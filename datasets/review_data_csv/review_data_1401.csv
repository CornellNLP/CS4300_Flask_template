0,The Jeffersons, They don't make them like they used too!,"The Jeffersons happened to be a spin off from All in the Family. I loved the relationship between George's mother played the wonderful Zara Cully who passed away during the series long run and Louise known as Weezy played by the wonderful Isabel Sanford. Then they brought in Florence as the maid played by the hilarious Marla Gibbs, the sparks flew between her and George. Not those kind of sparks but a funny rapport between the two to last for years. The show explored everything like interracial relationships and race with tact and dignity. My most memorable moments from the show were about George being secret Santa to a Harlem family who now lived in his building. But then who could forget George opening the George Jefferon Museum. I am glad to watch this show again one night a week on a local station which pays homage to the seventies shows like the Jeffersons. The show had a stellar supporting cast like Roxie Roker and Franklin Cover as the interracial couple, the Willises, who become dear friends of the Jeffersons. Isabel Sanford passed away about a year ago. She was the first African American woman to win an Emmy for Best Leading Actress in a Comedy Series. She was very worthy to be a pioneer for the rest. The fact that Sanford was twenty years older than Helmsley is fascinating. Isabel always looked fabulous and younger than her actual age. I miss Isabel. She was one of a kind!",26 out of 27 found this helpful.,10.0,21 July 2003
1,The Jeffersons, Jeffersons-Movin' On Up Was A Possibility ***1/2,"Very funny comedy of an affluent black family living the American dream in achieving success in their dry good business.<br/><br/>Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford provided terrific chemistry as the husband and wife team. Sanford always knew how to crack those one-liners at a vulnerable but lovable Hemsley. Militant son Lionel was always good for a laugh and as the mother-in-law, Zarra Cully, proved that having the typical mother-in-law to deal with wasn't only an Italian or Jewish problem.<br/><br/>Franklin Cover and Roxie Roker successfully showed that with understanding, inter-racial marriages could work.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,23 September 2007
2,The Jeffersons, The Black Archie Bunker,"For the first few years, this had to be one of the funniest shows on C.B.S.. It pretty much took the concept of the show it came from, ""All in the Family"", and moved it uptown and instead of a bigoted middle class white man, we have a bigoted rich black man.  George Jefferson proved that bigotry comes in all colors and sometimes his big mouth got him in trouble. However, just like Archie, beneath that gruff exterior was an old softy. I especially loved the episodes that showed that side of George. This show will always be one of the all time classics.",14 out of 15 found this helpful.,,11 December 2003
3,The Jeffersons, Commemorating The Jeffersons' 40th Anniversary Movin on Up....,"One of the best TV sitcoms ever!!! Just like his precessdor Archie Bunker,you'll never know what George Jefferson may come up with next. Very uncanny. Sherman Helmsley was the true professional actor is the utmost sense of the word. He played George down to the tilt!!! Was the most watched show in television history during its 11 year run on CBS that produced 253 episodes from its premiere on January 14,1975 until the last episode of the series on July 23,1986....the longest running African-American sitcom in television history.<br/><br/>The other tenants including Tom and Helen Willis,and there daughter Jenny; Mr. Bentley,Ralph the Doorman,and the housekeeper Florence whom George always teases but she gets him right back in front of his wife Louise!!!! In case you wanted to know about the shows theme song: A friend told me this that it was sung by Janet DuBois,who was Willona on another CBS sitcom ""Good Times"". Interesting point about this show: There were two actors who played the Jeffersons' son Lionel on the series,but only one was married off during the show's final season with Jenny and also had a baby girl. One of the best ever!! Several episodes from ""The Jeffersons"" do stand out as brilliant including one two parter episode that was filmed on location in Hawaii.",15 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,8 June 2000
4,The Jeffersons, Brilliant spin off to a processor from the golden age of the 1970's TV,"If there were a ""Sitcom Hall Of Fame"",for brilliance, the television series ""The Jeffersons"" would surely have a cherished spot as one of the best situation comedies of the 1970's. For the eleven and a half years that it ran on television,the series became one of CBS' longest-running shows of all time,right up there with ""Frasier"",""Cheers"",and even ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Happy Days"" for its longevity. From its premiere episode that aired on January 14,1975 to the final episode of the series on July 23,1986 it is amazing that the show survived during its astounding run on the air. The series cranked out more than 254 episodes during its run. It is also to note that ""The Jeffersons"" also was nominated for several Golden Globes and Emmys including a historic moment in the history of not only the show,but television itself. The series won the Emmy in 1981 for Isabel Sanford who in fact made history as being the first African-American woman to win for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series and also for Sherman Hemsley as Best Lead Actor in a Comedy Series as well,and for Marla Gibbs too who was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.<br/><br/>It is no wonder that ""The Jeffersons"" is one of television's top fifty all time programs in the history of television and it is right up there with the best of the bunch of classic television shows. Need I say more? This was a spin off to ""All In The Family"" by the way since the series was created by Norman Lear,the man who was behind some of the greatest shows of that period including ""All In The Family"",""Maude"",""Good Times"", ""One Day At A Time"",""Sanford and Son"",and so much more. Out of all the shows that had a predominately African-American cast of that period,the series ""The Jeffersons"" was the better show out of the entire bunch. Only Norman Lear's other show ""Good Times"" comes in a close second. The reason? For one you saw a successful black family doing something positive and for the first time in television history a successful African-American with a successful business and living the high life on TV,but at the same time you got to see not only a white side of bigotry but a black side of that too. Sherman Hemsley's character of George Jefferson was just that.....the opposite side of Archie Bunker,a bigot on the opposite side of racial intolerance. It was kind of a reflex towards the opposite The Bunkers,who basically were still living on 704 Hauser Street in Queens while their once neighbors The Jeffersons were living it up in a deluxe apartment complex on New York's upper rich side toward Park Avenue in Manhattan.<br/><br/>However,the set-up of a African-American family living in the high part of town and having a successful business establishment was something totally different and new when it aired back in 1975 since it was very odd to see this and America was paying very close attention to this as well since African-Americans at that time were making strides toward racial equality during that period. You saw a married couple George and Louise Jefferson(Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford)living the good life with their son Lionel(played by Mike Evans and then by Damon Evans)while making the best of any situation that comes at them with ease,but with hilarious results. The next door neighbors Tom and Helen Willis (Franklin Cover and Roxie Roker)were a interracial couple with their young daughter Jenny(Belinda Tolbert)and also their son Allan(played by Jay Hammer during the 1978-79 season)whom The Jeffersons also had another neighbor across from them as well,like the British neighbor Mr. Bentley(Paul Benedict)and others that were in the same tenant building as well like George's overbearing mother(played by Zara Cully during the 1975-78 season)who comes by for a visit and causes chaos for Louise and others like Mr. Whittington and so forth like the doorman Ralph or Charlie the bartender whose bar is downstairs but in the same building. The best part of this series and basically who could give George a run for his money in a scolding match would be the Jeffersons' housekeeper Florence Johnson(Marla Gibbs). This is what kept the series going strong because of the brilliant comedy chemistry that Sherman Hemsley and Marla Gibbs had and the sparks flew within a funny rapport that kept audiences laughing hard. Oh yeah,I forgot that Isabel Sanford kept the laughs provided too as Louise and George get into one predicament after another. But the series showed its darker side too right along with the laughs and insults as well as the series explored issues that were relevant to the day's topics from interracial relationships,racism, women's rights,and civil rights were the order of the day and other issues were added in that at the time were too intense for television but they were handled with tact and dignity.<br/><br/>Several brilliant episodes of this series come to mind that were memorable including the one where The Jeffersons go to Hawaii;George being a secret Santa to a Harlem family who lived in his building;The night the Jeffersons remember the riots that engulf a nation back in 1968 during the looting of his store over the death of MLK;Louise and Helen opening a health center for a lonely girl who commits suicide;and the marriage of Lionel and Jenny,which George disapproves. The proudest moment of the series came during the arrival of Lionel and Jenny as parents and George &amp; Louise become grandparents to a little baby girl.The saddest moment of the series when George learns the death of his beloved mother.<br/><br/>Speaking of this series,it is to note that five of the show's cast members have passed away but will be fondly remembered. Actor Sherman Hemsley who played businessman/family provider George Jefferson passed away in 2012. Zara Cully,who played Mother Jefferson;Roxie Roker who played Helen Willis;Isabel Sanford who played Louise Jefferson,and most recently Franklin Cover,Paul Benedict and Mike Evans.",14 out of 16 found this helpful.,,13 February 2006
5,The Jeffersons, Probably the funniest sitcom ever!,"Although my opionion may be a bit biased, I really do think this was an amazing show.  People always say that the earlier episodes were the better, but quite frankly, I disagree.  The best episodes I feel, and also this is the same time frame when the show was at it's most successful, was in the early 80's.  For the '81-'82 season, ""The Jeffersons"" was the 3rd rated television show in America.  People wanted to see Florence be sassy, and Tom and George be friends.  Viewers wanted to see Helen and Louise get somewhat foolish.  People wanted to see incredible guest stars, like Sammy Davis, Jr., Gladys Knight, Billy Dee Williams, even the popular singing group Sister Sledge.  It was the 80's, and people wanted to see rich folks living in excess, and it was also at this time the show was so successful, it finally had the advertising clout to command a bigger budget for a new set, off-site shoots, and guest stars.  I prefer the later set over the earlier one (the curved coffee table, gray sofa with peach throw cushions, and the round table dinette set).  It outlasted the show which it originally was spun-off from even.  Keep in mind also, that this show was still pulling in some great numbers in the 1984-1985 season when the plug was pulled (it was still in the top 20).  It seems that anything that originated in the 70's was leaving the line-up in the mid-80's.  Alice was canceled, along with The Love Boat, The Facts of Life, Hart to Hart, and a lot of other wonderful shows that were not necessarily growing tired, but the budget went towards all new shows.  Shows that were not memorable at all, and were cancelled within a season or two.  ""The Jeffersons"" ran for eleven seasons, and that's a long time in this business.  I always felt that after all ""The Jeffersons"" had done for CBS, that it certainly deserved a better send-off than being cancelled mid-season after a hiatus.  There never was a last episode, no closure.  No wrap up.  Nothing.  The last new episode that was shown was on June 25, 1985, and it was a pretty funny episode in which George helps his grand daughter Jessica with her Red Robins group.  Sadly, Tom &amp; Helen Willis did not appear in this episode.  It was actually the second to last show taped, but as you may be aware, the shows are not necessarily shown in the order that they are filmed.  I read an earlier entry that claims Lark Voorhies played Lionel and Jenny's daughter, Jessica on ""The Jeffersons"". Actually, it was an actress by the name of Ebonie Smith.  Lark portrayed Lisa on the TV show ""Saved By The Bell"".  I think the confusion may be because Ebonie Smith was in an episode of ""Saved By The Bell:  The New Class"".",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,,1 March 2003
6,The Jeffersons," The Jeffersons- Another 70's CBS Classic, But Are George and Archie Twins?","If the Television Hall of Fame selected television programs as a whole to win a gold plaque similar to Cooperstown N.Y. for MLB, or Canton Ohio for the NFL, ""The Jeffersons"" would be there front and center.<br/><br/>The long running CBS sitcom which aired from 1975 through 1985, won several Emmys, including Isabel Sanford for Best Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. To me ""The Jeffersons"" is one of television's top fifty All-Time Programs, and the best one with a predominately African American cast, better than ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Sanford and Son"". As a child it was a thrill to be able to watch this program when schoolwork or bedtime did not get in the way.<br/><br/>I now own the first two seasons of ""The Jeffersons"" on DVD, and I enjoy the performances of all the characters. The show is of course centered around bigoted and avaricious George (Sherman Helmsley), and his long suffering wife Louise ""Weezy"" Jefferson (Isabel Sanford), but the performances of the character actors are also well above par. Paul Benedict as George's goofy, bizarre neighbor, Ned Wertimer as the not so modest or polite (when it comes to tips) doorman, Mike Evans as wisecracking son Lionel, and Marla Gibbs as wisecracking live-in-maid Florence, and of course the interracial couple who are usually the butt of George's racist jokes, Tom and Helen Willis played by Franklin Cover and Roxie Roker. And of course don't forget going way back in the day when people born in the 1890's were alive, well and entertaining us all, Zara Cully as George Jefferson's quick witted Mother, Olivia. She was hilarious when seeking attention from George and Weezy she intentionally tackles herself to the ground in a season 2 episode.<br/><br/>But ""The Jeffersons"" at least the first two seasons centers around George and his vices, which often outweigh his virtues, similar to the Archie Bunker character introduced in the early 1970's. Like Archie George is set in his ways, avaricious, sometimes crude, and often bigoted. Like Archie he is a bigot without a mean streak. He is a lovable bigot, and his racist views are played out for laughs, but George is not a carbon copy of Archie. They're not twins. Archie makes fun of everyone that is not his race, religion creed, or sexual orientation. George sticks to the basics. Just make fun of whitey, and those whites that don't offer him anything in return for his efforts.<br/><br/>There are some whites like Wittendale, the banker who holds the key to George's future of a dry cleaning monopoly. George always wants to pander to this guy. However George has no use for ""honkies"" like Tom Willis and his black wife Helen. Like Archie Bunker he despises mixed marriages. (Although Archie is all for Irish marrying Italian). Mostly because Weezy has him on a short leash, George reluctantly accepts Tom and Helen Willis as neighbors and in-laws.<br/><br/>One major reason why Archie's ethnic and racial slurs often spiral out of control and George's doesn't is the nature of the women they're married to. Edith is tolerant, dingbatty, and naive, while Weezy is sharp, quick witted, and as shrewd as George. She puts her foot down faster on George, than Edith does on Archie. Edith tends to push Archie in the direction he's going, with some first class dingbat punchlines added in.<br/><br/>George is a little bit of a thing, with an obsession for power and control, much like Danny DeVito in the movies. He lusts for money and power, and he's got it, a wife a family and a full chain of cleaning stores. Archie doesn't have all this. Archie needs to shut other people down to better his own situation. George doesn't. George has money and power. However, like Archie he is set in his ways, and his lack of modesty always gets him into trouble.<br/><br/>What this show was missing was a crossover appearance by Archie and Edith from the slums of Flushing to the penthouses in Manhattan. Carroll O' Connor and Jean Stapleton never appeared on ""The Jeffersons."" ""The Jeffersons"" was not the greatest TV sitcom. ""All in the Family"" along with ""Seinfeld"", ""The Honeymooners"" and ""Cheers"" were better. However there was a certain charm with this show that lasted from the Gerald Ford through the second half of the Ronald Reagan presidency. This was one fine show.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,6 January 2006
7,The Jeffersons, One OF The Best Sitcoms Of All Times!,"This show was so funny that it lasted 11 seasons. I watched this show from the time before I was born until I was in the 5th grade. The funniest episodes were, are, and always will be the episodes that had BOTH Mother Jefferson AND Florence the maid. This was also one of the first sitcoms that replaced a main character with another actor and the first actor came back. Two Lionels! Confusing to all people who are not devout Jefferson fans. Damon Evans married Jenny and Mike Evans was there when Jenny had the baby. RIP Mike Evans AKA the 1st and 3rd Lionel. This show also had the two actors who were the longest reoccurring guest stars in t.v. history. Charlie the Bartender and Ralph the Doorman. They played on a sitcom for 11 consecutive years without ever being a regular character. George would do something zany every episode. And Louise would have a smart remark every episode. Helen would always argue with George, but Tom would listen to him. There were so many great guest stars in this show. Sammy Davis Jr., Sister Sledge, Andre Crouch, Billy Dee Williams, Gladys Knight. Look for Ernest Thomas and Jaleel White before they became stars in episodes of this show. There are still some mysteries in this show.

8,The Jeffersons, A classic that will never be forgotten,"This was a great sitcom. The show had great writing and great actors/actresses to perform it.

9,The Jeffersons, A deluxe TV sitcom!,"My mom and I would often catch this show when I was a kid, videotaping a good handful of episodes when it ran in syndication, and then we bought six seasons of it years later when the show finally was available on DVD.<br/><br/>Sherman Hemsley as George and Isabel Stanford as Louise were hilarious as the rich black couple living in that ""apartment in the sky,"" often bickering with one another, with Louise as the sensible one and George the one with fiery talk and a proud businessman attitude. Marla Gibbs plays Florence, the Jeffersons' sassy maid who doesn't take gut from anybody and backtalks when needed, especially to George - creating that love-hate relationship that is classic and funny throughout the entire show.<br/><br/>Franklin Cover and Roxy Roker play Tom and Helen Willis, the first interracial couple portrayed in a TV show. They have occasional run-ins with the Jeffersons as they live in the same apartment building, as did U.N. Interpreter Harry Bentley (Paul Benedict), who lives next door to the Jeffersons. And, rounding up the cast are the Jeffersons' son, Lionel (portrayed alternatively by Mike Evans and Damon Evans), the Willis' daughter and girlfriend to Lionel, Jenny (Berlinda Tolbert), the helpful but money-grubbing doorman Ralph (Ned Wertimer), bartender Charlie (Danny Wells) and George's mother, Mother Jeffersons (Zara Cully). Each character offered his/her own unique and interesting twist to the show, but much of the laughs come from the trio of George, Louis and Florence.<br/><br/>It's a very funny show to watch again and again, filled with comedic misadventures and tastefully done humor. So, get your slice of the pie and watch The Jeffersons! <br/><br/>Grade A",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,21 January 2017
10,The Jeffersons, A forgotten all-time classic.,"The Jefferson is the longest African-American comedy situation to date. It's a spin-off of the popular ""All in the family"". The Jeffersons is the most underrated comedy sitcom on television to some people. During its release in the mid 70s there were a few competitive shows like Good Times,What's Happening?,and Sanford &amp; Son. But this show lasted the longest and enjoyed by both black and white audiences. This show was funny during its first six years (1975-81) till Embassy Television took over,and the show became boring. Lionel and Jenny made just occasional appearances on the show and Ralph still have his hand out for a tip. The writers were changed and the show lost a lot of its audiences. But what I enjoyed the most about the show was when George and Florence go at it. Though in the long run George always kept her as their maid. I think George like having Florence around because he enjoys having somebody to pick on. Which Florence at times outsmarts him. What I didn't like was that geek Lionel (Damon Evans) he seem so soft to me and wasn't confident and outspoken like the original Lionel (Mike Evans). The Jeffersons was a fun show to watch and although the show maybe somewhat forgotten everybody remembers the theme (Movin' on up).",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,5 April 2003
11,The Jeffersons, Absolutely the best show ever produced!,"I remember growing up and watching this show.  I always thought it was so funny.  From then on, I would try to find out when it was coming on (after it stopped being produced).  Finally, Nick at Nite picked up this brilliant work.  It really is a true classic which often gets overlooked.  The acting, especially Sherman Helmsley and Marla Gibbs is amazing.  Anybody who watched this show regularly must have felt an attachment to the characters.  I have never watched an episode which wasn't hilarious.

13,The Jeffersons," Well, We're Movin On Up.","Movin on up, (moving on up) to the east side, (moving on up)to a deluxe apartment in the sky. We're moving on up to the east side (moving on up) we finally got a piece of the pie.

The chemistry between Sheryman Helmsley and Isabel Sandford was absolutely magical to me. Roxie Roker's character was one of my favourte characters of all time because at the time an interracial couple on TV was unheard of. I just wish that the Jeffersons had a proper send off than what happened. Maybe we could have seen Lionel and Jenny have kids and grow old gracefully together? The show, I think, had limitless possibilities for it's time and if it hadn't fallen prey to cancellation at the last possible second syndrome I think it might just have lasted a bit longer than it did.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,,18 October 2005
14,The Jeffersons, George and Weezy Are Movin' On Up,"I must admit that I am not that familiar with its predecessor, All In The Family, seeing as I wasn't born when it was originally released, but neither was I familiar with The Jeffersons either. It wasn't until later on one of the episodes of the Fresh Prince of Bel Air back in the 90s that I saw George appear on the show for the first time. And so from then on, I caught up with The Jeffersons, thanks to the brilliance of the web and sites such as You Tube, seeing as they had hardly shown this sitcom in the UK.<br/><br/>George and Louise 'Weezy' Jefferson are arguably one of the funniest sitcom couples ever; as different as they are in terms of personalities, and despite their arguments and fall- outs, like all couples they have managed to stay together and see things through regardless, no matter how much they get on one another's nerves. Sherman was just excellent as the outspoken, no- nonsense George- who has a bit of a short fuse, whilst Isabel was marvellous as the care-free, down-to earth and less pessimistic Weezy. The couple live together in an apartment block along with their son, Lionel, and their mother would occasionally drop- by, much to the Jefferson's surprise, whilst their neighbours were a Caucasian man named Tom and his Afro-American wife, Helen- which, for a inter-racial couple appearing on mainstream TV- was a rarity to see back in those days. The other characters on the show were the (somewhat) likable and pleasant Mr Bentley, Ralph and Florence, the sarchastic maid. <br/><br/>The Jeffersons was a humorous, fun and enjoyable comedy, which ran for an astonishing 11 seasons between 1975-1985. Some of my favourite moments include George taking part in a boxing contest- I couldn't help but laugh my socks off, what with George jogging all over the ring and his movements had me in stitches - and when George, Tom and Helen are trapped in George's bathroom and the situation is further complicated when 1) Weezy is having her hair done; unaware of the predicament her husband and her friends find themselves in and 2)they realise that the door can only operated from the outside, and not whilst they are inside the bathroom! In one scene and to make matters worse, the door handle even falls off! Not to mention 'Brother Tom' when Tom tries to act Black, much to his wife's embarrassment, in an attempt to fit in with the other Black folks, of whom included George and Louise.<br/><br/>Even though the Fresh Prince of Bel Air, Diff'rent Strokes and The Cosby Show got plenty of air time, here in the UK, it is a bit of a shame that this sitcom was never actually televised in this part of the world because as I mentioned The Jeffersons is a great show, which deserved to be seen by its audiences.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this was one of CBS's fewest hit sitcoms that managed to hit the big time and sustain a longevity that rivals the likes of NBC's other long running comedies, Frasier, Friends and The Fresh Prince of Bel Air.<br/><br/>Catch it if you can",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,2 March 2008

18,The Jeffersons, An all time classic,"This show is certainly one of if not THE best comedy of all time. I think one of the things most people forget is how funny georges mother, mother jefferson, was. Boy did she make life tough for Louise!! Florence was hysterical, and George was, well, George. My favorite episode had to be the one in 1983 where Georges old girlfriend, Yvonne Mcbride, came over for a surprise visit, but little did George know that the surprise was she came there to kill him!! That episode had serious themes as well as hysteria. THe funniest part may have been when Yvonne had caught on to georges trying to tell ralph the doorman about sending up a ""black and white"" (an obvious plea for a cop), so she tells him when he answers the door next time, ""i better not hear nothing about no black and white this time!"", waving the gun in his face. Well, he opens the door and guess who it is? Tom and Helen. Just awesome.<br/><br/>Hemsley went on to have another great show in ""Amen"" and Gibbs went onto another funny show called ""227"", and while both were very good, neither could match the greatness of the jeffersons. Although there was one episode on 227 where Hemsley guest starred, and that one was a great one.<br/><br/>This show is a 10/10 and I certainly think it's the best comedy of all time. Todays cant even hold a candle to it.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,18 March 2001
19,The Jeffersons, Another comedy gem from Norman Lear.,"All In The Family should have been named the best sit-com of all-time over Seinfeld, solely on the the successful spin-offs it delivered for CBS. Although Maude and Good Times were great comedies, it was The Jeffersons that was the best of the spin-offs. Like Maude, it also produced a spin-off show itself.<br/><br/>The Jeffersons mixed I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners, and some of Lear's ideas and gave it a black flavor and soul. Sherman Hemsley played George Jefferson, a wealthy man from his succesful chain of cleaning stores. He's a cocky, condescending, lively little man, living in a penthouse on Park Avenue. He also has a bit of fun in making his loyal wife Louise (or Weezy) miserable sometimes. Isabel Sanford played the foil beautifully with her uniquely deep voice, and the two had remarkable chemistry. Not only that, George had to play foil to someone himself. Marla Gibbs played the lazy, street-wise Florence Johnston who somehow always found a way to keep her job despite hurling more insults at George. She was so talented that she would steal the show at times and would even get her own spin-off show (Checking In).<br/><br/>Then there was the neighbours, the Willis', who were an interracial couple played by Franklin Cover (Tom) and Lenny Kravitz's mother the late Roxey Roker (Helen). Throw in Paul Benedict as Frank Bentley, their British neighbour and Ned Wertimer as Ralph the doorman (another target of abuse for George and sometimes vice-versa) and you've got the basis of a great sitcom with the addition of the great writing that came with Norman Lear's comedies.<br/><br/>The episodes still hold up great today with their humour and situations and holds up to repeated viewing. The better shows were in the first 5 or 6 years before it started to fizzle along with CBS' fortune. The most memorable episode was when they parodied Dallas' famous ""Who shot J.R.?"" episode.

My 2 favorite episodes are the one where Billie Dee Williams comes to visit and the one where George gets locked in the bathroom with Tom and Helen.

21,The Jeffersons, Just like All in the Family.,"If I'm up late once in a while I might catch The Jeffersons. I find this show very well written with good comedic timing. (Especially with George and Florence.) <br/><br/>The one thing that is kind of nice is that it is a spin-off of All in the Family. The Bunkers would crack on touchy subjects like the different races and all that, so know it's kind of a reflex towards the Bunkers.<br/><br/>
The set up of a black family living in the high part of town is a little different for the time it was aired because it WAS quite odd. Anyway, I love the background given to The Jeffersons, but most of all I like the characters and actors that portray them. Louise, Bentley, Helen, and Tom do a great job as mixed races living in the same apartment building. (Which isn't that important but its nice to see that sort of thing.) The two characters that I like the most are George and Florence. The actors that play them are very talented, and like I said earlier, they work well with mixing their comedic talents together. The verbal conflicts and caps on each other are very funny and always bring a chuckle out of me.<br/><br/>
For its time and even for today, its great to see an episode of The Jeffersons every once in a while. Like All in the Family, this is one of the older shows that I like. It's a little touchy and that's okay, but the cast and crew do a superb job.",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,,9 December 2000

23,The Jeffersons, Excellent Comedy,"I watched this in the 1970s, somewhat, and I liked it, but nowadays, even much more so. Since it ran for 11 seasons, naturally, there were changes in the type of its tones, so my review is mainly for the middle period. I do not care for All in the Family, from which The Jeffersons spun off, due to the character of Archie, his harsh belittling of people; hideous racism; and over-emphasis on political events, etc., so I find George Jefferson to be a light-hearted fellow, who, even if saying negative things, does so in a jovial way and is not too serious about it.<br/><br/>This show is virtually as funny as two favorites, Sanford and Son, and Three's Company. It is just so, so funny. Sherman Hemsley is absolutely marvelous, so comical, animated, and the life of the party, so to speak. Isabel is a sincere actress, playing ""Weezy"". The others are great, but the character of Bentley or the actor himself, always seemed strange, in that he was unsure of himself, and awkward.<br/><br/>A great show for laughs, and Marla Gibbs as Florence, absolutely great.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,28 January 2012

25,Southland, This has been a long time coming....,"Over the past twenty years we have seen an absolute invasion of cop shows and crime dramas on the small screen. Some have been highly acclaimed, like ""NYPD Blue"", and others have been long running, like ""Law and Order"". But all those shows developed notoriety based on strong characters and overly developed drama, a combination that seemed to be a necessary formula for prime time. The end result was entertainment at the cost of realism and integrity, as show plots became as convoluted as the characters. Think ""The Shield"", except that show had a very narrow focus. Now there's ""Southland"", and after the first few episodes it becomes immediately apparent that it is a show that will not be well received because it is vastly different than what has appeared before. Simply put, it will not live up to mass market expectations of what should constitute a crime drama. This is unfortunate. ""Southland"" offers a different perspective. It is simplistic without sacrificing depth, an effect achieved by cutting out unnecessary interactions and plot developments. The scope of coverage is revolutionary as well, with the portrayal of several different divisions--patrol, homicide, organized crime. The characters are developed and highlighted by both their strengths and flaws, making their statements through the performance of their duty without becoming preachy or pathetic. They are not all perfect and selfless, but instead are presented as basically moral and slightly jaded. It is not a testament as a whole of the LAPD, therefore it does not require the presentation of issues that are unnecessary to the purpose of the show--racism, sexism, corruption. The continuity is beneficial, and unusual enough to be revolutionary. The acting is solid. The greatest surprise is Regina King, who appears as a socially struggling homicide detective, a drastic change from the often overbearing or domineering African-American female roles she has been stuck in. Her portrayal of a heartfelt but complex detective is spot on. C. Thomas Howell delivers an absurdly believable rendition of an alcoholic, barrel-driven patrolman. Michael Cudlitz and Ben McKenzie are the most intriguing, as they are the rookie/veteran partnership who have common integrity and incredibly different backgrounds, yet manage to work together without the clichéd buddy-buddy relationship. And the subject matter? Raw, gritty, realistic, without fanciful or violent action scenes. From the mundane, to the absurd, to the disturbing. The difficulties of police work are highlighted, and obstacles are not always overcome. It has been many years since a television show has delivered a straightforward, pulse-pounding episode, as evidenced by number seven, ""Derailed"". If you dislike crime dramas or cop shows, you obviously won't like Southland. For the rest, it will probably be a toss-up. Stop looking at what the show doesn't present, and focus instead on what it does offer, and you will discover how exceptional it is.",122 out of 138 found this helpful.,8.0,26 May 2009
26,Southland, Top-Notch,"I've been on IMDb for quite sometime now, but have yet to feel compelled to write a comment. I suppose my biggest concern is that one of my favorite shows (i.e. Freaks &amp; Geeks, The Class, Undeclared, etc.) will again meet its' demise if not for full and utter fan support.<br/><br/>Right out of the gate, this show grabs you with not necessarily likable characters, but real characters. It makes no excuses for the way people act or the situations life inevitably holds for us on a daily basis. It is not over-dramatized, watered-down or needlessly careful. It's appeal is rather than being presented as a miniseries, it is shot more in the tradition of a motion picture or cable series (not unlike The Wire -- best show EVER) where measures are taken after the shoot to make it prime time friendly without being corny or sappy.<br/><br/>Though it's too early in the game to give this a 10, I can say that if you haven't checked this out yet, do yourself a favor -- you won't be disappointed.",85 out of 96 found this helpful.,9.0,17 April 2009
27,Southland, Simply the most accurate depiction of policing in television,"To start I have to say that the pilot episode was amazing and the show only got better until the season finale.<br/><br/>I have been policing for some time now and have yet to find a show that depicts policing as accurate as Southland. Sure there are some scenes in this series that are a bit over dramatized, as in any show; however, the attitudes, behaviours and problems officers face are very real.<br/><br/>Many of the messages Cst. COOPER says to his ""rookie"" Cst. SHERMAN are very valid in policing today and are often utilized. SHERMAN's responses to things that he has to see and experience are spot on.<br/><br/>The fact that many of the terms used in Southland are not sugar coated, as in other TV series, blows my mind and is what keeps me watching. I see far too much in other series where the characters actually seem awkward as their language doesn't reflect what their behaviour is showing or the producers want to appease the censors and use softer language.<br/><br/>Having two separate views of cases may distract some people, but this is exactly what it is like in reality. There are detectives in the same division as the front line officers and although they may work together on some incidents, often go about their day on different paths.<br/><br/>The finale is and what will make me a dedicated viewer because of how close it hits to home. As an officer you tend not to try and get involved in your neighbours business, this is a reality in today's world where anything can happen if you choose to do so.<br/><br/>All in all amazing acting, real characters, real settings and scenarios. I recommended this show to all my co-workers and anyone else interested in television shows depicting policing as it really is.<br/><br/>9/10 (Only reason I didn't give a 10 is because I don't believe anything is ever perfect).",79 out of 91 found this helpful.,9.0,30 May 2009
28,Southland, A Pleasant Surprise,"Southland turned out to be better than the ads for it made me believe. The ads seemed a little over the top, heavy handed even, but the show itself worked very well.<br/><br/>Michael Cudlitz's Officer Cooper has that nice combo of jaded and cynical but still obviously caring. His character seemed most likely to be over the top from the commercials, but in the context of the show came across about as close to perfect for the moment as you could ask. Looking forward to more with this character.<br/><br/>Benjamin McKenzie as Officer Ben Sherman also did very good. We didn't learn a whole lot about the character in the Pilot, but that makes sense in the debut as we will most certainly be learning more about him. Well acted by Mckenzie and has a nice rapport with Officer Cooper, that will by nice to watch develop.<br/><br/>Everything else in the show worked, and apart from a couple of moments that didn't quite jibe with the reality of the rest of the episode, makes me optimistic for the rest of the series.",54 out of 67 found this helpful.,9.0,12 April 2009
29,Southland, Well done!,"I work in the field, and I was genuinely impressed. Based on the pilot this show looks like it could be excellent. What strikes me is the focus on the very real impact of the job on the officers. In the real world, an officer doesn't fire his or her weapon at another person and then respond in a cavalier way or crack one liners (as you might believe from watching other cop dramas). The normal reaction is actually shock, and a massive adrenaline dump. and it takes time to process and deal with it. And as for language, I agree that I would rather see this show on cable where the realistic language wouldn't have to be bleeped out. Real officers and real bad guys don't say 'shucks and darn'...

31,Southland, strong show with uber-talented regina king.,"i am impressed with this show. most of all i'm impressed with regina king. she is a standout talent in whatever role she takes on, and to say she is believable in this role is an understatement. not once do i stop believing i am actually watching a detective in the LAPD who is totally emotionally invested in her work. with her eyes she can convey more emotion than most actors can with the finest dialog Hollywood has to offer. ben mckenzie as ""ben"" is believable in this role. he seems to find roles that suit him well (stoic, troubled, mysterious, ready to throw down) and although he isn't quite a great actor he has great moments. michael cudlitz as his partner plays the role of the bully veteran patrolman to a T. anyone who hangs around with enough big city cops has met someone just like this guy (if not a dozen). his performance is a treat. with the heavy use of hand-held cameras and the documentary style of filming, at times it all combines to give the feel of a live-action reality show, and i can see why some onlookers were reportedly duped into thinking ben mckenzie had traded professions for real. there are some flaws in the show, and some of the story lines involving lesser characters seem contrived and unconvincing at times. but with a few adjustments and a whole lot more of miss regina king this show could find a place of its own amongst a crowded field of cop shows.",34 out of 45 found this helpful.,9.0,13 August 2009

The other cast is all so good too.<br/><br/>NBC was stupid for canceling this show and keeping Jay Leno on the air. I like Jay, but his show doesn't need to be on five nights a week.

As the characters interacted and events unfolded I detected an intention to present a realistic -- if condensed -- version of life on the streets for LAPD. More importantly, I could sense that, unlike so many of today's TV dramas, this program seems to have something to say. Generally speaking, only TV producers Dick Wolf and David E. Kelley can be counted on to deliver on that score -- at least for the first ten years or so! For me, the jury is still out on ""Southland"". So far, so good ...

The characters have a lot of depth and the acting is great for a TV series!! This show was a launch pad for a bunch of great actors that are now hugely well known.
The storyline is thought provoking and very relatable to our continued and current cultural issues where people are still refusing to practice tolerance and acceptance. This show depicts the desperate need to demand equality.

I would have loved to have some good soundtrack, because the soundtrack and songs almost lacked entirely. Watching the TV series without some ambiental music in the background, or some songs to accompany the drama moments troughout the series, it wasn't so pleasurable.
Also, I would have loved to see more of the officers's private lives and I didn't like that some characters disappeared from the show without any information about them, like Daniel Sallinger, Officer Jessica Tang and Josie Ochoa. Their leave would have been more justified if I would have known while they are no longer in the show. Maybe some of them died, or some of them have been promoted, perhaps, but the show didn't say nothing about them.

52,Beauty and the Beast," ""Your love is where I'll go""...","There's a reason why ""Beauty and the Beast"" still holds a place in its legions of fans' hearts after all these years: it's a tender, earnest, lovely little series that celebrates a love that goes beyond shallow expectations. This isn't ""The O.C."", where it's only a matter of time before the bland, attractive leads jump in the sack. ""Beauty and the Beast"" chronicles the unique, powerful love between plucky assistant attorney Catherine (Linda Hamilton) and Vincent (spellbinding Ron Perlman), a courageous, compassionate man-beast. Because they live in two different worlds (she in the bustling world ""Above"", he in the secret utopia of ""Below""), they cannot have a real life together, but, as Catherine assures us in the opening credits, they ""will never, ever be apart"". Today's jaded viewers might scoff at the fact that Catherine and Vincent never go further than hugs and hand-holding in their relationship, but you know what? Catherine and Vincent express more joy, passion, respect and love in their very first embrace in the pilot episode than all the bed-hopping in the six seasons of ""Dawson's Creek"". Hamilton is appealing as Catherine, making her strong and vulnerable at the same time. Perlman is unforgettable as Vincent. Unhindered by the prosthetic make-up on his face, he expresses layers of complex emotions with just his eyes. He brings warmth, integrity, and, yes, beauty to a role that even Perlman himself has said is ""too good to be real"". He deservedly won and Emmy and a Golden Globe.

53,Beauty and the Beast, A Totally Misunderstood Program,"The brilliance of this series was its romance and its excellent early stories.  We could entirely believe that this could happen in New York -- except that any New Yorker would tell you that there are people far stranger than Vincent walking the streets.  We were never told how he came to be as he is, but it almost didn't matter.  I don't think it was any accident that he had such a feline appearance.<br/><br/>This series was so badly misunderstood and mishandled by its parent network that I am not surprised it lasted only two seasons.  Season 3 wasn't even the same program in my book. CBS seemed terribly upset with the fact that its audience was almost entirely female.  Was that why the body count of season 3 was higher than in a Bruce Willis movie?<br/><br/>The worst mistake CBS ever made was to let Linda Hamilton leave after two seasons.  Had the network been intelligent enough, they could have talked her into a third season, ending it with the fairytale ending -- she kisses Vincent for real (something CBS was VERY afraid of, but the fans would have loved) and have him turn into a human prince.  That would have given it the magical ending it deserved.",89 out of 103 found this helpful.,,1 November 2001
54,Beauty and the Beast, Linda Hamilton was very Beautiful in this Series...,I don't think there is any movie or series that made Linda look so beautifully stunning than in Beauty and the Beast.  She was rendered simply beautiful and her acting was very reaching and touching.  Ron Perlman was very masculine and ruggedly sexy under all that makeup.  I am sure the two of them enjoyed themselves immensely because it translated through their performances to the viewer.  I am only sorry that the series ended after only 3 seasons.,58 out of 68 found this helpful.,9.0,21 February 2001
55,Beauty and the Beast, Perhaps the Best Television Show ever,"I found this show by accident one Friday night and became hooked immediately. Here was an intelligent, well-acted program for adults. It was not sexually explicit, nor gratuitously violent. It had something most TV shows do not have: Romance.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton and Ron Perlman were absolutely perfect together as the beautiful lawyer who lives above and Ron Perlman as the ""hideous"" beast whose curse is that he is ugly on the outside and who never gets a chance to reveal his inner beauty until he saves Catherine. Knowing how tormented he was because of his deformities was heart-breaking and yet he blossomed as he and Catherine found real love.<br/><br/>Normally, I would be pleased when an actress leaves a show to spend time with her son, as Miss Hamilton did. I'm all for women staying home to be with their children over spending time at a carer; at risk of being hopelessly old-fashioned, I believe women with children should stay home to care for them. However, in this case, it was one of her worst decisions because her marriage to the father of this child fizzled. She later had a child and then married James Cameron of ""Titanic"" fame, only to lose him to a star of that overblown ocean-going vehicle. She did have success with the Terminator movies but those were nothing but Schwarzenegger fests. Meanwhile B&amp;B also suffered because they just couldn't find a woman to replace Catherine. Diana just didn't have it.<br/><br/>The fact that the show lasted 3 seasons (2 with Miss Hamilton) is a testament to its quality. Of course, we can't have quality on TV - there's not enough T&amp;A, violence, or out and out stupidity (think Jessica Simpson here). But for the 3 years this show was on, it was a real Friday night Feast. And I do thank Mr. Perlman and Miss Hamilton for the years they gave us and I thank Mr. Perlman for the CD of music and poetry from the show. It's still heart-wrenchingly beautiful to listen to Vincent as he narrates works by Matthew Arnold, e.e. cummings and, of course, the King of all poetry, plays and prose, Mr. William Shakespeare.<br/><br/>It would be a miracle if CBS were to air a ""reunion"" movie but I think there will be a tropical heat wave in the South Pole before that happens. Too bad - it sure beats the stupidity of such shows as The Newlyweds, starring the aforementioned Jessica Simpson, or Reality TV, American Idol and the other slime that passes for decent television. Meanwhile, I'll be content with VHS copies of B&amp;B or I'll wait patiently until the DVDs come out.",68 out of 85 found this helpful.,,16 January 2005
56,Beauty and the Beast, An Important Tale of Many Truths,"Beauty and the Beast, starring Hamilton and Perlman, is an important, indeed revealing tale of many, many truths. <br/><br/>Have you ever thought to yourself, 'There is something, terribly wrong with this world' and wondered what could be done? <br/><br/>Vincent and Catherine are phenomenal characters and the whole series, upon first viewing this show over the last two weeks, appears to revolve around the love of these two characters. <br/><br/>Look...Deeper! <br/><br/>Perhaps most women, and some 'civilized' men, can appreciate the quality of this T.V. series for what it actually does. It challenges and educates about gender roles, allowing for a woman to show strength and to be confident in her femininity, yet resilient and capable, even in violent scenes. In one artful sweep this series allows for her to co-exist, interdependently – successfully, with an empathic, physically powerful but conscionable masculine force. This show challenges the legitimacy of our current societal state (particularly in the U.S. and somewhat in Canada), showing the audience that another world is possible. We are left aware rather than ignorant of the issues that still pervade our world. We are not all Gabriels in this world, nor are we all Vincents. But we were all newborns, once upon a time; once, we all were the unlimited possibilities and hopes of those before us and of our own futures. By looking deeper at those sub-plots of corruption, and how 'the love of money is the root of all evil', juxtaposed against the respect, compassion and yes, EMPATHY, that Vincent represents, we are jarred into awareness. You may think me a socialist! Nay, I am but one person who can see the value of having my needs met, but not at the expense of other's needs. A simple life in the tunnels is appealing, over the insanity of a world where ""fear"" rules us all (S1E2); fear of terrorist attacks (that may or may not be backed by corrupt government (also featured in S2&amp;S3 - E. Birch sub-plot)), and the tragic, (and sadly condoned or ignored by so many, too many), inexcusable failings of our societal institutional structures. We would demand our right to bear arms (despite the reality that such weapons lead to death – as Father would likely agree) over the right to life and medical care of each person. Some would make the death of a foetus more reprehensible than the total general lack of care for our fellow human-beings once they are born. Pardon me for emphasizing the principles Vincent's world seems to exist by, that each person, poor, weak, ill, strong, wealthy, of all walks of life, each feels loves, bleeds, hates, can rise or fall, has fears and dreams. As we are, we are all alone. Vincent's world represents an alternative to being alone, where even a beast of inhuman characteristics can be treated as an equal, and loved as a son, a brother, a friend...a human being. LOVE is not 'sappy'. But violence and brutality beget more violence and brutality. This series shows this truth. <br/><br/>I am researching all Beauty and the Beast tales published to date for my own series of stories/screen-plays and I discovered this show mere weeks ago. Initially, by the end of my first viewing of the whole series, I hated - a strong word for me - how season three started and most of its storyline. It ruined all of my hopes and dreams for a world that is possible, (perhaps not Beauty and her Beast, though, by my own admission this is my reality, too, in a way) the dreams of a world of respect, appreciation, equality and acceptance. I actually wept and felt anger and an absolute feeling of denial for days, a testament to writers and the strength of their characters. Catherine's demise was anti-climactic, and hateful. But when one considers reality, as it is, S3 was beautiful, painful, poignant, and taught us many truths, for it captured the lack of ""Heart"" in our modern neoliberal world, a world that is ruled by a select few (Gabriels) who would destroy, and do destroy, thousands of Catherine Chandlers all over the world, every day. By the end of my second viewing of this series, I can now see that it was a brave and challenging way to conclude a story that did - and does - reach so many. I still find S3 to be disastrous to this series, but, I have hopes that a new series will be produced, soon, one that will take this original series and build upon lessons learned; start afresh with new, yet similar characters, and delve deeper. The time is ripe - the people desire a revitalized story that represents the now, while showing a world that we may be going towards, one that echoes back to Catherine and Vincent's world. A new take, made in a modern context and which would be more accommodating of the modern needs of those who seek more action, visual effects, and heightened levels of sexual tension. We want to see another world and maybe, learn how we can make our own possible. In part this is what I am doing, or hoping to work on, one day. We need stories like B&amp;tB in order to remember what is important. <br/><br/>Truth, Compassion, Empathy, Equality, and Love, – Hope.",9 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,21 January 2011
57,Beauty and the Beast, I have always been a fan.,"I thought this television series was well done and family oriented. Yes, it was overly romantic and may have been ""sappy"" to some viewers; but that was a large part of its appeal then and still is today. I was very surprised that this series was not on DVD.<br/><br/>It is probably better for family viewing than half the material that is out on DVD from a television series. If there are plans to release ""Beauty and The Beast"" on DVD, it should be released immediately and is long over due. I'm sure that there are many people out there who have forgotten about this series like myself, due to it not being shown on cable or satellite television in many viewing areas. Yet, we have not forgotten the wonderful exchanges between two (2) character's who had a romantic chemistry and truly grew to love each other; a love that our current society needs to find a lot more of.<br/><br/>If you here anything regarding the DVD collection please post info or drop me a line. Thank you.",37 out of 46 found this helpful.,,1 September 2004
58,Beauty and the Beast, Nothing will ever come close,"Ah Beauty and the Beast - just stringing those two beautiful words together is all I need to recall tunnels to mind. Tunnels and that other world, the world apart from Catherine's, and a world apart from mine. An Elysium where all fans of Beauty and the Beast would simply choose to reside if it actually existed. Truly we would all opt to be helpers and especially so if it meant that anything we could advise would see that Vincent and Catherine have their happy life.<br/><br/>Beauty and the Beast was for me the beginning of all my own dreams, as joining one of the British fan clubs associated with the show I began writing fan fiction and now after having written over 100 stories about my favourite characters I have gained the confidence and the experience to submit other work for publication and have also produced some children's books that are published in the USA.<br/><br/>I know my life has been enriched by Beauty and the Beast, the storylines and the whole concept of life beneath the New York City streets where love prevails is so beautiful and enchanting that I simply want to be there among the characters that I now view as among the very best friends that I have ever had. And it doesn't rest there, as the very directors and actors and actresses themselves that played the parts within Beauty and the Beast have also become good friends to all that have met them at B&amp;B conventions and reunions not to mention the whole new family that has sprung up among the fans where just like the show we endeavour to be family - as one.<br/><br/>In short this show is everything that is good about human kind and it is desperately needed more now than ever before so that it might shape the future of the younger generation today just as it shaped the lives of the fans it has now - fourteen years after it went off air. So bring back Beauty and the Beast - nothing will ever come close.",41 out of 52 found this helpful.,,30 May 2003
59,Beauty and the Beast, Still watching in 2018,"I found this show about 2 months ago while scrolling Amazon Prime and fell in love QUICK.
I loved the emotions between Katherine and Vincent and was in awe at how they could love so deeply and yet not feel the need to jumo in bed together to show each other that love.. I have dragged more than one of my family memebers in to watch an episode that I just HAD to share. 
""Orphans"" was my favorite as it touched on so many emotions I myself had when my father passed in 2009. I was not in love with Season 3 and just hold out hope that maybe there can be a new lease on the show. (Hey , I can dream, right ).I just can't get into and enjoy the re-make they did- it just was NOT my Katherine and Vincent. 
The show ended in what felt like was mid-season seeing as how most Seasons had 30 ish episodes and Season 3 barely hit the teens. 
I so rarely watch TV shows but will be gladly rewatching this one- many times I am sure.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,11 September 2018
60,Beauty and the Beast, Connecting from a distance,"Believe it or not when I was a kid I never heard of the Fairy Tale ""Beauty and the Beast"" until I ran into this show. There have been so many adaptations of this classic tale throughout the years which is part of why it's so timeless. Believe it or not this is probably my favorite version since it was the first for me and still the best. It's one of my favorite TV shows of all time and live action fantasy TV shows which there are unfortunately very few of. The show is sort of a Neil Gaiman like fantasy tale since like with the author it's a fantasy that's set in modern times, which is great because it gave it an accessible feel and I don't feel modern time in the fantasy genre is tackled very much, usually most fantasy is set in either the past, an alien planet or future.<br/><br/>The music is great most are orchastratic tunes, I really love that theme song which I think is just beautiful, it has a romantic, haunting, and somber tone to it.<br/><br/>I really love the underground world that is constructed, it's uncannily similar to the world in Neil Gaiman's ""Neverwhere"". I really love the vastness of that world, wondering what on the next turn or beyond that tunnel. It just strangely beautiful it looks like a place where anything is possible and has a great amount of mystery and depth. And from what it has and certain customs it's also one that looks kinda post medieval; it's one step in the past but also one step in our reality. I also like that there is a strong sense of community in that underground world that unfortunately the world above has yet to achieve. There is also a conflicting but indivisible dynamic between both the up and down worlds, it kinda reflects Catherine and Vincent's relationship how despite difference both worlds need each other to exist.<br/><br/>However what really made the show of course was the relationship between both Catherine and Vincent. The chemistry between them is just beautiful because even though it's platonic but it always gradually develops. Their interaction is just sweet, you really feel like their bonding and there are sparks flying. Whenever their in physical distance together it doesn't feel strange at all but right.<br/><br/>Linda Hamilton one of my favorite actresses, this is one of my favorite roles from her. The Catherine character is just beautiful inside and out. I love that she's a strong, independent, highly intellect woman. She can hold her own against danger so she's not some stereotypical damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Vincent played by one of my favorite actors Ron Peralman, this believe it or not is my favorite role from him. The make up work by one of my favorite make up artists Rick Baker is great. Vincent looks like he could be one of the humanoid cats in the cartoon show ""Thundercats"", or a mutant from the ""X-Men"" movies, he's practically a humanoid lion. I thought that was a great design choice because despite inhuman he's pleasant looking, I feel in a way it reflect his persona where he's a persona that isn't just strong physically but emotionally, as they says strong emotions are an untamed beast (no pun intended). You can say that the show is almost a bit of a superhero show also (I said a bit) since Vincent has became a protector of both the underground world and above ground. There is action, it's not exactly wall to wall but it's good all the same, whenever we see Vincent taking action I think it's cool, just seeing him beat the crap and go animalistic on scum that had it coming.<br/><br/>However what really makes his character you really like and feel pathos for. The feelings he has for Catherine are very human, which makes the show both touching and at times heart wrenching. At times you can sense he's in pain, longing and emotional acheing. Despite knowing and accepting he's an outsider you can tell he longs to be with Cathrine above ground, be like any other human being that walks the street just to be with her.<br/><br/>Catherine at times longs to be with him, as well as be part of the world underground despite her little understanding of it and at times still grounded in her own. In a way her going back and forth in the worlds is sort of reminiscent of the mythology of Persephone, whom grew to love Hades and his world but still loves her world. <br/><br/>And the show has a main villain Paracelcus played well by the late great Tony Jay, he's one of my favorite fictional villains. I remember when I was a kid this guy scared me, because he was so evil, sadistic, ruthless, had a whole scumbag army backing him up, wants to conquer both the underground and if possible above ground world. But also just wants to simply destroy everything that was innocent and beautiful just because he can. Heck that tone of his voice, I felt added to his menace, certain things he said and how he said them just gave me chills. To me Paracelcus and some of the scum from both above and below ground are the real beasts of the show. To me if you defile or take life for naught then your not truly human.<br/><br/>The show still retains the theme from the fairy tale, that what is inside a person is truly beautiful. But also I feel the other theme in both the show and fairy tale, is about the importance of connection and togetherness. To me part of what love is, is one always needing the other, their can never be true community if one is alone.<br/><br/>Just like the fairy tale, this show is timeless.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,1 March 2013
61,Beauty and the Beast, Too strange to succeed on TV,"When it became obvious that this series, which obviously aspired to be the next Star Trek (not just a TV show but a cult, complete with movies, action figures, conventions, t-shirts, books, calendars, etc.) had die-hard fans but not enough of them to sustain the phenomenon, I recall that CBS started running a little promotional blurb for it. The blurb was not very well done, but in any case concluded with the remark: ""Are you ready for a different kind of passion?""<br/><br/>For good or ill, most people weren't. There's a lesson here, or several. I wish I knew what that message was. But here are some thoughts.<br/><br/>(1) We are told that the audience was heavily female. This is not at all surprising, since it's women who read what is called ""romance"", which its opponents call ""mush"": the lovers talking in flowery, quasi-religious language about their relationships; no development or change in the characters; and an absolute lack of humor. You find this sort of thing profound or silly, and in our society it seems the majority find it silly. Statistics suggest that significantly more women than men find it profound. This says something weird about our society, although (I repeat) I don't know exactly WHAT it says. That cheesy popular guru who writes about Mars and Venus appears not to know the half of it.<br/><br/>(2) On the other hand, a significant portion of our population likes ""fantasy"" (as opposed to ""romance"" in the narrow sense), as is proved by the popularity of the Lord of the Rings films. This series is just about the only unashamed fantasy (for adults) which TV seems to have produced with a mass audience in mind and without intending satire, a takeoff, or ""camp."" Which is, I suppose, why the promoters of this series thought they had a chance.<br/><br/>(3) I'm not a fan of what is called ""romance"" (few men are, as I've pointed out); in fact, the overly solemn Winter's Tale is the only Shakespeare play I don't like. And I don't especially like ""fantasy"", with a few exceptions. But I found this series strangely watchable, and others of my temperament have said the same. Few of the episodes had a plot worthy of the name, but it was often pleasant to hear Ron Perlman reciting poetry. The dialog had a kind of elegance to it, not at all common in TV, which I admit to enjoying. Sort of like enjoying opera, maybe. And Perlman (who from all accounts did take Beauty and the Beast very seriously) did a wonderful a job of acting, through all that getup. <br/><br/>(4) One fine day, Linda Hamilton decided she wasn't going to spend the rest of her life playing this goody-goody role, trying to breathe life into what she must have begun to see as rather bland and stilted dialog and a relationship which never changed or developed. I suppose it was at this point that the producers made a desperate effort to save the show by altering the whole thing to a dark, moody piece with suggestions of ""The Shadow"" or the ""Dark Knight"" side of Batman. And BANG, the last season was a totally different concept, in these terms: (a) there is violence and villainy, the nocturnal creep Gabriel, and in one episode Gabriel's Terminator-style henchman, all of which a lot of the original fans found disturbing; (b) Vincent and Catherine have a baby, which again grated on fans' nerves after they'd been hit over the head for two seasons with how platonic their relationship had been (c) bad symbolism, as when Diana the policewoman announces ""This is Catherine Chandler's gun!"" before shooting Gabriel in cold blood, as if Catherine had been the type who would have wanted revenge in any case; and so on. <br/><br/>So what is ""A different kind of passion""? Well, for one thing, the platonic nature of the Vincent-Catherine relationship, which recalls such images as the knight who prefers to worship his lady chastely, from afar, rather than ""defile"" her. When women want their horny male companions to leave them alone, they say things like ""Let's not ruin our friendship"" and ""You're making me uncomfortable."" Well, maybe men should brood on that a little, and ask why so many female reviewers of this series are saying things like ""Vincent is the greatest"", ""I'd love to have a man like Vincent"", etc., and follow that up by asking what Vincent's got that we haven't. I'm serious. (A Don Juan could be defined as a jerk who PRETENDS to be ""like Vincent"" in order to control women, wouldn't you say?)<br/><br/>The last season, with its overthrow of many of the series' basic assumptions, shows how confused things can get when you wed a concept like Beauty and the Beast (which inherently caters to a niche audience) to TV (which inherently seeks a common denominator in its fans). The irony is that this show still has such a following. Not hard to understand, but ironic, that the fans of this series still hold their conventions, StarTrek style, and still hope for a movie. I wish them well. <br/><br/>And I hope that if someone who does figure out the significance of this series' failed attempt to ""catch on"" will be kind enough to enter a review at IMDb. <br/><br/>Indeed, maybe there's a good reason why Vincent and Catherine never kissed (leaving aside the last season, which doesn't count). What a drag it would be if the kiss turned him into a handsome prince! He would simply cease to be The Beast and would no longer concern us. Who would want Don Quixote without his delusions, or the Flying Dutchman with no curse on him? ... So here, at the end of my comments, we come at last to the beginning of the subject. <br/><br/>""Beauty and the Beast will be continued""? No kidding.",41 out of 54 found this helpful.,,23 May 2004

This show was a great display that two people who love each other can be together no matter what their circumstances are or what there backgrounds are. Further, although Vincent was did not look like the average man, but he was smart, strong, loving and had a wonderful spirit. Most women are looking for a man like him. What he looked like did not bother me at all. Vincent was always their to protect and defend Catherine in any way he could. Their bond was so strong that they knew when each other was in distress. This show was realistic and did focus on many issues that exist today. For example, both Vincent and Catherine had past relationships, but they unlike many people in the real world were honest with each other even if what they said may have hurt them. I watched every episode that was on Netflix, and I was hooked. I only wish they could have ended the show in a better way then they did.

66,Beauty and the Beast, Lovely Romantic Show,"What an intriguing idea this was for a show? A retelling of the classic fairytale set in 1980's New York City.<br/><br/>Ron Pearlmen and the beautiful Linda Hamilton did a great job as Vincent and Catherine. Vincent lived below the streets of New York with other outcasts. One day Catherine Chandler (played by Linda Hamilton) was left for dead after an attack and was nursed back to health by Vincent. They soon fell in love and throughout the show their bond became stronger and stronger despite numerous obstacles. Catherine loved Vincent for what he was like inside-and not what he looked like outside. This is a good lesson for all of us.<br/><br/>The stories were great throughout and Pearlman and Hamilton were supported by a great supporting cast such as Edward Albert, Jay Acovone and Roy Dotrice. There was always plenty of action throughout and Vincent came to Catherine's rescue numerous times dishing out some pain to the bad guys.<br/><br/>(POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD) Then we came to season 3. Season 3 had it's good points and bad points. In season 3 there was quite a bit of tension and Edward Albert and Jay Acovone had more prominent roles. There was also a villain called Gabriel played by Stephen McHattie. Gabriel was a brilliant villain, totally evil. There were also some good episodes such as one starring Lance Henrikson as a hitman out to kill a wounded Vincent.<br/><br/>However, Catherine Chandler was killed at the beginning of season 3. This started the death knell for the show. How can there be a Beauty and the Beast without a Beauty? Jo Anderson was brought in playing Diana Bennett who was investigating Catherine's death but it was purely platonic between her and Vincent (Obviously love is not exchangeable). Diana and Vincent eventually caught up with the men behind Catherine's death and they were good episodes.<br/><br/>However, once all that was resolved the show ended after two episodes. Vincent and Diana had caught Catherine's killer so there was nowhere for the show to go. We obviously couldn't have had Vincent and Diana falling in love. It would have been immoral and unrealistic. <br/><br/>All in all, Beauty and the Beast was a fine show and overall, it was a very deep show about love. It was unique and ahead of it's time in my opinion and worth tracking down on video.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,,14 September 2002

I'm a third season fan, which puts me a little out of the loop with most of the fans, but third season deals with Vincent's loss of Catherine, his quest for his son, and it even hints at him learning to love someone again.  The show is always well-written and acted, with a great supporting cast.  The only weak spot is near the end of the second season, when the show, in my opinion, deals too much with Vincent's ""inner demons.""

69,Beauty and the Beast, One of the Best TV Series of All Time - Even Now,"""Beauty and the Beast"" was, and remains, TV brilliance. Some TV shows lock themselves into the decade they were created, ""Beauty and the Beast"" managed to make its time period almost gray. Ron Koslow created a show where love is its foundation. The weekly story lines were entertaining enough, but each episode went back to the love Catherine and Vincent shared. That's what this show was about, the love between two individuals, different as they are. Before I wrote this review I went on ahead and clicked the ""spoiler"" box because if someone reveals a spoiler without warning people that reviewer will be forever blacklisted. However, I don't really give away any spoilers. One review I just read said that we never truly learn how Vincent became the way he is. I have to disagree with that-- I believe we do learn how he came to be the way he is. It's deep into the series - but is explained by the sinister character Paracelcus and is better explained by Father because Paracelcus was a devious liar and so viewers were led to believe that he lied. However, Father explains it. The main character in this wonderful series is, of course, Catherine. She is truly an amazing and gifted actress. Her emotions, when called for in the scripts are raw and amazingly believable. She truly loved Vincent. There is one particular episode that is close to my heart and it's the episode titled ""A Happy Life,"" it is so beautifully written and Linda Hamilton should have received an Emmy award for it. There is also beautiful classical music sprinkled throughout the series that Catherine and Vincent loved, which also lends to the series being evergreen. The show is very emotionally fulfilling and Ron Koslow had a group of talented writers who managed to create stories that were painful/awful in their humanity/beautiful in their scope. The words the writers created for Vincent's character always allowed him to give sage advice without being preachy. Sure, it's a fantasy world, but this is what GOOD television should be about, not the reality garbage that dominates the airwaves now. TV shows should make us feel good in our hearts, they should make us think, even fantasize, and that's exactly what the beautiful series does. I received the complete series as a gift, and now I will always treasure it. The series set also allows the viewer to occasionally listen to some commentary by Vincent's Ron Perlman and Catherine's Linda Hamilton, they're short, informative and a very nice treat for real fans of this TV show.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,3 January 2016
70,Beauty and the Beast, Such depth &amp; superb writing...,"The beauty of this show is multidimensional. On the surface, yes, a love story between two people who fate brought together and their fight to hold onto a love that people wouldn't understand or accept. But there are so many deeper meanings to many of the episodes -- which probably played a large role in dooming the show. In order to understand these nuances you had to be willing to allow yourself to be pulled into the story, while also having a real grasp to the complexity behind the main characters. The stories, poetry and imagery used in the episodes told a story within a story; extended the story beyond the mere visual details and really gave you pause to think.<br/><br/>It also showed -- for those who took the time to really see -- that love isn't always about carnal desires. It showed that sometimes loving someone means that you have to give up everything. For anyone who has known what true, deep love means, they can relate to the heavy price love can exact. This wasn't a story about fly-by-night or whirlwind romance... It was about those quite moments in a loving relationship where people can just enjoy the quiet moments and be fulfilled... In many ways, it was the story of what love should be. The fact that real intimate moments between Catherine and Vincent were left to insinuation, implication, and imagination was no accident -- it was brilliant.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the two main characters were so well linked with each other, that once L. Hamilton left the show there was no saving it. The way the story of Catherine and Vincent was told made it so the two characters were so completely linked that losing one would change the other so completely that the show would have to completely change around the remaining character in order for the show to survive. When Linda left, the whole premise of the show went with her because, as loyal followers of the story could attest to, Vincent could never love another. They did try to introduce another character like Catherine, but the chemistry and bond just never worked out. Plus, once father and son were reunited, it was the natural end point to the story...<br/><br/>This show still has a lot of followers because of the uniqueness of it. The depth of the story and complexity of those deeper meanings are so fascinating that you want to watch the episodes again and again... And you will usually come away with new tidbits, deeper understanding, things that really make you think and analyze things every time you watch some of the episodes.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,,14 May 2012
71,Beauty and the Beast, Beauty and the Beast (DVD),"I watched this series episode by episode when it first came out. I recently purchased all 3 seasons on DVD. I watched Season 1 and 2 within a week and loved every moment.<br/><br/>My days are again spent humming the haunting theme music as they were so many years ago. And then I started to watch Season 3, I say started because I remember feeling now as I felt then. What a disappointment the third season was. I made myself skim through it, suffice to say, the magic was gone.<br/><br/>Now I know why I never watched beyond the first episode of the third season.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend that everyone watches Seasons 1 and 2, there has never been a better series and for me, never will be.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,26 May 2008

I cried so very much when Vincent lost Catherine, and o boy did i hate gabriel for killing her and steel vincent and catherines son. And it was a major disaster when they replaced catherine with Diane Bennet. NO CAN DO. Ron Perlman was fantastic at Vincent. A so sensitive and gentle man as vincent is very rare in real life, he had the biggest hart. Does anyone know where to get the music? especially The first time i loved for ever. It's so beautiful.

73,Beauty and the Beast, Adult Program?,"OK, I've been reading several of the reviews/comments here, and as I'm an adult now (mostly), I forgot for a moment that I was 12 when this series first aired. I certainly never thought of this as an adult or child's program. I simply found the premise of this show fascinating, and I loved the chemistry between Vincent and Catherine (until it got bizarre in the last season when Linda Hamilton left). I also quite simply, fell in love with Vincent, and later came to learn who Ron Perlman was, and have tried to watch him in anything I can get my hands on that isn't too bizarre (a very strange French movie comes to mind on the bizarre scale). Point being, this show reached a far range of viewers of all ages. Why? I wish I knew. I think that tom_amity has some incredible theories and insights, and I was impressed that as a guy (no offense) he, I feel has some very good points.<br/><br/>I also feel that this show was taken in completely the wrong direction in it's last season. Between the forced consummated relationship of Catherine and Vincent, resulting in Catherine's death, and Vincent becoming a father, and the suddenly incredibly violent path that the show took, well, I have to say that I was incredibly confused as to what had transpired between the season finale of season two, and the season opener of season three, and had a very hard time following what was supposed to be going on. I think that it was a mistake to have tried to alter the show so tremendously.<br/><br/>Someone here mentioned that there was no show like this ever again. I happen to think that person was wrong. Another show I watched faithfully after this one, that also seemed to end badly (and also on CBS... pattern anyone?) was Forever Knight. That show to me had very similar elements going on, what with the main character being a kind of freak, and his at-a-distance lover (the gal that worked in the morgue) and how it was obvious that they were attracted to each other, but could not be together. That show too eventually had problems and got a little stranger toward the end.<br/><br/>I would love to know why it's so difficult for networks to accept that which is different but has such great potential? Both of these shows were incredible, and both wound up having a short life, and both wound up going in strange directions before finally burning out.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,3 October 2008
74,Beauty and the Beast, BRING CATHERINE AND THIS BEAUTIFUL SHOW BACK !,"These show deserves a comeback and a continuation WITH Catherine !

The plot is interesting and events complicated, a lot of hustling themed cuts and directing and good characters with great casting. Did I say about the references? You have to be sharp to spot those easter eggs as they won't be explained. They're just secret candy for the smartest of us. Shh.<br/><br/>Ten episodes per season, could've watched twenty easily. Would want to, so I hope this one plays on for years.<br/><br/>A great show especially for those with a darker sense of humor and like more complicated storylines.

Set days before the infamous Black Monday crash of 1987 in which the stock market suffered double digit percentage losses (the Dow fell a record 500 points) due to computer failure, this comedy/drama captures the zeitgeist of yuppie culture that still kinda resonates today with our era. Don Cheadle is amazing and should win a golden globe and an emmy for his performance. This show also is made well done by Point Grey, known mostly for off the wall mature movies that are tongue in cheek fun.

89,Black Monday, Huge step down from the first episode to subsequent episodes,"The first episode of this show had me thinking this could end up being an almost worthy follow up to Eastbound and Down. It was over the top funny, Don Cheadle's character seemed to have a lot of promise, the plotting was inventive, and there were some hilariously inventive little jokes (Lehman Brothers being just two actual twin brothers killed me).<br/><br/>But now I've watched episodes two, three, and four, and I think I'm done. I don't know what the show wants to be. It's dropped almost all the comedy in favor of drama, but the characters are all basically ridiculous and unrealistic, so having them try to do a drama doesn't work at all. Most of the acting aside from Don Cheadle is mediocre to bad. The limited, scattered attempts at humor after the initial episode almost all fall flat. None of the side players at the firm are funny at all, and they are not good enough actors to pull off drama. And they're not giving Don Cheadle much to work with either with comedy or drama. The pilot showed the basis for him to be a Kenny Powers sort of mix of comedy and pathos, but the writing has completely fallen flat in delivering on that.",22 out of 41 found this helpful.,4.0,11 February 2019

100,The Rising of the Shield Hero, the adaptation from the light novel is remarkable,"Besides the tipical isekai theme, the series has a quick start with the characters accepting just from the first episode that they are in another world. This could seem bad for a development, but its very refreshing and let the series take another view (which is, of course, the main plot from the series). Our protagonist is betrayed from the very start and makes him to see the wonderful isekai world in which he was invoked as it is in reality, a normal kingdom with all its fails and trash. From that point our protagonist evolves in such a smooth way that you dont remember the last time he didnt taste food. the soundtrack is wonderful, following the pase of the series perfectly and the seiyu's have made an excelent job voicing naofumi, filo and the racoon loli. the animation is acceptable, with some fails, but those dont ruin the experience. my score for the series is 8,5/10 and as a personal opinion a 9/10",40 out of 47 found this helpful.,9.0,7 March 2019

126,High Seas, Visual delight! And Art Deco!,"I don't know how they achieved the look but they have these wonderful glowing colours through the show, sometimes blurring slightly which also adds to the effect. Nice dark shadows too.<br/><br/>The influence of Art Deco is there in the ship set designs and maybe the clothes too, all of which are stunning.<br/><br/>And the story and acting: I must say I don't find it off-putting like I do nearly 95% of the British-American-Canadian-French-Indian and other productions. Basically, I cannot watch hardly anything that comes off Netflix or Hollywood today. Maybe this Spanish series is getting something right.<br/><br/>I'm into the third episode, so unlike what someone said, the first is not the only good one, imo anyway. So while, the plot etc. is nothing radical it's far from the worst Netflix series, and far far ahead of the others. It's not reliant on realism, randomly shot, quick shaky camera, Euro Cannes style film making which irritates with its total pretension.<br/><br/>In short, beautiful, easy to watch, while not really insulting your intelligence or emotions.",60 out of 67 found this helpful.,9.0,31 May 2019

138,High Seas, Agatha Christie Vibe on Luxury Liner,"Heavy atmospherics, murder, and intrigue highlight this mystery set on the high seas shortly after World War II. The sets are fabulous, beautifully evoking in dark, rich colors the luxurious cruise ship of the fabulously wealthy in the 1940s (or at least supposedly wealthy in some cases). The fashions for both men and women are authentically stunning, and probably something no one would be ashamed to wear today.<br/><br/>The plot races a mile a minute, and it may take the viewer a while to sort out who everyone is, along with exactly what's going on and who's betraying whom.
This, of course, is what keeps things interesting.<br/><br/>If there seems to be a bit of artifice in the spoken dialogue, it soon becomes clear that the Spanish cast is actually speaking English, but they have been overdubbed in British English - no doubt to keep the dialogue accessible and accent free. This can be a bit distracting at first, but I quickly got used to it.<br/><br/>The last few minutes of the final episode indicate that a second season is in the works - at least I hope so, because I can't wait to see it!",15 out of 18 found this helpful.,8.0,6 June 2019

The CGI , although it felt like it wasn't real , but it was well done enough to not bother me , the acting as well was fairly good .

153,Friends from College," What ""Friends"" Would Have REALLY Been Like","Finally, a show that doesn't paint a rosy picture of old friends and the 'fresh new face' of 40. X'ers and X/Y cusps are hitting a time of change where they're dealing with a very different 40's than their parents, major choices being made later in life due to hard knocks from the failing economy, dot-bomb, and recession; and trying to weather this ""40 is the new 20"" crap. Many people are saying that these friends are hard to relate to because they went to Harvard. I went to my 10 year high school reunion. It was like this. It was both shameful and hilarious at the same time. ""Friends"" was what we wanted our long term friends aka ""framily"" to be. ""Friends From College"" is the dirty reality of it. They're messy and flawed and have the same fears many of us do - finally ready to have kids and can't, outgrowing marriages, delusions about long term 'crushes' and how childish that can be, etc. Nostalgia can be helpful, but also devastating to real life and sometimes you need to realize you've outgrown people. Seeing them struggle with a new decade in their lives, new challenges, and their immaturity is kind of refreshing. I'm SO sick of seeing perfect friendships. And women who've been friends for longer than 10 years who miraculously don't secretly hate each other or have a hidden jealousy. Yeah right. Also interesting...I know 5 people who have trashed this show...they are just like the people in the show. There are some great comedic scenes in here and I think the cast is pretty darn great. Seeing Fred Savage's character celebrating his 40th birthday...that one stung a little and heightened the point of the show. We're a generation upset about getting older, running out of time, or both. While I did not attend a private college, it was still easy to map their experiences over to something I can relate to, and I can say that they act out feelings I keep inside and I laugh at their consequences. I think it has potential and everyone needs to lighten up.",107 out of 121 found this helpful.,9.0,10 August 2017
154,Friends from College, Please bring us future seasons.,"I really, really loved this show. In fact, I watched all 8 episodes in one sitting and am craving more! I may just watch it all over again. I have read the poor reviews and I just do not know what people want. Honestly, I was able to relate to these characters even though I didn't go to an IVY league school, don't live in NY, and don't hang out with my old crew. I relate to these characters because they are flawed and real. They fantasize and make mistakes. They struggle with getting older. Middle age is such a weird time and I love that they are kind of caught between their younger years and the advanced years where, typically, people are expected to give up on their desires and fantasies and just accept what they have built for themselves. I mean, who says you have to do it that way? People should dictate how their own life will play out. You've only got one, and that is what makes the relationship between Sam &amp; Ethan so complicated and sad. The ""what ifs"" are so strongly felt and time feels like it is running out for them. There are awkward moments in the show, but that is also a part of life. I have moments in my own life where I said or did the most inappropriate or awkward thing and I still cringe when I think back to it. I relate to those moments that make me cringe in the show for that very reason. Like the unperformed Monica play in the finale - I've been there. I've planned something out and then scrapped it out of nervousness or fear or just not thinking it would go over well, just like the writers did with that scene. When I read that people don't ""like"" the characters, I am so perplexed. Do you have to think you would be best friends with a character to like a show? That seems like a small-minded way to judge a show and I think it would severely limit your viewing options. I like all of the characters. Are they annoying sometimes? Yes. That makes them like every other human being - including you.",96 out of 111 found this helpful.,10.0,28 July 2017

158,Friends from College, I don't understand the hate,"Friends from College is filled with a stellar cast and mostly great comedy mixed in with quite a bit of cringe. Maybe that's not everybody's thing? I don't understand anyone who watched this series and didn't laugh. There's so much humor in this and so much of it is because of the brilliance of Keegan Michael Key. Faxon and Colbie are great too. However, these people are all pretty awful and the show is very frustrating to watch some times. I think the thing with the rowdy guys from the law firm was way over the top to the point of ridiculous. It's hard to invest in the characters until the end when some of them seem to start doing the right thing. A few loose ends are tied in the end and the dramatic moments were very well done. I'd see a second season, definitely. MVP of the show is obviously Key and honestly maybe if he wasn't in it my score would be a little lower. FFF isn't perfect, but if you're in the mood to laugh at some terrible people (and Key's weird goofy voices...which killed me) then binge away.",51 out of 62 found this helpful.,8.0,23 July 2017

160,Friends from College, It's like Friends if they were all horrible people who shouldn't be friends with each other,"If you are looking for a light-hearted comedy about a group of friends from college who are still best friends because they all love each other, then keep on moving, this is not that. What it is though is a look at what happens when you are still friend with people who you have clearly outgrown or never really liked that much just because you happen to have the shared experience of college. There are many laugh out loud moments and a fair amount cringe worthy scenes, but if you are looking for heart felt emotion, it's not going to happen. These characters are flawed, very flawed, but somehow they seem totally real. Each one has something they are hiding, whether it be a torrid affair or fear of growing up. <br/><br/>The casting - Whether it is the comedic genius that is Keegan-Michael Keys or the brilliant guest stars that show up throughout the series, the casting to this show is spot on. <br/><br/>Physical Comedy - Sight gags are usually lame and pointless, but there are so many moments where the physical comedy takes over the scene and will make you laugh, hard.<br/><br/>Friends, really? - You will find yourself asking over and over, why the hell are these people friends?? It is pretty simple I think. We all have experiences in our lives that created friendships, those bonds last forever, even if they shouldn't. That is this group of friends. Having all went to college together (with the exception of some of the spouses) they all feel connected, despite having clearly moved on in their lives. They feel it necessary to continue to be friends even though they probably don't want to be anymore. The few spouses that are not associated with the college experiences see this as much as you do and question it, frequently. <br/><br/>Overall, if you want a show that is going to make you feel warm and fuzzy, nope, not for you. If you want a show that is going to make you cringe, laugh, snort, and guffaw, yep, this is it.",68 out of 85 found this helpful.,9.0,18 July 2017

177,Wild 'N Out, I think it's spose ta be funny,"I heard some laughing from the audience, which led me to believe that something funny was happening off camera, but they wouldn't show it, and instead focused in on the dread that was happening on stage. I'm not really sure what was going on, the audience kept on going wooo, which seems to amount to laughter now-a-days. Perhaps their was a fight going on, which much to my dismay, they would not show. The guys on stage just kept on doing their thing, which I think were attempts at insults and or humour, or MTV's version of the Lincoln/Douglas debates. The crowd just kept on going wooo. Now I was really getting concerned, because the audience seemed to be totally oblivious and didn't realize that somebody needed to call 911, because these guys were dying on stage. Well I hope the debaters got the help they needed. I wish MTV would have shown what was going on off camera, cuz it must have been somewhat funny",17 out of 26 found this helpful.,1.0,10 December 2009

Cameron really proved herself on the Tyra Banks show, Cold Case and CSI--amazing talent!!!!! Even when she is just rooting her team on --her energy is so positive that it lifts everyone a notch.<br/><br/>If MTV has a plan for these stars it is not obvious --they should be breaking them in with new shows that showcase their talents and maximize their high powered energy.<br/><br/>Nick Cannon is turning out to be quite a force in Hollywood--The show's structure makes sure everyone leaves wanting more and the reruns are good for catching up and better appreciating the cast.<br/><br/>Congratulations--Good work.<br/><br/>Look forward to Season 3. <br/><br/>Hope to see more of your top talent--<br/><br/>Careful not to beep out all the best jokes",10 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,18 June 2006

The guests always resort to lame stereotype role-playing. I do not care that these people are famous they do not do improv well. Wild n Out is a great example of how in American culture the mindless masses can be force fed something that is crap, but given enough pub it becomes hot by default. Nick Cannon is another Chris Tucker to me, ""LAME"". MTV in the past has been known for innovative ideas. Today's MTV seems to have run out of creative juice. I do like their doc-series approach to the new show Two-A-Days. That show is very entertaining. Two-A-Days is big time high school football. It is brave of them to take on a project that is produced in BAMA. I hope MTV will continue to take risks like this instead of relying on the yesterday who's who.

195,Wild 'N Out, The Best Show On MTV,"This show is a modern version of Whose Line is it Anyway with a hip-hop twist to it.

The games that are played on the show are always funny and they're rotated so none of them become stale. At the end of the show there is a freestyle rap portion in which jokes are made to a beat. The cast is free to make jokes about anyone for anything, which leads to probably one of the funniest parts of the show. At the end there is always a musical performer, and all of them are great in my opinion.<br/><br/>The cast, for the most part, does a terrific job. There are, however, some members that hardly have any speaking parts.

196,Sesame Street," A childhood gem, but it has fallen in standards since I was a lad...","When I was a child, there were two main educational programs shown to children. Play School, being the other one, basically got me shouting at the television that I was not retarded, not stupid, and not a diminished human being, just a child. From what I've seen from observing some of my cousins' children, it hasn't changed a lot except parents have revised their opinion of its suitability for five year olds. Unfortunately, Sesame Street is going much in the same direction.<br/><br/>In the 1990s, Sesame Street had a rather nasty competitor in the shape of Barney, a purple dinosaur with a support cast that showed no difference in emotional response. Even when that support cast consisted of four year olds and fourteen year olds. As if that wasn't harmful enough, Barney would openly tell children they weren't good if they didn't have good feelings, or alter the rules of a game to make someone else the winner. That such ""lessons"" were allowed to be broadcast shows how useful the regulators of television really are. By contrast, the Sesame Street I remember even dealt with such issues as the death of a loved one. Goodbye, Mr. Hooper was one of the most amazing episodes of children's television ever broadcast because it made an effort to try and teach children about something so difficult that even live adults are often no help with it.<br/><br/>Other brilliant aspects of the show included using monsters to portray certain feelings or behaviours that the audience might be conflicted about. They had a cookie monster to show what a negative (but highly funny, the way they presented it) appearance gluttony can bring. They had a grouchy monster to show the effects of an anti-social mentality. More ""cute"" monsters such as Grover were used to show things like fear or sadness. There was a good reason for all of this. Negative feelings are difficult enough for a child to understand, so having puppets to thoroughly explain them was very educational.<br/><br/>Kudos are also due the adult cast of the show. During every episode I saw, even Goodbye, Mr. Hooper, the adults were never condescending or smug. They never acted as if they had every answer. Instead, they told the monster, other puppet, or child characters a few useful tidbits and let these characters work things out for themselves. Even today, if you see the sequences with such annoying characters as Elmo, it is the children or the child-like characters who deliver all the answer lines. Those consultations with child psychologists done by the Children's Television Workshop really paid off.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, and there always seems to be an unfortunately these days when it comes to children's television, a certain adherence to marketing over education crept in over recent years. The greatness of such characters as Oscar or Grover was that they could appeal to children without needing to be cutesy. Oscar was a grump who appeared to have worked too many night shifts, while Grover seemed to be just a fearful but friendly guy trying to make his way in the world. Perfectly normal, ordinary people wrapped up in some very bizarre-looking trimmings, in other words. Nowadays, characters like Elmo seem so awfully sugarcoated that it makes me wonder if his audience is going to encounter problems in later life when they learn they cannot get by simply on acting cute.<br/><br/>I don't know who pulls the strings on this show these days, but I would like to implore them for the sake of future generations. The old way of educating the children about the fundamentals of life, and letting the cute factor take care of itself, was a much better one. Please go back to it. I might not be part of the audience anymore, but I do have second cousins, and maybe one day a niece or nephew, who are.",66 out of 74 found this helpful.,,13 November 2004
197,Sesame Street," Classic show, but lowering it's standards","This is a children's television classic.  It's educational and entertaining, and not painful for parents to watch with their kids.  At least it never used to be.  It used to be quite edgy, high-brow, very adult-accessible. It's been dumbed down considerably over the years.  This is a result of playing to lower age-groups, shorter attention spans, and competing with the run-of-the-mill trash in the kid's TV arena.<br/><br/>The adults have virtually vanished, the muppets have gotten annoying (I'm sure we're all familiar with Elmo by now), the show has shrunk to 40 minutes, the last 20 being a new show-within-a-show known as ""Elmo's World"". As if the 20 minutes of Elmo aren't enough, even more grating is that there are only about 10-20 episodes of Elmo's World, yet it runs every day!  And rather than dealing with reading, writing, counting, nature, social skills, Elmo's World revolves around things like balls, puppies, hair, etc.  Yes, this is not your parent's Sesame Street, or probably even the Sesame Street you grew up with.  It's a more modern, simple, conformist Street that has considerably less charm but at least more educational value than the other, more commercial stuff out there.<br/><br/>The only reason to turn your kids on to television is rapidly shrinking into another Barney.",35 out of 45 found this helpful.,,2 January 2001
198,Sesame Street, My daughters are the judge,"This was one of my favorite shows as a child in the 70s. (Though my sister always preferred ""The Electric Company"" - if anyone remembers that.) So, naturally, I thought my own two daughters would love it. Well, at age 2-3, my oldest loved Elmo, but at age 4, she's long over both Elmo and Sesame Street - and she won't enter Kindergarten for two more years! So, I give the current show a 6. It's too inane for my 4 year old. As for myself, I was much older when I stopped watching. This was one of my favorite shows. I give the old Sesame Street a 10/10. Thus we get 8 stars overall.<br/><br/>When I do occasionally watch the new show, I miss Kermit, am dismayed that Snuffy is visible to everyone (where's the fun in that?), think Big Bird acts like an imbecile (was he always such a baby? maybe so), wish Grover and Cookie Monster and the Count got more face time, suspect that the current production team is trying to make Ernie and Bert seem gay, and miss some of the old segments. I think they should just stop producing new shows and start re-running the old shows starting with season 1. The ratings would probably go way up and they'd save a lot of money.<br/><br/>""Oh waiter!

199,Sesame Street," Rest in Peace, Sesame Street (1969 - 1998)","I title the review as ""Rest in Peace"" only because if you, like me, are a child born of the early 1980's (or earlier) that grew up with Sesame Street, then you know now, as you watch it with your children, either on Netflix or PBS in the morning, that the Sesame Street we grew up with is long gone.<br/><br/>In 1998, a muppet monster that had, for the majority of its lifespan on Sesame Street, been nothing but a background character with virtually no lines or significant appearances in the show's then 29 year history, became the undisputed center of the show. Over the course of the following decade, that character would continue to dominate the show, becoming its very face and voice. That character was Elmo.<br/><br/>Within a few years, the entire format of Sesame Street would change. Elmo's world started as a small segment of Sesame Street that aired every other episode. By 2004, Elmo's World became a full 1/4 of the show, airing every single episode. Appearance by favorites, familiar faces and mainstays of Sesame Street began to slowly phase out. Big Bird, formerly the face and ""host"" of Sesame Street was replaced in time by ""Murray"" who, like Elmo, was also a background muppet that had virtually no presence on the show in the 35 years leading up to his first appearance as host. Murray, like Elmo, dominates roughly 1/4 of the show with various segments. Joining Elmo early in the 2000's was Abby Cadabby, a feisty and rather irritating purple fairy that's a huge hit with girls. She has her own segment, comprising the 3rd 1/4 of the show, Abby's Magical Sky School. Murray, from the very opening moment of a Sesame Street show, immediately begins reassuring kids that Elmo's World will be coming up, ""but we have a few other things to get through first"". Ultimately, ""Sesame Street"" itself is now reduced to a mere 10 minute segment. The problem that is posed in the beginning of the show, once taking the full hour of the show to investigate, understand and solve, is now resolved in only 10 minutes (sometimes 15, but rarely). Occasionally, one of the familiar adults may show up, like Gordon, but its otherwise Elmo, Abby Cadabby and the dreaded ""Beybah Baw"" (Baby Bear), a talking teddy bear with an insufferable speech impediment. Likable, new adult characters such as Gordon's nephew Chris, and Alan, who both run Hooper's store appear often enough to break up the monotony of Elmo, Abby and Baby Bear's childish antics. On the rare occasion that a classic character will show up, such as Bert, Ernie, Big Bird or Snuffy, Elmo will make his appearance within minutes to take over the show. I recall watching an episode recently with my daughter in which Bert lost his pet bird. 3 minutes after this situation is announced, Elmo and Abby show up and take over the segment. Bert is not seen again, his bird is never found...the entire segment consists of Abby and Elmo picking up random objects and asking ""Is this a bird? Is that a bird? Why isn't this a bird?"".<br/><br/>Sesame Street, I fear, is simply TOO childish to be of any value to children at this point. When I was a toddler in the early 80's, Sesame Street helped me learn how to read, count, differentiate colors and shapes and objects...all things my parents helped me with, Sesame Street did too. It was truly a valuable educational tool. Now? We have Elmo running around his house like a lunatic, screaming at inanimate objects, displaying narcissistic tendencies by referring to himself in the third person and imagining himself as different animals and objects. His own house seems to hate him, as he is constantly yelling at his window shade to cooperate with him, and other objects, such as his desk drawer, repeatedly bash him over the head when he starts yelling at them. Where's the educational value in Elmo running around in circles yelling at everything?<br/><br/>Parents are strongly advised not to utilize ""classic"" Sesame Street (pre-1990) as educational tools, as they ""no longer have any educational value and should not be utilized by your child."" Very sad that this warning comes on the DVD box sets of pre-Elmo Sesame Street. Frankly, I'd rather have Gordon sing ""Who are the people in your neighborhood"" to my daughter, rather than having Elmo cannibalize the melody to Jingle Bells and repeat ""Trucks trucks trucks, trucks trucks trucks"" over and over again. <br/><br/>A silent uproar occurred sometime around 2010, when it was suggested by the show's producers (internally) that the show be renamed. It would have become something along the lines of Elmo's World (Featuring Sesame Street)) Thankfully, this never occurred, though it appears to have piggybacked off the movement to cancel Sesame Street entirely, which was proposed in 2003, in favor of making Elmo's World a standalone show. The dominance of Elmo over Sesame Street into the 2000's and 2010's only continued to grow, as more and more of the classic faces of Sesame Street faded away into nothingness. Cookie Monster and Big Bird seldom make appearances on the show anymore...sometimes going over a dozen episodes without seeing them. On the other hand, if you were to watch Abby's Sky School and Elmo's World each day for the 24 episode season, you'll have seen at least 18 reruns of each show, since there are barely a dozen segments filmed for both.<br/><br/>Sesame Street was great for our generation but for our children? I wouldn't recommend it. It hurts me to say it. My daughter loves it...she's 15 months, and she loves the characters. I'm not going to take that from her...but as she gets older I will due my duty as her father to make sure she is educated properly. Sadly, Sesame Street, in its current state, cannot be a part of that experience.",25 out of 34 found this helpful.,7.0,21 April 2013

202,Sesame Street, GIve Cookie Monster back his cookies,"This was once one of the best shows for children to learn things from at an early age but now it's taken the turn of a ridiculous show to keep kids quiet while their parents don't pay attention. Then they complain about one of the characters and the show gets worse. Things that need to be changed: <br/><br/>1. Elmo- Get rid of Elmo, he teaches nothing and is very annoying. The only reason they added him was so they could make a doll that makes an irritating noise when you squeeze it then vibrates across the carpet. <br/><br/>2. Cookie Monster- Veggie Monster! what is that! Why can't Cookie Monster eat cookies anymore? Cookie Monster did not make kids fat, stupid video games made kids fat. Now stand back, ignore Sesame Street and look at the problem. Kids are not fat because they idolize a puppet, kids are fat because they don't have the common sense to put down the I-Pod and the Gameboy and go play outside. After all they don't need to go outside to play baseball anymore, not when they can sit on their duffs and do it on a Playstation. <br/><br/>3.

The people that have come and gone from this show are the ones that have been the best I've seen in a very long time. Now instead of recording new shows and going on without some of the major players in the show they just pasted together clips from old shows. I remember the days before Jim Henson died when Sesame Street was more than just a clip show. It meant a lot to the kids of my generation.",18 out of 24 found this helpful.,5.0,28 May 2006
204,Sesame Street, Beautiful and bitter memories...,"I wrote in another review on this site about how I was born to a military family stationed in Germany, Land of No Cable (And the world's best chocolate, but that's another story.).<br/><br/>Anyway, one of the few kid's shows on TV that my grandparents didn't have to record and send over was Sesame Street, and the only one that was on the entire eight years we were there (Eureka's Castle was on for bit, but then one day it vanished. Same thing with Lampchops.). On my dad's side of the family, everyone had a Sesame Street character that they had a bond with (Dad's was Cookie Monster), and naturally, I followed the tradition by latching on to Ernie. Many a night I could be heard singing ""Rubber Ducky"" in the tub (I had two Rubber Duckies, but one got chucked because it got moldy, I think). To this day, I still hold Ernie dear to my heart (I even have a ""Tickle Me Ernie"", much, much cuter than ""Tickle Me Elmo""!)<br/><br/>Not only did Sesame Street give me Ernie to love and make me laugh, but like everyone else who watched this show, it taught me to read and count. Then one day, this obnoxious bear showed up on Sesame Street, whining about Goldilocks stealing his porridge. I hoped he wouldn't be a permanent addition to the cast. Everyday, I'd turn on the set, and there he was, screeching in that high pitched voice of his. Soon, I stopped watching Sesame Street because I was so sick of Baby Bear. I was seven years old, and I had been watching Sesame Street for seven years.<br/><br/>Over the years, I did what all kids do, grew up. But about three years ago, I turned on Sesame Street again, and BABY BEAR IS STILL THERE!!! Not only that, some doofus gave Elmo a twenty minute segment, in which he spends most of those twenty minutes hopping around singing, ""Dee dee da dee, Elmo's World!"" over and over! And BABY BEAR IS STILL THERE!!! Horrible still, I hardly ever get to see my beloved Ernie and his Ol' Buddy Bert anymore. Worse of all, BABY BEAR IS STILL THERE!!!<br/><br/>So yes, Elmo may have ruined Sesame Street permanently (Unless God decides to raise Jim Henson from the dead), but for me, the death of Sesame Street came with the introduction of Baby Bear. So thanks a lot, you big throw rug! I hope the rest of the cast gets wise and turns you into a fur coat!",12 out of 15 found this helpful.,,19 December 2003
205,Sesame Street, What happended to my show?,"Can this really be the same show that dealt with the death of Mr. Hooper? I can't see them doing anything like that now. They used to count up to twenty. Now they sometimes go past ten. I even remember one cartoon segment where they went up to 40! I miss Mumford the Magician(ala peanut butter sandwiches!) and the honkers. I had a honker doll when I was little. Drove my folks nuts.<br/><br/>Please get rid of Elmo World! He doesn't even TEACH anything.('cept for that one PC Holiday Speacial) and as many others pointed out he's annoying and talks down to kids.<br/><br/>For people who tell me not to get upset over a kids show, I remind them that Sesame Street was a show parents could watch with their kids without being bored silly. The show had jokes that parents could get. and some awesome guest stars.<br/><br/>I have a feeling this show may be coming to an end.

The show would have like little teachings for them in various formats for them such as animated and such. There is some funny stuff on this show with Oscar, The Cookie Monster, Bert and Ernie. I would only recommend this television show to young kids unless the adults are interested in seeing the actors and the hilarious characters or if you want watch something you haven't seen as young boy or girl then this can bring memories back from the past make you feel like your a kid again.

207,Sesame Street, Lost Roots,"Though I am 33 years old, I have still found myself drawn to watch a minute or two of Sesame Street now and then. My daughter is 10 years old so her days of Elmo are long over but I find it a little sad that they have changed so much on the show. I remember watching the show every time it came on. My daughter loved it too. It seems too commercialized now and the characters have changed so much that you don't feel a connection to them the way that I did as a child. There was a feeling of being a part of ""the family"" even if you weren't actually there with them. I don't think that kids have changed so much that they wouldn't like it just the way that it use to be. I think what has changed is the junk that is on T.V. now days. Unfortunately, I suppose, poor old Sesame Street just couldn't compete with all that, and ended up having to make a few minor sacrifices here and there to draw the attention of the kids. I wish that for my Grand children's sake, though, they could find a way to go back to the Sesame Street that I remember and also be able to incorporate some of the new things.",14 out of 20 found this helpful.,5.0,28 July 2006
208,Sesame Street, Sesame Street in the 21st Century,"Sesame Street really got a makeover for its 33rd season, mainly because of the competitive environment of Pre-School TV, and how they learn things in this day in age.  The show is now blocked into these segments in order.<br/><br/>Greeting of the day:  Big Bird and the Sesame Street neighbors' great the viewers and either tell jokes play a game and/or sing a song.<br/><br/>Monster Time:  In this segment either shorts with the classic Sesame Street monsters are shown (Grover, Elmo, Rosita etc.) or a new feature called ""Monster Clubhouse"" in which four new monsters give preschoolers a crash course in what goes on in a typical preschool day.<br/><br/>Number of the Day:  The Count hosts this segment (who else could do it better on Sesame Street) in which he uses a special counting organ to find what the number of the day is.  The segment is followed up with live-action and animated sketches which help the viewers give a better understanding of the numbers.<br/><br/>Street Story:  The story of the day is now done in one complete segment rather than scatted throughout the whole show as it was done in the past. It seems that preschoolers don't like things interrupted but other things and messages (commercials or not).  The stories teach everything from cooperation, friendship, feelings, problem solving etc.<br/><br/>Journey to Ernie:  Big Bird and the viewers play a virural reality game in trying to find Ernie who hides in a box that resembles his red, yellow, and blue striped shirt with his rubber duckie in front of it.  The catch is it may not be the first or second boxes that contain Ernie.  The game begins a park and when BB is transported to other virtual environments and perform certain skills in order to find the box (memory recall, singing a song, doing a certain skill etc.).  If a box is found and does not have Ernie inside then a clip or segment is featured ranging from a special song or a kid that does something special, after which the game continues.  When Ernie is finally found then a sketch and/or song with Ernie is featured (sometimes with partner Bert).<br/><br/>Hero Guy: If Monster Clubhouse was not done in the Monstertime segment, then we see a sketch with Baby Bear and his imagery creation Hero Guy, in which they both learn about art, imagination, and problem solving.  Don't expect this to turn into a 'Big Bird's imaginary friend' running gag.  For those who complain about outing Snuffy this segement gives a fantasy friend to Baby Bear, and he is not going to try to prove that Hero Guy is real.<br/><br/>Letter of the Day:  Cookie Monster is given the honor of hosting this segment by showing cookies that have a letter on them.  The problem is Cookie eventually gives in to his instincts and eats the cookie.  The clips after Cookie Monster's attempt to teach letters will help viewers learn the sounds and recognition of the letters themselves.<br/><br/>Spanish Word of the Day:  Rosita along with Grover, Big Bird, and others on the street teach a Spanish word in a way that can be understood.<br/><br/>Elmo's World:  This guy should get his very own show and I am not joking. In the meantime Elmo encourages to learn about all kinds of things like Mail, Music, computers etc.  Elmo focuses on one subject to help kids understand what Elmo is inquisitive about on the day's segment.<br/><br/>Some complain that Sesame Street is not what it used to be, but keep in mind its own show anymore.  It's now for OUR kids, and Sesame Street is forever programming to 2 to 5 year olds.  With some many shows for preschooler out their Sesame Street is one of the few survivors today and don't be surprised if it's still on for another 33 years teaching the basics of numbers, letters etc.",17 out of 27 found this helpful.,,8 December 2002

211,Sesame Street, Used to be wonderful!,"Sesame Street--where to begin? Many different celebrities have appeared on the show throughout the years. I think that's what makes the show fun--all the celebrities making appearances. SS was very different back in the day. Some Muppets that used to be on were Forgetful Jones, Kermit the Frog, Prairie Dawn, and a few more I can't remember. There used to be a lot of segments with the Muppets sitting inside a gray room teaching children how to count, and learn the alphabet. One of my favorite is from 1972 with Kermit and a little girl named Joey. Kermit was trying to teach Joey the alphabet and she kept replacing the letters with ""COOKIE MONSTER"" which frustrated Kermit to the point of leaving, but then she said ""I love you"" and hugged him. I think some of my favorite segments are from the 70s, with Grover as the waiter in the restaurant much to the chagrin of this guy named ""Fat Blue."" Then there was an early one of Ernie trying to count some balloons. Then there was one of Cookie Monster in the library. Then there were some with Kermit and Cookie Monster. Then there was one with Ernie not being able to fall asleep and decided to count things in his head but they ended up being very noisy. Some of my favorite songs included ""Telephone Rock"" and ""C is for Cookie."" I haven't seen too many full episodes from the 70s but these are the only songs I know of. And there was that baker who kept dropping all the pies as he went down the stairs.<br/><br/>The 80s was probably my favorite decade . . . however there was some sadness. In December 1982, Will Lee (who played Mr. Hooper) died, and they made an episode teaching children about death and incorporated his death into the episode. Big Bird didn't understand at first and thought he was going to come back, but was told by the adults that he's not coming back which upset Big Bird plenty. On the positive side, the 80s SS had some really great songs, such as ""Monster in the Mirror"" (WUBBA WUBBA WUBBA) ""Wet Paint,"" (used to scare me at the end when the screen would melt) ""The Word is NO,"" ""Healthy Food,""-a rap song sung by Cookie Monster and various healthy foods, ""I Dance Myself to Sleep,"" featuring Ernie and the Boogeywoogie Sheep (I loved this one as a kid, lol) ""Do De Rubber Duck,"" ""Holy Moly 8 Balls of Fur,"" ""Cereal Girl,"" and ""A New Way to Walk."" There were some great segments as well--such as ""Teeny Little Superguy,"" and Kermit directing ""Oklahoma,"" I don't know if this was the 70s or 80s but there were the segments of Bert and Ernie fishing, and exploring a pyramid in Egypt. In 1985 was the debut of the current star of the show, Elmo, the little red furry monster we all know and love with the orange nose. He was cute at first as a background character and in the occasional segment (he was in one with Julia Roberts, and another with Whoopie Goldberg) but in the 90s, he became the star. May 1988 featured the wedding of Maria and Luis, and May 1989 featured the birth of their baby daughter Gabby. It's fitting because it aired a few weeks before I was born and my sister who was 2 at the time watched SS so my family was excited. And they taught children about how babies are born. <br/><br/>The 90s . . . in May 1990, Jim Henson, the creator of SS and the voice/puppeteer of Kermit, Ernie and others passed away. They did find a replacement for their voices but it just isn't the same. The early 90s is the SS I remember the most. In 1992 Queen Latifah sang a rap song called ""That's the Letter O"" which is a favorite of mine. In 1996 Elmo became a huge star and the hot new toy at the time, ""Tickle Me Elmo"" went on the market. In 1998 Elmo got his own segment ""Elmo's World,"" which takes up the last 20 minutes of the episode. I still think they should've just made it a spin off. The 90s was also the debut of Baby Bear, Baby Natasha, Rosita and Zoey--if not, they debuted in the 80s. I stopped watching in the mid-late 90s but I had cousins who were babies/toddlers at that time so sometimes I caught an episode here and there. We also used to watch the videotapes that were released--my aunt would run them for my cousins and that was fun. I can't remember any segments from the 90s because they mostly re-ran the old ones. <br/><br/>The 2000s--there were some major changes. Not only did Kermit the Frog and several other muppets disappear, but Children's Television Workshop was renamed to Sesame Workshop (and the little CTW on the SS sign was turned into 123) they had the same segments on the show every day--Journey to Ernie, Supergrover's Adventure, Number of the day, Letter of the Day, Spanish word of the day, and of course, Elmo's World. They even added that into the older episodes like the late 80s/early 90s. Also in 2005, it was rumored that Cookie Monster was being renamed to Veggie Monster because SS thinks his cookie-eating habit is one of the factors for child obesity. I think that is really dumb and nothing happened to us! They just made him eat healthier and even game him a new song called ""Cookies are sometimes food."" That's about it . . . <br/><br/>I hope if I have kids one day I will show them what SS used to be like. I know we're not the target audience anymore but it really was cool back in the day.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,16 June 2006

People might say it sucks, but you have to remember it's for LITTLE KIDS. And for a little kid's show, it was great. It's not Teletubbies (thank god), and it isn't nearly as sappy or needless as some modern kid's shows.

They talked up to kids and really educated them and spoke perfectly. They actually TAUGHT kids how to act! The show is horribly taken over by Elmo and that Bear and it is just sad to see. Jim Henson would be horrified with what this show has become. There was not any need to make drastic changes. It WAS PERFECT! Plus, the viewers who were 2-5 years, would outgrow them and there would always be a new audience. Back in the day, the parents would be entertained by this once great show. Not anymore. Elmo is horrendous. That whiney lisp has got to go. IT's as if the producers of Sesame Street don't want to parents to watch with their children.

218,Sesame Street, Change in Seseme Street,"I agree with the majority of the comments I have seen written. I grew up watching Seseme Street before a lot of the people who have written comments were even born. I was born in 1964, so I was 5-yrs-old when Seseme Street was introduced to television. The show taught me my numbers (The Count), spelling (the Muppet), and about life. I liked all the old characters (Big Bird, Oscar, Grover, and Cookie Monster) and don't quite understand why they had to change. I understand that everything has to change in some way, but to make Cookie Monster into a ""veggie monster"" to promote healthy eating. The show has introduced new characters and monsters since it's inception, why not make a separate ""veggie monster"" that talks/discusses the benefits of eating a varied diet with Cookie Monster. But, back to my point. I grew up watching the very beginning of Seseme Street, my now 20 yr-old daughter grew up watching SS with me along side her, and we discussed Mr. Hooper dying, although he had died prior to her being born, as well as other topics on the show. I saw the episode as a older child, and still remember how well they portrayed the event, much like real life. And I'm sure it hit the cast extremely hard as all deaths and losses effect families. You saw this on the show and it allowed parents and children to discuss very difficult events. The show has talked about traditional families, adoptive families and combined families. It's one of the few shows that actually discusses these scenarios. I now have a 5 yr-old daughter who really doesn't watch SS. I've tried to watch the show a couple of times, but, it really is not what it used to be. The Elmo 1/2 hr with Mr. Noodle is absolutely ridiculous. Like many people have said, it doesn't teach anything. It's geared for the less than 18 month old (maybe), and isn't even funny. I always prided myself on watching SS as a child, teen, and adult with my own child. Now on my second go-round, I really have a hard time watching SS. The topics that were discussed: death, marriage, non-traditional families, new to neighborhoods, moving away were related to children and adults in a manner easy for 2-99 year old to understand and relate to. Now, there are NO concepts taught, minimal counting, only the occasional mention of the alphabet. It is NOT the same SS, from an original watcher of the show. PLEASE if any producers from the show read these comments, return the show to its foundation. New concepts have never been a problem with SS, they just used to have a better way to incorporate them into the show.",9 out of 15 found this helpful.,3.0,15 March 2009

Fred Dryer was awesome as Rick Hunter, a shoot-first-and-ask-questions-later Dirty Harry-type, which is actually what the show started out as, but the character was toned down a little afterwards. Stephanie Kramer, as D.D. McCall, was the best of his three female partners, as was Charles Hallahan as the third of three different captains. It was like a small-screen action movie, with plenty of car chases and gun fights. Dryer and Kramer had great chemistry, which especially came across in the episodes featuring personal stories for the two, such as the first season two-parter in which Hunter defies orders and goes to Mexico to look for a guy who had attacked McCall and hid behind his diplomatic immunity. It was an episode that allowed Hunter to display the depth of his friendship to McCall and showed just how much the characters cared for one another. I don't remember too much about the later years (in which Hunter went through two new partners), but I recall a lot of the earlier ones, with many standout episodes. I would definitely love to have this great series on DVD.",22 out of 27 found this helpful.,,12 April 2002

In fact over the last few months I have viewed a couple episodes of ""Hunter"" and the viewings just reminded me just what a great show it was! I remember as a youngster on Saturday night ""Hunter"" occupied the NBC schedule and during that time period of the mid 1980's it's popularity was unmatched and I can see why. With every episode I watched from my days as a child and even now on TBS you can notice not only are the scripts well crafted but the characters are really what made this show. Especially notice the chemistry between Fred Dryer and Stepfanie Kramer they are able to play partners to perfection. Dryer a former professional football player a defensive end to be exact is tailor made for the part of Detective Sergeant Rick Hunter his own physical appearance combined with the attitude of a kick ass style cop make him a perfect fit and that made the show more interesting to watch. Stepfanie Kramer handles her job as Sergeant Dee Dee McCall just wonderful. Hey what happened to Stepfanie Kramer? What kind of logic are the TV networks and executives using? I tell you Stepfanie is a real cutesie. She definitely needs to be back once again in front of a TV camera her beauty must be noticed.

225,Hunter," Season one works for me, Season 2 not as much","Hunter was like the small-screen version of Dirty Harry, but a tad more on the gentle side. Fred Dryer's performance and Stefanie Kramers as Hunter's partner Detective Dee Dee McCall made this one of the most memorable cop show of the glorious decade that was the 1980's. In the first Season Hunter and McCall meet for the first time to take on a slasher of beautiful women, McCall's ex-partner turned mob hit-man, a case where the main suspect is the police commissioner, crooked sheriffs, a mafia hit, missing pigeons (??!!?), Hunter being false imprisoned, an overzealous bounty hunter, more mafioso, a cop killer, an overzealous parole officer, an overzealous surveillance expert, Hollywood, drug related death, and Hunter's ex among others. Featuring such notable guest stars as Brian Dennehy, Bo Svenson, Wings Hauser, Tracey Walter, Frances McDormand, Ed O'Neill, Christopher McDonald, Dennis Farina, Dennis Franz, and Monique Gabrielle. The first season had great shows for the most part (the Pigeon episode wasn't that good in the least) and the chemistry between Hunter and McCall is great.

Of course, the chemistry between Fred Dryer and Stephanie Kramer was what really made this show. You were always thinking, ""Are they ever going to date?"" LOL - good memories. It's too bad that Stephanie Kramer had to quit the show because of health issues (kept spraining/breaking her ankle because of all the stunt work involved - surprising, considering she was a former female wrestler).

230,Hunter, Often Silly But Always Entertaining,"I watched these back in the day and recently started re-watching on Hulu. I still enjoy them, but I notice things now I didn't 35 years ago.

I also enjoy watching Stepfanie Kramer run around with her perfect hair and makeup, often wearing a dress and heels, and never breaking a nail. I enjoy Fred Dryer even with his overuse of ""it works for me"". One thing that started toward the end of the first season was the ""music video"" format for shows. They would play a song while showing the story taking place. Maybe they got tired of writing dialog? Sometimes it works, but usually it's some lame song that I end up muting, and it just gets old and tiresome.

It's very obvious to me when I see Her two ex boyfriends, but lawyers. But why can't She see these obvious corrupt and greedy and spineless traits? Is Her character oblivious to the obvious or is She supposed to be dumb regarding dating? Both males She picked were exposed as being either very power hungry and/or very corrupt in ignoring the truth and just prosecuting anybody. I'm disappointed in Her for picking these cowardly males who have no integrity and should never be alllwed to practice law, let alone prosecute, as they keep prosecuting innocent people. That specific detail aside, the show is great. It makes me see some of what LAPD goes through. Oh! Another thing, How does LAPD have jurisdiction in some of the places that are outskirts of Los Angeles county? They get cases outside of la county and it doesn't make sense. Maybe jurisdiction didn't matter back then, but I saw at least 3 episodes where it made no sense that they were investigating cases outside of L A county. Anyway, I pay attention to details.

234,Hunter, Fun action cop show for the first five seasons,"Hunter was a great fun action cop show with Fred Dryer and Stephanie Kramer. It was produced in the mid-eighties so none of that politically correct garbage and in fact being PC was made fun of in the form of one of the internal affairs officer who always had a corn cob up his rear end and gave Hunter a hard time for not following procedures.<br/><br/>There is always a little sexual tension between Hunter and DD, as she was a very attractive lady, and their banter back and forth and insults to each other made the show. In the last two seasons they remove that sexual tension, first with an attractive officer who did not have a strong personality in the six season and no witty banter with Hunter. The 7th season saw a partner officer who looked more like an anorexic man than a woman and there was no sexual tension and no innuendo banter at all. So the lack of chemistry between Hunter and his female partner in the 6th and 7th seasons is what really killed Hunter.

236,Hunter, Worked for him and me !,"Just recently finished revisiting this show on DVD, i say revisiting, what i actually meant was watching the whole seven seasons on the all inclusive box set.<br/><br/>To set the picture, i had only seen upto the end of season two back in 87/88 when the ITV here in the UK suddenly decided that they didn't like American action/drama shows anymore and stopped showing them or shuffled them off to the wee hours of post midnight television. A few episodes of season three did pop up sporadically and then it went over to SKY TV for its seventh and final season.<br/><br/>This was the turning point where ITV and i parted company, gone were the days of The A team, Knight Rider, The Fall Guy, Airwolf, TJ Hooker, The Greatest American Hero, The Equalizer etc and of course, Hunter. In came shows with all the entertainment value of picking your nose and on it goes to this day with X factor, anyway, Hunter.<br/><br/>Now i've finally seen all the episodes, i can say that Hunter has to be one of the all time great American cop shows, what started, admittedly as a ""homage"" to the Dirty Harry movies, fought through that to establish its own relevant and unique persona. <br/><br/>Yes, the action was toned down post season two, but after watching the entire run now, it seems clear that this move is what guaranteed the show its seven season run, if it had relied on purely shoot outs and car flips, it would have folded much sooner. <br/><br/>It became more layered as it progressed, the characters became more three dimensional and even ""issues"" were tackled within the story lines. Effort such as this, at that time, is the beginning of the evolution to the cop shows of today, to move beyond being subservient to property destruction.<br/><br/>That said, the new Hawaii Five 0 seems to be back in this old vein and Justified is very much ""old school"" in its approach and consequently both a firm faves of mine. <br/><br/>Fred Dryer, considering he was a professional sportsman at the beginning of his career, managed to take Rick Hunter beyond being just an imposing presence against the scum he had to deal with and made him laconic, witty and even warmly human on occasion. Likewise Stepfanie Kramer, over the course of the shows run, made Dee Dee McCall a fully formed, professional law enforcement officer.<br/><br/>As with Hunter's character, it was revealed she had thoughts and feelings and was far more than just an attractive foil to Hunter and could crack skulls just as well as he could. Again, these efforts made at that time are what has helped to round out the TV tecs of today.<br/><br/>In summation, i was truly surprised and impressed by Hunter when i finally got to see all of them recently, yes a few episodes go clunk, but the ones that really work easily surpass them.<br/><br/>I recommend this show unreservedly, if you like good cop shows, you'll like this.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,1 December 2011
237,Hunter," ""It (still) works for me!""","'Hunter' was a great show, for the first 5 seasons, despite having several cast changes throughout the course of its 7 year run, the chemistry between the two lead characters was perfect. The relationship between Hunter and McCall made you believe that BOTH of them really had the hots for one another! You wanted to see some of the sizzle but (to my knowledge) it never happened either on the show or during their personal lives either. Had it happened it would NOT have been the worst pairing in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Of course, Stepfanie Kramer, a beautiful, sexy cream-puff of a girl, portrays Hunter's partner Dee Dee. The woman was so gorgeous, so soft, so feminine, that it was often comical watching her play a hard-nosed police officer... even when she was shooting at bad guys (and hitting them) you had an irresistible urge to hug and squeeze her. Ms. Kramer evidently tried to counter her natural lovable squishiness by POINTING at things or suspects when she was trying to express real anger or determination. She even pointed fellow officers, pictures in a file folder, etc. After she quit the show in early 1990 Dryer (the star and executive producer) continued right along with at least 3 different female partners whose names or character names are totally forgotten...as were their performances in the show... and those episodes just dragged along for me.<br/><br/>I still watch them on a local cable channel almost 5 evenings a week even though I tune out if it is one of the 20 or so episodes near the end of the series that Stepfanie Kramer was not co-starring in. Dryer just could have never made the show a network hit without Kramer! Her nickname ""the brass cupcake"" truly fit the talent she brought to the program.<br/><br/>If she had continued working they could have had at least another 5 years on network TV! This was a great show when it first aired in the 80's and it still is a great show in reruns. It says something about a crime drama series when it is still being aired on television 21 years after its original premiere date.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,4 August 2015
238,Hunter, Dirty Harry for TV - Sometimes Watchable,"Rugged anti-hero/loose cannon Los Angeles cop Sgt. Rick Hunter (Fred Dryer) didn't get into law enforcement for the meagre paycheck, or the long hours or the instability in his relationships, or the constant threat of death. He got into it because there are some bad guys out there who need to get taken down hard and he is just the bucko ta do it! Hunter's original arrangement with partner Dee Dee McCall (A trigger-happy, Lynda Carter lookalike referred to as ""The Brass Cupcake"" by her more sexist colleagues) was that they would be partners in name only .<br/><br/>Since neither could keep a partner and they both worked better on their own the arrangement appeared to make sense. They would sign each other's reports and vouch for one another conducting investigations separately.<br/><br/>But each brought out the best in the other making inroads into crime heightening the danger with their very progress. They would come to need each other's presence up until they acknowledged they really were partners.<br/><br/>There was big money in the vigilante cop formula and Hunter which ran for 152 episodes didn't disappoint giving audiences their fix of gritty cop show action. Hunter was essentially ""Dirty Harry for TV"" and was cast with ex-pro football player Fred Dryer who sort of resembled Clint Eastwood though unlike Eastwood Dryer couldn't act and was balding even more rapidly than Eastwood.<br/><br/>Dryer actually appeared to be affecting an impression of Eastwwod with an angry glare and clenched teeth sneering his lines early in the series. Hunter had the same trigger-happy gunslinger attitude as Dirty Harry and the familiar difficulty dealing with a police bureaucracy obsessed with public relations, red tape and prospects for career advancement.<br/><br/>Hunter also famously had a habit of physically abusing suspects of African-American, Asian and Latino persuasion. Hunter's partner Dee Dee McCall often came close to being raped and murdered on a show which narrowly avoided being classified as the most violent on network TV simply because Miami Vice and the A-Team (NBC took over from ABC as the network with the most violent programming) were still on the air. Think of all of that what you will.<br/><br/>Very little of what was shown in the murder mysteries was all that complicated and the one-dimensional characters never challenged audiences much. The quality of the production actually deteriorated as it went. There was never an examination of light and shade in the characters. There was not the slightest hint of moral subjectivity in the performances. There was merely good destroying evil.<br/><br/>The Hunter character was much like those portrayed by John Wayne or Randolph Scott in Westerns; One who exerts brute force in the same way a bullying thug might but is insulated by his own righteousness. It is of little challenge to an actor and as such Dryer was much more effective early in the series when he was not called upon to emote on camera.<br/><br/>Reviews of this show at the time it came out were almost uniformly negative. Nobody liked this show...With the exception of the actual public.",8 out of 14 found this helpful.,,4 September 2012
239,Hunter, My favorite cop-oriented show,"This has to be one of the best cop shows of all time.  Hunter (Dryer) and McCall (Kramer) have a chemistry that cannot be matched (unlike Law and Order, Jerry Orbach have several different partners).  The car chases, crashes, shootouts, fights, etc... are great.  Hunter's car in the show is cool!  It, like Hunter, takes a licking and keeps on ticking. Unfortunately, the show took a downturn after McCall left and I discontinued watching at that point.  Also, Hunter wearing a police uniform instead of his usual casual clothes turned me off.  He was also driving a Crown Victoria issued by the LA police instead of that big green land-barge of his.  Needless to say, the final seasons (post mid-1990) left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>Of all the characters, I have to say captain Charlie Devane (Charles Hallahan) was the worst.  I disliked his attitude.  He thinks of himself as ""cool"" but he is just a fat, lazy, and ugly middle aged man.  I also disliked Sporty James (Garret Morris).  I don't know what it was, but I just despised the guy!  It could of been his ""pimp"" attitude.  He sucked.  My favorites were of course Hunter and McCall.  Hunter kicked the butts of many crime-doers in Los Angeles (being a former NFL player, he can do this without even trying hard!), and McCall stunned everybody with her beauty (I happen to think she is VERY beautiful!) and her toughness from that little body of hers.  The women that followed McCall (Molenski, Novak (Lauren Lane)) were very unattractive and useless as police officers.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the show from the 1984-1990 seasons (Kramer's tenure) although TBS does jumble the episode order, especially the 84-85 season. If there were no Charles Hallahan character or Sporty James character, and McCall never left, the show could have lasted alot longer easily.",8 out of 15 found this helpful.,,6 August 2002
240,Hunter, Hunter is an AWESOME show!!!,"Hunter is a NBC Police Drama from 1984 - 1991. It was created by Frank Lupo, and is a Stephen J. Cannell Production. This is one of the greatest cop shows from the '80s! The two main characters are Detective Sgt. Rick Hunter (played by Fred Dryer) and Detective Sgt. Dee Dee McCall (played by Stepfanie Kramer). Together, they are partners in the LAPD Homicide division. They are solving murders and catching those bad criminals! If you watch this show for a while, you'll really root for Hunter and McCall. The episodes always have me at the edge of my seat. Not only is the show exciting but it also has its funny moments between Hunter and McCall. One thing that can make this show different than other cop shows is the wonderful relationship between the two partners. And in my opinion, Dryer and Kramer did an excellent job acting!!",4 out of 7 found this helpful.,,26 March 2005

242,Hunter, Cop-Out,"""Hunter"" was a TV series so predictable, so banal, so obvious that you've already seen every episode. It isn't hard to imagine the meetings that went into the creation of this show: ""How about a Dirty Harry for the small-screen... with a beautiful babe as his partner?"" ""Works for me."" When pro-football player Fred Dryer retired and took up a career in acting, he displayed a remarkable gift, rare for even lifelong professional actors... he had a flare for comedy. He was so funny, in fact, that he came *this* close to getting the role of Sam Malone in Cheers... even when it went to Ted Danson the producers had Dryer on numerous times in guest-appearances that became classics. The bold move for him and his agent would have been to find or create a TV series that put his talents to use, a show that highlighted his tough-guy/teddy-bear persona. Instead Fred copped out.<br/><br/>""Hunter"" was the cop show that defined the whole genre of bad 80's cop-shows... a rebel detective that exacts his own brand of justice, a loose cannon who fights with the chief and carries a gun so big it belongs on a battleship. Dryer allowed his uncanny resemblance to Clint Eastwood to be exploited in a mindless show that can best be described as ""filler."" See him squint and fire a warning shot... watch him cuff a street punk so he can get a lead on who killed a hooker... Wasted was a man capable of delivering a punchline, playing a romantic lead, or exposing the sensitivity beneath the rough exterior. Instead we get a walking cliché, complete with his own ""Make-my-day"" catchphrase: ""Works for me.""<br/><br/>Stepfanie Kramer, a beautiful cream-puff of a girl, portrays Hunter's partner Dee Dee. The woman was so gorgeous, so soft, so feminine, that it was often comical watching her play a police officer... even when she was shooting at bad guys you had an irresistible urge to hug her. Kramer evidently tried to counter her natural squishiness by POINTING at things when she was trying to express anger or determination. She pointed at suspects, fellow officers, guns... we still loved her.<br/><br/>This is not to say the show itself is terrible. Dryer is good in the lead, but only good. He shares a wonderful chemistry with the stunning Kramer, and most episodes are decent and watchable. A great TV show, however, needs more than a passing grade. I'm only passionate about Hunter because I feel Fred Dryer was capable of so much more... instead of a classic sitcom that challenged a gifted actor (or even a cop show that redefined the genre), we're stuck with seven seasons of sirens, silencers and shootouts. Most people don't even remember the show or the actors, and there's a reason for that. ""Hunter"" spoiled the career of Fred Dryer, and that does not work for me.",10 out of 27 found this helpful.,,26 April 2005
243,Hunter, A kick-ass cop show...but only in its first season,"In 1984, ""Hunter"" got off to an explosive start, with producer Stephen J. Cannell and creator Frank Lupo taking the Dirty Harry concept way over the top. Fred Dryer starred as Rick Hunter, a Los Angeles cop hated by his superiors both for his shoot-first-ask-questions-later methods and for his family ties to the mob. Stepfanie Kramer played Dee Dee McCall, the only other cop on the force with an equally aggressive approach; she also had a flair for disguise which was often helpful. Together, they took down every form of sleaze under the California sun: psychos, drug-dealers, pimps, corrupt politicians, often in a hailstorm of bullets punctuated by car crashes and explosions; and they made no apologies, because they knew that there was no other way to have justice in a scummy world. With the outstanding production values typical to Cannell shows, and with Dryer and Kramer's considerable chemistry, the results were white-hot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after the show was renewed for a second season, Cannell found himself juggling too many shows at once, and brought in his mentor, veteran producer Roy Huggins, to take over the reins. The results were depressing: out went the sleaze, out went Hunter's mob ties, out went the fights with the superiors, out went most of the action. Instead, we got the usual boring upscale L.A. locations, we got slower, ""socially relevant"" stories, and Hunter and McCall suddenly had vulnerabilities. That last change was especially annoying to me, because the unstoppable dealer (in this case, dealers) of justice is a true icon which Cannell, with his love for classic hard-boiled detective fiction, understood perfectly.<br/><br/>The series went on to run for a total of eight years, but it was never again as good as when it started. For a brief, bright moment, it was the closest thing to TRUE pulp fiction seen in American live action entertainment from the second half of the 20th century.",4 out of 9 found this helpful.,,21 February 2005

253,Roadies, A real music fans treat or why Cameron Crowe is so great,"let me open this review by saying that music was always my greatest passion and music artists are some of my greatest heroes, that and of course movies and cinema. I was 16 years old when Crowe present me with the groundbreaking movie ""Singles"" that capture the grunge music generation with a one of a time soundtrack from bands like Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam and many more... the movie was the right mixture of drama, music,comedy and romance that only a true music lover can make. and then came ""Almost Famous"" that kept the same delicate essence. This series is (for me) the 3rd part in Crowe's musical trilogy, a group of roadies works for a band in a city state tour, a real hard job that keep you out of a normal family life where the tour buses are your home and the actual family are your co-workers, the pay isn't much so why keep going? they all have one thing in common, their passion for music, the same passion that drove Crowe on an early age to become a traveling journalist for the Rolling Stones magazine (the ""Almost Famous"" movie story). so.. is that series any good - sure is!, if you loved Crowe's other movies this one is the right series for you, if you are a true music lover you will identify with the characters and your heart will fill with warmth every couple of minutes.",11 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,10 October 2016

257,Roadies, Heart broken,"There are very few shows that I get attached to, and Roadies was one of them. My iTunes music library grew because of this show. Every week I looked forward to seeing what new music would be featured. The story was well written and entertaining, although I'm sure roadie life is not really the way it was portrayed. Since the season one finale my wife and I kept watching replays on demand and wondered where they would take the story in season 2. Needless to say, we were crushed when we heard that the show had been canceled. I don't understand how a show that was so well liked (7.4/10) can be canceled. It is extremely disappointing and we're hoping that Showtime changes their minds and brings it back.",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,18 January 2017
258,Roadies, An excellent show!,"Its a travesty, a damn shame that such a great show have been cancelled. I did not even noticed that there was a bad manuscrip or if the facts where not right...it was GREAT Music, a ""good feel"" show. It had the same aura as ""stranger things"", but even ""californication"", it just made you feel good! The characters in this show are great, the settings are excellent and the whole concept of the show is perfect. It would have been awesome if we could have seen them on the tour in Europé, and let us see some more of our rockstar legends. There are more superlatives but ill take a break for now.<br/><br/>There is no other show i would like to be picked up than this one and i hope at least HBO, that usually have a sense about these things does something about it.",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,28 September 2016

I read so many crap about the series and about critics who say that it's not accurate to the actually jobs of roadies and so on...of course not. I'ts TV....it's entertainment! I really hope Grey's Anatomy, ER, CSI, and every other show you can think of are not the standards for how it works in those jobs either.<br/><br/>I really hope that there is more to come and hopefully some more seasons.<br/><br/>If you like new music there is another plus for you!

260,Roadies, Just a wonderful trip,"I loved this series. I started watching it unaware of who was involved and the first thing I thought was it was 'Almost Famous' as a series. When the end credits came up sure enough it was Cameron Crowe. But that's a great thing. He brings the atmosphere so vividly on screen. He captures the feeling, the ups and downs and all the little sounds in between of life on the road. I've been there, being a Tour Manager, and he got everything right............so he should because he's been there too in its hey day. It is 'Almost Famous' as a series, but that's a great thing right? Who doesn't love Almost Famous? And its a great modern day take on it balancing the nostalgic meaning of what it was to be with a rock band back in the day versus the modern day fat cats in the music business and with it comes job cuts. <br/><br/>'Roadies' has a purpose.

It felt like I was watching a show I had seen 10 times before. Even top notch acting can't save a worn out script. Things like walking out a door &amp; getting locked out - we have seen this a million times before but done much better. There is absolutely nothing even remotely original about this show. Every scene was predictable and formulaic. It's too bad they wasted an excellent cast on this re-run script. I don't expect writers to reinvent the world, but this feels like formula TV at it's worst.

269,The Loud House, Nickelodeon is getting its' groove bock!,"Finally, after eight years of crappy sitcoms and brain dead cartoons, Nick is finally regaining its' old spirit. not since Avatar has there ever been a show that can truly relate to families everywhere.<br/><br/>the synopsis of the show is about an 11-year-old boy named Lincoln Loud who is part of a family of 10 sisters, each one having diverse, unique personalities that bring out the different sides of Lincoln. There's the first born Lori who constantly texts to her boyfriend, Bobby, and because of being the oldest, believes that she can get whatever she wants amongst her siblings, but despite her condescending attitude, she does care for her brother and sisters. There is the second born Leni who is the stereotypical dumb blonde and, unlike most of the family members, is the nicest person you'll ever meet, but can be taken advantage at times due to her naivety. There's the third born Luna who likes to listen, and play, loud music, along with being skilled in guitar and expressing the punk rock lifestyle. Luan Loud, the fourth born, is an amateur comedian who enjoys playing pranks on her family members and telling terrible jokes, which she is oblivious of the constant groans of her annoyed siblings. Lynn Loud is the fifth oldest sister who is energetic and enjoys playing extreme sports while playing and/or fighting with her brother, Lincoln, much to his chagrin. 8-year-old Lucy Loud is the oddball of the family and a preteen emo/goth girl who enjoys reciting poems of the macabre and hosting seances, despite creeping most of her family members whenever she appears out of nowhere. the twins, Lola and Lana, are polar opposites--one is a spoiled, tattle telling pageant girl while the other is a mud-loving, dumpster diving tomboy--that tends to get into fights dues to their clashing personalities. Lisa is a 4-year-old child prodigy who had skipped several grades and even graduated college early with a ph.d. last but not least is Lilly the baby who enjoys running around naked throughout the house and defecating in her own diaper while exclaiming ""poo poo."" like any normal baby.<br/><br/>At times, they can get on Lincoln's nerves due to the chaos they bring and sometimes wishes for them to go away (like any kid with siblings), but, most of the time, he loves them and is thankful that he has sisters who love him and has his back.<br/><br/>This show has a well-built storyline, excellent character development, a decent setting with episodes made by brilliant writers, and a protagonist we can all relate to. Along with Harvey Beaks, this is the show that can help bring Nick out of the darkness and into the light and i'm enjoying it every time i watch it.",48 out of 69 found this helpful.,10.0,27 May 2016

271,The Loud House, This show is good and you should check it out.,"The show is about an 11 year old boy living with his ten sisters. The plot for this show is very compelling and it makes me think that Nick has a shot of redeeming itself. I really like the character development here and even though there is some gross out humor, there isn't much and it is mild. I personally like Harvey Beaks and with two good shows in a row, Nick is on the right track. I especially love the animation and with the panels in the title sequence takes me back. Honestly, I think Lincoln is the least interesting character in this show(aside from Clyde). He is a likable enough main character, but it is more interesting in my case to learn more about his siblings. Finally, the best part of this show is the fact that you can relate to it and I relate well because I grew up in a large family. I think you should check this show out and maybe, just maybe Nick can dig itself out of the hole they have crawled into.",31 out of 47 found this helpful.,10.0,18 May 2016

273,The Loud House, Sigh....This show is getting less and less funny now. Not even *close* to being better than Spongebob like some people are saying.,"This show is hilariously overrated, here. I see tons of 10/10s, yet when I turned it on for my youngest cousin he asked me: ""Can you please turn this channel, I hate this show."" I dove deeper and I see *why* he has such disdain for this show. For one: the animation. It's not bad bad, but it's *next* to teen titans go. That in itself is an accomplishment. The graphics are good I will admit, but holy shoot the animation barely even matches the graphics. I had sometimes where I paused it
 during sometimes and the animation was so messed up that the character wasn't even *There* yet. That in itself is messed up.<br/><br/>Another thing that chased me away from liking this show is the characters themselves: let me dissect each of the characters just to let you get an understanding on what I mean. By that I mean *all* eleven of the kids.<br/><br/>Lincoln: While I found him *okay* at first, he just started become one of the biggest douches that I have ever seen in my lifetime. Every episode you can see that the guy is 90% selfish and either destroys his sisters items (Lynn's bike for example which guess what the reason was? *To look cool instead of literally telling them what was what.*(he just provides a excuse saying it was his sisters and that he was cool). By the way, he *still* ends up not being able to hang out with them because Lynn has them as her followers at the end of the episode) or even his own parents (for example, losing Rita's novel, which he got lucky that she forgave him and wanted to start a new one which is *cough plot armor cough*. Or that time where he convinced his sisters to ruin their dad's dinner(I don't care if they were tired of it as well, it was *his* plan to sabotage the dinner) and got what they wanted. He didn't even *care* about the tight budget, and I guarantee you that none of the sisters would have thought of that if he wasn't there to mention it.). Overall, this guy thinks he's cool and a hotshot, yet he isn't. Heck he didn't even trust his partner *Ronnie Anne* when they were caring for an egg...that in itself is just wrong of you dude. So, 90% jerk, you're not cool Lincoln so stop trying, you're just making yourself look pathetic.<br/><br/>Lynn: The stereotype of the jock persona, the one that loves sports and wrestling.(which comes to my other quirk of the fact that they always yell out what their stereotype is, an example being Lynn). Now lynn is just as annoying as Lincoln, just times the fact that she always has something smart to say (calling them weak for not catching something or doing anything she can do with ease, which isn't even funny) and the fact that she is 90% of the time the sister that threatens someone into talking with violence or just by belittling the others and you got Lynn in a nutshell. Don't know how that even comes to a likeable character. My only issue is that she is way too loud almost all of the time and whenever she is shown on screen she always has to announce that she loves sports by her actions and how competitive she is as well. It's annoying: stop it. Also, she's one of the many bad quirks this show gives me, but let's keep that for the plot section shall we?<br/><br/>Lucy: Gothic stereotype: most sentences *she* says always has to end up being gothic....seriously? Another recurring thing that annoys me is when she says things like ""I'm here"" that's really old, and it isn't funny at all that the family forget about her when counting each other. Not just that, but every gothic quote she makes just has my body itself cringe so bad I feel like I was going to go to the hospital. No it isn't that I don't like gothic people, it's the fact that *everything* she says has something to do with being gothic. Just *please* stop I'm begging you. Say something that isn't part of you being gothic(Nor the topic.)<br/><br/>Luan: This is probably my most hated character next to Lincoln himself. Basically imagine the Joker, but just that all of the jokes fall flat and she doesn't kill. That's Luan in a nutshell. Luan's jokes in every episode is just terrible, and it isn't funny. The running gag is supposed to be that the rest of the siblings sighs after hearing her pun jokes. What's supposed to be funny about that? It just shows that *they* are having the same feeling that I am hearing her jokes: wanting to die. That's how bad her jokes is. But what really makes me disdain her, is when April Fools comes about. She just pretends like she's the Joker in that she plans her pranks to a large extent, but all of them just seem so easy to know when the prank is going to happen or what trap it is awaiting the family. Just stop: your pranks aren't funny, your jokes aren't funny, and you don't have that much of a brilliant mind at setting things up as you think you do. Anyone who is watching her prank-a-thon knows exactly what is coming next despite it being *blatantly* obvious the family somehow *still* falls for it. I guess plot armor? I don't know but it really does make me contemplate at night wondering where did the world go wrong at Nickelodeon.<br/><br/>Lisa: The Geek Scientist Stereotype:The only real issue I have about her is that she constantly has to show that she's a genius by pronouncing words that others don't know and then being all condescending on them for not knowing. I like smart people in shows, but not the type that has to constantly condescend on others because they know a word they don't. She was looking good at first, but after seeing her do it again and again, I just gave up on her. If she stops being so condescending and actually shows something else, then maybe I'll start liking her. But right now? No.<br/><br/>Lennie: The dumb, fashionable, blondie stereotype. This has been done so many times that it annoys me now. You're not being unique, it's just the same jizz that others already did. Seeing Lennie being *Crazy* stupid has actually made me feel like my brain cells was disappearing slowly each time I heard a word come out of her mouth. I'm just like: ""there's no way she's this dumb"" but unfortunately, she is. It isn't funny whenever she mistakes things, stop running that miserable gag. It's boring as heck up to this point now. Sorry Lennie, but due to your incredibly low IQ, I can't deem you a good character.<br/><br/>Lola: The ""I'm a princess so you should bow to me and I won't do any physical work at all"" stereotype. This is bland over all, if you watch any episodes, you would see what I mean. All she ever does is condescend others and tries to be scary as heck, yet I'm just sitting here wondering why the heck is everyone afraid of this little girl. You aren't scary Lola. That's my main problem with her: she tries too hard to be scary as heck, yet I don't feel any fear whatsoever or a ""oh dear lord"". There's also her beauty issue, which seriously ticks me off because nobody really cares about how beautiful she is. Yet every time, she always has to mention it or just be condescending overall. Not a very good character if you ask me.<br/><br/>Luna: Rock on dude stereotype: Everything she says is either ""dude"" or something along the lines of rock and roll. Any other good information you could provide Luna? You know, helpful ones or something that is on the topic. What really makes me feel uncomfortable is the fact that every single time they do something like cleaning up the house, they have her play music in the background. Which really got old real fast, just stop...please.<br/><br/>Lana: The engineer/Dirty stereotype: This one speaks for itself, she just does all the poop and unfunny gross jokes. That's enough to make me dislike her as a character as a whole.<br/><br/>Lori: My third most hated character. Lori is the stereotype of teenagers: texting and on the phone all the time. My main issue is her obsession with Bobby, like can we stop with that for *one* moment please? Why does every word you have to say have to mention either texting or Bobby. It's bland and gets real annoying real fast. Reminds me of Sakura from Naruto and her crush on Sasuke. Just makes me sigh and wonder what in the heck were they thinking when they made her. And finally...<br/><br/>Lilly: Bland, very annoying baby. She always cry whenever things don't go her way, she isn't cute: she annoys me because each time I see her on screen she either makes the other siblings lives miserable or just wants to be a pain for even the entire family. Just stop: cry sometimes, but not all the time whenever things don't go your way or throw a tantrum because Lincoln won't take you to the grocery store.
Bonus would be Clyde, because he's just a weirdo who has a crush on Lori.<br/><br/>Plot: Everything that had happened in the past, is just being reused over and over again. Take the butterfly effect for example, The Amazing World of Gumball and Spongebob already did that. Make your own ideas already. The other reason why the plot is bad is because Lincoln is 100% the butt of the jokes of things. He's portrayed as a coward almost *all the time* and gets easily scared by any of his siblings. I thought you were a man with a plan: why are you so scared of so many things?! It's incredible this gag is still going.<br/><br/>Anyway, watch anything else than this show...please do.",27 out of 43 found this helpful.,1.0,2 October 2018
274,The Loud House, Extremely Overrated,"The Loud House is, at best, decent. It has pleasant animation, and some of its characters are good, but it's not 'The savior of Nickelodeon,' as many people view it as. The worst thing about it is that it's boring; it's terribly predictable and most of its characters are one- dimensional stereotypes. <br/><br/>The worst thing about The Loud House are the episode plots. I liked a few, but the majority of its episodes are really predictable and unoriginal. The most notable example of this is the episode where Lincoln brings his class pet spider to his house to take care of him over the weekend, only remembering that his sister, Leni, has severe arachnophobia after he agrees to watch the spider. Skip to the end of the episode, and the exterminator is called to eradicate the spider, who is saved by Leni before he could be seriously harmed. Oh, and the spider turned out to be a pregnant female (which has been done before by SpongeBob). Most episodes follow an unoriginal plot like this. There's also a similar problem with the characters. Not Lincoln in particular, but his sisters. Most of them are really cliché. You've got the genius little girl, the dumb one, the goth, the overly-competitive one, the princess, and five more. I understand that with eleven characters to conceive and develop, it's hard to come up with amazing personalities, but they can't just have one defining trait (and the show focuses really heavily on the characters, so it's not as appealing if they aren't very good).<br/><br/>Overall, it's definitely not the worst show on Nickelodeon, but it cannot be considered Nickelodeon's crowning achievement. It's just really overrated.",33 out of 56 found this helpful.,4.0,1 August 2017
275,The Loud House, Absolutely not!,"This show in no way deserves the praise it's getting. It's unfunny, poorly drawn and animated, cheesy, bland, crass, stereotypical etc. The list could go on.<br/><br/>A good amount of characters are painfully stereotyped, and others just have almost no personality at all. They're unrealistically trying to fit all these stereotypes through 11 main characters. A good show needs to have limits on the amount of main characters it has. Like 2 or 4 character limit.<br/><br/>The animation doesn't match the art style. Period.<br/><br/>The humor is very lame and cringe-inducing.<br/><br/>Not to mention there's a lot of television shows, movies, and books this show could have (and seemingly did) ripped-off. The Brady Bunch should be a notable example. The plot line and genre are over-used and uncreative with each step.<br/><br/>I'd take a classic and nostalgic kid's show like Arthur. Unlike Chris Savino (Who has been accused more than several times of sexual misconduct.) Marc Brown is a lively and creative children's literature legend, who is not (and never will be) forgotten. Arthur is not all perfect either, but at least it is sophisticated and smart enough for a child's viewing.<br/><br/>Sadly, kids from this day and age will never know what a good cartoon really was back then.",35 out of 61 found this helpful.,1.0,15 January 2018

I didn't feel too excited about the first one,but I decided too persevere. I'm glad I did,things just kept getting better and better. I can relate to the Louds. I was an only child but my friend's family's had characters like these...really...even the goth girl! Most of my friend's had a lot of siblings too, with much of the same issues as Lincoln and his crew. They argued,worked it out and argued some more the next day,but,one thing was certain (just like ""the Louds) nobody else better not mess with them. They had each other's back and made it known. This show is ""just right"".I don't see how anyone could call the characters ""cliches"", as I noticed one user's review did.

278,The Loud House," The show is becoming too much to me, i don't like it anymore &gt;:(","You know when i watched the show since it aired on 2016, i expected to be another lame Nicktoon like Fanboy &amp; Chum Chum, Breadwinners, Sanjay and Craig, Spongebob Squarepants (no kidding, i always hated that show even seasons 1-3), and other worst shows that came out in the 2010s. But then it turned out to be the best Nicktoon ever made since i watched other Nicktoons i really liked such as of the earlier seasons of The Fairly OddParents, The Legend of Korra, TMNT 2012 and Harvey Beaks. The characters were likeable and relatable albeit with cliched personalities i see on other media, the voice acting is really great, good humor, and the animation style reminds me of the 90s and 2000s. My favorite characterd are Luna, Leni, Lana, Lily, Pop Pop, Sam, Rusty, Stella, Mr Grouse, Rita, Lynn Sr, and Ronnie Anne. It was great for me that the show is still running today and became the longest running Nicktoon that aired in the 2010s.<br/><br/>But then came a BIG problem in which the show started to go downhill by the 4th season-present. The episodes were repetitive and unoriginal that were done before with a bunch of recycling premise from seasons 1-3. Season 3 has the same problem but by the half due Savino firing. The characters became very dumb, unlikeable and unrealistic, except for Luna and Leni who were still great. And every episodes begins with the same formula over and over and over again: characters do something wrong or irresponsible, they gonna apologize and learning their lesson. The Lincoln-Clyde episodes are very toxic and unintersting to me and their friendship is very unreal. And every gags are really unrealistic that i'm not gonna mentioned which are. I realize after all these years watching this show, i made a huge mistake that this was the best show, but no. This the example of the gigantic cliche cartoon of all time an d i'm no longer gonna watch this show ever again, except for the episodes that are basically focuses around Luna, Lana, Lily and Leni. This show is bad next to Spongebob.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,4.0,2 November 2020
279,The Loud House, Used to be good,"It's either growing up or that the loud house actually has town downhill but I don't hold it in such a light anymore, especially since recipe for disaster. Firstly, I hate Lincoln's and Clyde's voice and there are a thousand plotholes within the writing, my main problem is the writing, in fact. especially game off, where the solution is basically what caused the problem at the beginning but because writing, lana just accepts it anyway. Secondly, the episode plots are rather cliché, like deep cuts (oh no our clubs are being cut) and when they aren't cliche, they are predictable. Predict ability: I figured out the entire plot of the episode after the part where Lincoln realizes he needs to change himself. Game off: after the part where lana gets introduced to the game. in fact, the plots are always the same. Someone wants something or to do something but then they realize that what they are doing is wrong. Around the end of season 3, the lessons become the same as before. Season 5 needs to be good and stop on this downward spiral cause my rating could drop any day now. I Used to hold the show to such high regard. The writing was smart and the characters could work with their personalities efficiently, but something died around the airing of kings of the con, and the rotting corpse only got worse around the middle of season 3 and the airing of predict ability and driving ambition.<br/><br/>EDIT: It got worse. The reason my rating doesnt drop though is because honestly, this is the way i hold it. I cant imagine rating it 3 or 4 out of 10. It had a brief good spell after Singled out but only from s4 episodes 18 through 20. And maybe 21b (room and hoard) but i just cant see anything else being good, especially sand hassles, and a dark and story night.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,3.0,9 May 2020

282,The Loud House, Really entertaining and enjoyable,"After giving us terrible shows after the other, this was a show they really needed! I have my own thought that any character can be good. Where I am going when I said that is that just because a character is stereotypical doesn't mean that they are a bad character. To me it determines on how said stereotyped is used and this show uses them well. I like how this show satires a whole lot of different people from the dumb blond to the comedic girl to the emo girl and etc. Every character has their own trait that portrays them but this show knows how to go deep into that trait. Almost every character is easily likable and I find the show as a whole really easy to enjoy. A great piece of work from Nickelodeon.",16 out of 26 found this helpful.,8.0,26 August 2016
283,The Loud House, Best Nickelodeon show since SpongeBob SquarePants,"This is definitely the best show on Nickelodeon that I have seen in a long time. I mean SpongeBob SquarePants has been going downhill since season 4 or 5 and I've gotten sick and tired of the Fairly Odd Parents. Well that show had some good episodes though so both Fairly Odd Parents and SpongeBob have seen better days. It's time start off with something fresh on Nickelodeon for a change and this is the show for me to watch and when I'm married and have kids I'm showing them this show too. The characters in this show are all great, especially that white haired boy Lincoln. I mean who has ever seen a kid with albino hair before? I even doubt that boys with white hair even exist lol. One of my favorite episodes of this show I believe is when the Loud family wanted to be in a fair talent show and in that episode Luna Loud the rock n roll girl of the family hears that her idol Mick Swagger was coming to town and she wanted to impress him by showing herself and the rest of the Loud family how talented they are, but she also knows that rock n roll wasn't about music. It was about having fun. That's what she learned from Mick Swagger. So when she tries to go solo after not being impressed with the Loud families music she tries to go solo until she meets a stranger who tells her the lesson she learned from Mick Swagger and she knew she had to make it up to the Loud family by letting them back in the band in time for the talent show. Also at the ending of the episode Luna discovers that the stranger she talked to in that restaurant was none other then Mick Swagger. After that Luna and the Loud families dad faint. lol. Yep this show is fantastic. Great characters, great story telling and great for this generation of kids watching Nickelodeon.",16 out of 26 found this helpful.,10.0,16 August 2016
284,The Loud House, Nickeloedeon is getting better again!!,"First, Harvey Beaks getting better. Then, later episodes of Spongebob getting back to their roots. And now this! This show proves that if Nickelodeon actually tried, they could be great. The creator of this show has worked on many of my childhood shows from Rocko's Modern Life to Kick Buttowski. And with this show being premiered only a month ago is already my brand new favorite show{......next to spongebob of course) Life with ten sisters must be crazy to handle. I have 4 siblings and they drive my to my boiling point. Aside from that they all have great personalities. You can relate to all of them on a personal level. Its also funny to see how Lincolns best friend Clyde likes the oldest(Lori)<br/><br/>All in all,this a great show, and for the love of god, PLEASE DON'T CANCEL THIS SHOW!!!<br/><br/>Keep up the good work!

285,The Loud House, Is this the end of the Dark Age?,"Wow. I mean wow. How is that even possible? First, Stephen Hillenburg returns to Spongebob, then Nick announces the cancellation of Breadwinners, now shows like Harvey Beaks and The Loud House? I mean, these 2 new shows have the good things about Nick in it! I'm doing The Loud House now, since it has bigger ratings. Unlike new Nick shows, it breaks the 4th wall, but in a good way, because Lincoln, the main character of the show, explains some of his problems, and solutions, to some of his, and his 10 sisters, adventures! Let me explain the good things about this show! 1: The voice acting really fits each sibling's personality, since each sibling DOES have a different one. 2: The animation has really smooth movements, and the characters were drawn out really well, with their emotions. At first, I thought the animation was like TTG, but until I remembered shows like Wonder over Yonder, and Kick Buttowski, which were great shows, compared to TTG. 3: The adventures of the show are pretty realistic, with some you probably ran into! 4: The jokes and gags in this show are actually kind of funny, while the gags are used frequently. One of the gags is that Leni acts kind of silly. 5: Yes, there is gross-out jokes, but at least they do them right! According to MrEnter, how gross-out humor works, is that it has to be the character is suffering of some sorts, but it doesn't when it's just there. But here, it's used right! Now, if you're reading this, I highly recommend this good show!",18 out of 30 found this helpful.,9.0,22 May 2016

287,The Loud House, Nickelodeon's HUGE Comeback,"This is easily a major comeback for Nickelodeon. In terms of animated series, they weren't doing so well before this show came along, but when it did, I was blown away by it. I can consider it to be one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon, and possibly one of the greatest modern cartoons of all time. I would most certainly recommend this show for those who are looking for great cartoons, because it's definitely one. Everything about it is not just unique, but incredibly creative, which is what brings this show to amazement. Honestly, I could find almost nothing wrong with this show. It is a must watch in my opinion, and Nickelodeon deserves a standing ovation for this masterpiece that returned them to greatness.",16 out of 28 found this helpful.,9.0,19 July 2016
288,The Loud House, This show is nothing less than AMAZING!,"I just want to say that this is my ALL-TIME FAVORITE SHOW. When I know there's a new episode, for the week I know about it I count down TO THE MINUTE until it airs.
I'm going to be honest, the first season I liked. The seasons after that, though, I LOVED and each new episode is better than the last. The first season I didn't like as much because it always seemed to shove some kind of moral or lesson at you at the end, and we only saw the characters as their interests--ex. Lynn is only viewed as the ""aggressive sporty one"", Lisa as the ""science-y one"", Luna as the ""cool rock-n-roller"", etc.
Now the characters are MUCH more lovable and relatable. Each one is complex with many different sides and emotions. With the same characters I listed above, we now see: Lynn has a soft side and is very loving inside, Lisa deeply cares for her family, and Luna is very true to herself and is a very good friend.
This is one of the few shows I've seen that actually has EMOTION in it, not just humor. If one of the characters is going through a tough time or decision (such as in ""Racing Hearts"" or ""Really Loud Music"", my favorite episodes by the way!), I can actually FEEL it with them. I've never cried at a movie or show, but I wouldn't be too surprised if this show finally breaks that streak. The writers are awesome with their work!
Another thing I love is how The Loud House is all-inclusive: for example, so far there are 4 characters who are revealed to be LGBT (I'm not going to specify who, since it might be a spoiler), a character with a disability, and people of all different races throughout the series. Not a lot of shows do that, and I feel that it's good for kids to be exposed to that kind of stuff. Funny how I'm saying that, as I'm only a newly-teenage girl myself . . . .
Overall, I just love the animation, writing, characters, and show itself. I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is even better than (the old) Spongebob. Don't worry, I love that show too :3. I would recommend this to anyone.",9 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,30 June 2019

290,The Loud House, Greatest Cartoon Since Gravity Falls!,"After Gravity Falls, I thought there was no other amazing shows for children. Well, I was wrong, The Loud House is an wonderful cartoon that came out summer 2016, and This is the best cartoon I've Enjoyed since Gravity Falls. This also is considered ""The Show That Saved Nick"" and I can say, yes, it is indeed the show that saved Nick, and the best Nick show on the air. <br/><br/>Story: <br/><br/>Lincoln Loud is an 11 year old boy who deals with the everyday life of his 10 sisters. <br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>*Character Development: Some People might think the characters are stereotypes. For Example, Lori can be seen as the Bossy Older Sibling who loves her Boyfriend or Luan can be seen as the prankster. While these are stereotypes, the show does well of having character to these sisters. Each Sister interacts with one another and you can remember their names real easily after the 1st or 2nd episode. My favorite characters are Luna and Luan. Luna because she has the same taste of music that I have (and makes some 60s/70s song references quite often) and Luan because her jokes are intentionally cheesy and not trying to be up in your face funny.<br/><br/>*Art Style: The art style gives me and countless others an Sunday newspaper vibe. I can consider this show to be the modern day Charlie Brown (Which the show does make references of) <br/><br/>*Heartwarming Themes: At the end of each episode, there is always an heartwarming lesson/theme. Unlike some recent cartoons where the main character and sibling hate each other and do like ""He did it!"" ""No She did it!"" ""Sisters are so girly"", Loud House actually has Lincoln Loud and his sisters learn some life lessons, which makes the show have realism. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>*Occasional Crap Jokes: While the show is outstanding, Nick still has Breadwinners fetish when it comes to putting crap jokes in their shows. While this show doesn't have that many compared to ""TTGO"" and ""Breadwinners"", the times where it does are unnecessary. There are some times rarely where an sister (Lori And Lynn) fart but it does it how an real life family would deal with it and it breaks the stereotype that ""Girls don't fart and are messy as boys"". <br/><br/>Conclusion: Overall, I love this show. It is an great show for kids and even teens/adults. It is the best cartoon I've seen since Gravity Falls because of it's Character Development, Art Style, Heartwarming Themes, and the list goes on and on. The only problem is the occasional Crap jokes. <br/><br/>Score: 10/10",13 out of 23 found this helpful.,10.0,16 February 2017

And the plots are entertaining. This is how Nick should be gone from now. The only negative thing I can say is the toilet humour, but they do it rarely which is great. As you watch the show you will get a strong relationship with these characters. And I'm sure that every fan has a favourite character. Another thing this show does right is that it never shows the parents face like every 90s show. I would recommend this show for any kid.",12 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,30 July 2016
293,The Loud House, The Loud house is helping and succeeding to resurrect Nick,"The Loud house is a savior on Nick. This and Harvey Beaks can save the network. For the initial review, I will be going over the plot and how it is well developed. (Initial plot, not really spoilers) So this show is about a boy and 10 girls in one house. This boy shows his everyday life story's with these sisters. Sounds like a cliché plot but it has really good episodes.(Some spoilers here) This show is pretty humorous, a kid named Clyde, the main characters friend is in love with the oldest sister and his nose bleeds when he sees her (like a lot) and she screams and runs away. It teaches morals to kids, has great humor, and each character is very well developed. The characters are getting into their back stories based on how they act due to their addiction to a certain thing such as sports or music. It does have little toilet humor (very generic type of humor) and the characters can act cliché sometime. But it can definitely save Nick from the dead with Harvey Beaks as a happy brother that likes to support his doings. The Loud House is a 9 for me +well developing characters +good morals +good humor<br/><br/>+some cliché moments and toilet humor",12 out of 21 found this helpful.,9.0,8 June 2016

The survival techniques and stunts used felt like something a normal mortal person have any chance to use.<br/><br/>The episode with Ben Stiller was genuinely funny.

295,Running Wild with Bear Grylls, Sharing an Adventure with Bear,"I suspect there are many who would like to go on an outdoor adventure with Bear Grylls, taking advantage of his experience and expertise. ""Running Wild"" allows the viewer to do that--from the comfort of his easy chair.<br/><br/>In the first episode I watched (from the second season), Kate Hudson--actress, dancer, and daughter of Goldie--accompanied Bear on a traverse of a pass in the Italian Dolomites. They climbed rocks, they hiked above the snowline, they passed through tunnels left over from WWII, and they rappelled beside a raging waterfall. They dined on available foods. They spent the night on pine boughs beside a comforting fire, taking time to discuss some deeper issues.<br/><br/>When it was over, Kate had experienced laughter, tears, and some moments of contemplation and insight. What more could you ask for? I think Bear likes to push his guests beyond their comfort zones. But he seems rather trustworthy in his exhaustive knowledge of techniques for negotiating risky situations. These are transformative experiences and it's fun to share them.<br/><br/>Update 7/29/15: After three episodes, it is clear that this show is even more than I thought it was. By sharing the triumphs of Bear's guests, the viewer is treated to elevating experiences. As the book says, ""Feel the Fear and do it Anyway"" and that principle is embodied by the show and its lesson is made real. I am increasing my grade to 9. Enjoyable and inspiring.",10 out of 15 found this helpful.,9.0,14 July 2015
296,Running Wild with Bear Grylls," Not quite as good as ""Man Vs. Wild""","Technically / visually it's almost its equal (photography / camerawork are still spectacular), and in terms of character it's more intimate and introspective. But it's also much slower-paced: if Bear alone faced, say, 10 challenges per episode, with a celebrity guest they face, say, 4. There is also one more problem: too much rappelling. It's thrilling to watch the first few times, but when every single episode has it (though I have missed a couple), it gets very repetitive. My favorite episode is probably the one with Vanessa Hudgens - she is extremely likable, and the ""screen running"" at the end makes for an exciting change-of-pace. Oustanding later episodes include those with the super-fit Keri Russell and Brie Larson. But the show seems to be heading in the wrong direction mid-season 5 (Bautista? Channing Tatum (again)? A professional rock climber???). For this concept at its freshest, see the ""Man Vs. Wild"" specials ""Fan Vs.

297,Running Wild with Bear Grylls, Bear Grylls is fabulous,"This is by far my favourite reality TV show. It's wonderful to see celebrities being so down to earth and such greats sports! (with the exception of Ben Stiller who whined the whole time ).
Bear is probably the most charismatic host you can find anywhere and is just so likeable, apart from having super human survival skills. It's great to see how comfortable he makes people feel and the way he gets his guests to share their vulnerabilities.
The show itself is edited beautifully. I particularly enjoyed the episodes with Zac Effron, Armie Hammer and Channing Tatum because they were so damn enthusiastic and sporting about everything. Kate Winslet was great. So authentic and just herself. In fact everyone on the show were really genuine, authentic and cool.

I am, however, aware of it and have seen bits and pieces of it over time. Even that little bit was more than too much. First of all, it doesn't take a genius to understand that Grylls and his guests are in no real danger and are NOT fighting for survival. If anything goes bad they have a full on support crew only feet away. They are not actually starving, cold or baking in the heat because all of those situations are remedied as soon as the director says ""cut'. So give us a break. However, I could care less about all of that. But ... how dare they go into wildlife habitat and intrude upon, hunt down, torture and kill creatures in their own territories. I just saw a clip from one episode where Grylls made a worm omelet, using live worms and tiny eggs stolen from a bird's nest. They actually mixed these worms in with the cracked eggs and held the cup near the fire, watching the worms writhe in pain as they burned up from the direct heat of the flames. Really???? If you want to demonstrate how to survive in the elements find a way to do it without maiming and murdering animals whose homes you have invaded. Why does NBC, Nat Geo or any reputable network air a program like this? Why are people watching? For entertainment? Hope you're taking good notes because if you really find yourself lost in the woods you won't have a back-up team at the ready on stand-by like fake Grylls does.",0 out of 3 found this helpful.,,4 April 2021

She has the knowledge of a professional comedian. She is just one of the best actors (to me) in the world. I read and interview on her on the internet, and she has no need to retire. She says ""Retirment, hmmmmmmm..........Rubbish it is. Can't even spell the word"" quite frankly, with her skills, I am with her 100%. Clive Swift is another great actor, but also 7 years younger then her, still has a bit of acting skills to catch up on her. Josephine Tewson, another fabulous actor, plays the timid neighbor, Elizabeth. Every time she 'pops in' for a cup of tea or coffee, she ends up spilling something or breaking on of Hyacinths porcelain cups! All the actors on Keeping Up Appearances are great, and should start to think about making another series. WELL DONE!!!",46 out of 47 found this helpful.,,17 June 2005
312,Keeping Up Appearances, Funnier than America's current sitcoms,"My wife and I discovered ""Keeping up appearances"" several years ago on PBS and we've been hooked ever since. As many times as we watch it, we never tire of Hyacinth's relentless efforts to climb the social latter within the backdrop of her less-than-classy family. KUA is certainly funnier than any sitcom produced in America today. The humor is an excellent mixture of traditional brit, old-fashioned slapstick and numerous sight gags and with facial expressions that are often more telling than dialogue. Patricia Routledge is the greatest comedic actress since Lucille Ball and couldn't possibly be more realistic in this hilarious role. She and her supporting cast lend such an element of realism to the show, one is almost tempted to look outside to see if they may be lurking next door! kudos and cheers to the Brits for this classic.",69 out of 72 found this helpful.,,12 July 2005
313,Keeping Up Appearances, excellent British comedy,"The dry humour of the Brits has no problem mixing up the slapstick in Keeping Up Appearances, a delicious series poking fun at the social graces of upper crust English society in the eyes of a lowly middle-class British wife.<br/><br/>  Patricia Routledge can't be more perfect as Hyacinth Bucket, the charming and altogether frightening definition of an English lady, despite her mediocre financial status.  The series follows her incessant efforts to make a name for herself as a social elite, inviting neighbors and important townsfolk over for ""candlelight suppers,"" among other social events she so daftly names.  Of course, the whole Hyacinth image wouldn't be nearly as funny unless the hysterical supporting cast weren't there to ground Mrs. Bucket (pronounced ""Bouquet"") in her place.  Her working class sisters, the hussy Rose and the meek Daisy are perfect as Hyacinth's inescapable link to mediocrity.  The image is complete with Daisy's slob of a husband Onslo, who dispenses his frank advice with racous results.  Rounding up the innocent bystanders of Hyacinth's misadventures are her nervous neighbor Elizabeth and her brother Emmitt, but most of all Hyacinth's whipped yet sardonic husband, Richard, whom you can't help but pity and root for at the same time.<br/><br/>This is a British comedy to end all comedies.  The chances for conflict between Hyacinth's goal as a social mistress and her bourgeois reality are infinite, and the laugh track doesn't lie when Hyacinth is caught between a rock and a hard place - more often literally than figuratively.  If you aren't a fan of Brit comedy, you may only be able to stomach a few episodes before the formula seems to wear.  However, a true social connoiseur of such a series would scoff at the idea.  :-)",76 out of 81 found this helpful.,,22 July 2003
314,Keeping Up Appearances, Hyacinth inisist's that all things be simply the best &amp; her show IS!,"All words fail to adequately describe our Hyacinth.  To say she is a totally consumed, self important, myopic  social climber is to be meek in one's definition.  But our Hyacinth is also sweet in her own odd way.  Hyacinth honestly wants to do good by and for all but she just wants to be seen be all the right people while in the midst of doing it.  Her friends love her despite the fact that Hyacinth requires her friends to be long suffering and, selfless in their love of her.  Hyacinth's son Sheridan who is suspected to be totally gay to everyone but her while off at University calls home constantly to his doting mommy and cash cow dad.  She makes the post man, the power &amp; light dude, tradesmen, heck all visitors to her home go through tons of changes like remove their shoes at the door.  Hyacinth was just like my mother so I love her.  Hyacinths family was awesome ranging from her one sister whose husband is a cross dressing turf accountant to Daisy  whose husband is a Big bone idle man with a great heart and, a car thats s joke.<br/><br/>This is a awesome show from the UK and, the best imported show we here in the US have ever been graced with.

My parents have always been fans of the show from day one and initially I didn't think the idea of a snobbish housewife driving her husband crazy being all that funny. Back then Mr. Bean was the only BritCom I liked, but when I saw my first episode of this classic comedy, I became hooked. <br/><br/>Everyone is fantastic for their roles, especially Patricia Routledge as Hyacinth Bouquet.

316,Keeping Up Appearances, One of the BEST British comedy's ever made!,"Keeping Up Appearances has got to be one of my favourite shows EVER!<br/><br/>I remember watching it years ago when it was first on BBC1, and thinking it was SOOO funny! Now it's back on UK Gold, and I can't help but watch it every time it's on.<br/><br/>Patrcia Routledge as Hyacinth is fantastic! The casting and acting are perfect. OK, as some people have pointed out, there are so many running jokes - but that is what is all part of what makes this show great!<br/><br/>Hyacinth's candlelight suppers, her answering the phone ""the Bucket residence, the lady of the house speaking!"", Elizabth constantly spilling her coffee, always trying to resist her daily order from Hyacinth for morning coffee, Emmett and ""she'll sing at me"", Onslow ""Oh Nice"", Vilot - ""It's MA Sister Violet, ""Daddy!"", the vicar, Rose and Mr. whoever, and throughout all this poor old Richard, lol.<br/><br/>And one of the best and most famous Hyacinth lines - ""Sauna, Swimming Pool and room for a pony!!!!""<br/><br/>It is a true proper British comedy, and is up there with the likes of that other great 90's BBC sitcom - One Foot in the Grave. And also the likes of To The Manor Born, The Good Life, and Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em.<br/><br/>Everybody you talk to always raises a smile when you mention ""the Bucket woman""! <br/><br/>Only the other day I watched an episode when Hyacinth wanted to test drive a new Rolls Royce so she could get one-up on another one of her posh local rivals - Lydia Hawsworth, whom had just overtaken them in her brand new Jag.<br/><br/>She made Richard drive it out of the garage without the salesman's permission, and take it to this posh hotel deliberately, as she knew this was where this woman had afternoon tea. Of course Rose, Daisy and Onslow turn up as usual, so they have to get out of there before she bumps into them - how embarrassing! lol. When they get into her ""getaway car"" as she callas it to Richard, the police turn up and arrest them outside the hotel! And then just at that point who turns up but Lydia Hawksworth!<br/><br/>This is just an example of how great this show is!<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I really don't understand how anybody could NOT like it! <br/><br/>If they don't, then I actually feel slightly sorry for them - as they are missing out on so much enjoyment!<br/><br/>Oh...and contrary to what somebody has said - in my opinion it is just about the closest thing to perfection that a sitcom can get!",36 out of 41 found this helpful.,,15 June 2004

318,Keeping Up Appearances, Fantastic!,"This show is truly hilarious with its superb writing, excellent physical comedy and biting wit! Although Routledge lights up the screen with her portrayal of class-conscious Hyacinth, she is well supported by a varied and talented supporting cast. From Violet (the sister with a Mercedes and room for a pony) to library-book reading Daisy, the cast provides non-stop laughter and storylines that keep you watching to discover the next crazy twist. Hyacinth's flamboyant snobbery and utter self-absorption is an excellent contrast to her straight, resigned husband Richard. The running jokes 'Appearances' provides keep you laughing from the theme song to the closing credits. You will tune in for each episode to witness another round of Rose's declarations of love, Hyacinth's worries about whether the post will realize she is of a social standing that should only receive FIRST class mail, Sheridan's requests of money and avoidance of women (reportedly because Mummy asks - not because of his dubious interests!) and Elizabeth's inevitable break of china or spill of tea.

Geoffry Hughes is great as Onslow, who plays Hyacinth's slob brother-in-law who can care less about every and anything. And then there is Daisy, his desperate wife and Hyacinth's sister, who is desperate to get Onslow to show some interest in her. And then there is the man crazy sister Rose (Mary Millar) who will do anything to get a man and to swear off them of them as well (including donating her undies to Charity.) And, of course, there's Hyacinth's poor suffering husband Richard and her neighbor, Elizabeth, who is so nervous in Hyacinth's presence that she continually breaks Hyacinth's Periwinkle China every time she is asked (forced to)come to tea.

321,Keeping Up Appearances," Quick Richard, it might be someone important!","Definitely one of my favourite sitcoms, Keeping up appearances is funny because of it's characters rather than its jokes. <br/><br/>Hyacinth Bucket (Pronounced Bou-kay) is a middle class snob who lives with her long suffering husband Richard. Patricia Routledge is perfectly cast as Hyacinth and really makes the part her own, her facial expressions are hilarious, especially when she blinks her eyes erratically when something catastrophic has happened (Mainly her brother in law Onslow in a dirty vest) and she loves to sing.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are crucial to make Hyacinth appear even worse, she annoys them like mad but they can't tell her how they feel, she never listens. sister Daisy and bro in law Onslow are the opposite of Hyacinth, slobby and lazy and her sister Rose in her hotpants loves all the men in the area.<br/><br/>Elizabeth and her brother Emmet are the terrified next door neighbours, Elizabeth can't be in Hyacinth's company without breaking the bone china and Emmet will do anything to avoid Mrs. Bou-kay.<br/><br/>As he puts it:<br/><br/>""She'll sing at me""<br/><br/>I also like the local vicar (The one Hyacinth dies to impress) he calls her the bucket woman!<br/><br/>This programme is a simple idea that works, it doesn't give us weeks of wonderful, trivial plot lines, it's pretty much the same; Hyacinth tries to impress someone important but her plans ate thwarted by her Daddy or Daisy or Onslow, but this is why it's funny. People are the same as they were last week and the more we watch the character's eccentricities the more we grow to love them. it's great to see how Hyacinth will react in the situations she's placed in.<br/><br/>Overall it never lost its spark and even though it finished a while back it still brings a smile to my face.",14 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,7 May 2007
322,Keeping Up Appearances, Fun With The English Class System!,"Hyacinth Bucket was a first class snob and a great eccentric.

Why did long-suffering husband Richard and neighbours Liz and Emmett put up with Hyacinth? Wherever she went, she caused chaos in her endless pursuit of a refined and elegant existence.<br/><br/>This is the most English of comedies: on the island of Britain, no nation takes class more seriously than England - and this series also demonstrates the wonderful ability of the English to laugh at their own peculiarities.<br/><br/>A wonderful series - and one of the last truly great English sitcoms.",13 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,9 February 2008

Yes, it's formulaic but it's still uproariously funny. Definitely one of the bests sit-coms I've ever seen. Patricia Rutledge's portrayal of Hyacinch Bucket (pronounced Bouquet) is hysterical and Clive Swift is terrific in his portrayal of her long suffering husband.

326,Keeping Up Appearances, Brit-Com's Self-Appointed First Lady of Taste and Substance,"Never before has there been a middle class English housewife so determined to climb the social ladder (or at least appear to). Constantly on the look-out for opportunities to rub elbows with the ""socially desirable"" upper crust, Hyacinth Bucket (pronounced BOU-QUET) always manages to utterly embarrass herself in the process. This set of 4 DVDs features more of the hilarious adventures of Hyacinth and the family and ""friends"" who put up with her obnoxiously ""uppity"" demeanor. Whether pretending to plan a ""very expensive"" trip or entertaining eccentric millionaires (who could pass for vagabonds judging by their attire), Hyacinth never passes up a chance to show how superior she is to all of those ""wanna-be's"" out there.<br/><br/>Supporting cast includes faithful (and long suffering) husband Richard, 3 sisters (of various social standings and emotional stability) and their husbands/gentleman-friends, ever-nervous next-door neighbors Elizabeth (whose husband is permanently on business trips) and her brother Emmett (who is happily divorced, now concentrating on his work as small-time music director at local functions). The sister's ""Daddy"" makes occasional appearances as dementia-ridden old man who is known for his flair to suddenly disappear. The oft-discussed and frequently telephoning ""Sheridan"" (Hyacinth's pride and joy son who is off at University studying needle-work and related arts and crafts and enjoys asking for regular hand-outs from his Mummy and Daddy) is actually never seen, assuring that any actual person would be a disappointment after hearing all of the colorful stories about ""My Sheridan"".<br/><br/>This is Brit-Coms at their very best!

328,Keeping Up Appearances, This is Britain's Best EVER!,"Keeping Up Appearances has always been a personal favorite of mine. It has everything a good comedy needs: catch phrases, good stories, classic plots, extraordinary characters,... The actors are all first class and especially Patricia Routledge, who plays Hyacinth, is outstanding. I mean, has an actress ever been so good in playing her role? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The series also have a 'happy atmosphere' around them. From the first minute, when you see Hyacinth appear dusting her books, it almost makes you laugh immediately. She can say 'The Bouquet Residence, Lady of the house speaking' 1000 times, it still makes you laugh. And apart from those many catch phrases and some predictable stories it feels so 'real'. They drink real coffee, when she cleans her thee pot it is actually filled with real hot water, ... I bet thousands of people have such a neighbor like Hyacinth.<br/><br/>This is the only good comedy of the '90, absolutely. Brilliant television filled with all sorts of comedy: dry, subtle, physical,... They can make as many sitcoms as they want, not any will ever come near 'Keeping Up Appearances'.

329,Keeping Up Appearances, Origin of Pat Routledge's portrayal,"Today I woke early and caught a section of the Bette Davis movie, Watch on the Rhine made in 1943. The segment I watched did not even have Bette Davis but what struck me profoundly and immediately was the character named Fanny Farrelly played by Lucille Watson (born 27 May 1879 Québec, Canada - died 24 June 1962, New York). I don't recall ever seeing her before in any film, but, in this one, it was apparent that her portrayal of Fanny was the inspiration Patricia Routledge took for the character Hyacinth. The behavior and expressions were so similar, I first thought that it must be Patricia in this role, but I knew that it was made in 1943, so it was impossible for it to be her. I would love to see the entire movie, but, will have to wait to find it on again. Anyone who is a fan of Keep Up Appearances would get a kick out of seeing this film just to see this woman! The only difference was that Fanny had no obsession with how things ""appeared"" to other people. But the facial expressions and even the voice are astonishingly similar to Patricia's portrayal of Hyacinth. I would love to know if anyone else has ever seen this film. Also would love to find out from Pat herself if this film inspired her, but don't know any way of contacting her.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,,1 April 2006
330,Keeping Up Appearances, And all Richard wanted was a quiet life . . .,"Poor Richard Bucket. You know what he thinks of his home life right at the start of the series. Now old enough to retire, the long-suffering husband of the woman who makes such a show of her ""Royal Doulton with the hand-painted periwinkles"" would get on his knees and clean the carpets in his old workplace if it meant he could spend more time away from Hyacinth.<br/><br/>Hyacinth Bucket (""that's Bouquet . . . B-U-C-K-E-T"") is a woman possessed. She'll stop at nothing to propel herself up the social ladder. She'll spend the weekend in a country cottage that isn't big enough to turn around in if it makes her look a bit more upwardly mobile. What with the unseen Sheridan constantly on the phone for more money that his father can't afford to give him or bothering Elizabeth next door to join her for coffee in ten minutes, Hyacinth certainly has her life worked out. And everyone else's, for that matter. <br/><br/>What I particularly like is everything that holds Hyacinth back. Her sister Violet has a swimming pool, sauna and room for a pony (I've seen Keeping Up Appearances so many times I can rattle that one off without thinking) and a cross-dressing husband named Bruce. Her other sister Rose is possibly two steps away from being a prostitute - she's always got at least three men on the go and doesn't know what to do with any of them - and lives in what Hyacinth would consider squalor with the fourth sister, Daisy, and Daisy's carefree slob of a husband Onslow. I always love it when Daisy tries to get a bit romantic with Onslow and he just thinks she's mad.<br/><br/>At least Violet and Bruce, and Daisy and Rose and Onslow have the compensation of living far away from Hyacinth. Poor Elizabeth next door has had her nerves shattered by Hyacinth's glass-shattering voice (which has often led poor Liz to shatter several dozen pieces of Hyacinth's crockery) and her brother Emmet vents his frustration out on his piano. One wonderful scene when Hyacinth volunteers to help at the church hall sees Richard, Onslow, Emmet and Michael the Vicar hiding in the basement in the dark as they try to fix the electrics. Everyone needs a place to hide from Hyacinth.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,13 February 2006

The show isn't as well known in the States, although it does get some broadcast over the weekend on PBS.<br/><br/>Essentially the show is about a woman named Hyacinth who is like Patrick Bateman from ""American Psycho"" on a less psychopathic scale - all she worries about are the material things: social status, clothing, items, upkeep of her home, etc.<br/><br/>Her husband Richard (Clive Swift) puts up with all her belittlement. Swift is one of the great comedians of the 1990s for providing the performances he did in this show; he compliments it so nicely.<br/><br/>Routledge, known to the UK public as a drama actress, managed to provide her audience with comedy in 1990 and the result was an instant classic. Her role, Hyacinth Bucket (""Bouquet!""), shall never be forgotten.<br/><br/>It's also worth mentioning Jeoffrey Hughes as Hyacinth's brother-in-law, who plays a lovable slob whom Hyacinth hates.<br/><br/>This show will make you laugh and care for the characters.

She is so proud of him and his achievements but is forever missing the signs that he is doing a drama and arts course and living with another man. Hilarious! Hyacinth's ever so hard efforts to climb the social ladder are so funny. Each and every episode she is trying to better herself and her long-loving and long-suffering husband, Richard.<br/><br/>The essence of the programme is how different from Hyacinth her two sisters are.

From their old Ford Cortina parked on the driveway on bricks, with a dog on the back seat to Rose's new man, Hyacinth is forever worried about what the upper classes will think of her.<br/><br/>Excellent script writing makes the on-screen chemistry between Hyacinth and her family truly remarkable.

I make a point of re-watching it at least once per year, and it has been a staple in my TV diet since I was an adolescent. (I'm 33 Now).<br/><br/>Some people, particularly those not fond of British Class-based humour may find it dull and boring, but for those of us that love this style of comedy this is the epitome of entertainment.<br/><br/>To say I love the show would be a severe understatement, and I don't make this claim lightly - if a show is bad, I say so - this isn't - it's brilliantly written and performed with perfect comic timing.<br/><br/>The only downside is there just isn't enough episodes - because for me, even if there was 1000 I don't think I could ever grow tired of ""The Bucket Woman's"" antics.<br/><br/>Patricia Routledge and Clive Swift are amazing actors and the supporting cast do more than provide justice for this ranking as absolute all-time number one.<br/><br/>Now if you don't mind, I must go and answer my phone...it'll be my Sheridan of course...I can tell by the psychic pain between my shoulder blades :p",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,24 April 2019
335,Taggart, The second best TV-show in the world - and the best in the detective genre,"Probably the best detective-show in the world, it is even better than ""Rejseholdet"". The very best thing about Taggart is probably that you never know who the criminal is until 5 minutes before the credits, so it is intensely thrilling to the very last minute. Another remarkable feature is the constant focus on the personality of the men and women of the Maryhill police, they never end up as boring detective-robots, the show even allows their personal troubles to play a part in the plot. Another thing I like about Taggart is the way that twice (in the parts, I've watched) they borrow the outlines of another story - ex. Treasure Island by R.L. Stevenson. It adds a unique taste to the plot and makes you wonder, whether the Taggart-plot will end similar to the plot in the other story, but it never does.

336,Taggart," Scotland's great contribution to the ""Tv 'Tec"" show.","Taggart is now officially the longest running cop show on British T.V. and indeed has been on for 3/4 of my lifetime. There are several reasons for its longevity but surely the main one is the underlying grim humour that enhances every episode. While it was undoubtedly at it's peak in the Mark ""there's been a muurder"" McManus years, it has recently returned to peak form with the introduction Alec Norton as the ""heid man."" Norton combines McManus's tough demeanor with an acting ability that outweighs his predecessor. But then McManus didn't need to be an Al Pacino, he WAS the character, dour and caustic. The other characters always provided a little colour along with occasionally convoluted personal lives. However the real star in Taggart was always Glasgow. while Glasgow has changed greatly since the '80's the city's character and natural humour always shines through. The title song puts it that ""this is no mean town, this is no mean city"", well it's obviously a mean enough city to sustain a 22 year murder series without ever really seeming unbelievable like the village of ""Midsomer Murder"" which has a body count higher than New York's!

With Taggart, we are barely given a chance to come up with a suspect for one murder and suddenly someone else has copped it and throws a spanner in the works. Excellent show.",25 out of 27 found this helpful.,,18 December 1999
338,Taggart, Excellent home-grown detective drama,"Over the years, I've grown weary for the depressing drudge that British television companies churn out and have turned to American imports for entertainment. However, never once have I tired of watching a 'Taggart' episode as it's a show that's never been less that great.<br/><br/>Set in Glasgow, the shows sees Maryhill CID investigating the various homicide cases that cross their desks. The team was initially headed by DCI Jim Taggart (played by Mark McManus) with Mike Jardine and Jackie Reid as his underlings but, after McManus' death in 1994, Jardine took command which, in turn, passed onto DCI Matt Burke whose character is much like an incarnate of Taggart.<br/><br/>'Taggart' excels because the story lines are intriguing, continually leaving viewers guessing over the murderer's identity right to the end of the episode, and the characters are solid and engaging without unnecessarily delving deep into their personal lives (many detective and medical shows have been ruined by focusing too much on the characters' love lives and their sad, pathetic childhoods). There is also the dry Glasgow wit that provides an injection of humour to the show as, after all, there can't be many programmes out there where people are referred to as 'tinkies', 'baldie' or 'deid'! It's no surprise this is Britain's longest-running detective show and it's the strength of 'Taggart' that saw it survive after Mark McManus' death and, subsequently, the death of the title character. Long may it continue!",21 out of 23 found this helpful.,8.0,1 October 2006
339,Taggart," ""There's a deid boady in Maryhill, Jean !""","Taggart is total murder fantasy land.Lord knows what the body count is for all the series but it must be substantial.It is usually written to a formula of a whodunnit with one grisly murder following another before the killer is revealed(usually predictable). Mark McManus, who played the part of Jim Taggart up until his untimely death,was quite remarkable. He must have been one of the stiffest actors ever, more wooden than a Californian Redwood. Ironically though, he was perfect for the part of the gruff detective with no time for small talk. The show and its formula became such a brand that it kept the name even after McManus and the character of Taggart both passed away.Every possible angle in the twilight world of homicide seems to have been covered but still they manage to come up with different stories though these are appearing more laboured in recent years despite being superb entertainment. So Taggart continues. Who could imagine Kojak without Kojak or Columbo without Columbo ? As long as there are murders in Maryhill Taggart's old colleagues will have a place.",23 out of 26 found this helpful.,,10 October 2000
340,Taggart, Jim Taggart's City,"When it was first broadcast all those years ago in 1983, as a mini-series named Killer, Glasgow was very much a city of ship building, heavy engineering and manufacturing - most of which for various reasons was in terminal decline.<br/><br/>Killer caught the character of that city that is now long gone - the cranes, dingy streets, sawdust pubs, old tenements and schemes - and that's been the one constant in Taggart. The evolving face of the city of Glasgow...and it's implicable, unchanging, nature.<br/><br/>The late Mark McManus - in a first rate performance - perfectly eptimisoed the lead character and his city - hard drinking, hard bitten, tough and laconic; yet possessing a dry humour, savviness and a very real decency. In his obituary McManus was described as a sensitive, intelligent man a world away from the character - and as fondly regarded as he was by many Glaswegians, fame did not come easily to McManus. Very sadly, his association with the role led to some verbal abuse and physical harassment. Towards the end of his life he went through a series of difficult breavements.<br/><br/>The other lead player was always Glasgow. It's fascinating watching the evolution of Glasgow over the course of each season. Perhaps my favourite episode was 'Root of Evil' set against the backdrop of debt collectors, Morningside (in Edinburgh) and the immensely popular but now almost forgotten 1988 Garden Festival. It was great stuff...as was 'Evil Eye', ' Flesh and Blood', 'Double Jeopardy' and 'Hostile Witness'.<br/><br/>Also noteworthy was the guest appearances and cameos. Alan Cumming, Robert Carlyle, Diane Keen, John Hannah, Jill Gascoigne and Celia Imrie - very striking as a gangster's moll - all made welcome appearances.<br/><br/>Taggart was more than just a hard copper. Inspired from Glasgow's literature, particularly William McIlvanney's subtle, underrated Laidlaw series - another detective with many of Taggart's characteristics. Any coincidence that the theme song was 'No Mean City'?<br/><br/>In short the McManus era is definitely a worthwhile watch. It's currently playing on UK Drama - I certainly catch it when I can.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,9 February 2020
341,Taggart, One of the best.,"It's several years now since Taggart ended, and it's still a great watch. It spanned many years, and had different phases, in my opinion the early years with Mark McManus were the best, the dark, gritty writing, coupled with the charisma of the original Detective are a winning combination. I enjoyed the later years also, but wish they'd stuck with the longer running times, the character development in the earlier years was tremendous.<br/><br/>Some wonderful episodes over the years, my personal favourite Death Call had all of the elements, drama, crazed killers and a complex story, but there were many classics, Nest of Vipers, A Death Foretold and Gingerbread, I could go on, there were many.<br/><br/>Many wonderful guest and regular performances over the years, Blythe Duff shone over the years, she was the glue that held it all together, when she was given great material she performed amazingly.<br/><br/>It did seem to end at the right time, the last series was poor, particularly when compared to episodes from the show's glory years. I think it's still the longest running Detective series, will Midsomer Murders overtake it?<br/><br/>I love the accents, landscapes and views of Scotland.<br/><br/>Excellent series 9/10",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,24 January 2020

I loved the fact that his boss Detective Chief Superintendent McVitie was know as ' The Biscuit' Taggart was replaced by his protégé Michael Jardine who was nothing like a Detective I have ever seen. The present incumbent, Matt Burke is more in the Jim Taggart mode. For the past 15 years the female lead has been Blythe Duff. More recent additions have been DI Robbie Ross and DC Stuart Fraser.

But if you want a gritty, sombre murder mystery with totally original ideas, Taggart is perfect for you. Such a shame that Mark McManus died during the series' very successful run, though Alex Norton does do a competent job as DCI Burke. Blythe Duff is a very talented actress, and John Michie and Colin McCredie do a credible job also. The episodes are sometimes brutal, but always gritty and tense. Although I am more familiar with the more recent episodes, I wish there were more repeats of the earlier ones with McManus.

349,Taggart, Good procedural but I'm tired of neurotic abusive law-breaking cops/Detectives,"H*L* is only offering seasons 18-27, so I can only speak to the show in that season range. So far I've watched seasons 18-20, I will update my review if necessary as I watch: While dated, it held up well enough as a police procedural. Dialogue and production values are decent enough considering it was filmed in the early 2000s. I generally like British television. The cases and the characters tend to be more ""real"" than the Hollywood versions, and for the most part this is true of Taggart as well---HOWEVER: My biggest gripe with the series is that the tension is artificially generated by the impulsive and often aggressive actions of apparently unstable major characters. This is just lazy writing as the cases, suspects and police sleuthing should be--and ARE interesting enough to carry the show without this added nonsense. Basically I'm just tired of this all too common characterization of any police force--American or British. It's ridiculous and frankly insulting to the viewer. <br/><br/>Neither cops or detectives should be shown as being justified in breaking the law to ""solve"" a case--or abusing suspects. The one thing THIS show did right was to make it clear that these officers do actually make mistakes when they are ""sure"" they know who is guilty--AND they do (mostly) suffer the consequences of their actions. That raised my score considerably. <br/><br/>The characters also repeatedly make the point that they have procedures for good reason, and it raises sometimes dire questions (and consequences) when those procedures aren't followed. <br/><br/>But--I absolutely HATE how often the major character YELLS at his subordinates. He's rude and a bully. How would a person like that ever be in a sustained leadership position? He also likes to break the rules--in a ""Do as I say, not as I do"" fashion--which is completely unfair and ridiculous. Again, how could someone like this keep his job???? <br/><br/>I do like that they sometimes show the team as disliking this aspect of their boss, but all too often they wind up defending indefensible behavior. It's so unnecessary! I really, really hope that this particular character doesn't stick around--or that his character arc has him ""growing"" out of it.<br/><br/>Overall the stories are interesting and the dialogue and the acting are decent. If they cut out the neurotic and abusive nonsense by the main characters this would be a terrific show.",3 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,29 April 2018

351,Taggart," Greatest English'', crime-television show ever.","Scottish detective television programmer, created by Glenn Chandler (who has written many of the episodes), and made by SMG Productions (STV) for the ITV network. Taggart is a Glaswegian detective television programmer, originally set and filmed in the area of Maryhill police station in Glasgow, Scotland, but is internationally famous and is now translated into many languages including Dutch, French and Japanese. The series revolves around a group of detectives in the Maryhill CID of Strathclyde Police. It is the world's longest continually running police drama,[1] although ""Woodentop"", the one-off drama that later served as a the pilot for another ITV police drama, The Bill, aired one month before the first episode of Taggart.<br/><br/>The Scottish English and Glasgow Patter used by the characters in the show has been the subject of a number of skits. The 1980's BBC Scotland comedy series Naked Video regularly featured a series of 'Taggart' sketches in which Tony Roper portrayed Mark McManus/Jim Taggart complete with his ""There's been a murder!"" catchphrase pronounced with an extremely thick Glaswegian accent rolling the 'r' in murder. There is also a Tennents lager advert where CG-animated pints of Tennents play Taggart characters.

359,Nurse Jackie," Outspoken. Raw and visually revealing blended with laughs, yet at the same time it's touching and emotional.","I must say give a big thumbs up for the new hit Showtime series ""Nurse Jackie"" which features one of the best and most hard working TV actresses around Edie Falco. Unlike Edie's award winning days as Carmela Soprano the elegant and naive mob housewife on HBO's ""The Sopranos"" this time her character is more blue collar yet she still has a dark nature to her no matter how caring she is. Edie is Jackie Peyton a nurse who charms and lights it up in this dark natured and raw funny comedy series one of the better made for TV in a long time.<br/><br/>Jackie is tough and outspoken and tells the doctors like it is in the ER she certainly has a caring heart for all patients. Yet she's hardly a saint her life and work doesn't come without problems for one she's trying to cope with a bad back that gives her chronic pain. This problem has lead her to become a pill popping and snorting addict which the scenes vividly display. Also she's having a bump and grind love affair with the hospital pharmacist(Paul Schulze)who's also her pill provider. Also the drama is always at an interesting and tense pacing while she deals with Dr. Cooper(Peter Facinelli)who's a cocky young hotshot who thinks he knows it all. Plus juggling a friendship with a gay nurse and fellow co worker Mo-Mo(Haaz Sleiman)as with most jobs she also puts up with a wicked witch of a supervisor who's watches her every move and turn while she trains up and coming nurses. And to top all that off she has her marriage to manage with hubby(Dominic Fumusa)and plus raise her two daughters.<br/><br/>So that sounds like some interesting stuff for the goings and happenings of a New York city hospital and it shows that this is one nurse with a complex and mixed up life. As always Falco shines and the supporting cast blends in well, it looks like Showtime has found another winner for a TV series. This is one drama that shows the pains and drama stress of real life and it shows how it's connected with work life something that many can relate to.

361,Nurse Jackie, Disappointing toward the end.,"I watched the first five seasons on cable and watched the last two on Netflix. I am a registered nurse (for 39+ yrs). I was a huge fan of the show's initial seasons. I had great hopes for it. <br/><br/>I give the series high marks for realism, with the exception of Jackie's ability to be a super clinician when high. I worked with impaired nurses throughout my career. I have been manipulated, used and lied to. I have been set up. I have had to fire a nursing aide for coming to work drunk in a hospice for a night shift. I have been Thor, Zoe and Akalitus. Their roles are painfully accurate beyond description.<br/><br/>The performances are five-stars throughout. I could go on and on about individuals but I think giving everyone an A+ in the ensemble is as big a compliment as I can give. <br/><br/>My major disappointment is with the writing. The humor and repartee of the earlier seasons were the perfect counterpoints to Jackie's selfish depravity. In fact, when I have worked with impaired nurses, the atmosphere tended to be just that. Some impaired nurses are masters of distraction by way of entertainment. They hook their coworkers on the drugged personality, not so much on the quality of the nursing. I think the ending of the series would have much more effective if the train had bustled along those quick-witted rails with less kudos for Jackie's nursing expertise. In fact, it would have been truer to life if she had gradually screwed up more often on the job.",13 out of 16 found this helpful.,6.0,6 January 2016
362,Nurse Jackie," Fantastic show, unusual, progressive and realistically representative.","I will admit, I didn't have much hopes for this show, due to my own ingrained prejudices. Halfway through season one, I was hooked and now I genuinely think it is one of the best shows I have seen (nothing will ever quite match up to The Wire however). This show is SO funny, dark, serious and perfectly blends gritty drama with laugh out loud comedy. <br/><br/>It is an important show for me for many reasons, Nurse Jackie, played by Edie Falco (incredible) is the first female protagonist I have seen in a while who isn't incredibly hot and 2 dimensionally fleshed out as a character. She is attractive but regular, and most importantly flawed. She is a real woman, a sort of anti-hero. She compares to typical protagonists like Tony Soprano, Walter White and Jimmy McNulty, but is female and it is so refreshing to see realistic representations of women on screen, (along with the support cast). <br/><br/>I've watched it all now, and I can say she does some despicable things, and we get to learn how she works which makes you squirm, but she also does amazing things for her patients. She's an addict. <br/><br/>For me this show wins out on it's portrayal of women as real people with real lives and personalities, and real/representative faces and bodies. Men are also portrayed well, with screen time showing them concerned with their futures as husbands/fathers as well as their careers. This show does really well to subvert the patriarchal traditional stereotype of how we see women and men portrayed on the screen, and I for one have been crying out for a show like this. Amazing! I only wish more shows could be as progressive as this.",19 out of 26 found this helpful.,10.0,31 May 2014
363,Nurse Jackie, Seems to be Getting Better as It Goes Along....,"I thought Showtime's new series""Nurse Jackie"" started off with good intentions and held promise but truth be known, I had little faith in it. It felt like a vehicle for its star, Edie Falco and though I respect her work, I couldn't understand how she could allow herself to get involved with a show that felt a little half baked.<br/><br/>Now a little over a month since its premiere, I'm warming up to a lot (but not all) of ""Nurse Jackie"" and it's not just because of Falco. The eccentricities are feeling less forced and more integrated. A lot of the actors are really coming into focus and are more appealing. I particularly like Merritt Wever's Zoey Barkow, a trainee nurse under Falco's seasoned Nurse Jackie. She's soft, likable and sincere without being cloying. She's cute in an unforced way. We root for her through our understanding of being in her shoes more than once (the newbie amongst the vets). Wever gets us on her side subtly without forcing any of her bits. She's a real charmer. Eve Best's Dr O'Hara is another winner. Like a lot of my initial reaction to ""Nurse Jackie"", I thought her character being British was just too much ""odd-ballness"" for one show that seemed to be trying too hard to be offbeat. But like Wever, she's showing shadings in her character without over doing it (i.e. the episode where she saved the twin brother. Her acceptance of the twin's artwork was priceless. She showed that she understood how clueless she was in how to handle the situation but handled it anyway.) And the dinner conversation between her and Zoey was inspired. Her reaction to Zoey's revelation about her father being in prison for manslaughter was priceless and made me laugh out loud. I'm not completely sold on Anna Deavere Smith's Gloria Akalitis but I think I'm getting there. The shrill, office administrator part can be a difficult one to play. It can become one note very quickly. I don't really like her pratfalls such as her being zapped by the taser. They seem beneath her and don't work. On the male side, ""Nurse Jackie"" has been even more of a mixed bag. Haaz Sleiman's 'Mo-Mo' is fine. He's a solid, believable presence. Anyone who has worked with a homosexual man knows that he's getting it right. Peter Facinelli's Dr. Fitch Cooper (or ""Coop"", as he's insisting people call him) is a good, live wire. Unlike Noah Wyle's Dr. John Carter on ""ER"", (who seemed to be falling asleep even as his stories became more and more super melodramatic) ""Coop"" is very much alive and seemingly off kilter. Like Dr. O'Hara, I didn't (and don't) like his supposed tourette syndrome habit of grabbing women when he was stressed as it felt (and feels) too forced. But as a character (and thanks to Facinelli's performance), he's more than one note. I'm not thrilled with the other two male characters in the show: Paul Schulze's Eddie Walzer and Jackie's husband, played by Dominic Fumusa. Schulze's Eddie is the hospital pharmacist who is ""prescribing"" Jackie the drugs (painkillers) that she's seen taking at regular intervals and is having a sexual relationship with. There's something about Jackie's drug habit and her affair that doesn't ring true in the show. Perhaps it looked good on paper, to give Jackie a very specific quirk. But as played, it's feels out of place. Eddie's role is underwritten: we're not sure what Jackie's real feelings are for him: drugs, sex, both? When none of them really seem to be that important to her, his role feels unnecessary. As for her husband, Kevin, Dominic Fumusa is too good looking to be believable. He's a romance novel authors idea of a husband rather than the reality that someone in Jackie's situation would likely be in. He's too much the stay at home father (though he owns a bar), painfully aware of his eldest daughter's anxieties and trying to make Jackie aware of it. I think the writers were trying for a gender role reversal here by having Jackie be the one who is cheating while Kevin is the doting, attentive caregiver but it's not really working. It's not Fumusa's fault (though he's bland) but more Falco's. Falco's Nurse Jackie may well have been envisioned as a depiction of a flawed but human women trying to balance so much in her life that she's resorted to drug use to get through her day. The show as well as the role, has the feel of being workshopped: the actors might have been able to work with the writers in developing all the elements of their respective characters. While that's fine, what one actor thinks might make for an interesting character to play doesn't always project that way to the audience. Nurse Jackie's no slouch. We're with her right from the start. She's strong, committed and human to us and it is immediately apparent. We don't need the additions of obvious flaws like the drug use and the affair to tell us that. All of this is thanks to Falco. With those expressive, yearning eyes, she's got the weary look of someone who's been through (and seen) a lot but still has the time and patience to care even if she's spent.<br/><br/>Watching ""Nurse Jackie"" is like watching a tight rope walker: I'm hoping for the best, that the show will make it across while at the same time, I won't be surprised if it falls apart because the whole show is trying something new and not conventional. For that, we should be thankful. I'm just hoping it does not turn out to be a one season wonder.",26 out of 46 found this helpful.,8.0,14 July 2009
364,Nurse Jackie, another excellent performance by Edie Falco,"When I heard that Edie Falco was in another TV drama I definitely had to check it out. I had hoped the writing was good, and I wasn't disappointed. Edie Falco as Nurse Jackie is brilliant as usual. She was great in The Sopranos and she doesn't disappoint in this. She is so gifted, she could make an alphabet recitation interesting. The character Jackie is troubled, complex and caring and she draws you in. The storyline is complex as I'm sure the character arcs will be. <br/><br/>It's refreshing to see a drama with the central focus on a nurse. I tire of the hero worship of doctors on TV and film. Obviously many TV and film writers have little idea generally speaking of what most hospital doctors are like. I can appreciate certain parts of this show since I have been an RN myself for many years. Nurses of course are highly under-appreciated and underpaid. <br/><br/>Eve Best also plays an excellent character as Dr. Eleanor O'Hara. I look forward to her appearance each episode. <br/><br/>This is not a hospital soap opera like ""Greys Anatomy"" or ""ER"". It's quirky and complex. I am really looking forward to this show having a long run. I hope Edie Falco continues to get quality roles in her career. She is remarkable.",11 out of 17 found this helpful.,8.0,16 February 2011
365,Nurse Jackie, First six episodes...,"Halfway through season one and I have developed an unexpected fondness for this dry, subtle and somewhat dark medical drama. <br/><br/>The show is centred around tough and candid Nurse Jackie who juggles her work, boyfriend, husband and kids all whilst dealing with her secret addiction to pain killers.<br/><br/>Nurse Jackie moves away from the typical soap opera territory where many hospital based dramas reside and in so, does not rely on outrageous medical situations nor heroic, attractive doctors to capture its viewers. <br/><br/>The true triumph of Nurse Jackie is its intriguing characters and outstanding acting, without exception, from the cast. <br/><br/>Edie Falco portrays every dimension of her character with real conviction. Despite Jackie's complicated domestic life and obvious addiction, she is a surprisingly stable and strong character. Just six episodes in and I'm gripped by her story.<br/><br/>Alongside Falco, Merritt Weaver plays enthusiastic nursing student Zoe. Impressionable and talkative, Zoe renders a perfect counterpart to Jackie and has provided some of the shows funniest moments. Eva Best plays Jackie's best friend and eccentric British Doctor Eleanor O'Hara. Much like Jackie, O'Hara is contempt and bitter yet instantly likable. Another great performance comes from Peter Facinelli who plays Fitch Cooper, a new doctor who is confident and smug despite his inappropriate groping impulse.<br/><br/>Whilst I am a big fan of the beautiful doctor love-fest that is Grey's Anatomy and the laugh-a-minute cry-a-minute comedy drama Scrubs, Nurse Jackie (so far) is a refreshing change of pace from typical medical dramas. The show is dark yet hilarious with outlandish yet realistic characters. The episodes are well measured in their half-hour slot, each with individual and on-going stories. <br/><br/>Nurse Jackie maybe lacklustre for fans of hard-hitting, edge-of-seat dramas, however the show is smart and gritty and certainly has potential.",12 out of 19 found this helpful.,9.0,4 January 2013

367,Nurse Jackie, Very good show with puzzling end,"Nurse Jackie is a good comedy because it is based on real life and nothing is more funny, horrible, tragic, {adjective here} than real life. Jackie is a great nurse who is not open to personal relationships even though she has the compassion of 100 people (making her a great nurse). She treats herself like crap while her patients get her best. Problem is she is hooked on pills. Pain killers seem to be the drug of choice but she isn't super particular just has the tolerance of a horse. She chomps down 80-100 mg oxy pills like a kid does gummy bears. She chews and snorts them to get the maximum effect from the dosage. Challenge is that this makes her an addict which comes with all the character flaws of an addict; lying, stealing, etc., doing anything to prevent running out of drugs. I think they go a little light on the severity of detox the few times she does. She has herself convinced that she does a better job when high, not an unusual self perception for an addict. The show has a lot of plot lines that take us through a well written story of her life and the supporting cast; mostly her co-workers at a city hospital's ER (which throws in its own set of funny and gross situations). Bad doctors accidentally killing people or being prevented from killing them through the nurses help. Some of the doctors grow and become good while others don't, but it is part of the humor.<br/><br/>Jackie bottoms out, losing her family, children and almost her job; the thing that is more important to her than anything but her drugs. That pushes her to get sober and then use again in the hell of faking sobriety. They don't really inject a lot of 12 step BS. in the show. But that is because Jackie does go through detox for a couple of weeks and say she is in recovery but doesn't actually participate in recovery to where she even knows how the program works. She is though a master manipulator and the show entertains as she jumps through ever increasingly difficult hoops to keep her supplied with drugs and working. She has one person she seems to truly care about, but even that is questionable. When he throws himself under the bus to protect her from prosecution she reacts by rejecting him because it messes with her drug source.<br/><br/>The show evolves over the seasons but the underlying story is that of an addict getting increasingly worse providing a lot of laughs in the process. You can't help but love her flaws and all because you are seeing life through her eyes. The end is tough. Having again dodged a bullet successfully keeping her nursing license by completing a probation program disaster strikes. A dealer who had his stash stolen runs into the ER with a gun looking for it. A doctor talks him out of believing the thief is there and he runs off. But Jackie realizes the likely culprit is a reoccurring character that comes into the ER with a heroine OD because it explains why the dealer would think the thief was there. In this final episode and scene Jackie realizes this guy would do such a thing and runs into the men's room finding our junkie with the huge stash he stole. She takes it from him ,saves him and sets him up in the ER. This occurs during a celebration for the ER treating their last patient and locking their doors (as the hospital is shutting down having been sold to be converted to condo's). She slips into the bathroom and snorts a big pile of the heroine she stole from the addict. At this point she appears to walk out of the party in a euphoric state and go join a large group of people in times square in meditation appearing like the show was ending with her getting worse and moving on... but then suddenly we are back in the ER where all her friends are trying to revive her as she really came out from snorting all the heroine and collapsed. The show then ends with her staring into the camera as we fade to credits unsure if she got revived or died from an OD. Something for fans to debate. I took it as her dying. Either way it signaled the end. Either her life ended or her addiction ended because she couldn't have O.D.'ed and continued on to her next job as a nurse as she would have lost her license after a heroine OD and her life would have been forever changed thus killing the character. Little difference as she either died or the character died thus ending the story.<br/><br/>Great show with a lot of realism that goes where most don't with an ending leaving questions that regardless of the answer lead to the same ultimate end for those who understand the path of addiction. Good writing and a painful subject turned into great entertainment taking a horrible subject and making us laugh as we go along for the ride. Unusual and I'm sure for many who don't know the realities of addiction much of it likely lost on them. But the show is top notch regardless of the viewers knowledge. Though based on the popularity enough people have been touched by the disease to know enough to get it... and getting it is worth the trip!",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,18 June 2016

It got a little ""broken record"" for my liking. I am honestly glad that ended it because I was begining to hate Jackie. Everybody bent over backwards for her and she didnt care. I felt like she broke Zoey's spirit in the end. I honestly think they could have wrapped this up after a couple seasons.

369,Nurse Jackie, Anatomy of a sociopath,"Good premise. Decent first season. Then, not unlike too many other shows that start out with a lot of potential Nurse Jackie quickly runs off the rails and never gets back on track. This show suffers from the all-too-typical ""caricatures rather than characters"" syndrome. There are simply too many one dimensional cartoon characters in this show to even begin to take it seriously. ""Coop"". Zoey. Thor. All cartoonish immature 1 dimensional clowns. And that's simply unacceptable. So is its schizo nature of taking itself way too seriously then not taking itself seriously enough. And so is the problem of having no one to really care that much about. So in short, this show is neither here nor there, and as such, the net result is a big waste of time.<br/><br/>Furthermore the continuity from one season to the next is hands down THE WORST of any TV series I've ever seen. It's like the writers/directors/editors/producers were all on PCP. The gaps and unexplained events from one season to the next are appalling and any semblance of suspension of disbelief is totally destroyed.<br/><br/>But possibly the biggest problem with this show is that it SEEMS to be focusing on addiction, when in fact, it's the lead character is a sociopath who is also an addict. Jackie has no conscience whatsoever, and her persistent incorrigible behavior makes it impossible to want anything for her except incarceration. Rarely has one TV character generated so much hatred.<br/><br/>My suggestion? Please...pull the plug on this rotting comatose vegetable already.",13 out of 25 found this helpful.,5.0,28 April 2015
370,Nurse Jackie, A soap opera with really unbelievable medical practice,"The premise of this show is a study of addiction in a Nurse who can function while still being an addict. The focus is supposed to be on the characters and their interaction with one another. The problem is that it's set in a hospital where the medical situations are totally implausible and unbelievable. Many of the things that the nurse does in the series would just not be possible in a hospital. She knows more than the doctors, speaks to people like she's in charge etc. While I'm all for strong female leads in series, they have to be put in believable situations, not constantly living in a fantasy world. This departure from reality gets worse as the series progresses. If attention had been paid to detail, and maybe the show had a medical consultant to advise on the situations, it might have a bit more credibility.",7 out of 12 found this helpful.,4.0,30 August 2017
371,Nurse Jackie, Pretty great,"This show, on a nutshell, is pretty consistent. I do think the third season was a dropoff in quality, but Season 4 bounced back up as the show's best and the quality continued. Falco is amazing, unsurprisingly, and she just makes it all look so effortless. The supporting cast is also pretty great, and the show knows how to use them for the most part. Weaver really stands out as the MVP of the supporting cast, and Falcinelli is also pretty great. I hope the show doesn't burn out anytime soon, that would be a shame. As it is now, I feel like the show's incredibly underrated. I definitely recommend this, it's a pretty great comedy-drama",6 out of 10 found this helpful.,,13 August 2014
372,Nurse Jackie," A Refreshing New Show! Edie is excellent! ""ER"" with humor","Edie Falco, best known for her role as Carmela Soprano on HBO's ""The Sopranos"" amazes viewers with her talent and versatility.

As someone who has spent time working in an ER, the nuances and interactions between the characters have me asking who wrote this, because this weird random stuff has totally happened. <br/><br/>You have to have a good sense of humor to enjoy it. It may be a little bit of dark comedy. I highly highly recommend it if you are a fan of ""The Sopranos"", ""Six Feet Under"" , ""Nip/Tuck"", ""Rescue Me"",or ""Dead Like Me"" then you will definitely love the show.

374,Nurse Jackie, 5 stars for the cast alone,"Great cast and premise, and it kept me watching all episodes but i have several issues. I just binge watched it in May 2020 so I'm late in watching this. The show intrigued me because I like Edie Falco and Peter Facinelli. My fave character ended up being Zoey (Merritt). Although she is annoyingly cheery, she reminds me a lot of myself. From what all of my nurse friends say, the all love their job but they do complain about the CATTiness of the women nurses and the snobby doctors. So I think this show did a good job of portraying nurses. The cases did seem far fetched on here but it is a drama made for tv. I think cancer and flu patients being shown in every episode would get boring, lets be real. My problems:
Jackie's short hair. I just couldn't stand her with a bob haircut. I'm glad it ended up growing out in later seasons. I also hated her popping those pills like it was nothing. No water or anything. Just chewing them or swallowing whole. It was just annoying and got old in every episode, almost. The only time i liked Jackie's character was when she was clean for that full year. Very frustrating everytime she started using again. Im sure in real life, nurses or doctors can't actually do their job while intoxicated all day. But again, its tv, sooooo....
Then there is the whole doctors and nurses getting it on in random rooms. Im certain that doesn't happen. They made me hate jackie but made me root for her the whole time. Jackie is so selfish. She had such a good life and loved her job so much and they made her choose drugs over her family and friends and its very frustrating. I know a lot of drug addicts who have became clean and stayed clean so i know it is possible. The lies, the stealing, manipulation and selfishness are all things that drug addicts do but its frustrating to watch. The season finale was blah for me and i feel like i didn't get any closure. They should have either had her die from it or become clean for good, but not open ended so we have to wonder this whole time if she survived the OD. It would have been nice for it to conclude with her becoming clean for good. That way it would give watchers hope that people can become clean no matter what f^&lt;#ed up things they have done, but it was very unfulfilling.

377,Nurse Jackie, Painful. Awful. And worse...,"The ""2"" is so I could give 1 point to Edie Falco, who deserves better than this (her work in The Sopranos was marvelous). We made it through the pilot, wincing at all of the stereotypical characters, forced drama and mostly idiotic and predictable dialog. We added something new to the next episode - howls of laughter, as, if anything, the stereotypes grew worse, the drama more forced - but, oddly, the dialog grew so terrible to have become hilarious. Then we thought....we were fooled! This is just a very clever comedy!<br/><br/>But, alas, no - it is supposed to be a drama. It made us pine for the quality of character development, situations and dialog of ER.

378,Nurse Jackie, Professional Nurses Will Be Up In Arms,"Having known a nurse who needed to retire because of a bad back, I started wondering how many get hooked on painkillers when that happens to them. In that vein, it's an excellent premise for a TV series. Unlike Gregory House, however, Jackie gives a damn about her patients to the same degree she flouts basic ethics from time to time.<br/><br/>Edie Falco is perfectly cast in this role as an unsaintly nurse who gets our sympathy. You applaud her when she flushes the severed ear of the ""diplomat"" who repeatedly stabbed a prostitute, but we don't want to end up in her ER lest we get on her bad side. The situations are compelling despite the cliché characters that surround Jackie, and we hope that they will develop into 3-dimensional people. On that note, we still hope Cooper gets what's coming to him.<br/><br/>The series has already been renewed for a second season, so the writers will have plenty of time to develop this dark dramedy.

I was worried I wouldn't see Edie as anyone other than Carmela Soprano. Nope. It was all Nurse Jackie. She was so good as a drug addicted pathological lying nurse; I found myself hating her at times. Despite her flaws she is a great nurse with the patients best interest in mind (most of the time)I love Dr. Cooper (Facinelli).

381,Nurse Jackie, Do Not Resusitate,"Don't get me wrong, the premise for Nurse Jackie is great. Edie Falco plays Jackie Peyton, a Vicodin addicted nurse whose whole world (and this series, it turns out) are held together by the hope that nobody will discover her dirty little secret. During the day, she's the Champion ER Nurse of All Time, showing both compassion and brains while bucking the system that promotes and protects profit-hungry hospitals and rock star egomaniac doctors at the expense of the everyday working man and woman. Bravo Jackie.<br/><br/>Not so much so to the show's creator's Liz Brixius and Linda Wallum, who, it seems, had every good intention when they dreamed up this little show, which has, since season one, devolved into a horribly solipsistic mishmash of retreads from all the most forgettable network TV hospital dramas and bad nighttime soaps.<br/><br/>See, NJ has one card to play --- the one stated above --- and after that ace is revealed, the rest of the show goes on life support. Season two ended promisingly enough (after 85% of it was recycled St. Elsewhere hubris) with some much needed suspense revolving around that ace.<br/><br/>I've only watched a few episodes of season three but it is mind numbingly horrific.<br/><br/>One of the big problems is the roster of bland, two-dimensional supporting characters (not the actors, with the exception of teeth-grindingly cutesy Merritt Wever). They run the gamut from Thor (not fleshed out enough...really just a gay cardboard cut-out) to Ackolidas (Anna Devere Smith utterly wasted in the 'bad boss with a heart of gold shtick' --- did I actually see her talking to a monkey in one episode or did I dream that?) to unbelievably dense (Falco's husband on the series....just a weak-willed cypher who's decades too young to play opposite Falco, at least in appearance).<br/><br/>The first season had some interesting subplots, including the one about the OCD daughter. The newer episodes have as subplots: 1) Will Wever get together with her hunky slob of an EMT boyfriend? 2) Will Peter Facinelli (another great actor in a wastoid role) make up with the male nurse who punched him after he screwed his girlfriend? Add in the Xanax-induced doze of all the hacky ""zany"" ER episode-length plots that try so earnestly to win our hearts and funny bones. They get neither.<br/><br/>It's too bad Showtime didn't see the broken railroad tracks at the end of this speeding freight train when they green-lighted it. I'm sure they thought Falco alone could save it. Sorry....pull the plug and DNR it if you value your time and sanity.",18 out of 46 found this helpful.,3.0,4 April 2011

Every episode contains famous actors, which add to the fun!!<br/><br/>Port goes stageless! SNL, and Kids in The Hall take place on stages or sets. Port does not. This gives it a more authentic reality show feel which makes it more accessible and less artificial.<br/><br/>This show makes me feel like I know these people or grew up with them. They make fun of things me and my friends make fun of. Everyday young adults, who understand punk, politics, indie rock, college life, and getting over all of that will relate. <br/><br/>Portlandia is a 9 1/2 star show yet it's not over the top. It's not pretentious. This is why Port is for now. This generation. It's almost like a consistently funny SNL. An SNL that doesn't make fun of pop culture but rather everyday life. Therefore it's easy to laugh at again and again.<br/><br/>Though it's great Port lacks just little in two areas rewatchability and characters.

'Portlandia' is, for me at least, the best American sketch comedy series I've seen since 'Upright Citizens Brigade'.<br/><br/>I don't know how accurately it depicts Portland and its denizens, but I do know that (A) it really makes me want to visit there and (B) it really, really makes me laugh.<br/><br/>Carrie Brownstein is new to me as comedian, though I of course know her musical work with indie darlings Sleater-Kinney. The brilliantly versatile Fred Armisen has deservedly earned a big fan base (including my family) through his work on SNL. Yet, who could have predicted that this combination of talent, in such an off-the-wall concept, could work so well? It really does, and I want to congratulate all associated with the series, notably the legendary Lorne Michaels for once again nurturing talents like Fred and Carrie and giving them the chance to do a great show like this.<br/><br/>Once you get the style and shape of the show, you'll be hooked. The sketches are, for the most part, really good and some (e.g. Chicken Farm, One More Episode of Galactica) are destined to become enduring classics.<br/><br/>The stars (in their multiple roles) are ably assisted by a fine cast of supporting performers and a BIG highlight of the series is the many surprising and hilarious cameo appearances, including people like Edward James Olmos, Aimee Mann and Greg Louganis (playing themselves) and of course the wonderful Kyle McLachlan as the Mayor. These bits work not only because of who the stars are, but also because in just about every case they are perfect for and in the sketch (c.f. Eddie Vedder's great cameo in the ""boyfriend's tattoo"" sketch).<br/><br/>Thanks Fred and Carrie and all the cast and crew - it's been a real delight to discover such a clever, quirky, inventive comedy series that consistently takes unexpected turns, gives a lot of laughs, and leaves you wanting more every time.",30 out of 50 found this helpful.,10.0,9 September 2012

I was in high school in the early/mid 90s and very little of the material in the show resonates with me.<br/><br/>I suppose there's the odd laugh, but it appears to be a show written entirely as an in-joke and I'm afraid I'm missing almost all of it. The jokes that were accessible, like the bookstore, were funny for the first minute or two but after several long drawn out minutes of the same material I was just eager for the scene to end - meager laughs were simply replaced with despair.<br/><br/>I've never actually seen or experienced an adult hide and go seek league, have you? Let alone something as obviously over the top and ridiculous as the one portrayed in this show. Does anything like that even exist? Outside of the fake social pages set up as (maybe) marketing for this show? It's just so 'out there' that it loses any of its potential humour. If it had stuck to poking fun at the ludicrous reality that *does* exist, it could have been brilliant.<br/><br/>Then there's the scene where they go to see the location of where their chicken (I think, right?) was farmed. I understand that there are those who are interested in knowing the origins of their meal, and this bit could have been very well done if it ended in the restaurant. The show just takes it to a painful degree where the laughs have dried up and it's just simply sad and unfunny in the end. I was just wishing they would wrap up and move along.<br/><br/>To sum up, I'm really not sure how this got a 7.8 rating - but I can guess: It's a collection of scenes strung together, desperately attempting to make a funny, they fail so miserably that your just feel bad for the actors and creators that you want to give it a higher rating in the hopes that it will redeem yourself for taking the time to actually watch it. <br/><br/>Maybe next time you will be carrying exact change so you can get out of the bookstore that much faster and won't get locked in. <br/><br/>Awful joke right? I know.",39 out of 85 found this helpful.,3.0,2 April 2012
390,Portlandia," Amazing at its best, although it's become more hit and miss over the years","Portlandia is a wonderful mockery of a sort of the silliness of the modern age, poking fun at obsessions with food and authenticity and playing with concepts of gender. <br/><br/>Portlandia walks that very thin line between so weird it's funny and too weird to be funny. That means you can see something truly inventive, original sketches, but also that you can watch an entire episode without a single funny thing in it. This has become increasingly true as the series has progressed - as of season 8 the humor has been somewhat patchy, although it is still sometimes brilliant.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this series, you should definitely check it out. Start with the early episodes to get the most bang for your buck.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,30 August 2017
391,Portlandia," Funny at First, Not So Much Anymore","I'm not from Portland, but I live there now. Portland is a beautiful place to live. Breathtaking scenery, an excellent public transit system, awesome restaurants, great beer and coffee, close proximity to mountains and the ocean. There's a lot to like about living here. Sure, it rains a lot, there are a lot of homeless people, and hipsters are pretentious douchebags, but most people are hard working, friendly and inclusive. Some people get annoyed by the ""small town"" locals and some people get annoyed by the ""yuppies for California."" I think most people are good people in this city. IFC plays on many of the Portland sensibilities in their satire sketch comedy show ""Portlandia"".<br/><br/>I enjoyed the show when it first started, but my enjoyment has dipped since then. Maybe it's because when it started it was still a place for young people to retire. Now, not so much. It's a booming economy, a lot of new money pouring in, and things are changing, I think mostly for the better, but that's not how everyone sees it. Rent has increased, so has traffic, and some of the charm has disappeared. I guess you can look at it both ways, positively and negatively. Also, jokes about hipsters, weirdness and more grow stale after being told over and over again. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed it when it first started, but maybe it's time to let it go. Like one of their famous sketches suggests, it's over.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,6.0,7 February 2017
392,Portlandia, Complete waste of time,"I love dry, low key, intelligent humor. And this show advertises that this is what it delivers. Trouble is, this simply is a poorly thought out sketch comedy show that only pretends to deliver these things. It's not creative. It's not witty. It's simply a show that preys on stereotypes and relies on the counter-culture visibility of hippie and hipster culture to attempt to evoke a coolness factor that just falls flat in this show. And while Fred Armison is extremely talented, and I occasionally chuckled at his straight-faced deliver of some absurd line or facial emotion, it doesn't come close to making up for the boredom. <br/><br/>The best way I can describe this show is to ask you to picture Saturday Night Live. On most SNL episodes, there are about 3 sketches that kill, 4 that bore you, and 2 that make you want to gouge your eyes out. Portlandia falls between categories 2 and 3. <br/><br/>Now I will give the show props for being original. It's charting a course I haven't seen before. That alone is hard to do in today's cookie-cutter Ratings-driven Hollywood culture. And as far as cameos go, few shows beat it. There is a revolving door of A and B listers that show up which at times makes the show bearable. <br/><br/>But do yourself a favor and just pass. Unless, of course, you are trying to repent for something.",37 out of 81 found this helpful.,1.0,23 January 2014
393,Portlandia, First season: 10 stars...Second season - 2 stars,"This show completely cracks me up. The strange characters portrayed by these talented people are too funny. The subtle humor and lack of a laugh track is something that is lacking on television. The mayor is a total pretentious jerk that probably reminds a lot of us of our bosses. The bizarre humor in the show is completely original and unrelenting. I hate it when they have back-to-back episodes on Saturday mornings because I can't get out of bed - can't turn it off. The bookstore women, the cult, the dumpster divers, the gender-reversed couple, the Portland ""Thinkers""....too funny. It's the best thing to hit television since ""Fernwood 2 Nite"", circa 1975. This just in...the second season sucked. I removed 4 stars.",17 out of 34 found this helpful.,6.0,1 January 2012
394,Portlandia," Boring, corny and unfunny, disguised as indie/hipster fare.","The creators of this show made some accurate and pithy observations regarding the culture of Portland, Oregon, capturing our local native vibe that is sometimes quirky and sincere, sometimes obsessive, and sometimes down right passive-aggressive. As a 13-year resident of Portland, I appreciate this, as I appreciate location shots and the cameo appearance of our beleaguered Mayor Sam Adams.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, a lot of the sketches on this show simply lack humor. There seems to be a lot of padding, a lot of sketches where there is no real joke, and a lot of unfunny characters who show up every episode, such as the couple played by our actors doing the cross-dressing thing.<br/><br/>You can certainly use Portland as a springboard for humor, god knows I have been making fun of this city (which I love) for years...but at the end of the day, you also need some more actual jokes, and you need a bit of substance. Instead, you have one or two segments of this show being amusing, with the rest of it falling flat like Saturday Night Live after Tina Fey left.<br/><br/>In short, the writers either have almost no actual material, or are just lazy.",61 out of 154 found this helpful.,4.0,14 February 2011
395,Portlandia, Armisen and Brownstein at their finest,"I never would have guessed that punk rocker Carrie Brownstein was this funny, and as for Fred Armisen, after 12 years on SNL, I naturally assumed those to be the peak of Armisen's sketch comedy genius, but then: Portlandia.<br/><br/>The characters are memorable (i.e. Feminist bookstore ladies) and the sketches are spot on at capturing the essence of hipster culture, various more generalized societal woes and everyday struggles. <br/><br/>Excerpt from Shocking Art Supplies sketch: ""We've got baby doll parts; you can put them together any way you want"" ""Here's a radical juxtaposition; the butt is in the front"" ""What does that say about society""<br/><br/>As an art student,I took to this one, however every episode is packed with hilarious critiques and comedic genius from the dynamic duo Armisen and Brownstein.",10 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,11 April 2015
396,Portlandia, Painfully dull and unfunny,"One of those safe shows you hear everyone raving about. I gave this several chances, as I wondered what I was missing. All of the gags are DOA, I've never once even smirked at this safe pablum. I think the popularity of this God awful show is that everything safe, and all the humor, if you can call it that, is aimed at millennials. The jokes are based on observational humor specifically hipster culture in portland, which is just hipster culture. The problem is that all all the gags are nerfed, there isn't a single biting, or sharp observation in this show. Every single ""jab"" at these hipster conventions is gentle and designed for the hipsters to laugh at, because they are in on the joke. Also, all the targets are stereotypes so broad, this show needn't take place in Portland as all the jokes are totally generic, and run for far too long. This show feels like SNL - lame sketches that overstay their welcome. Jesus they did an ENTIRE episode about a bit where a lady didn't want to eat Tsukemen a certain way and the noodles came to life in a painfully tedious and unfunny episode length sketch that should have lasted 3 minutes at most. This show is just bizzzzaaaad.",21 out of 48 found this helpful.,1.0,17 June 2016
397,Portlandia, I actually fast forwarded through this to see Kyle MacLachlan!!,"I didn't have the highest hopes for this show since SNL is not that funny anymore. But I gave it a shot. The first episode wasn't funny at all, which lead me to believe this show isn't a comedy. Is it? I mean, the beginning part with the singing was so long and not humorous. Then the characters were flat and in the bookstore, in took me awhile to realize Fred Armisen was playing a woman. See, if you watched a Kids in the Hall skit, you would instantly know a guy was playing a female. In this, I didn't. If there are jokes in this show, I must be missing them all. Wait, there are no jokes.<br/><br/>It's a hodgepodge at best. Trying to be That 90's Show crossed with more topical sections, like when the two leads meet a bigamist cult that is like Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Overall, it doesn't make sense since that was in Texas and this is in Portland. I get the angle they were trying to create, but it is a lukewarm idea backed up with no spirit.<br/><br/>I don't think the two leads, Armisen and Carrie Brownstein, who was more funny when she was in the band Sleater-Kinney than this, aren't very intriguing. There is something off with their delivery. I guess the side by side Portlandia and Black Books viewing would stand. You can do comedy straight but it has to be funny. This is not.<br/><br/>I struggled through the second episode because I am a Kyle MacLachlan fan, so I fast forwarded to his sections. He actually breathed some life into the show for a brief second. Maybe it is because he knows how to act serious yet funny. He gets it. Then in bounded Aubrey Plaza from Parks and Recreation, a show I actually like and that I think is funny. But she always seems to play about the same character...still her scene in the bookstore was more inspired than Steve Buscemi's who played a guy who had to use the bathroom in the store and then ended up frustrated because he had to buy something. Having worked in a few indie bookstores myself, you would think this would bring up a chuckle or too. It didn't. <br/><br/>There is no magic to Portlandia. I wanted to see some of the other cameos, but I can't even stomach it enough to fast forward to those cameos. I have no interest in any of the characters either of the leads play. It's like watching a whole episode of SNL that isn't funny at all (I am looking at you Russell Brand, Jesse Eisenberg, Jeff Bridges, Robert De Niro and Bryan Cranston hosted episodes...hard to make all that talent unfunny but somehow SNL currently does it...with only a few of the show like the Dana Carvey and Jim Carrey ones being actually funny) yet disappoints even more than ""not funny"" does. It's an odd accomplishment to make a show devoid of humor and isn't even interesting in style beyond that so I can get through a 20 minute show.

398,Portlandia, Mostly miss,"Portlandia is a version of anti-comedy that doesn't realize anti-comedy is only good about 1 out of 30 skits, not all of them. Anti-comedy is comedy that tries to be funny by not being funny or trying to be ironic and usually is not good. Sometimes the jokes are too front loaded, sometimes they are just flogged to death in the attempt of making something that isn't funny funny by repetition. So, basically this just didn't work for me. It might work for you; the closest thing off the top of my head is another show I didn't like: Curb Your Enthusiasm. I only watched one episode of Curb and only 3 of this so maybe it's not a good comparison.",26 out of 65 found this helpful.,3.0,26 January 2013

As another user said, the show feels like it's all just inside jokes, very horrendously bad inside jokes.

400,Portlandia," Painful to watch, and I'm from Portland","Portland is a unique place, to say the least. When this show first started, I had hoped for a show that captured the vibrancy of the NW. The show does touch on topics of interest from the area. People raising chickens in town...the love of micro brews...the music scene.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it is just painful to try and watch! <br/><br/>Think of SNL. They often have just a couple of skits that make you laugh. The rest are just failing attempts. Portlandia feels as if they swept up SNL's leftovers that fell on the floor, changed to a Portland theme, and then tossed it at us. I truly hope that this show will end some day soon! It would also be great, if they could tell the viewers that this is TV and not real. It is amazing, how many people move here because of the show??? Maybe, they should do an episode about the brutally high rent, lack of jobs, 7 1/2 months of rain and the increasing dis like of hipsters by the city.<br/><br/>I have yet to laugh at this show, or be able to make it through a complete episode.

401,Portlandia, Kyle MacLachlan nails it but the rest fall short.,"Kyle MacLachlan goes all in on his portrayal of the simple but always charming, Mayor of Portland. Unfortunately even MacLachlan's powerful performance wasn't enough to carry the show with Armisen's dry, bland, and all around boring characters that just don't fit the bill.<br/><br/>It seems like the skits aren't very well thought out and they're pulling humor from over-analyzing the hipster culture. To me, it seems like they're trying to make something out of nothing.<br/><br/>If MacLachlan walks I'd give the show one more season before it's done. We see smaller shows trying to get their footing by injecting some star power (Devito in Sunny) all the time but maybe MacLachlan isn't even enough to keep this one afloat.",18 out of 44 found this helpful.,1.0,20 October 2013

Not only does it have very bad acting the whole idea of the show is just comedy gone wrong.

406,Portlandia, You'll either love it or hate it.,"THIS ONE MIGHT HAVE SPOILERS! ""Portlandia"" - It's not for everybody. That's the first sign you might find it good viewing. The second sign is it may take time to grow on you. It takes you out of your viewing comfort zone right away and a lot of people don't like that. My wife can't watch it. The first thing you'll notice is ""Portlandia"" is really the ""Fred and Carrie show"". These two mesh though, so they can pull it off. And they aren't concerned at all about looking ridiculous or even idiotic for a laugh. Sometimes the formula of straight absurdity just doesn't work - but it works enough of the time to keep me tuning back in. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: Every episode Fred and Carrie play multiple characters. They have many recurring sets that sometimes even overlap - logic has no place in ""Portlandia"" - So be prepared for them to appear as old people, two female book store owners, two homeless people, there is no limit and so don't even bother keeping track of the names - trying to tell someone ""about"" this show who hasn't seen it, is next to impossible so i don't even try.<br/><br/>The roles they will play and what will happen, are totally unpredictable and this is probably what a lot of people like (or hate). On the Fred-and-Carrie-show, characters appear from nowhere, disappear, and then reappear again at random. The characters always have a motive and the motive is always something ridiculous. Something always gets resolved during the show - a question, an issue, a problem, an invented crisis, a cause or belief that is very silly, again, always about matters completely absurd. So don't be surprised when Fred and Carrie reverse sexes (Carrie plays a guy named Lance and they slow her voice down, which i find hilarious) while Fred puts on a dress to play Nina (speeded up voice) and of course, these two are a couple. Their gender role changes are some of the funniest of the show but you gotta be ready for all the weirdness, because there's plenty of that in ""Portlandia"". If you don't do weird this show might not be for you. <br/><br/>I give it 8 of 10, it took me 3 or 4 episodes of chipping at this show before i felt comfortable enough watching it. And not every episode is a gem either (because they can't all be) but all in all, good show and worth your time.",7 out of 15 found this helpful.,8.0,20 May 2015

430,The Mick," Promising new comedy, that could go either way","The Mick is the second most promising new comedy of 2017, after Santa Clarita Diet, which I give a clear 10.<br/><br/>They both thrive on being wildly inappropriate, to a degree where you either can't help laughing out loud, because it all is so outrageous, or get in touch with your inner prude.<br/><br/>Personally, I find it hilarious.<br/><br/>Where The Mick falls a little short is, that it can at times get too focused on creating a happy or moral ending to an episode.... stuff is forgotten or forgiven a little too easily.... and it seems like they are rushing to create harmony amongst the cast during the first season, rather than leaving room for long term development.<br/><br/>But, that is something the writers can tighten up for the next season - I have no doubt it should be renewed.<br/><br/>The cast is really good, albeit, I wonder what they are going to do with a 25 year old playing an 18 year old..... if the show catches on ;)",19 out of 28 found this helpful.,8.0,15 February 2017
431,The Mick, Funny new FOX show for Kaitlin Olson,"Kaitlin Olson strikes out on her own from the gang in a hilarious new comedy series that sees her troubled character Mackenzie ""Mick"" Murphy in charge of three kids in a mansion. When Mick's sister escapes with her husband from an FBI investigation, Mick is left in charge. Her first order of business is to let the maid Alba (Carla Jimenez) off the hook for work and to relax. However, the three kids Sabrina (Sofia Black-D'Elia), Chip (Thomas Barbusca), and Ben (Jack Stanton) Pemberton are more than Mick bargained for. Each has their own issues as Chip tries to stand up to bullies, Sabrina sneaks out to party, and Ben obsesses over fire. Mick tries to establish rules but her own lackadaisical discipline and her boyfriend Jimmy (Scott MacArthur) don't set the best example.<br/><br/>Mick encounters problems with the rich neighbors, the wealthy school's principal, and other tenants of the extreme wealth the Pemberton's inhabit. She finds that the kids have had little to no guidance in life when it comes to dealing with the complex issues of childhood and budding adolescence. The show touches on several complex issues from gender identity to income disparity. Mick usually takes a route that is most convenient and suits her new lifestyle as she becomes accustomed to immense wealth and the spoiled children.<br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",14 out of 20 found this helpful.,8.0,4 May 2017
432,Constantine, Needs more seasons,"The first season was awesome. I loved it. I was very disappointed that the series did not continue. That was a horrible way to end the first season without any follow-up. I feel that it could have been a very popular show had it been given the opportunity. Some of the criticism that I have read about it I didn't even see in the show. If there had been more episodes I would have rated it a 10 for sure. I have also watched the movie which I did enjoy, as well as John Constantine's limited presence in other series.",36 out of 39 found this helpful.,9.0,30 August 2018
433,Constantine, Bloody Fantastic,"Being a MASSIVE fan of the Hellblazer comics, I was dead excited to see that they were finally going to bring an accurate version of John Constantine to life. No offense to Keanu Reeves, who did a badass job, but Matt Ryan has done a brilliant job of capturing this character for who he really is. <br/><br/>To anyone comparing this to supernatural, PLEASE don't. Give me a break. Supernatural was INSPIRED by the Hellblazer comics (it's in the Supernatural Wiki). i.e., Constantine came first. Saying ""we don't need another Supernatural"" couldn't be more wrong. Supernatural has lost the plot, and is no where near as good as it was before. This brings an entirely new, fresh viewing of demons and angels and possessions. So far I absolutely love it and I really hope they stick true to the comics. I hope they won't rule out the chain-smoking just to calm viewers down. On a network that shows the Hannibal series, I sincerely doubt that chain-smoking is the thing to worry about when it comes to bad habits. <br/><br/>I loved the actual comic art they showed at the end of the first episode too. I can't wait to see where this series is going and I REALLY hope it continues. This series has what Supernatural has lost; a dark, gritty ambiance that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a DC fan.",167 out of 204 found this helpful.,10.0,27 October 2014
434,Constantine, Saved My Sodding Television,"Constantine is the best thing currently on television, in my opinion. It's a show about a human doing bogus metaphysics and not a metahuman doing bogus physics, which makes it different from Flash. It's true to the source material (making it different from both Arrow and Gotham) without being a slave to it (making it worth watching instead of just reading).<br/><br/>Matt Ryan and Angelica Celaya's on-screen chemistry is exquisite, sexual tension real but not overpowering. Special effects whose corniness is justified by the circumstances, and to my mind the most important bit: real, human stories.<br/><br/>Amidst the occult, the psychic, the voodoo and the demonic, the show is about redemption, worldview, escaping, and struggling with ""inner demons."" Constantine is entertaining, but more than giving you something to care about, it gives you something to relate to. And as far as I'm concerned, there's room for humans to do business in a TV world bigger than sit-coms.",88 out of 107 found this helpful.,10.0,24 November 2014

Constantine has so far maintained this delicate balance and stays squarely within the lines of a core storyline. However, I am afraid this is going to suffer the fate of many of my favorite shows. They are going to do one of two things-- U.S. network programming that isn't specifically called a ""Mini-series"" either runs- on till it runs out of plot line or gets canceled with no conclusion worth the name. If one of the above happens here...I recommend cutting cable and going an online route. <br/><br/>At least that way you watch on your time table and without having to pay extra.",37 out of 43 found this helpful.,9.0,19 April 2015
436,Constantine," Fantastic canon research, high production value","The writers and designers have done an outstanding job with filling the script, the set, and the costumes with all kinds of details true the comic books and the DC world. (The arcane laboratory is fantastic!) There is also a rich dark feel to the whole show that is pure Vertigo. The whole vibe is creepy and wonderful, and fills that blurry good-vs-evil void that Buffy and Angel left behind, without getting maudlin and soap-operatic. The chemistry between John and Zed is snarky and fun, and the supporting cast is so good. Papa Midnite is PERFECT, and Chas is brilliant. One thing that really works is the special effects. They don't get hokey or feel CGI'ed to ridiculousness- A contorting demon, instead of being twisted by camera tricks, is played by an acrobat that leaves you breathless the 15 seconds she is on scene. I so hope NBC doesn't let this one go; it would be as bad a move as Fox dropping Firefly.",61 out of 76 found this helpful.,9.0,24 November 2014
437,Constantine, JC is back! Woo-Hoo.,"I've been waiting almost ten years for some sort of sequel or reboot of the first Constantine movie back in 2005. I'm not a big comic book fan and I never knew the character prior to the film, but for what is worth I enjoyed it back in the day and I was hoping for more for a long time.<br/><br/>The series starts off on the right note and with a proper rhythm. The protagonist (Matt Ryan) looks ready to undertake a main role. The script isn't the strongest point so far, but it almost never is after just the pilot. I'm sure that in time, it will become much more detailed and interesting. <br/><br/>For me personally, it is a very good alternative to the Supernatural series, that keeps taking a dive for the worse with every season passing. I love Supernatural, but that show should have ended 5 seasons ago. <br/><br/>Overall, the pilot was cohesive, concentrated and left me curious for more. The scares were also very good with awesome make-up and CGI. If this level of quality can be sustained, I'm sure that we will be on a great ride with John Constantine.",86 out of 113 found this helpful.,8.0,26 October 2014
438,Constantine, John Constantine Hellblazer supreme .,I've read the comics. And I have a soft spot for John Constantine. The Keanu Reeves movie was in my opinion well done. But Reeves missed the subtle characteristics of John. The Hellblazer comic was supposed to be a intelligent look at a warlock named John Constantine who is a complete lying and con man. He has a really nasty habit of having his friends die around him. The Show reminds me of the comic a lot. now it won't be the comic. Anything that is adapted to another medium such as TV or the movies is bound to have changes. It won't be 100% Constatine Comic book. But here they nailed down the essence of what that comic is about. John Constatine is a haunted man. the mistakes of his past are starting to come back and haunt him. Hell wants him in the worst possible way. Heaven doesn't want him . and so John must try to redeem himself somewhat by saving others. Of course John is a cheeky lying con man who is only in it for his own goals. But sometimes. Sometimes the Hero in John rises to the occasion and he fights evil just to save lives. Because he knows what is right and what is wrong. And John Constantine is a regular person who needs to be prodded into taking the right course of action. If you like Supernatural. Give Constantine a chance it's a walk down that same dark road Dean and Sam Winchester take every week. And I'd like to think the Winchester's and John would get along nicely. If it's not your cup of tea well change the channel. but if it is. Watch it you will be surprised and rewarded for your patience. And Loyality.,68 out of 89 found this helpful.,10.0,17 November 2014
439,Constantine, The Misunderstood Man Walking the Fine Line,"First of all , hats off to Matt Ryan for actually bringing the crazy witty bastard we all know as John Constantine to life. A true gem and a revolution in bringing the less glorified and star spangled yet utterly brilliant comic characters to life. I've been a fan of hellblazer since i was a kid, the dark creepy twisted plots and the always witty John Constantine, always having an ace up his sleeve, always surviving. The charisma the actors exude, the level of believability is very carefully plotted and the true comic genre is employed quite fantastically. Hope this show runs long alongside the spangled spandex runners and proves that u don't need hugely popular and socially feasible hero characters to come up with a brilliant show. I'll give it 10, yes, for being true to Constantine, and especially for holding no bars, may it be gore , creepiness, nudity or just the plain simple religious incantations. Absolutely Promising and spine chilling.",41 out of 54 found this helpful.,10.0,18 January 2015
440,Constantine, Well Played,"As of this point, only the first episode has aired. I can only comment on what I've seen. That said, here we go: You'll find that, unlike the movie bearing the same name, this stays truer to the source material. We can expect omissions of certain things and some creative liberties because the original Hellblazer began in the late 80s and this is network television. I can abide this, and expected it. Constantine is the anti-hero that you would expect, assuming you're familiar with the source material. Matt Ryan does a great job in this role and captures the sardonic humor of the character. Glancing at the cast list for season 1, you might recognize many names from the original comics. The first episode was better than I expected. I assumed it would mostly be seeing the viewer up to understand the characters, and, while it did this, it allowed us to get straight to the meat and potatoes of the character and his story. The writers were clever about how they can't show Constantine smoking on camera. Instead, you'll see him idly toying with a lighter and putting out cigarettes that he would have just finished. It's network television. That's about as close as you can get. They didn't stray from the horror and the occult, either. Finally, the season at a glance trailer that played at the end offered much promise. Fans of the comics will recognize some nods here and there, as well.<br/><br/>First episode was fantastic. 9.5/10 (rounded to ten)<br/><br/>Folks who will enjoy this are those that enjoy horror mixed with sharp dialogue and humor. It's very fantastical. Supernatural fans will likely enjoy this, as well.",123 out of 179 found this helpful.,10.0,25 October 2014
441,Constantine, This is the Constantine I grew up with!,"Why is this so good? Probably for the simple reason that Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis &amp; Alan Moore are on board. These 2 made the comic I loved soar when I subscribed to it all those years ago. That's right, this is no Keanu Reeves version of our favorite Hellblazer. This is the real deal. His compatriots are back. His story arc and background story intact. I just finished episode 1 and like Gothem having Frank Miller &amp; Bob Kane (probably the best writers of Batman comics and going way back ) on the writing staff, this show Constantine will be appreciated by fans for what hopefully will be a sustained effort at excellence in writing and faithfulness to character. The Hellblazer of Alan Moore and Garth Ennis is a deeply flawed and nuanced John Constantine and with Chaz and Zed at his side this wrecking crew are sure to make a dent in hell's plots.<br/><br/>Other Comic luminaries that worked on the monumental character are Dave McKean, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman and Stephen Bissette.

442,Constantine, Could have been better,It is quite evident that the writers struggled to find a direction to this show.

I have greater hopes for the show knowing the Newcatle Crew and Astra are there and Zed will become part of the show (I mean, no bad feelings for Liv but she kind of reminded me of Rachel Weiss... NO THANKS) I'm very eager to see what's going to happen through the rest of the series and I know we'll get there, the point where everyone is satisfied (except for Alan Moore of course) BTW. 17 easter eggs to the DC Universe... just WOW.",58 out of 98 found this helpful.,10.0,27 October 2014

447,Constantine, First Two Episodes Review and Thoughts on the Series,"Constantine First Two Episodes Review: Better Than Gotham<br/><br/>DC Comics have premiered three different TV shows this fall. Combined with the already established show Arrow, DC now has four superhero-based shows across multiple networks (math), creating quite the foothold in the television medium. The latest show to premiere was Constantine. <br/><br/>Note: I put off writing this review because after the pilot, I didn't have a great feel for the show. Having now seen the first two episodes, I think I have a good idea of how the show will unfold. Also, I can confirm: It is better than Gotham. <br/><br/>SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Constantine is based on the successful DC (and more specifically, Vertigo) comic series Hellblazer. There was a film adaptation the comic a couple years ago starring Keanu Reeves. The movie was fun, but not great.<br/><br/>The main character of the show is John Constantine, an exorcist, demonologist, and, um, dabbler of the Dark Arts. <br/><br/>I am a fan of the Hellblazer comics and a huge fan of Vertigo Comics as a whole. I was not only excited to see the show's pilot, but also satisfied with what I saw. <br/><br/>Constantine's pilot was incredibly fun. The pilot was full of cameos, references, and smart-ass remarks (courtesy of John). Essentially, the episode's plot involves John helping an old friend's daughter by protecting her from a creature that is haunting her. I was worried that the daughter was going to be a permanent character in the show, but it looks like she was written out. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the girl was a great plot device because Constantine was constantly having to explain things to her, but her character was stereotypical and a little obnoxious. <br/><br/>After this pilot, all Constantine had done was save the girl, move into his dead friend's old house, and got a map with a bunch of supernatural disasters prophesied on it. It was at this point that I began to develop a suspicious thought. Later, I watched the second episode, and my speculation was confirmed.<br/><br/>Season 1 of Constantine is going to be just like the first season of Supernatural. <br/><br/>In episode two, John travels across the country to fight an unknown but prophesied force. Along the way, he met another, more interesting girl, who conveniently has the same skill set of the first one. Anyway, I have a feeling that this season is going to follow the ""Saving people, hunting things"" pattern.<br/><br/>But that's okay! For those of you don't know, Supernatural's first season had the Winchester Brothers fighting a different monster/threat each episode. Honestly, I this route is the most logical for Constantine's storyline.<br/><br/>It's Award Time<br/><br/>Best Performance: Matt Ryan as John Constantine<br/><br/>Best Reference for All the Nerds: The Doctor Fate Helmet. <br/><br/>Ahem. Prepare for a pretty big geek-out. In the pilot, the helmet of Doctor Fate is shown in the house wear Constantine is staying. <br/><br/>Holy crap! I pretty much lost my mind at that point. If Doctor Fate makes an appearance at any point in this show, it will be amazing. Oh! And what if something happens that causes Constantine to put on the helmet in order to win a fight or something?!? <br/><br/>Wooo. Breath. Don't worry, I'll be okay; just give me a minute.<br/><br/>Note: If you don't know who/what Dr. Fate is, then look it up! I don't think I can appropriately explain his significance.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>I have a problem with DC's TV series. They exist in their own universe, are not tied to the movies in any way, and only Arrow and The Flash are connected (at the moment). But Vertigo is predetermined to exist in a different universe than the rest of the DC universe (Vertigo comics take place in the magical universe of Europe). That's why I am okay with watching Constantine. There is no responsibility to watch any other shows or movies, and I don't need to worry about ridiculous continuity errors (*cough, cough* Gotham). It's just a fun show.<br/><br/>Constantine is not the best it could be. The show has a lot of plot holes and moments when things just don't make sense. There needs to be a lot more backstory explained in the coming episodes. Still, I believe in Constantine. It shows definite promise. I give the first two episodes of Constantine a combined score of 8.5/10. Watch the show and enjoy it. I promise it isn't that scary.",20 out of 33 found this helpful.,8.0,1 November 2014
448,Constantine, Constantine without the intelligence,"John Constantine is (as some people may know) a comic book character from the same company that counts Superman, Batman and such among its properties. But there are 2 main differences between Constantine and his ""colleagues"". While Superman and the likes are selfless ideals and more archetype than men. Constantine is fiercely human and, for the most part, deeply self-serving. He lives in an occult world of angels, demons, magic &amp; squalor. And this world is never black nor white, but always morally ambiguous and bathed in nuances of grey.<br/><br/>Others have pointed out that the TV series is a more faithful adaptation than the 2005 movie (of the same name). Which is something I actually disagree with. On the surface, yes, this TV Constantine resemble the comic book character a lot more, than the Keanu Reeves of Constantine the Movie. But where the Constantine movie actually had inspired visuals and a shimmer of intelligence. This pilot unfortunately doesn't even have that. And this is my point. If you want to do Constantine. He needs intelligence above anything else. The comics have a long track record of consistent intelligent writing.<br/><br/>In the Pilot we get acquainted with a Constantine who's remorseful for having a hand in the damnation of a little girl. He quickly gets a demonic ""letter"" telling him to go to America. Why would a demon invite someone to interfere with its plans? Constantine meets a girl that is tormented by, apparently, the same demon who invited him to the party. And after this the pilot is about introducing this girl (and the audience) to the world of John Constantine. Leaving us at the end of the episode with the setup for the rest of the season. Which is a map marked with locations across America where bad stuff happens. Basically the most lazy of plot devices for a show: A new case every week without having to describe how this case came about. Which again is far removed from the story telling of the comics. Where Constantine takes on different problems much more organically.<br/><br/>The writing is far from good with sub-par dialogue, unnecessary exposition dumps, lapses in logic and a character who can't figure out if he wants to be mysterious or give everything about him away. We are far removed from the mysterious &amp; intelligent Constantine of the comics, who only gives enough away, to serve his own selfish motives. One example of this dumb Constantine comes when a demon tries to trick him to let it go, with a very weak trick. Constantine falls for it instantly. Despite the fact that he's supposedly had so much contact with demons that he should be able to see through their tricks. But no.<br/><br/>The direction is serviceable but lack sophistication and undersells the action scenes.<br/><br/>The effects are hit an miss. Some are alright but others are just terrible. On top of that, the visuals of the pilot are just rehashings of the same clichés you see in the lowest budget horror films you can imagine.<br/><br/>The one good thing is Matt Ryan (who plays John Constantine). He looks the part and at times manage to hit the sinister charm of his character. There is great potential in this department.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the pilot generally leave little hope for the series in the future if you're acquainted with John Constantine from the comics. If you have no experiences with Constantine and don't mind less than stellar writing/direction/special effects. Then this show might be alright to kill some time with but nothing more.",55 out of 106 found this helpful.,2.0,28 October 2014

There is some promise here and the series will probably do better with those who aren't fans of the comic book or the horrible Keanu Reeves film. I like Matt Ryan and he brings a been there, sick of it, demon weary attitude that defines what I would expect of the character. And Charles Halford is OK as Chas Chandler, Constantine's version of ""Hrothbert ""Bob"" of Bainbridge."" The series has good spot following Grim and may find an audience.

450,Constantine, Brilliant use of comic book form FINALLY!!!!!,"Many might remember Keanu Reeves' Constantine movie. While a good movie it had nothing to do with the comic book character John Constantine. This TV series seems so far to be going back to the comic books and finally getting this character pretty darn close. He's a Brit. Blond. Trenchcoat. Miserable as all. And finally I saw him smoke a cigarette. THAT is John Constantine. I just fear that NBC will not give this show a chance. I hope they do and keep the characters and stories where they come from, the comic books. I have not seen Matt Ryan in anything else but he is spot on brilliant in this role. Plucked straight from the comics. Yes I am heavy on referring to the comics because that is where John comes from. Zedd is more mysterious in the comic and does not hang around so much but we need a female in the show and she can do it. I'm not sure about the Angel but let's see what he brings. This show though is all about one person and they are doing that person justice.",9 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,6 December 2014
451,Constantine, Sad,"This is based on the first episode only:<br/><br/>Such a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Given a script doctor to work on the exposition and dialog, this could've been an 8.x show. Instead it's a 6 at best (I landed on 5, after some deliberation -- that's ""decidedly average"", by the way, not ""horrible"").<br/><br/>The acting is, in places, decent. In others, it seems like the actors read the script, thought ""this is abysmal, how do you expect me to deliver this?"" and more or less just read the lines out loud.<br/><br/>Several scenes seemed cut for the sake of cutting. As if they had a two minute scene, were told to get it down to 30 seconds, and just used the first 15 and final 15 seconds and called it a day. There's not a surprising moment in the entire first episode, it's all broadcast well beforehand, but the way it's played out it seems the intent was to surprise. It's like cutting the audio in a horror movie, thinking no one can guess there is a jump scare coming.<br/><br/>It's possible that I'm just too old. That the target audience is 15-18-year-olds (I'm just about 40) and that this is quality to them. However, considering members of my family fall into that age bracket, that seems like an insult.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this should have been a rejected pilot. Re-shot and resubmitted as a great supernaturals show. As it stands, it's a missed opportunity that does not deserve a time slot unless what it's replacing is a reality show of some sort.<br/><br/>I'll watch an episode or two more, hoping my first impression is off, but I don't have high hopes.",71 out of 153 found this helpful.,5.0,25 October 2014
452,Constantine, An unintentionally tragicomic purée of Hellblazer scrapings.,"Like many others, I loved Hellblazer. There's a special place in my heart for its unique character and atmosphere, and for the rough, dark way it dealt with the supernatural. In many ways, though, that does not matter. I knew this was not going to be Hellblazer, but a televised version of the DC Comics reboot—a reboot which has justifiably gotten some pretty miserable reviews. My expectations were accordingly measured.<br/><br/>However, I'm an avid watcher of series like Supernatural (yes, still) True Blood and Hemlock Grove, besides more gritty fare such as American Horror Story and Hannibal. I adore horror, and so I figured there was no reason not to give Constantine a go.<br/><br/>With that in mind, watching the pilot episode, I tried to think of this simply as a new, American supernatural TV drama series. Sadly, Constantine does not even attempt to stand on its own. It pillages scrap upon scrap from the comic with an almost gleeful neglect of context, presenting the pickings in pompous, quick-fire scene succession with none of the depth, none of the tension, none of the soul that even the DC reboot could muster. The result is an unintentional self-parody of pulp horror cliché, its confused caricature accented by a soundtrack that seems to wilfully ridicule the action. In many ways, it is as if someone saw a house for the first time just before it was razed, and proceeded to pile up gables and gargoyles in the belief that a Gothic cathedral would magically appear.<br/><br/>Strangely, it seems the actors are making a better go of it than the script-writers and the directors. Occasionally, Matt Ryan (ghastly dye-job notwithstanding) will conjure up some proper John Constantine cheek, and most of the cast seems to have real talent. Sadly, all attempts at acting are instantly bulldozed by the ham-fisted direction.<br/><br/>In the end, I am left with the simple question ""why bother?"" The answer, sadly, probably has more to do with DC Comics' fervent wish to scramble onto the coattails of Marvel's recent success in film and television, and very little with any real interest in making a worthwhile TV version of Hellblazer/Constantine.<br/><br/>Perhaps the pilot—as is often the case—is poorly representative of the series as it will continue. We may hope, although it is difficult to see how the writers would turn the story into something coherent and inspiring after this butchery of an introduction.<br/><br/>In short: unless you are running pitifully low on television fare to feed your horror drama addiction, almost any other such series would be preferable to this. If television is not a must, and you haven't already read them too many times, go find the trade paperbacks of the original Hellblazer comic instead. Those are well worth your time.

Instead of being mesmerized by an original story, I felt like watching an episode of Supernatural season 4 or 5 (which were not bad), but I found that Constantine was missing the originality that made the comic so entertaining.<br/><br/>I look forward to future episodes to see if the series will pick up the pace or if I will move on to something else. I'm also concerned about John Constantine who was originally created with the profile of pop singer Sting. I did not see that reflected in the show and was a bit sad about it and I felt that the show lacked a strong presence at the helm.

I will say to all the Constantine fans that it has that something we all loved from the movie and despite not having Keanu or a Keanu look a like the protagonist manages to pull threw with his acting.<br/><br/>The script was good enough, the acting was OK and the world was awesome like in the movie.All and all i enjoyed way more than I thought I would and would recommend it.",21 out of 41 found this helpful.,8.0,25 October 2014

490,Banana Fish, great anime,"-this part of my review doesn't contain any spoilers-<br/><br/>if you're here you're probably interested in the series anyway so just give it a watch. for me this anime is 10/10, story is very emotional, art is unique and pleasant to watch, animation is great, soundtrack is just perfect and I love how different the characters are. watch. it.<br/><br/>-the rest of this review contains MAJOR spoilers. seriously don't read further if you haven't watched it thanks-<br/><br/>I guess the thing that's mostly disliked about this anime is how repetitive it gets in the middle of the show (a peaceful moment (usually short) -&gt; Eiji gets kidnapped -&gt; Ash goes and sacrifices himself -&gt; Eiji/gang/Max save Ash -&gt; repeat) But what people don't get is how different Ash is every time this cycle continues. He gets way more scared and the last time something like this happens he panics so much that people he works with are confused. It also shows how close he gets to Eiji throughout the series. I feel like this series has a lot of deep undertones that I would love to discuss but it's supposed to be a review so I won't go into that lol.
The only thing that disappointed me about this anime is the last 5-6 minutes of the ending episode. You're telling me Ash survived child trafficking, so many sexual assaults and life-threatening situations just to be killed by Lao? He wasn't suicidal so why didn't he even try to survive? Why didn't anyone in the library notice him? And Eiji goes to Japan even though he knows how unstable Ash is, even though he promised to stay with him forever.. There are rumours that Ash may have survived that so let's hope for the best.",18 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,26 December 2018
491,Banana Fish, Still Thinking About it,"The story is very realistic. The plot is very connected and always bring you surprise. Every episode is very heavy, but mixed with some comedy and it make me love even more.<br/><br/>Not like other anime, where everything happens slowly (a fight take for 1 or 2 episodes) or the pacing is very slow or the character reading their thought (it always drives me nuts), everything in Banana Fish is incredibly well-organized. The pacing is very accurate, give you enough time to feel and understand the situation (with beautiful music in the background) and not taking anything for a nonsense long time. Every dialogue is really connected to the story and also contain a profound meaning.<br/><br/>The animation is magnificent. The first anime that every scene has a good human proportion with both face and body. People interaction looks very realistic, and people in the background are not just standing like a mannequin, they always doing something like a real person. It makes the anime looks more realistic. The background: New York city with many gorgeous graffiti on wall and a splendid liberty statue; china town which always crowded with people, restaurants and lanterns; the Cape Cod's nostalgic view in a windy field with beautiful dawn (it's a very sad scene); and especially the gorgeous Los Angeles city filled with night lights from the mountain's view. Many camera angle choices are very unique and clever, the animation crew did an awesome jobs on this anime.<br/><br/>Soundtrack: its awesome, just listen and enjoy. My favorite is the ending song Prayer X by King Gnu, it gives me a nostalgic feeling mix of happiness and sadness (T.T).

The animation is clean and the music is understated.
Action scenes balance out nicely with moments of reflection in scenic landscapes.<br/><br/>If it has one flaw, it's that towards the end you can't breathe between the action scenes, which make the last 4 to 6 episodes feel ""crammed for time""...

The show let's viewers know that there are bad things in the world, but with the ferocity of people like Ash, it gives hope for the future. Some of the best moments are when Ash and the whole gang get the freedom to be who they want to be if they had a life without guns. It's great when Ash and Eiji can joke with each other. You can see humor peeking throughout the episodes. Very emotional, but with a shocking ending that both brings peace and restlessness to the soul. It inspires others to write, and I would definitely give credit to this show for any good plots I can come up with in writing. The nicknames of the show definitely match the creative personalities of the characters, and really bring these guys to life.

500,Banana Fish, Outstanding! Magnificent! Exhilarating!,"Watching this show in Christmas season may turn others off as this is a crime thriller anime filled with delinquent gangs, guns, violence, sexual abuse, and mental breakdowns. However, ""redemption"", ""peace"", ""forgiveness"" are some of the overlooked themes that audience miss. Despite its silly title, ""Banana Fish"", the dynamics among the characters is what keeps me watching the show (&amp; I don't mean that in a twisted way). It is true that there are a lot of disturbing scenes in this show. Putting that aside, ""What helps the characters moving forward despite their past traumas?"", ""What replenished their strength despite the horrifics of their current situation?"" It is terrifying, and truth be told, this could have been an anime that ended in its 1st cour (first 12 episodes), and it could have been great nonetheless. I think the second cour is filled with filler episodes to expand the friendship among the protagonists and to expand the action sequences. It can get repetitive, and you just want these characters to have a definitive happy ending. But it is open-ended I think (the ending), and there may be no true ending that will give complete satisfaction and peace to these characters. So I guess that is why the creator/author/illustrator left it sort of a cliffhanger for us audience. The author might be saying, ""I leave it all up to the audience on how they want my characters to find peace."" Having said that, the animation art and soundtrack of Banana Fish is outstanding! It's themes are relevant in our society! I will give it 10/10!",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,24 December 2019
501,Banana Fish, Not for everyone,"This anime left me with very conflicting feelings. It has many strong points, i.e delicate topics I've never seen covered in other animes, and a few, significant short-comings, which might be justifiable with the fact that the manga is rather old and very plot, instead of character, driven.<br/><br/>The plot development might be very unrealistic, but it does a good job at showing the harsh reality of how cruel this world can be. The main protagonist is surpassingly likeable, even though he is practically depicted as near-perfect (with a very very dark past). His character is very complex and well-written, and the character growth fairly well portrayed. You can't help to root for him..honestly he is probably the only reason I stuck with it until the end. But as mentioned, the story is mainly plot driven, which I think is a shame. With a character like Ash, there would have been so much more potential for further growth, in particular concerning his traumas, and I'd really loved to see that, but this is not that kind of anime sadly.<br/><br/>I watched this because I was looking for something similar to Yuri on Ice. Well, these 2 couldn't be farther apart, other than the same sex relationship they have nothing in common, at all. But even in regards to that, I felt like BF was lacking something. I prefer a little more romance, especially if the characters are so clearly meant for each other, but in BF the relationship between the 2 is very unclear. It's undoubtedly asexual in nature, understandably so regrading Ash's history, but personally I missed that whole aspect. I've read that this anime is very cherished by ace people, since they can identify with it, so maybe that's why I felt unsatisfied by the platonic nature of it all.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of people mad about the ending. Quite frankly, I didn't mind them going their separate ways in this, yet I wish It would've been more hopeful. But even so, no matter whether Ash is dead or not, both would make sense. He deserved some happiness and peace; if he couldn't have that with his ""friend"", then maybe death is the only way to finally get that for someone like him.<br/><br/>I had a hard time rating this. The thing is, I'm not particularly glad I watched it but it's a great anime nonetheless. Personally, I'm not into mafia stories and constant shootings and gang conflicts aren't my thing, so my experience watching this was probably about 6/10. But that wouldn't do this anime any justice. With the right expectations, and the right preferences in plot story, this could blow you away. I think if you go into it without expecting any romance at all, are looking for sensitive topics being part of the plot and wish some action in your anime, this is a right fit. If you're looking for something like Yuri on Ice, something to cheer you up and a duo that's very shippable, this isn't it.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,25 August 2020

508,Married at First Sight, Fascinating concept- could use major improvements.,"I just watched this as a marathon. I wanted to love it, kind of like Monet and Vaughn wanted to love each other, but some glaring issues remain:<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is that 1month is completely inadequate for an experiment such as this. I suggest at least 6 months to truly get to the depths of how two people adjust to an arranged marriage. I understand that there are other concerns when producing a TV show, but one month can't be taken seriously. It almost smells lazy in terms of production.<br/><br/>The show recycled sound bites way too much. It was awful listening to the same quotes every episode!<br/><br/>The matching process was hardly described- really vague. It made the first episode quite boring- which worked for me because I watched the wedding one first, so I was already hooked. But what would be educational about this show is to learn more about how they matched these couples.<br/><br/>Another suggestion: it might be beneficial to round out every episode with a therapy session for each couple. It's another chance to educate the audience on healthy ways to confront marital issues, and it might help redirect couples early on, thereby increasing their chances of staying together.",31 out of 34 found this helpful.,5.0,10 September 2014

But I soon realized it was anything but. I'd say I'd you're going to watch this then it may be worth watching the first season, but beyond that it's a waste of time. <br/><br/>Firstly, the success rate of this show is abysmal. Either the ""experts"" don't know what they're doing, or they're doing the best they can with the limited sample size, or both. I also feel like the show is really drawn out, which makes each subsequent episode more and more boring. But most importantly after 8 seasons and a 27% success rate means that this show has serious credibility issues. Clearly, whatever they are doing isn't working. If the success rate was higher, I'd actually be more open to the concept of this show.

It's time for these experts to see that this experiment is a HUGE failure and is wrong to continue. It seems they like to pair up couples that are very different in the hopes that their mate will change them. Big mistake! Lillian and Tom stayed married (so far), but I see them headed for a lot of problems in the future due to their so different work ethics. Season one none of the couples stayed married for even 6 months. That in itself should have been a big heads up for the producers and ""experts"" to see that their method is VERY flawed.

Seriously, every couple from every season seem to be the same. <br/><br/>I just watched this past season that is still on and the girl Heather is clearly NOT ready to be married! Her body language her attitude. How was she chosen? How is the vetting process? I do not feel these are ""real"" experts. I have volunteered to be an expert on this show and I guarantee the couples would stay together. As an intuitive I can see how people connect. <br/><br/>While the experts pick them because of their backgrounds they have to ""match"" them based on where they are in life now and who they are. Not because they both don't speak to their father's.<br/><br/>I don't feel this is realistic what is the purpose of this experiment? 6 weeks is NOT enough time to get people to connect in marriage.

On the honeymoon they all seem to have problems. <br/><br/>The experts contradict each other. <br/><br/>I was especially irked this season with Heather. She is being a bitch and pushing Derek away because she is not interested in him. Not attracted and does not want to try. She should of just said NO at the alter. It's pathetic.

522,Married at First Sight," Really, really, really, really, really slow moving","It's slow moving. As in, a snail could move faster. My step daughter's turtle could crawl her tank 1000 times and this show would still be in the initial introduction phase. Then again, the demographic seems to be for those around 12 or 14 years-old so perhaps the redundancy and slow pace is warranted for this reason. Basically, it's always 3 couples. They're matched and in an excruciatingly predictable manner. One couple will be extremely traditional, the next will be one or both partners being either blooming idiots or narcissists (depends upon the given season) and the last is always an ethnic token. One or two couples will almost always ""work out,"" at least for a time and the failing couple is meant to be a surprise as they try to lead the viewer to believe they'll be the ones with the lasting commitment but is not the case. It's basically what would happen if someone went on a matchmaking dating site that claims to use ""expert opinion and technique"" and married on the 1st date. Frankly, it appears to be toying with one's life however, if one decides to make such a choice then by all means hopefully it works out for them.

523,Married at First Sight," This isn't reality TV, it's filmed mental torture","You could argue that the participants know full well what they are getting into, so any humiliation they suffer is ""deserved"", and normally I'd agree. But this show goes to great length talking up the ""experts"" and their ability to be successful match makers, which I'm sure is sold to the contests in a very heavy-handed way, so I can understand why the contestants are getting an experience they didn't initially expect when signing up for this.<br/><br/>That being said, the ""experts"" are anything but. If as a licensed professional mental expert you think you can honestly evaluate two people's ability to coexist for life based on just a few hours of evaluation, you are a liar, a fraud, or just delusional. I've done the math, there's no way each hopeful participant (during the initial interviews) gets more than 15-30 minutes of 1:1 time, before the ""experts"" decide who should be with who. How can anyone possibly believe that's enough evaluation time?<br/><br/>If this show sold it to contestants that this was a roll of the dice, that it was pure luck to result in a successful marriage, that's kind of masochistic, but at least it's honest. No, instead these people are told that this match was a good match, it was ""scientific"" even.<br/><br/>That might sound harmless enough, but soon after the contestants independently realize they made a bad decision, the gaslighting by the ""experts"" begins. ""No honey, he's not secretly gay and using this as a publicity stunt to help his own career, he LOVES you!"" Marriages that are obvious train wrecks waiting to happen are forced to continue through endless gaslighting by the ""experts"" to keep up the ratings. It's pretty sick, especially since they all took an oath to ""do no harm.""<br/><br/>The terrible ""experts"" would be bad enough if that's the extent of the mental abuse the contestants suffer, but then let's add in that most of them are just terrible people, too.<br/><br/>If you've got a good job, and a decent body (as all the contestants always do), then if you're still single at 30 and willing to be on a reality show to ""find love"", there's a reason: Horrible mental baggage. Now, I'm not saying anyone who is single at 30 is a mental case, they are not. But THESE PEOPLE ARE. If you're willing to subject yourself to the humiliation that is marrying a stranger on reality tv? Yeah, there's issues there.<br/><br/>Why would anyone think marrying 2 people with huge baggage issues would ever result in success, is beyond me.<br/><br/>Final rant about this show: The ""experts"" continually refer to this show as ""an experiment."" Well after 10+ seasons, and only 5 marriages lasting more than 6 months out of 37+ couples, I can safely say the ""experiment"" is an utter failure.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,1.0,7 August 2020
524,Married at First Sight," The Best Reality ""Love"" Show","To understand my perspective, I started watching this show on Season 9, which I saw on Netflix. I was recommended this show by a friend. I am a man, married to a woman - just mentioning that for context.<br/><br/>When I watched this for the first time, I didn't look into reviews or the success rates of the couples, I simply started watching. What caught my eye right off the bat was that for a reality TV show, this is the one that is taking the most risks, and that is what intrigued me the most. The concept is that you have 3 experts on relationships and intimacy, working with a pool of about 40 men and 40 women and trying to find the best matches. They settle on 4 couples and they give them 2 months to determine if they would like to stick it out or get a divorce.<br/><br/>The risks? The experts are with them the whole time, monitoring their marriage, offering advice, and guiding these new couples (many of them that have struggled in past relationships) to make it work. The put it on themselves to make it work. For the couples themselves, their placed in a very vulnerable position and are followed in all aspects of life from marriage to honeymoon to normal life. You see everything, basically, and it can get emotional. They have a stake in the game to make it work as well. If it fails, you'll probably know why.<br/><br/>The show does SO many things right, especially compared to other love shows that I've watched (The Bachelor/Bachelorette are the main ones that come to mind). Most other love shows I've seen take a couple through the honey moon and fantasy stages of a relationship, but everything ends there. You don't see anything else, and everything is shallow. I typically watch these kinds of shows because they make me think of how I'm treating my own wife, and, while these shallower shows do give me pause and make me think, it's nothing very deep. Entertaining, though? Yes - the cat fights in the Bachelor mansion are pretty enjoyable.<br/><br/>Then comes along ""Married at First Sight."" At least in Season 9, I could tell that each couple was fairly serious about wanting a marriage and relationship - especially the women. As I watched, yes, the first few episodes go through the honeymoon phase of their relationship, but the show is so much more about how they get through life after the fact.<br/><br/>They STRUGGLE and the show isn't afraid of showing it, and the contestants talk about it - awkwardly at times, but they DO talk about it. These people are shown in their most vulnerable and emotional moments and what catches my attention is the TOPICS they are discussing. They are struggling with feelings of abandonment, sense of pride, breaking down barriers, virginity, understanding another human being, and being a good partner. And the role of the experts throughout all of this? They offer counseling to the couples - REAL counseling - not the shallow counseling you'd see in a host like Chris Harrison. There are serious problems/fighting/anxiousness that the love experts get to the bottom of like it was a couple's therapy session. They are unapologetic in their approach, which I appreciate. I don't want the show to be rose-colored all the time. This is as real as I've ever seen it get.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoy it because it makes me think how I am treating my wife - am I someone that is showing her the love and attention she needs? How do I compare to the men on the show in how they are treating the wives they just met? I wouldn't enjoy it if I didn't feel I was learning something from it and gaining an internal perspective from it. No, this show is not the Bible for marriage - but it is entertaining, and it makes me think deeper than I normally would, which I really appreciate. The genuineness of everyone involved in the show keeps me watching.<br/><br/>Regarding the success rate of the show? I hear that it's not good. There are success stories, though. That's not why I'm watching, though. The effort these couples and experts are putting into this is genuine. This is very real, and that is what I appreciate. I'm not watching a fantasy.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,8 June 2020
525,Married at First Sight, Marriage with the Perfect (?) Stranger,"This is a review for the second season of ""Married at First Sight"". There is another page for the first season.<br/><br/>""Married"" is a self-described social experiment, as are most reality shows. You put some people in an unusual situation and you see how they react.<br/><br/>In this case, a team of relationship experts collected tons of data on 7,000 candidates, then picked three men and three women who they determined to be suited for marriage--to each other. The six ""winners"" of this process then were told they would be getting married in ten days. To someone they would first meet at the altar. Pretty bold of the candidates, but they felt unsuccessful in their prior efforts to find ""the one"" and decided to let social science take its best shot.<br/><br/>The process requires the couples to marry, go on a one-week honeymoon, and make arrangements for cohabitation. At the end of six weeks, they are given the option of staying married or getting divorced.<br/><br/>The budding relationships are under stress, of course, but some start out better than others. But for all three couples, its a roller-coaster of emotions.<br/><br/>People sometimes make fun of ""The Bachelor"" because the participants expect to find a mate after just weeks of interaction. The fact that those weeks in no way resemble reality, because they are wined, dined and swept away to exotic destinations for once-in-a-lifetime dates, makes that show seem even more unrealistic. The differences with ""Married"" are that a) scientific matching is done up front and b) you don't get weeks to learn about someone before marrying. There is no proposal.<br/><br/>The series produces some touching moments and some that are tough to watch. There are surprises. See if you can figure out which couple will be the first to kiss.

Shouldn't scientists ask whether that tradition is worth emulating? And do so BEFORE building an elaborate experiment?<br/><br/>Fourth, to the extent that arranged marriages work at all, the family relationships play a HUGE role, and that starts long before the marriage. In the show, the sociologists are substituting for the families, which doesn't work, because the sociologists have no skin in the game. Other than producing an entertaining show.<br/><br/>I think I might have been able to stomach the show if they hadn't pretended that what they're doing is science. And if they'd selected more mature candidates. The men and women selected are all so immature it's a wonder they can even hold down jobs let alone stumble their way to happiness in an arranged marriage.

532,Drop Dead Diva, Wonderful new series on Lifetime,"""Drop Dead Diva"" is a new series on Lifetime. The pilot is very enjoyable, mainly because of the star, Brooke Elliot, who is fabulous. She plays a brilliant, highly successful attorney, Jayne, who pays no attention to her appearance - she's on the heavy side, and her hair is long with no style. One night, she stays late at the office, and a man, angry with one of the partners, comes in with a gun. She is killed. At the same moment of her death, a shallow, pencil thin, blonde beauty named Deb is driving to an audition to be a prize demonstrator on The Price is Right and crashes while putting on lipstick. Upset that she's dead, once in heaven, she hits a ""return"" button when the check-in person isn't looking. She ends up with Jayne's body, Jayne's brains, and her own memory.<br/><br/>I love the premise - it's been used in movies before, but usually seriously. Some of the scenes are great, including when Deb first sees herself as Jayne, Jayne trying to get into Deb's clothes - I won't spoil it for you. Since Deb has inherited Jayne's brain power, she's thrilled that she's now smart, and certainly knows how to deal with competitive women, which Jayne did not. I love how Elliot incorporates Deb's bubbly personality beneath the person of Jayne.<br/><br/>Very well cast, with Margaret Cho as Jayne's assistant and Kate Levering, a talented Broadway actress, as Deb's friend Kim.<br/><br/>Great fun, and I'm so happy that Lifetime has been branching out from its women in jeopardy theme.",58 out of 71 found this helpful.,8.0,21 July 2009

I like it that the Jane Bingum character has a golden moral compass and yet is playful like a Sex in the City girl. Kudos to the creator and writers for creating a character that is like a real person. The Jane Bingum character reveals great sensitivity and vulnerability along with areas of great strength and fortitude. This is no ""one note"" character like the many that usually populate series TV shows. Drop Dead Diva is both high drama and wry comedy by virtue of its excellent writers.

I loved and love a lot of TV shows (most of them already ended), but since my late teens I for the first time am really thrilled with the main character of the TV show, as well as I can well put myself in almost every position she's in (except, huh, for having your soul trapped in a wrong body). It's like in many TV shows and movies we only get these 'super white big smile nice body' actors and actresses which all look great and at the same time almost the same and just as unreal as Santa to any grown-up, but this time we are getting this new character which is awesome, beautiful, and at the same time just like me, you or someone next to you. And I really love that. Long live the show as there is one fan for you here already",39 out of 50 found this helpful.,7.0,25 September 2009
537,Drop Dead Diva, The End a Disappointment,"They took a good show and murdered it. I was particularly disappointed that Jane did not do the singing in the last show!!!!! The story line became so stupid it was beyond fantasy. It should have ended with the wedding and if they wanted it to end with the babies, how about showing some newborns and the cast gathered around the mom. If that put too much focus on Stacy, then have Jane hold one kid and say the things they said going into her house. They could talk about their own kids while holding the new baby. I was all a big mes. At least they found someone for Kim at the end. I kept thinking of the show when it started. It was really good. I enjoyed the singing when Jane would sing like a regular person not in a dream. Why did they stop her from singing? The first three seasons were the best.",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,4.0,26 June 2014
538,Drop Dead Diva," Deep, engaging and fun!","Between the excellent cast that seems to mesh so well together, the clever, poignant and fast-paced fun scripts, and constantly interesting subject matter, this show is ready to become Classic TV.<br/><br/>Jane is so cute, and such an excellent actress, Stacy is just adorably ditzy, and such a great co-star/supporting actress. She just seems so genuine, like anyone would want her as a friend, and so true to Jane.<br/><br/>All of the acting is superb, and how they jive with each other seems completely unscripted, and real.<br/><br/>Every episode catches me, so I mourn when it's over. It's the perfect mix of light and fun, with deep and thought-provoking. Please don't make us wait so long for the next season!!! Lifetime should advertise this more in other forums, and on other channels, this show could really make them money.",26 out of 33 found this helpful.,10.0,1 July 2011
539,Drop Dead Diva, Brooke Elliott is a Delight!,"I rarely watch Lifetime because their programs, in my opinion, always seem like the same, lame, made-for-women schmaltz. But I have to state that ""Drop Dead Diva"" was so very good! We've seen many movies with this plot: two people die at the same time but one person's soul enters the other's body and has to live that life. Brooke Elliott is delightful as the plump woman who winds up with a thin, empty-headed, self-absorbed woman's soul. I love the way she discovers her new self after a tragic accident and is quite convincing. Elliott is so cute as she enters this new world as a thin soul in a plump body. Her laugh is contagious. Her pain is convincing when in a moment of clarity she finds out how other people suffer. The producers of this show so far have not made it too preachy (don't judge people by their appearance), or too lightweight (they don't spend too much time on the thin woman's life). If this program continues to focus on ""Jane"" in the here and now without lots of flashbacks on the other woman...they have a hit on their hands. I love the thin friend too. She's adjusted and accepted her friend in a new form.",19 out of 24 found this helpful.,7.0,25 July 2009
540,Drop Dead Diva, DDD has its charm !,"Even though I'm not among the typical target group of this show I like ""Drop Dead Diva"" season one. From my perspective this show did a lot right, starting with a more than just likable, talented cast and nicely written often touching stories.<br/><br/>""DDD"" is a show trying to prove that there's always more than meets the eye. For example on the one hand we got Jane. She's not the type of woman who meets typical TV beauty ideals. Her body in combination with the personality of Deb - at first sight the ""typical"" young blonde woman - two stereotype extreme's meet. But when you learn to know her better, I'd say it's hard not to like her(especially during the second half of season one, when she's becoming emotionally more stable). Then there's Stacy. At the first glance I didn't like her. Turns out this is a truly wonderfully written character, getting funnier with every episode. In my opinion the best character of the show. I can't imagine ""DDD"" without her. <br/><br/>As for now female characters are definitely leading the show. I think that male characters could use a little more space to develop beyond their surface. Another aspect bothering me: ""Drop Dead Diva"" starts with this angel/heaven/return button plot. A Setup where anything seems possible. Unfortunately most of the time the show doesn't make use of these possibilities. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed many of them very very much but if it goes on like that it might risk to become like other lawyer TV-shows or remind of films like ""Legally Blonde"".<br/><br/>In short: ""Drop Dead Diva"" is lovely, positive and life-affirming. Good people doing the right thing, while confronting prejudices, stereotypes and other social injustices. Sometimes it reminded me of ""Ally McBeal"" - probably not as great and funny as Ally during it's best times, but it's doing quiet a fine job!",19 out of 26 found this helpful.,7.0,30 October 2009
541,Drop Dead Diva, Not your average TV show,"OK, you KNOW if Margaret Cho is involved, there will be some decent writing. As much as I like the show, Cho's is my favorite character. She fires up any scene she's in. Wait, no Fred is my favorite character. And Grayson. And Jane! Everybody's interesting, seriously, and the acting is really right on. The premise is Freaky Friday meets LA Law, but add in a guardian angel, smart chicks, models, and fresh story lines.. and hey, you've got my attention. Drop Dead Diva is unpredictable, but with the likable hooks surrounding romance, achieving partner, and beauty. You can stream it on Netflix, which is slightly addictive.

And I was hooked. I always set my DVR to record it now.<br/><br/>This show is so funny and witty. I like all the cast members, no one is overly annoying, even Kim can be OK at times. I can't wait for the next season. I hope this show stays on too, my sister also got me hooked on Kyle XY and Veronica Mars and both of those great shows were canceled. I hope this show can hang in there and get the viewers it deserves.",18 out of 25 found this helpful.,9.0,19 October 2009
543,Drop Dead Diva, Who saw the REAL Deb; Grayson or the Heavenly Records?,"I absolutely loved this show for all the reasons others who have given high ratings did. That being said, I do have one confusion.<br/><br/>When Deb dies and the gatekeeper (Fred) assesses her to check whether she should go to heaven or hell, her deeds come unto a flat 0-0. Which means she has done neither good deeds or bad deeds in her life. In fact Fred even tells her that she's neither a good person, nor a bad person, just simply a shallow person. And this is the premise given in the show summary too which describes Deb as a ""vapid"" aspiring model.<br/><br/>And yet.....Grayson, an intelligent, charismatic, as well as kind man, loved Deb with all his heart and considered her his soulmate. He even goes on to berate Jane (after he got to know that she was really Deb) for even thinking that he wouldn't love her in Jane's body and says ""Did you really think I was that shallow"" and also says that he would have gone through fire to get Deb back because he loved her so damn much. So if he wasn't just infatuated with her looks, what did he love about Deb so deeply, if she really was a 0-0 as the Heavenly records showed? I really don't get that.<br/><br/>I'm inclined to think that the Heavenly records were wrong on this. One reason I have for thinking this is, in one flashback to Deb's life, we are shown how she and Grayson first met. And right before Grayson bumps into her, she points out to Stacey a girl sitting sadly in a corner by herself and tells Stacey that she's going to go and talk to her. This is a pretty kind thing to do. It's not something a completely shallow, self absorbed person would do. Such a person would not even notice another person sitting by themselves looking lonely. I really wish the show gave Deb's character more credit rather than making her out as just ""vapid"" and nothing more.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,20 January 2019
544,Drop Dead Diva," Used to be good, then turn into day time crap","They need to bring back Jay Parker, hands down, and cut the ""original Jane"" character, and stop making Stacey make so insanely stupid decisions and being extremely dramatic, like suddenly going on needlessly urgent search for sperm donors to have a baby, sacrificing her relationship with Jane just to briefly hook up with Owen, then for no reason at all making a big deal and breaking up with Owen. It makes me sick to my stomach. Owen's character used to be so in love with Jane, for him to suddenly pick up Stacey and act all natural make it seem unbelievable and audience lose respect of him. You can tell the actor playing Owen (a very good actor) even has a hard time trying to make it seem justifiable! Any self-respecting actor will feel the writing is crap. What a waste of a good cast! If they are doing a sixth season and want to retain followers and attract new viewers, they NEED to do the following: 1) Their most urgent need right now is to bring Parker back and keep Kim around! These two are immensely appealing and drawing actors and characters. They bring depth and charisma to the show. 2) Secondly, make Stacey herself not a crazy friend betraying, sperm-crazy, lunatic mom! 3) last but not least, bring Jane and Grayson together already. It's painful and annoying to watch another episode where the show tries desperately to drag on the suspicion with irrational plots of surprises coming up last minute or interruptions during their confessions. It's not interesting anymore nor suspense. Just plain disturbance and people are losing interest fast. They need to move the show onto new grounds and stop spoiling a fresh idea by lazily adopting old tricks to fool the audience. These writers and producers need to get real and make a honest living, or most viewers will not return. If they follow these suggestions, I think they will find the show more successful. If they don't heed advice from the very people the show's trying to draw, they aren't very smart.",11 out of 15 found this helpful.,5.0,6 December 2013

546,Drop Dead Diva, Enjoyable new series,"A light-weight comedy, and quite enjoyable if somewhat formulaic. Have I seen this somewhere before? Apart from the main stars, the additional characters add some depth to the series. And it is nice to see the unexpected guest star (ref Liza Minnelli). Why the 'dumb blondes'? Why should it be expected that blondes would be dumb. I'm not! The story revolves around a model who died and came back to life in another body - a lawyer no less, and the cases she becomes involved in.<br/><br/>The romantic interest is different, as the boyfriend (played by Jackson Hurst) just can't let go of his dead love. Although I find it difficult to see how an intelligent lawyer such as Grayson Kent would fall for a vapid would-be model. But then I'm a woman, and who knows how men would respond.<br/><br/>All in all, the show is worth watching if you simply want to blob out.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,8.0,10 May 2011
547,Drop Dead Diva, Top notch! Surprisingly better than you'd think!,"When I first heard about this show, I was quite enthusiastic to see it. It sounded like it would be quite funny, in a slapstick sort of vein.<br/><br/>In reality, the show is more of a drama than a comedy. There are certainly comedic moments, but it's definitely a drama first and foremost. I was expecting a comedy that might have ""some"" drama.<br/><br/>Here's the thing -- it works! *Wonderfully* In fact, the show seems to get better and better each week. I think it truly reached its stride with the episode that guest starred Elliot Gould. It was wonderful (as was his performance). I even get teary eyed at the ending!<br/><br/>For me, the show has filled the void left by ""Boston Legal"" without being a total rip off of it. There are moments QUITE reminiscent of BL in fact -- minus David E. Kelly's preaching (which really went overboard as that show reached its final episodes). Still, the characters in this are much more tame, and still quite enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Brooke Elliott is a true find in the lead role. She's amazing in it. The supporting cast are also terrific. Everyone in it was cast extremely well. And that Jackson Hurst. He is also a terrific find -- a definite leading man!<br/><br/>I'm quite saddened to see only five other comments on this show as of this writing (well four and one legal dissection). This is a very well done show and it deserves more fans. I think, in a way, the title (which is actually very clever), is the show's downfall. It suggests a slapstick comedy, but in reality, the show is a whole lot more.<br/><br/>I'm thoroughly impressed. I hope it lasts. It deserves to.",10 out of 16 found this helpful.,9.0,26 August 2009
548,Drop Dead Diva, Decent show,"This show is alright. It's often funny and heartwarming, and the legal stories are usually pretty interesting too. I utterly loved the characters of Stacey and Fred, in particular. For the first 2-3 seasons, I was pretty hooked on this show.<br/><br/>I gave it only 5 stars for a reason, though! They really could've cut a good season or so from it without harming the story at all- it drags a bit in seasons 4 &amp; 5, though 6 was better. There are times when it gets into preachy territory - people who get irritated by social justice warriors, be warned, there are a few nauseatingly politically correct and preachy episodes. Jane's character and the poor communication between some characters started to grind on me toward the end, but the series end was satisfying nonetheless.<br/><br/>All in all, yeah, it was a decent show.

555,Drop Dead Diva, A Drop dead review,"Can i say that i absolutely love this show. If you guys are ever tired of watching heavy shows with zombies, vampires,stalkers and everything, this show is for you. This is a show that in one sitting you will watch it. It is a really loveable, comfy, hilarious show, i honestly don't have the words to describe how good and amusing it is. This show follows the life of a model named Deb who gets into a car crash and suddenly she wakes up into an another body, in details in a body of an overweight, very intelligent lawyer who basically changes everything about how Deb sees. I like Deb, but i love her so much more in Jane's body, there is something so loveable, comfy in Jane that we just can't help and love her more and as well as her crazy assistant Teri. The characters are awesome, everyone unique in their own way, the cast is spot on, the plot, world building, i loved it, that is all i've got to say. Oooh and i also think that Jane dresses better than any model out there, there are many top fashion advices in this show also which it makes better than watching some serious fashion show, just saying. I definitely recommend this to everyone, give it a try guys, i promise it is not some dumb show that will disappoint you, it is really great and with some really talented actors.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,9.0,29 June 2018
556,Drop Dead Diva, Pretty decent thus far,"This show is actually quite charming. It has it's equal blend of humorous and dramatic sides, and the characters are reasonably likable.<br/><br/>However, the plot isn't necessarily that original. For one thing, it is quite similar to the movies of ""Legally Blonde"", with the story being about the once dumb blonde turning into a lawyer and ends up doing a good job, and learns new things about life.<br/><br/>Minus the part where the protagonist dies and enters the new body, it just feels like the same. At least for now.<br/><br/>Another thing, is no doubt the noticeable division between two types of women, with ""unattractive but smart and caring"" and ""Attractive but vain and self centered"" - or to stretch it out into another category, the blonde is dumb but the brunette is intelligent. Do we honestly have to use hair colour again to imply how a person really is? I'm not entirely fond of this blend. Especially if one desires to notice also that all the men in this show are both equally handsome AND smart. Why is this sort of division only apply to women? And very specific? That being said however, I will admit once more that the show is quite pleasant. It is the first pilot after all, so hopefully it will develop some more and broaden the horizons, and certain characters get more character development.<br/><br/>At least with shows like ""Ugly Betty"" (Which I love) every character equally goes through development, despite their assigned roles. Regardless of their appearances, status in the fashion industry and intelligence, all had made mistakes, show a humane side and progressed.

Example:Zapata finding out about Andreas drive was so unnecessary and he was there just to take steal the drive on time. Jario never got a chance to see it. Jario getting bribed by the vilian- I mean there were too many things happening at the same time to procure the event from not happening and after one point it just feels so scripted. I mean Macarena is rich enough to kidnap a guywhy didnt she do the same with Zapata when he blackmailed her? How did Zapata find out about the drugs Ivan stole ? Why were the Rojas in communication with Philip in the start of the season if they didnt know about his dissapearance because of killing Alvaro. I feel there were alot of loose ends in the end. And lastly there was a planned blast and all the boys along with triana were dancing but only she died. It doesnt make sense.

593,Pandora," Lower than expected Budget, simple fair, but, perhaps, give it a chance. Too soon to call.","I just watched the first episode of this.
I seems this is a lower budget offering. If you're watching the fantasy show The Outpost, it's of similar budget, in writing, production value, acting, direction and effects, but, sci-fi instead of fantasy.<br/><br/>It feels like a made for TV show, similar to how the old Xena, Hercules productions were all relatively lower budget shows, though, they were still worth watching.<br/><br/>It's too soon to say if this can be another Xena or Hercules as far as popularity, since we seem to expect and require a LOT more sophistication in story telling, set pieces, and everything else these days when we get spoiled by big budget productions like GoT, The Walking Dead, Star Trek Discovery, etc.<br/><br/>It's probably 1/2 a notch below The Orville in production value, but, The Orville doesn't take itself seriously while this feels like it wants to be more than it is.<br/><br/>I'll continue to give this one a chance.
The Swamp Thing has a bigger budget, and I'm watching that, though, I'm putting an effort into trying to like it.
I dunno. The whole Flash, Supergirl, Arrowverse formula works really well, and I love those shows even though they're low budget, but, i suspect this is less than half the budget of those per episode.<br/><br/>Eh, We'll see.<br/><br/>Recommendation: I think it's too soon to make a call on this. There are, however, tons of shows that've had far greater popularity, better writing, more likable characters, and production value that've gotten the axe almost right off.
if you find you really love this show, don't invest too much, because I expect they're depending on the low budget as one of the selling factors for renewal, but, that might maybe not be enough.<br/><br/>I say give this show a chance to grow and develop, but, don't get married to it.

Using friends who can't act, no script, locations like classrooms and bars and an etch a sketch for the special effects he managed to sell it to the CW.

I can't understand why they waste so much money on extras - when the money could go to special effects?

At the end of the season, it's still hard to know who the lead Jax Zhou ""is"" and why we should care about her - which is a problem. It's an odd mishmash of serialized and episodic storytelling - but they don't seem to understand what that means. Too little given to the interesting elements - too much given to the things that are forgettable. That said, the building blocks are there. The dynamics that could be built upon are there. And the writers are obviously thinking of the right things when they're building the scripts, it just gets diluted and lost somewhere along the way. I'm a huge sci-fi fan, who longs for some good old fashioned content. Every show has a learning curve, so I'll absolutely be tuning in next season.

611,Liar," One third good, two thirds disappointing","No matter the execution, anything that explores the subject of rape and its consequences is to be applauded. Rape is a very harrowing and sensitive subject and a difficult one to explore, considering how it affects the victims afterwards, and other people's misconceptions and ignorance (how many times have people resorted to victim blaming and saying they asked for it?). Talking about it and the consequences in real life and on film and television is incredibly brave and important to address.<br/><br/>'Liar' had such a good premise and had potential to be a strong, thought-provoking, harrowing and poignant character study and exploration of this horrible crime, the questions of who's innocent and who's guilty and how it affects the victims afterwards. While it is nowhere near as bad as some of the reviews have said, and some of the criticisms have been blown out of proportion, 'Liar' was a let down and didn't do enough with such a good and potentially relatable premise. There are good things here. 'Liar' actually does start off very well, excellently in fact.<br/><br/>The first two episodes were riveting and were exactly what the advertising promised. They held our attention and really made us question who was guilty and who was innocent without ever making it obvious either way. One really feels the female lead character Laura's pain and anguish. Credit is due too in that the subject is never trivialised although not fully explored from Episode 3 onward, Laura's desperation, emotional journey and her scrutinised, harsh treatment are more than capably acknowledged and convincing.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Liar' looks great with atmospheric locations, cohesive editing and photography that's slick and matches the characters' thought processes very well. The music is haunting but understated. The acting is very good, with the series being carried by a heart-wrenching, emotionally complex and clearly troubled Joanne Froggatt and an intense and charming (one effectively questions whether this charm is genuine or deceptive) Ioan Gruffudd, haven't seen him this good in a long time and his confusion is also believable. Of the supporting cast, all good considering what they had to work with, the most interesting and sympathetic is the female detective Vanessa played dynamically by Shelley Conn.<br/><br/>It is such a pity that such great potential goes off the boil, with the series taking a complete 180 and never really recovering. This is including the ending, which some have said was shocking, to me it wasn't that surprising and it felt rushed too. The tautness of the first two episodes script-wise is replaced by clunky dialogue and that it becomes biased and one sided (not sure about the sexism and feminist complaints but can kind of understand that about negative male stereotyping). What started off as an intriguing and promising character study became from Episode 3 onward overwrought melodrama and odd decision making.<br/><br/>Apart from Vanessa, the supporting characters are completely stock and as flimsily developed as you can possibly get, so the character study promise is thrown out of the window after the first two episodes. Let's not get started on the portrayal of a strong contender for the most incompetent police force in film and television in a long time. The initially riveting story-telling of the first two episodes becomes contrived, dull, muddled and one-sided for the other two thirds.<br/><br/>Rape, the conflict of guilt vs. innocence in the series, whether it was rape or not and the consequences are not harrowing or poignant enough in how they're written, very much lacking in tension and suspense. Further hampered by the inclusion of nowhere near as interesting or relevant (too many are really soap-operatic and contrived) subplots that take over too much and distract from the main story, which is not focused on enough. There are many twists here, almost too many, but some are far better done than others and too many of them are predictable and clunky, almost too thrown in.<br/><br/>Overall, great potential and started off so well but declines rapidly too early. 4/10 Bethany Cox",46 out of 73 found this helpful.,4.0,21 October 2017

Because the main theme here is rape and it's concequences.<br/><br/>***This review contains spoilers***<br/><br/>Watching the first episode I was hooked enough to give it at least the benefit of the doubt. And sure enough the first episode got me intrigued and left me wondering who was the liar.<br/><br/>Then episode 2 happened... basically proving me right all along. It's exactly one of those series. It's almost like the scriptwriting office got overrun by mouth-foaming SJW and Feminazis half way through the writing of episode 2 and took over from there on out.<br/><br/>The detectives, I don't even know how they got through the academy. They don't even ask the obvious questions. Somehow the man is already guilty of his crimes even though there is no evidence whatsoever and her story is shaky at best. It's no coincidence that it's also the female detective that's absolutely sure he did it.<br/><br/>But the woman breaking into the man's house, asking her ex boyfriend (who is a cop) to see if he can do anything to get the man's house searched for substances by a drug squad. Which is clearly obstruction of the investigation. The detectives know about it! They even mention it! For the love of god man! There is a man accused of rape and it's by no means even sure he actually did it. But the woman who is actually guilty of entering the man's house without permission, getting his house searched behind the detectives back and she's not even going to get arrested for that? And lets not forget the fact that she posted the allegation on social media, basically dragging his name through the mud without any tangible evidence just because she can.<br/><br/>Now I'm getting to the best part... which basically sealed the deal for me. During episode 2 or 3, can't remember which one there is a scene where the show gives you statistics: Every year in the UK there are 87000 rape allegations and only 5,4% of them actually turn into convictions. What the show doesn't say and mention is How many of those allegations are fake?<br/><br/>If you are writing a show, which the whole premise of said show is the ambiguity of a rape allegation of this nature one would expect to provide the viewer with ALL the statistics, not only those which are carefully selected by entitled feminazis and SJWs in order to put forward their own agenda.<br/><br/>This show wants you to feel sorry for even considering that woman never falsely accuse men of rape. That doesn't happen! don't mention it you masogynist! This show wants you to believe that men in high positions (a highly qualified surgeon in this case) are rapists and that you shouldn't date one. This show wants you to believe that a female detective knows, she just knows the man is guilty, everything no matter how credibly is of no concern. The man is guilty and I'm going to go to his house and deliver a folder 'the meaning of consent' after telling him no one is going to press charges against him or go to court.<br/><br/>Save yourself these 6 hours and go do something else that's actually worth spending your precious time on.",81 out of 157 found this helpful.,3.0,26 September 2017

The makers first introduce the accuser a very prominently neurotic woman, who only does and say irrational and annoying things and the accused, a well balanced, gentleman a great doctor and father, a rational, friendly, modest character. And just when the man is cleared of charges, something almost any viewer would be cheering for by then, things take a sudden 180 turn, but it's not the circumstances that change but in a rather unnatural, unrealistic way the characters do. The neurotic woman suddenly becomes an empathetic, courageous warrior of justice and and the gentleman doctor a wolf in sheep's clothing, a psychopathic predator enjoying his sick game with a wide sadistic grin on his face.

Even though I am a man, a gay man, I consider myself a feminist, and here in Argentina there is this new current of ""die man"", ""let's cut men's penises"" and all that but honestly, feminism is not about it, not really. It has to do with actually empowering women to reach their maximum but in the end it's just another trend. Real feminism is another thing and I do agree with other people here, this feels like it's been written by another of those feminazis that are around, her not being the victim would have been and interesting twist.

Nevertheless, such a program came into fruition in the form of Silver Spoons, when it debuted on NBC in September 1982. Joel Higgins was perfect as Edward Stratton III, a wealthy man who discovers that he is the father of a 12-year-old boy named Ricky Stratton, played by Ricky Schroder. But who could have guessed that someone like Ricky Schroder, known for dramatic movies such as The Champ and The Earthling, would star in a sitcom? Regardless, Schroder was great as Ricky Stratton.<br/><br/>Silver Spoons is an enjoyable sitcom. The series ran for five years, on NBC from 1982 to 1986 and in first-run syndication from 1986 to 1987. It produced a total of 116 episodes. That was a good run.

His stepmother and father's secretary was played by Erin Gray better known for her female role in the short-lived series, Buck Rogers. Everybody knew that they would get together. Anyway the Strattons live in Long Island, we also got to see Jason Bateman before he became famous. I liked Christina Belford who played the mother and former wife, Mrs. Stratton.

636,Silver Spoons," Eaaau, the 80s","Unashamedly 80s, Silver Spoons was pretty decent TV show and I really can't imagine my childhood without this series. The strange thing is that I don't even remember much from this program (I just know that I liked it), as I don't think I've watched it since the 80s, so I'm doing my best from memory. The main character was sort of a take off on the character of ""Richie Rich"", 12 year old Ricky Stratton was a boy who had an obnoxiously wealthy father who was pretty immature himself. His father had a mansion that was decked out with toys, games and a giant train set. There were some memorable characters (Alfonso, Derek, J.T., the prissy Dexter) and episodes on this show. I do remember this series being sort of like a cartoon, where the kids had unrealistic adventures in the span of 30 minutes. The series could range from pretty cool to cringe worthy. There was a hilarious episode where Ricky hired Mr. T to be his bodyguard. There was also an episode where Menundo guest starred,...man I feel pretty damn old for knowing who Menundo are. I remember the networks gave up on Silver Spoons after a while, it then went into cheapo syndication where it dragged on for a couple more years. They were likely on target getting rid of Silver Spoons after only a few years, because I believe the series overstayed it's welcome. It ran from 1982-'87, when it probably should have went off the air in 1985. When the kids got older it became pretty dumb watching them repeating the same old antics and trying to be so cool with their Duran Duran style and riding that train when they were 17.

638,Silver Spoons, One of the best shows from the 80's,"This was one of those shows from the golden decade of the 1980's and this show was produced by the same individuals who brought us the shows of our day:""Different Strokes"",and the others? The short-lived sitcom ""Hello,Larry"",""The Facts Of Life"",""Who's The Boss?"",and so much more. ""Silver Spoons"" really brought audiences into the spotlight the young and talented Ricky Schroder and with the presence of his abilities and his other talents took this show to the top of the Nielsens for three out of its five seasons that it ran on NBC-TV from 1982 to 1987. This was indeed a huge favorite with the teenage set during the decade that brought out a lot and so much,much more. Ricky Schroder stars as super rich-kid millionaire Ricky Stratton-the kid who has it all,the toys,the girls,and everything else under the guidance and supervision of his father,Edward Stratton III,a single father who is coming from a painful divorce to raise his son alone played by Broadway sensation Joel Higgins and his biological mother,also facing a divorce as well who is in custody of the child,played by Christine Belford. Edward's assistant is<br/><br/>Dexter Stuffins(Franklyn Seales)who watches over the youngster in times of trouble,where Ricky usually gets into sometimes,along with the kooky and sometimes stuffy grandfather Edward Stratton II(played by the great John Houseman)along with Edward Stratton III's hot new girlfriend whom he would later married on in the series,Kate Summers(played by the gorgeous hottie Erin Gray).<br/><br/>This show had it all and about that house this kid had! He had an arcade style game room in the family den,a build-in train set that went throughout the house along with other accessories that he had-any kids dream house,a house full of toys and presents and just about everything else! But still he had the same problems other kids his age growing up since some of the times he could be totally obnoxious,and there were times when the father and the son learn a lot from each other since most of the episodes really concentrated on the ""little lessons"" here that each member provided and from there you can tell this was a family-oriented show with a little something extra insight in some of the episodes produced. And those friends Ricky had? One of them was his best-buddy J.T.(played by Bobby Fite),Freddy(played by Corky Pigeon), and the unpredictable Derek,who was in my opinion the Eddie Haskell of the show who was always trying to get Ricky is some hair-brained scheme and ends up being one of his closest friends,and that was played by Jason Bateman.<br/><br/>The best part about this show was during the series' third season,another character was introduced and the debut of Alfonso Ribeiro as Ricky's pal and close buddy,Alfonso Spears. Anyways,the show had some of the pop culture items from that era,and its a crying shame that the series ""Silver Spoons"" isn't shown in certain markets and I wanna know what is the holdup? Come on? Nick-At-Nite,TV Land,ABC Family Channel or Spike TV,get with it! Bring back this show! Getting back to the era of the show,the culture items from that decade were on this program: Topsider boat shoes,Michael Jackson dance moves,The RUN-DMC Collection,Break dancing,Shell-toed Adidas shoes,The Michael Jackson collection-everything from the items that were included--the glove,the hat,the shoes,the jacket from the video ""Beat It"",everything from Madonna too,and those Members Only Jackets were included in some of the episodes.

640,Silver Spoons, Well to this point all of the characters Ricky Schroder played had a tough time of it.,"Yes, if the poor kid was not by his dying father after a heavyweight fight he was having to deal with the loss of both parents in a mobile home accident then having the guy teaching him how to survive die. Yes, poor little Ricky had it rather rough, but then he got a gig on this show as a rich kid who finally gets to meet his father and live a life he has always dreamed of. Not sure what happened to the mother, but given little Ricky's past of tragedy she most likely succumbed to some long and painful disease as he sat by her bedside. Well I am not sure that happened all I know is that the first episode had him meeting his dad for the first time and finding that his dad was rich and was a kid at heart himself so he had lots of neat toys and video games in the house, so as a kid I thought that was cool. The early episodes were the best, but none of the show was what you would call spectacular. A lot of awkward episodes in the mix as well as some rather annoying ones. Also, a rather strange episode where Ricky and a bunch of his friends watch a porno as one of the kids hijacked the keys to the cable box from the father. What were they thinking? I watch an adult movie myself from time to time and think people are a bit overly critical of it at times, but showing an episode like that on a primarily family show was just insane. Also, that episode when they had Menudo guest star was just awful. Seriously, one of the first boy bands and still one of the worst with none of them doing much of anything after that band folded.

641,Silver Spoons," Likable, lighthearted, classic family show, that could give you cavities","Silver Spoons, may not have been a worldwide cultural phenomenon, like Cheers, which started just a few days after this, but is well and fondly remembered by people somewhere in their 30's to maybe those somewhere in their 50's. I'm only 25, but wise and kind of an old soul. The series was referred to as ""treacly sweet"" or something along those lines, Rick Schroder was a lovable boy, starting as Ricky Stratton, the 12-year old who was mature and wise beyond years. Dad was a kid at heart; VERY much a kid. That is to say he played with electric trains and played in the fashion of a child. Nonetheless, I think he was still a good father and the nicest TV dad I remember. Jason Bateman was in the first two seasons, of course, as Ricky's trouble-making, smart aleck friend. It's a wonder that was Jason Bateman, seeing him today in the ultra-contemporary 21st century programs, like Arrested Development, which i did not like, and his feature films in recent years. Though, maybe not hilarious and sometimes serious with pro social messages and ""special episodes"" e.g. Ricky babysits a little girl who was neglected by adopted parents,and characters with disabilities maybe the theme in at least an episode, and teen pregnancy (no it wasn't Rick's fault) it made me laugh more than most other shows, strangely. I bought the first season in a vintage style lunch box at Best Buy about 2 and a half year ago, and it took me almost 3 months to finish. Sexism and cliché'd gender stereotyping comments also seems kept to a minimum. I didn't like Jason Bateman so much in the show. By season 2 or Season 3, Alfonso Ribeiro became the new friend. A waiter at Olive Garden from the generation said he was the show's star. Next to Ricky Schroder at least. I carry the lunch box around with me, as I got tired of the little backpack. Joel Higgins, was no prolific actor on the silver screen and I can only think of maybe TV movies he was in, but he went on to record some music. He seemed rather quiet in Hollywood, something underrated, in my opinion. Erin Gray was also lovely as the assistant who was like a surrogate mother to Rick and later his father marries her. Ricky was clean cut like the Brady kids, a style and time in television I miss.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,,17 August 2011

Erin Gray lean't such great and sexy support as the Higgin's personal assistant, who eventually, became Charle's Stratton's second wife.

647,Silver Spoons, Reliving my favorite decade - the '80s,"This show remains one of my favorite TV series, partly because I'm Ricky Schroder's age (and my high school class celebrated its 30 year reunion back in 2018). Watching the show takes me back to those formative years, and even now I really like how Ricky Schroder portrayed Ricky Stratton. Not only was he cute, especially during the first two seasons, but if you didn't know he was rich, you couldn't tell just by looking -- a far cry from those who feel ""entitled"" today. Granted, in later seasons, Ricky tried -- and frequently failed -- to be a ladies' man, but he always seemed likable and, more importantly, relatable. Though my memory of later seasons is hazy (mostly because only the first season is readily available), I'm pretty sure there were times I'd watch an episode and want to high-five Ricky, give him a hug, or strangle him. But at the end of the day, he was always someone you'd want as a friend.<br/><br/>The show ran the gambit of tackling different topics that '80s teenagers would have faced. in the early seasons they ranged from stuff like computer hacking (a la WarGames) to watching X-rated movies to dealing with the possibility of losing a parent while still a teenager. In later seasons the topics became more mature, like when a divorced father kidnaps his daughter from her mother or when one of Rick's friends has a drinking problem that ends up getting Rick injured.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I never had a VCR to record the show until after it ended, so right now I can only relive the first season in its entirety. What I would have liked to have seen, though, was perhaps some kind of special giving us a glimpse of what the characters would have been some ten years or show after the show ended. Would Ricky be as successful as his dad? Would he be married and have kids? What kind of father would he be (and what kind of grandparents would Edward and Kate be)?",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,8.0,21 May 2020
648,Silver Spoons, The pangs of riches,"Before Michael Jackson created his own fantasy childhood for someone who never quite grew up we had an 80s series with a child living a fantasy life. This
would be Rick Schroder in Silver Spoons. Schroder played Richard Stratton III
whose dad was raising him.<br/><br/>There house was like a Michael Jackson creation. Every kind of toy imaginable was there that his dad Joel Higgins provided. But Higgins also wanted him to
grow up as normal as possible under the circumstances, so Schroder was always having his friends over and they did the usual kid things. He also went
to public school like the rest of his peers.<br/><br/>John Houseman was Richard Stratton I and he raised Higgins quite severely. It
was John Houseman so you would expect nothing less. But Higgins was determined on his own course of child rearing.<br/><br/>Others in the cast were Erin Gray as girl Friday, Franklin Searles as the butler,
and Alfonso Ribeiro and Jason Bateman as friends who went on to star in TV
series themselves.<br/><br/>Silver Spoons was good family entertainment.",1 out of 3 found this helpful.,5.0,9 October 2019
649,Silver Spoons, Charming is the word for it!,"note: This review is based on the first season as it's the only season currently on DVD.<br/><br/>Prior to this show, Ricky Schroder was known for dramatic roles-like the champ, the earthling and the last flight of Noah's ark. Yet it was this show that made him a household name.<br/><br/>Ricky Stratton(Schroder)is a Rich kid who decides after being in military school-to move in with rather goofy father-Edward Stratton the third(Joel Higgins)who owns a toy factory. His ""Living room"" is equipped with toys, Video arcade games, a computerized chess set-and a mini-freight train! You could call it ""The home version of Coney Island"" Even the front door is operated by remote control! Ricky has the face of an angel-but don't let that fool ya-he is a regular kid who gets into situations any kid gets into. He can be obnoxious, devious and even sometimes rude-but Ricky is a real charmer! And has the most infectious smile to ever grace the small screen. It's really hard not to like this kid.<br/><br/>The supporting cast includes Jason Bateman-who plays Ricky's arrogant pal Derek and my favorite John Houseman-who plays Edward Stratton the second the cynical father of Edward the third. Also Erin Gray plays Edward's loyal secretary-who he eventually marries.<br/><br/>Ricky Shrorder is the star of this show! He never gets annoying at all. Though I like him in the films I listed earlier-He really shines here.<br/><br/>The show is set in Long Island-and though they live in a mansion, we only see three or 4 rooms.<br/><br/>This show is really funny-with a few dramatic moments here and there. Some of it maybe cheesy-but that is the real charm of this show-it was made before the more gritty ""Reality"" sitcoms that came in the 90's.<br/><br/>About the first season DVDS: There are no special features at all-and they crammed it all on 3 discs-unless you have a surround system, it can be hard to hear-because of compression. However, at least they didn't put them on duel sided discs which are worse. There are 22 episodes including the pilot. Not the best in Quality sound or picture wise-but I've seen worse. I do have this to Say to Sony-Bring on the rest of the seasons! This set was released in 2007 and so far the first season's been released. If Sony doesn't want to release them Fine, License another company like Shout factory, MPI or Mill creek to release them.",1 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,25 April 2010
650,Silver Spoons, Best show of the 1980's!,I remember that show when I used to watch that show when I was like a month old or 2 months old but I was born in the year 1982 of March that time to I was 5 years old in '87. I remember that scene Rick S. as Ricky Stratton had the remote control door to open when Alfonso R. as Alfonso came to Ricky's house. I remember these epoisdes for 5 years when I was a little kid. I still remember the signal light on the wall where Ricky was around the house near it from the living room to the door. It is the best show of the 1980's! I still remember that show well for 22 years that I used to watch the show everyday. I remember the opening credits well. I really liked that show.,3 out of 35 found this helpful.,,8 November 2004
651,Are You Being Served?, Hilarious Mollie Sugden and John Inman... Priceless,"ARE YOU BEING SERVED had a long run on British TV, from 1972 to 1985. This groundbreaking series paved the way for many other famous Brticoms. But this one was the first to feature a gay character and delighted audiences with its naughty and unending double entendres.<br/><br/>Set in a dismal department store, Grace Brothers, the basic plot revolves around the sales people in the ladies' and gents' departments, forced to share floor space. Of course there are other store employees and many hapless customers. This basic structure saw something like 69 episodes filmed over 13 years as well as many cast changes.<br/><br/>The series was first seen as a starring vehicle for the swinging bachelor, Mr. Lucas, played by Trevor Bannister. As the junior sales clerk in the men's department, Lucas was always short of money and anxious to get out of the store to chase ""birds."" But after a few episodes two other characters emerged from the pack as audience favorites.<br/><br/>The blowzy Mrs. Slocombe, played by Mollie Sugden, was a middle-aged woman with an ever-changing hair color. She could switch between Cockney and Posh accents in a heartbeat and was often the butt of Lucas' crude jokes. Mrs. Slocombe had an alarming habit of referring to her ""pussy"" but was always blithely unaware of how these stories were taken by others.<br/><br/>The character of Mr. Humphries, played by John Inman, embraced many gay stereotypes but at heart he was a sweet and non-threatening character. Like Mrs. Slocombe, he had his own set of double entendres, but he winkingly made it known he knew exactly what he was saying.<br/><br/>Other main characters included the pompous floorwalker, Captain Peacock, played by Frank Thornton; the busty sales girl Miss Brahms, played by Wendy Richard, the crusty senior sales clerk, Mr. Grainger, played by Arthur Borough, the dim manager, Mr. Rumbold, played by Nicholas Smith, and the ancient store owner, Young Mr. Grace, played by Harold Bennett.<br/><br/>There were also crude maintenance men, Mr. Mash, played by Larry Martyn, who was succeeded by Mr. Harman, played by Arthur English, and a series of busty-but-dumb secretaries.<br/><br/>After Bannister left the series and Borough passed away, there was a series of replacements for these characters but none were terribly successful. Pop star Mike Berry had a decent run as Mr. Spooner, ""the junior,"" and a series of actors had turns replacing Borough as ""the senior."" Alfie Bass, James Hayter, Benny Lee, and Milo Sperber all had short runs.<br/><br/>Over all the years, however, the hearts of the series were Mollie Sugden and John Inman. Both were superb comic actors who were game for just about anything. Anything here meant outlandish costumes (Inman often in drag), musical numbers, dances, and knock-about slapstick comedy that was done live and apparently in front of an audience. Sugden was often asked to wear ridiculous costumes, ranging from rompers to lederhosen. Inman even appeared as his own mother.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that this series was silly but sweet. Its crude language and situations were easily forgiven because the actors were so damned good. Like a handful of other TV classics, ARE YOU BEING SERVED has never stopped running. This was a famous import for PBS) along with other Britcoms) and became a staple of that network.<br/><br/>The show was so popular, it spawned a 1977 movie in which the gang all go on holiday together. There was also a sequel series called GRAVE AND FAVOUR or ARE YOU BEING SERVED AGAIN? In which Sugden, Inman, Thornton, Richard, and Smith all retire to the country and run a hotel (owned by Grace Brothers) in exchange for free board.",42 out of 44 found this helpful.,10.0,15 April 2010

Peacock played by Frank Thornton, wisecracking junior salesman Mr Lucas [Trevor Bannister], who was always leering at young saleslady Miss Brahms [Wendy Richard, now Pauline in EastEnders], senior salesman Mr Grainger [Arthur Brough] and tactless manager Mr Rumbold [Nicholas Smith].<br/><br/>The boss was 80 year old Mr Grace, telling everyone ""You've all done very well!"", played by Harold Bennett.

I've always felt Brits make the funniest sitcoms, maybe i have an inbuilt British humour. Only in the last 2 years i bought series one of this to see what all the fuss was about, without any shadow of a doubt this is the funniest sitcom ever, no matter what mood i'm in i can put one of these on and laugh out loud, to the people who moan that the jokes were repeated i'd like to remind them of how many years this ran for and just how successful it was and still is. The movie was horrible, why did they make it!! However the sitcom all the way through was hilarious, Mollie and John i think made the series but all the cast were wonderful, especially young Mr Grace. There was an innocence about the series hidden deep amongst all the double entendres. High points for me were from the episodes Camping in, Oh what a tangled web and Friends and Neighbours. Maybe the show dipped a bit at series 9, but series 10 was a class act.",18 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,12 April 2011

655,Are You Being Served?, Wonderful show!,"I don't understand how anyone could bash this show. Yeah, there were a lot of sexual references in it, but it's not near as bad as some of the shows we see on TV these days. There are other Brit-coms like Monty Python that show actual nudity. AYBS does not. I could never get tired of this show. Frankly, I've been a fan of it for years and I hate that it's not currently on our local PBS station. Thankfully, I have taped episodes from when it did air so that if I feel like watching a real comedy, I can just pop in a videotape of AYBS and laugh away. This is an outstanding comedy and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good laugh.

656,Are You Being Served?, Double Entendre!,"Are You Being Served is a fantastic example of British humor at its finest. Granted, with almost 30 years since the telecast of the first episode, some of the humor has become dated.  However, the cast and script-writers took the concept of double entendre to a whole new level with the jokes in the show (the best one I think being about Mrs. Slocum's cat, if you get my drift!).  The thing that makes the show stand the test of time is that they did not have to resort to outright obscenity and crudity to get the humor across.  It requires a little bit of thought to follow some of the jokes, which while base, are veiled in ""false propriety"".  It is something that I would have no problem letting my children watch because they would not get the  jokes until they were old enough to understand and deal with the humor. What comedy today can we say the same about? The show also has the ability to pull you in, make you privy to the ""secret jokes"" and make you feel part of the club.  You become bound up in the inside jokes and personalities, and can identify with the characters (within reason: who can understand the concept of Mrs. Slocum's changing hair-colors?!).  Overall, it is a great series and well worth watching, even 27 years later!",44 out of 48 found this helpful.,,31 October 2000

659,Are You Being Served?, PURE AWESOME,"I have seen every episode in this show at least 10 or more times for sure. So let me tell you the sets are by today's standards cardboard like the, props sort of dated.<br/><br/>BUT that said you would be a fool to let that stop you from seeing this awesome example of Double Entendre! taken to the highest comedic extremes. No other show is so packed with things that on the surface suggest daily life that one who has an active mind easily finds a more gutter snipe meaning to what was said.<br/><br/>A perfect example follows where Mrs. Slocumbe was talking to a truck driver on the road via CB radio from the Grace Brothers store.  Mrs. Slocumbe an avid feline lover and, owner has a cat named tiddles.  She is constantly on the hunt for a man like a British Sadie Hawkins this guy was a hot prospect seeing he too sounded keen on her.  Mrs. Slocumbe regales the truck driver with all her home spun skills and loves... you hear the truck driver obviously in the midst of driving his big rig as Mrs. Slocumbe begins telling the truck driver of her pussy &lt;cat&gt; and how it wins a prize every time she shows it.  You hear the wheels lock and, screech as dude looses control of his rig and, the connection is broken. Not to mention she was dressed as a punk rocker in a rainbow Amazon woman outfit when talking to the man.<br/><br/>
Whey was she in the punk rocker garb well.  Well this just a hint of the funny things you will find on this show... You just have to get the videos DVD's whatever's available but one thing for sure you will never ever be sorry you did.",36 out of 41 found this helpful.,,11 August 2001
660,Are You Being Served?," ""Are You Being Served?"" Serves!","""Are You Being Served?"" is one of the best British comedies to hit American television screens! The show is about workers in a department store and their everyday lives. Every show the workers have adventures from being stuck in the store due to bad weather to one of them becoming a Pop Star for a day. ""Are You Being Served"" does not have any hidden messages like the average comedy it just tells about life in a plain old department store. What makes the show unique is the personalities of the workers; where in this store the customer is not always right. While the show ended in 1982 the show remains an icon due to the simple story lines which lead to hilarious side-splitting misunderstandings. ""Are You Being Served?"" is a must see for people who enjoy comedy.

661,Are You Being Served?, The funniest show I've ever seen,"I never laughed so hard in my life as the first time I saw this show. The only American sitcom that ever compared was Cheers. Anybody who has nit seen this sitcom should really watch it. The cast of characters is excellent. For example in the early episodes Mr. Lucas is always getting Mrs. Sloacombes goat. John In man as Mr. humphries is definitely the star of the show. Mr. granger reminds me of A man I used to work with A long time ago. That's what really makes this program so funny. It is more realistic than you might think. One of the funniest in jokes is the one where they always tell the customers that their sleeves or pants leg will ""ride up"" with wear.

662,Are You Being Served?, I loved this show,"I remember watching reruns of this show on PBS in the 90s, I must have watched every episode ten times. The only American show that could be compared to AYBS is probably Threes Company, if only for the dirty jokes that pop up on every episode. It was a little weird seeing such proper British people casually tossing off filthy double entendres, but that was part of the charm, the characters were largely oblivious to the fact. My favorite character was Mrs. Slocombe with her sky-high neon-colored hair. She and Mr. Humphries made the show, just like Karen and Jack make Will &amp; Grace, if you get my drift. Mrs. Slocombe had the funniest reactions to every event, no matter how small, and was quick to petulance after her fragile ego was even slightly bruised. I still laugh when I recall scenes from the show, for instance when she walked in one day wearing a brown outfit and Mr. Lucas said ""how now brown cow"", and she glared at him. I'm laughing as I type this. Or the time when Mr. Rumbold became ill and Mrs. Slocombe took over the whole department and used his office, she started ordering all these fancy things befitting an executive, like a new suit, and Mr. Travis said ""She looks like Rocky Marciano"". Then she ate the meringue and got a call from Mr. Rumbold not to eat the meringue, and became violently ill. My favorite Mrs. Slocombe episode, if there is one, is when she can't get home so she stays at Grace Brothers upstairs and has a self-contained apartment. One-by-one, all the other characters, who couldn't get home either, drop by to stay at her apartment and she has to accommodate them all. It's hilarious! There's also one episode where Joanne Lumley makes an appearance and she's young and sexy, she's selling perfume or something.<br/><br/>This wasn't the best show ever made, but the characters are so well crafted that you feel like Grace Brothers could be a real department store somewhere. Even in the 70s, when this show was made, Grace Brothers seems hopelessly old-fashioned and out of date.",30 out of 35 found this helpful.,,17 October 2005
663,Are You Being Served?, THE British Comedy,"I was pondering which review would be worthy of being my 50th IMDb review and AYBS won by a landslide. Not only is it the definitive field guide to the world of double entendres, it's my personal favourite TV show- British or otherwise. If you are looking for your first foray into British comedy, you'll find no better, and if you only see one, this had better be it.<br/><br/>Despite its long run and casting changes, not always for the better mind you, AYBS was one show I can never say outran it's welcome. It remains as fresh and hilarious as the first day of taping, capturing perfectly the working atmosphere (in no small ways can I pick out similarities to my own stint in retail) while seamlessly introducing the absurdly hilarious. Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft were BRILLIANT writers for the show.<br/><br/>The original lineup will always remain the favorite. In that time, I felt the characters were more equally favored, and I loved the caustic Mr. Mash. As changes ensued, there were highlights and detriments, including Miss Brahms coming more into her own, and the most obvious unwanted replacements of Mr. Grainger and Mr. Lucas. I never was a fan of Mr. Spooner, but I don't think he killed the show as more rabid purists may attest. Either way, I was never presented with an episode that couldn't make me laugh and forget the oppressions of real life.<br/><br/>One last note, the musique concrete theme song was really outstanding as a hallmark of the show: very iconic.<br/><br/>So this is my poor tribute to a fantastic show. If anything, I hope the very least I can do is inspire someone to look it up and become a new fan of this brilliant classic",9 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,7 February 2010
664,Are You Being Served?, A British Comedy Classic!,"This series ran from 1972 to 1985, but as British series typically only do six or seven episodes in a season, there are only sixty-nine episodes in all.<br/><br/>The series focuses on the relationship between the staff of the ladies' department and the gentlemen's department in a mid-priced department store in London.  Also involved in the humor and bickering are the floorwalker, the department manager, and the owner of the store.  There were several cast changes, but most of the crew stayed on through the entire run.<br/><br/>As Frank Thornton (Captain Peacock, the floorwalker) points out in interviews, this show is appealing because it's about shops.  Everybody knows what goes on in a shop.  We see the bickering for display space, the outrageous lies told to clinch a sale, and the petty squabbles as management institutes ridiculous rules.  <br/><br/>The one flaw to the series is that continuity stank.  The departments in question bounced from floor to floor over the years, not because they were moved, but because the writers forgot where they were supposed to be! <br/><br/>
A blessing to fans of the series is the new DVD collection which includes 34 episodes from the first five seasons.  There were four Christmas episodes that are rarely shown on television, and two are in the time frame of this set.  Also included is ""Top Hat and Tails,"" which had been ""lost"" for twenty-five years.  Once you see it, you'll understand why someone ""lost"" it until just recently (there's a scene that was surely considered inappropriate at the time).  <br/><br/>This series has its down moments, but every episode brings laughs and joy.

665,Are You Being Served?, One of the best,"I have to say that this has to be one of the best British Comedies I have ever seen. The humor is fascinating and yet so down to earth. I enjoy watching Ms. Slocumb just to see what color her hair is going to be next, which was one of the claim to fame of the show. Also the innuendos that Mr. Humphries may or may not be gay, is he or isn't he? There are so many good things to say about this series. I am currently in the process of buying the complete series on DVD along with Are You Being Served Again and Are you Being Served: The Movie. Though I have watched this series often and for a long time, the one's I watched were usually on PBS in the United States and I know that it is impossible for me to have seen every single episode. I also watched many of the episodes of Are You Being Served Again and thought they too were great, I only wish it had lasted much longer than 3 seasons. I can hardly wait to own all of them on DVD so that I can continue to watch them anytime I choose and actually see ""every"" episode. If you haven't seen these yet, they are well worth the watch and the purchase.

Grace Brothers spares no expense to bring you goofy promotions, mucked-up display units, and bizarre situations. Then there are the employees--they aren't as normal as they seem either. For example there's the aloof Captain Peacock, who has quite the practice on the side-often with secretaries. Then there is Mrs. Slocomb, senior saleswoman, who has a cat, which she refers to constantly by another name. Mr. Humphreys, by most accounts swings two directions. The dopey Mr. Rumbold and Young Mr. Grace, who run the company spend more time in confusion than any real managment work. Other odd birds like stocky Mr. Tebbs, insinuating Mr. Maash, cockney-ditz Miss Brahams, cranky Mr. Grainger, jolly Mr. Harmon, and the ever nasty canteen manageress.

668,Are You Being Served?, British Comedy at it's height,"What makes this better than most modern britcoms is that it isn't so obsessed with good camera-work, graphics and movie style acting that really adds nothing to the humour itself. The style and culture involved reflects upper class British culture of the 1900s with hilarious, though now far outdated, satire on the British cast system. With an amusing cast of workers in the womens and mens departments at Grace Bros comes with it characters that have become stereotypes more than they poked fun at the original inspiration. The jokes, however repetitive, don't tire, more they relax, and it is easy to see why so much references to this show have been made. I would tell recommend it to anyone interested in 1900s culture, and it is an important part of television history, as are many 70s comedies. The simple theme intro with a equally simple guitar tune is quite interesting. Most humour is taken from outrageous costumes, hilarious backfirings of 'schemes' and devices and the coming together of all the workers despite their differences to fight longer working hours, bad meals, and other such conditions. The funniest jokes are when casts collide, often upsetting a high set person or upraising a lower one.

You'll laugh out loud non stop through out the entire thing.Its especially funny when Mr.Humphries answers the phone in a deep men's tone, then goes back to his original sqeaky voice.<br/><br/>Apart from all the fighting and mean jokes about one another,there's still that close bond that you can kind of sense about them.<br/><br/>This series is so hilariously delightful your sure to love it, you can catch it on PBS at 10:00-11:00 I believe. It's great laughs.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,,9 February 2003
671,Are You Being Served?, Very amusing work,"A lot of people like my dad for example think that AYBS is a load of bollocks but quite frankly I disagree. I admit thought that a lot of it is quite corny but Jimmy Perry &amp; David Croft had a way of making these old jokes very amusing. It also like Dad's Army, It Ain't Half Hot mum, Hi-De-Hi and other work by Perry and Croft always had the right atmosphere. It was amusing, pleasent and very sarcastic. The perfect atmosphere for a comedy classic. My favourite character has to be pompous, nose in the air floorwalker Captain Peacock. Reason is that he's the most amusing of the lot, probably the most intellegent and also the way he is tight about his money I think is hilarious. Also Mr Humphries I think is very amusing the he walks, talks and makes jokes not even knowing that he's done it. So like I said at the beginning a very amusing piece of work that is liked, like all Perry &amp; Croft sitcoms, by all ages and will be for much time to come.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,,5 January 2004
672,Are You Being Served?, One of the best,Are You Being Served is one of the best sitcoms of all time. From fabulous actors to the great lines each series of this show has at least one magic moment.<br/><br/>It's pure pantomime humour that can be enjoyed by the whole family and it is because of this that the show is timeless.<br/><br/>The catchphrases come thick and fast and the exploits of Mr Humphries and co continue to bring smiles to peoples faces across the world.<br/><br/>It was about the sixth series when this show started to fade with the numerous cast changes not helping. The major loss was Trevor Bannister as Mr Lucas who was just fantastic in this show. After he left the show began to sink.<br/><br/>Overall a great show that is well worth watching.,8 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,17 December 2010
673,Are You Being Served?," If you happen to be ""free"", spend some time at Grace Brothers! And I am unanimous in that!","Twenty five years ago, a former roommate (who was from London) introduced me to this classic British sitcom which he happened to discover was on PBS. Being in customer service at the time, I loved its sometimes acidic view of life behind the counter. It was also a crash course in British slang which became a part of my lingo and over the years has made me seem a bit of an eccentric. The regular characters here were certainly all a bit eccentric, but in quite different ways. From store owner Young Mr. Grace (the delightfully adorable and seemingly much older Harold Bennett) all the way down to the cockney handymen who were constantly being ordered off the floor by the imperious Captain Peacock, resulting in a delightful insult at his expense, these characters became a part of my TV history memories, as memorable to me as Lucy and Ethel, Laverne and Shirley, all the Golden Girls &amp; Designing Women, and many, many others.<br/><br/>The heart and soul of the show and oft' scene stealers were Mollie Sugden's Mrs. Betty Slocum, the ""Get Stuffed!"" spouting senior clerk ""for the ladies' department"" who was always complaining about something in regards to her ""cat"" (utilizing a word which gave quite a different impression of what she was talking about) and John Inman's very gay Mr. Humphries who would answer the phone in a very butch manner (""Men's Wear"") then respond to Captain Peacock's ""Are You Free?"" with a very high pitched ""I'm Free!"". The characters argued quite a bit as most co-workers who work together for a long time do, but it is obvious that they couldn't imagine working with anybody else. Wendy Richard's Miss Brahams is a ""dead common"" working class girl anxious to be a little more high class, but when she took elocution lessons, she ended up sounding like she was making fun of an upper class customer. Mr. Lucas over in Men's Wear had fun flirting with Miss Brahams in a very un-PC way and insulting Mrs. Slocum in an even more delicious manner. The gay references from the other characters towards Mr. Humphreys were never homophobic, and came off often as endearing like a friendly little slap on the butt rather than something you'd compare to a hate crime.<br/><br/>Then, there was ""Jug Ears"", Mr. Rumbolt, the prim and proper department manager who often got confused as to the on floor misunderstandings and usually made it out to be something more than it was. Trying to be a peacemaker, he usually ended up causing more trouble. Then, when Mr. Grace made suggestions for the department, ""Jug Ears"" would turn the suggestion into a big production which usually put the staff in campy costumes and over the top situations that kept the audiences in stitches. One example was a store commercial with Mrs. Slocum wearing over-sized eye lashes that kept getting stuck and Mr. Rumbolt wearing the wrong wig which seemed more appropriate for Liza Minnelli than the character he was playing. The show did utilize American references so that when it did come to American T.V., it ended up being as acceptable to them as it was to the BBC audiences.<br/><br/>Replacements for various actors were necessary (usually due to the older cast member's sudden deaths) but they weren't as successful as the original. ""Old Mr. Grace"" didn't have the cute quality of ""Young Mr. Grace"", and Mr. Spooner just seemed a pale imitation of Trevor Bannister's Mr. Lucas. Fortunately, the majority of the cast remained the same and the quality of the writing never changed its patterns. 40 years later, the series is as fresh as ever and proves to us American audiences that the humor of the British doesn't have to be droll or ""stiff upper lip"" and that they can get as down and dirty (in fact even dirtier) than the unfortunate political correctness of American TV has taken over the years. Censorship didn't stop this show from being delightfully witty and even with its slightly obscene insinuations, there is absolutely nothing to offend anybody.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,20 March 2015
674,Are You Being Served?, Timeless classic comedy series.,This is my favorite comedy series ever made. Set in '70s to '80s London in an old-style department store in the Ladies and Gents department it offers a unique atmosphere (especially to Americans). The characters are hilarious and never grow dramatic (as happens to some long-running comedies).  It's one of those shows where you can watch an episode multiple times and still find it funny.  Occasionally they reused jokes but it was done to show character and never too often as to wear it out (you'll laugh when Mrs. Slocombe talks about her 'pussy').  A great comedy that I recommend.,4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,11 July 2000

676,Republic of Doyle, A fun trip to the Republic,"As a native Newfoundlander, my opinions on this show have to be coloured by that rather important fact, but I have tried to divorce my feelings for my home from my review of the program.<br/><br/>As is plainly written on the Republic of Doyle web site, this show is cut from the same mould as The Rockford Files and Magnum PI. It's mostly a comedy with just enough mystery plot to hold the whole thing together. If you are expecting CSI on the East Coast, you will be disappointed. However, if you are looking for interesting characters that are true Newfoundlanders, with all the irreverence, dry wit and lust for life that the term implies, then this show will definitely entertain you.<br/><br/>Shot in and around St. John's, Nfld, on admittedly the largest number of nice weather days I've seen in a row, Republic takes full advantage of the visual variety of both the city and the surroundings. Dramatic shots of steep hills and brightly coloured houses backdropped by the harbour make even unlikely car chases appear really dramatic. I've driven those streets. Car chases on those hilly, narrow and winding streets is a fast way to a trip to the hospital. Still, they look like a lot of fun, and that's the point of it all, so it works a treat.<br/><br/>The strength of the series, though, is the characters and their interactions. For a brand new series, the recurring characters have a sense of solidity and reality that usually takes several seasons to achieve. The humour is appropriate to the place and people. As a Newfoundlander, I ""get"" the humour; I can only hope that others find it just as amusing. The other thing that reads very true is the dialogue. Having listened to a great many people butcher both the accent and the common terms of speech, it is refreshing to find dialogue that really could be heard on the streets of the city on any given day.<br/><br/>All-in-all, this is an hour of your life that you will be glad you spent in Newfoundland.

With appearances from some recognizable cast, Newfie wit, and good old fashioned chase scenes, it looks like it could be on the way to be the next Canadian produced hit.<br/><br/>We loved that the area the scenes were shot were clearly recognizable, to anyone who has visited the capital city.

678,Republic of Doyle, Thumbs up! This show is growing on me.,"If you had said last season that this show was a little cheesy, I would have agreed. I mean, Jake is right out of the 70's in so many ways. He hasn't really grown up but the show has grown up around him this season in my opinion. The characters are deeper, the plots more complex and interesting, and a lot of the lame situations have been benched in favour of better material. <br/><br/>Do Newfoundlanders really talk like that? And what's with the brightly coloured houses? Where can I get a GTO like that? Little glimpses of maritime Canada I suppose. <br/><br/>If you're looking for realism and big-budget effects, you won't find satisfaction here.

679,Republic of Doyle, All six seasons watched and enjoyed,Just watched the very last episode in the final season and the series gathered momentum from the beginning to the end. I got very attached to the characters and will miss them which showed that the characters were well developed. The stories were good as well. Sexual tension between the pairs was irritating along the way but in the end that was satisfying. The stand out acting came from Jake and Des although the whole cast was very good and convincing in their roles. Des provided much of the humour. The island setting was beautiful and colourful.

681,Republic of Doyle, Excellent ... truly excellent.,"I came to this show late, after friends praised it to me.<br/><br/>I'm so sorry I didn't start watching it from the beginning.<br/><br/>The thing with me was that it was a CBC television production. Although I love CBC radio, the majority of CBC TV shows have been ... well ... weak. There have been a few exceptions, of course, but that hasn't been the way to bet.<br/><br/>This show is one of those exceptions. It's light, humorous, well written, and most of all, entertaining. It's just flat out entertaining. The plots are fun and interesting and there are just enough twists to keep us guessing, and to offer a surprise every once in a while.<br/><br/>The actors do a great job and are all very likable. I think that may be one of the main reasons that the show does well. I heard that they scored 1.2 million viewers on the last episode. That's an impressive number.<br/><br/>I'm not a Newfoundler so I don't think I'm biased, although I am from Nova Scotia so I know buckets full of people from The Rock. From my outsider experience, the dialogue and the attitudes they show towards each other are very accurate.<br/><br/>I honestly believe Newfoundlanders are the friendliest people on earth, and you get a taste of that from this series.<br/><br/>Bravo to CBC for putting this on and bravo to the writers and cast for a good, enjoyable, TV show.",24 out of 29 found this helpful.,10.0,11 March 2012

Never taking itself too seriously (except toward later seasons), the series captures the seedy side of life in the Maritimes while showcasing some fine Canadian actors (e.g., Nicholas Campbell guest stars) and scenery, highlighting friendship and camaraderie, and realistically addressing political corruption and overly ambitious real-estate development.

Also, his chemistry with Krystin Pellerin is natural and electric. <br/><br/>This series is loaded with solid plots, great humor, and excellent writing. It's quite frankly a lot better than most American mystery procedural shows that are currently still airing for some reason.

684,Republic of Doyle, An absolute joy to watch!,"I've never visited the province of Newfoundland and Labrador but I consider the entire population to be my friends. I've always been intrigued by the populace due to their unique accent/dialect, their music, their food such as fish and brewis and their booze. I've watched a lot of NTV and have learned a great deal about their province. These are hardy, tough and determined people living on a rock where Canada's worst weather occurs. They love to fight. The idea of an action comedy-drama show set there is a brilliant idea.<br/><br/>Allan Hawco, the star, co-creator, executive producer, head writer and showrunner of Republic Of Doyle, plays Jake Doyle, a PI in St John's, NFLD&amp;L. Doyle is a fearless man who isn't afraid to die in the line of fire for justice. He is aided by his father Malachy (Sean McGinley) and his step-mother Rose (Lynda Boyd), who usually go online to dig up dirt on his targets. He also has Des Courtney (Mark O'Brien), a stammering youth who helps/hinders him. There's also Katrina Doyle (Marthe Bernard), a cute-as-a-button, Janet Wood-type who works for the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary.<br/><br/>Unlike Magnum P.I., RoD is more like typical T.V. as an entire season of story lines occur throughout its run. It's a deft mix of drama, comedy and action in the streets of the capital city. It's unique to see crime fighting take place in a smaller city like St. John's than in, say, New York, L.A. or Toronto.<br/><br/>If you're obsessed with Newfoundland like I am, this show is a must- watch. Even if you're not, it's much better than 85% of T.V. today and it's just only hitting its prime. It's a fun romp every time I watch. I also have to commend Mr. Hawco on his taste in women as he hires knockouts on his show. Only in RoD could some beautiful lady in a mini-dress be the mastermind behind a mad bomber.<br/><br/>Newfoundland and Labrador is taking over, people.",19 out of 24 found this helpful.,8.0,1 August 2013
685,Republic of Doyle, And now for something completely different!,"I'm in the middle of Season 2 and am enjoying every minute of it. What a wonderful series, especially refreshing because the writing is such a departure from the typical canned, predictable script. The characters are strong, three-dimensional, and charismatic.<br/><br/>The setting is St. Johns, Newfoundland, unique and picturesque. I love the aerial views of the city, especially the shot in the introduction where the camera zooms over the water as it approaches a narrows between two mountainside cliffs.<br/><br/>Jake Doyle is the lead character, a cute and charming ne'er-do-well PI who is always trying to get out of scrapes that are generally of his own making. The series begins with him living at home with his dad (Malachy) and dad's live-in girlfriend (Rose) and somewhat surly teenage niece (Tinny). Additionally, he has to deal with a would-be apprentice, Des, a goofy, awkward, and geeky (smart) lad who is in love with Tinny. <br/><br/>The only problem I had with the series initially was with the female characters, who seemed to be deemed interesting only because of their looks and willing participation in Jake's sexual escapades. The ex-wife was not especially strong, particularly as her ambivalence about Jake became a bit confusing. However, as the series develops, the female characters indeed become three-dimensional, interesting, and strong: Leslie, the female police sergeant; Tinny, whose teenage angst morphs into remarkable self-possession; and the Crown attorney whose name I cannot recall. <br/><br/>I love seeing the evolution of the characters over the episodes, and the interweaving of plot lines throughout the series. The father and Rose seem to be a bit more flatly portrayed, more static rather than dynamic characters. <br/><br/>And about that action: there are plenty of rough-and-tumble fight scenes recalling the good old days of television, as opposed to bang-bang-you're-dead, where the presence of guns tends to dampen the fun. <br/><br/>I love the corny humor (thank you, Des), the unusual accents, Hawco's sweet rubbery babyface, the sense of loyalty and affection among the characters, the whole thing, actually. Highly recommend.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,13 March 2018

I have been to NL, and love the scenery. This is my type of action/drama TV series that I like. <br/><br/>The father love between Malachy and Jake is like the motherly love with my Mother.

Some nice guest roles have helped out as well (Gordon Pinsent, Russell Crowe).

The hour-long show has plenty of action, and lots of humor, a la The Rockford Files with Hawco a younger and studlier version of James Garner. This guy is catnip to women, and skirts the edge of the law to beat the bad guys at their own game. Lots of action, involving the Doyle clan, who are the ultimate crime-solving family. One character, however, consistently strikes a false note and that is Des, a kid who has become part of the family. He's a consistent idiot as a character, highly unfunny simply in the way.

The main character, the city of St. John's, Newfoundland, (is a a republic?) was wonderful. The place, the language, the scenery, the homey feel, the small town everyone knowing everyone's business. Watched all 6 seasons, laughed out loud several times which I don't often do, so they pulled off the comedy part really well. Over the course of the sic seasons, the characters go through al ot, and the character arcs are really good. The plot lines of returning characters crescendos in the last two seasons, and speaks to lots of concerns about power grabbing behind the scenes machinations taking over governments, corruption everywhere. Our Republic of Doyle is governed by good ideals, heroes all, though the characters are flawed in many ways. How that plays out in relationships of all kinds is fascinating. There are heart wrenching twists, and soul crushing events a plenty, fights, great cars and car chases, and even though our heroes hate guns and hardly ever use them, there are gun fights, too. The show is both modern and a throw back, a little Magnum PI, some Castle in there as well. The show was fun entertainment, a visit to another land, and facing lots of issues as well.

691,Republic of Doyle, Trip to St John Newfoundland in my future!!,"I just finished binge watching Republic of Doyle! All in all, I found the series to be very refreshing! More than anything, I loved the shows strong family values as well as doing the right thing when the world is against you! Strong morals throughout! There are a number of attractive leading ladies throughout the series. Most of them are interested in getting closer with Jake. However, Jake only has eyes for Leslie. For some reason, it takes all 6 seasons for Jake and Leslie to be a family! The main issue I had with the show is the police force has problems with Jake and Doyle &amp; Doyle PI investigations! They regularly serve up solved cases to the police on a silver platter, yet no gratitude to be seen. Various officers are promoted thanks to the Doyles, yet the police consider them enemies! My one gripe is the joke of firearms. Jake doesn't like and doesn't believe in firearms. He doesn't use them and I don't recall him firing one shot throughout the show. As soon as he takes a gun away from a criminal, he empties it immediately. If you watch closely, the firearms rarely have any rounds in them. Safeties are keep on and single action only firearms (1911) aren't often cocked and ready! More than anything, I love the accepting attitude of the Canadians, and willingness to give people second chances!

696,Republic of Doyle, Fun Canadian TV Show,"I'd like to start this review of the series by saying that I loved this show. I watched it three times, actually. It's fun and suspenseful, with a lot of Newfoundland charm. (I am not from NFLD, I'm from Nova Scotia, but my fam is from Newf.) Those who were expecting a serious crime drama were probably disappointed. This is a classic dramady series with so much heart.<br/><br/>
One thing I would really like to mention is that at first, I hated the main character, Jake Doyle. He's in his early thirties and is a classic screw up. He's an ex-cop going through a divorce, his business isn't doing well, he has a strained relationship with his brother, he sleeps around, gets drunk a lot, and is just an overall massive tool. But as the series goes on, you realize that it is intentional. Jake grows so much throughout the series, and I feel like I appreciated him so much more than if he had been likeable from the start. He becomes a great character, without changing completely. It's like he learned how to be himself and also be a responsible, charming adult. So if Jake annoys you, stick with it! It gets better!! Allan Hawco is an amazing actor. He brought to much to this character, and I feel like he put a lot of himself into the character of Jake. This makes him seem more realistic instead of outlandish.<br/><br/>
The rest of the main cast is delightful too. Leslie Bennett is the love interest and the actress who plays her, Krystin Pellerin is seriously phenomenal. Allan and Leslie have amazing chemistry, and their scenes together are by far the best in the series. Their acting is so effortless when they are together on screen.<br/><br/>
Jake's relationship with his dad, Mal, is also incredible to watch. You get the sense that they love and respect each other, even though it's not always apparent.<br/><br/>
All of the characters have their own charm, and I wish I could be a part of their family. Special mention of my favourite character Des. He's seriously incredible.<br/><br/>
The guest stars are amazing, especially if you're a fan of Canadian TV: Victor Garber, Paul Gross, Mark Critch, Gordon Pinsent, Joel Thomas Hynes, Yannick Bisson, Alan Doyle of Great Big Sea, Scott Grimes, Kevin Durand, Enrico Colantoni, and of course Russell Crowe, just to name a few.<br/><br/>
For my fellow Canadians, if you are a fan of Rookie Blue or Private Eyes, you'll like this show. A lot of the actors from Rookie Blue appear as guest stars.
Overall, if you are looking for a series that oozes heart, humour, and home, this is the one for you. (Also if you love a will-they-or-won't-they relationship you can ship, this is perfect for you.)",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,4 December 2018
697,Republic of Doyle, A very pleasant hour's entertainment - rather less formulaic than many other similar shows.,"I didn't know anything about this series before my wife stumbled on it on Netflix. I'm now in season 2 and watch one episode a week. The strengths of the show are the generally excellent and unforced acting, the pacing, the original, if sometimes rather far- fetched story lines, and of course the locale, St Johns, Newfoundland. Allen Hawco, as well as co-writing and co-producing the show, is one of the two main protagonists, father and son Doyle, private detectives. He's an accomplished and very good looking actor, plays the part of the son, Jake Doyle, with a nice line in comedic expression and action - there's an alertness and lightness of touch that's very appealing. His father, Malachy Doyle, Irish actor Sean McGinley, is pretty good looking too, a rather more restrained actor, with a nice line in wry asides, and the father son relationship is dealt with gentle humour and some pathos. They work really well together. Add in Jake's many love interests, first, his ex-wife (very well acted by Rachel Wilson)and then a particularly attractive policewomen , Lesley, played by Krysten Pellerin, and another rather sexy public prosecutor, and Malachy's more constant love for Rose (Lynda Boyd), the series has a backbone of developing relationships against the episodic nature of each adventure. Other characters are also well played. Des is a hapless comic foil and perhaps just too hapless/helpless for complete believability, but heck, this is crime comedy and Tinny the rebellious niece helps fill out the family dynamics. <br/><br/>As a somewhat jaded septuagenarian, who watches very little TV, I can thoroughly recommend this series, I've remained very impressed with the sheer entertainment value of this series, and I look forward to renewing my acquaintance with the Doyles every week. What particularly comes across to me is that the actors in the show really seem to be enjoying themselves - I suspect they would have enjoyed many good parties as the series progressed.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,28 July 2016
698,Republic of Doyle, I really enjoyed this show,"It's a great show to watch. It is not too serious, they didn't have to kill off characters to keep it interesting like some. There is some comedy and good actors. You have to use your imagination a little because obviously they cannot fit everything into one show. It's a show you can skip some and continue watching without worrying you missed something. I really enjoyed learning about Newfoundland and it was interesting how the culture is different from where I live. I am watching the whole series a second time.

It kind of remind me of Corner gas meets a P I movie. I would not go out of my way to watch the ""Republic of Doyle"", but I would not shut the show off either. I give the ""Republic of Doyle"" a six out of ten. The show is a east cost version of the old C B C show Tom Stone.

701,Birds of Prey, A great series that should have stayed.,"I liked this show. It's too bad it didn't last very long. I liked the matrix-like action sequences, the dialog, the twists and turns that each episode took. It's a bummer that the last episode was such a cliffhanger (of course they usually are). It's true the meta-human thing was a bit unrealistic, but they had to play with things a little to make it so that it wasn't too much a copy of other Batman stories. I would have liked to see Dina's character more developed as she discovered her abilities. I would have liked to see Oracle get the use of her legs back if possible. It would have been neat to see if the Alfred character would develop further. Of course the Huntress character had a lot of development options. I wish they'd bring this show back. I don't care what all of the negative people might say, I liked it and miss it a lot. I wish somebody could do something to bring it back.",44 out of 52 found this helpful.,,2 April 2004
702,Birds of Prey," In Defense of ""Birds of Prey""","There are those comix purists who will complain that BoP violates ""continuity"".  If the truth be known, that which constitutes ""continuity"" is in the eye of the beholder (At last count, there are over five -- and counting --different Batman ""continuities"" [Movie Batman, ""Batman: The Animated Series"", ""Batman Beyond"", ""Justice League"", ""The Dark Knight"", etc.] ).  At last count, Superman has over EIGHT different continuities (radio show, TV shows [""Superboy"", ""Smallville"", etc.], and countless cartoon incarnations -- in addition to the comics).  This is to say nothing of the pre- and post-""Crisis"" versions of each of these characters.<br/><br/>There are so many different versions of Batman and Superman and different eras that trying to please each and every comic fan out there is a nightmare and an impossible task for a screenwriter. There are some people who want to see this version and some who want to see this era and if the writers mix them up then all hell breaks loose in Comix Fandom.  To attempt to satisfy the whims of each individual fan is to ask for trouble.<br/><br/>While the critics are marking off their checklists and tabulating how well BoP adheres to its ""source material"", they're missing out on a fun show peopled with some quirky and interesting characters (The Huntress holds the singular honor of being TV's first superhero to see a therapist on a regular basis!).<br/><br/>""Birds of Prey"" is best enjoyed when judged on its own merits.

703,Birds of Prey, A good show cut down before it had a chance.,"While not a dead on comic adaptation,and far from ideal effects and stories,Birds of Prey set out to give viewers a good comic related action show and was succeeding,as the Thousands of unhappy and protesting fans that wrote and emailed the WB prove. While not without its flaws,the show had good action and good plots for the medium.Enjoyable acting ,fast pace,and effects consistent with tv action/fantasy.As to the comic fans who are rabid over the differences:while we'd all love to see it,no comic based movie or tv show has ever been a perfect adaptation.File it away to alternate realities if you must,but be open minded.Just because Star Wars Episodes 1-3 Made most of it's ""history"" bunk doesnt mean Timothy Zahn's Heir to the Empire books were any less enjoyable The WB and Fox both owe their very existence to shows that didnt take off immediately,Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Married With Children come to mind and they are not the only ones.Yet in recent years both networks have developed a ""better ratings now"" philosophy that insults viewers and television industry people alike.Any show that isnt cookie cutter crap or an instant hit with whatever demographic they are aiming for is quickly eliminated,almost unerringly,giving no time to grow a large and loyal fanbase(like the aforementioned shows did).But fanbases do exist for these shows and are kept alive via the internet,and word of mouth.Given another year for people to tune in and a little tweaking this show could have been another Buffy like hit,but sadly it wasnt to be.So remember kiddies:tape those first runs,the show might not make it to reruns",32 out of 39 found this helpful.,,26 October 2003

705,Birds of Prey, Interesting take on the old legend,"****Spoilers ahoy! ****<br/><br/><br/><br/>For those of you whose only preception of Batgirl was the ""Batman and Robin"" version, featuring the blonde-haired, deliverer of bad comebacks ""Barbara Wilson"" (Alicia Silverstone), this new WB series ""Birds of Prey"" should be a welcome breath of fresh air. Based on the hit comicbook series, BoP presents us with an alternate Gotham City, a world in which Batman is mysteriously absent. His protege, Barbara Gordon, one-time Batgirl and computer genius, strives to follow in his vigilante footsteps. After suffering a crippling injury at the hands of the Joker, Barbara assumes a new identity: Oracle, an all-seeing, all-knowing force of justice. Utilizing her vast computer knowledge, she patrols Gotham virtually, battling the forces of evil.<br/><br/>Aiding her on this quest, is Helena Kyle, the daughter of Batman (Bruce Wayne) and Catwoman (Selina Kyle). Taken in by Barbara after her mother's brutal murder, Helena is Oracle's eyes and ears in New Gotham. Though she seems to enjoy a solid butt-kicking and the occassional pithy retort, the Huntress is considerably more laid-back than her mentor and frequently demands a reminder for why she and Oracle bother with crimefighting in the first place.<br/><br/>Dinah Lance, a naive teenager from a quiet Midwestern background, later journeys to Gotham, pursuing the two figures from her childhood nightmares. Believing her premonitions to be real despite her mother's skepticism, she arrives by bus and quickly finds herself at the mercy of the dangerous city. The Huntress appears just in time to rescue her and Dinah recognizes her as one of the women from her dreams. Her gift allows her to see and feel what others do when she comes in physical contact with them, and due to this, she is able to follow the Huntress back to Oracle's clocktower, thereby discovering their secret identities.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with the flashback sequences, the appearance of Batman and Batgirl, battling the Joker together. Dina Meyer is delightful in her portrayal as Barbara Gordon, believable in both her no-nonsense valor and quiet tenderness. It's a pleasure to finally see a correct interpretation of Batgirl/Oracle hit the screen. And though the BoP series features the Earth 1 version of the Huntress (quite unlike the more commonly known Helena Bertinelli), the stray from today's continuity is not altogether unpleasant. Helena Kyle broods admirably, yet is not as dark, violent, and angsty as her Earth 2 counterpart. Ashley Scott's chemistry with Shemar Moore (Detective Reese) will also be fun to follow.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be the casting for the lovable psychopath Harelyquinn. Though it's probably too early to nitpick, Mia Sara seems an unlikely choice in both appearance and personality for the young and bubbly Harley. I suppose we'll have to see her in action before passing a final judgement. But other than that, BoP grants us access to a whole new Gotham, fiercely protected by a new trio of superheroines. Hopefully, the producers will leave some room for the old; favorites like Nightwing, Robin, and Spoiler would make for delicious gueststars ;)",13 out of 16 found this helpful.,,11 October 2002
706,Birds of Prey, The Original Huntress is Back!!!,"I think it's fantastic to have the original Huntress back! This is great!! I've missed her. As for Batman being missing? Not the first time. Batman's been known to just vanish from time to time (usually leaving Robin in charge). Why the Clocktower? What was wrong with putting Barbara in the Wayne Foundation Penthouse/Batcave?? And with such a young Black Canary... can we assume Ollie's still shipwrecked on a island with pirates???<br/><br/>As for Batman and Catwoman having a daughter -- it began in The Flash #123 (1961), with the Golden-Age Bat-Man and Catwoman getting married in Brave and the Bold #197 (1983), and Helena Wayne becoming the Huntress in All-Star Comics #69 (1977). A more revised Catwoman history states that Selina gave up a life of crime to become a professional adventurer, and thus began dating Bruce Wayne.<br/><br/>The most important thing here to remember is the comics have their version and the film productions have theirs (back to the parallel universe). No one version is right or wrong. It just is. With the film production team's primary job being to draw in and hook that audience that wouldn't be caught dead reading a comic book.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,,5 August 2002
707,Birds of Prey," Loved the comic, Loved the show, bought the DVD","There are a lot of positive things to say about this show. I regret not watching this show when it first came on. The premise intrigued me, and I was a comic book fan, so I was really disappointed that I was unable to watch the show because it was on a night that I worked. By the time I was able to change my schedule the show had been canceled so I just forgot about it for a while, but then it came out on DVD with good reviews so I bought it and watched it with my young sons. We all loved it! Just as every reviewer has said, the plot is about the daughter of Batman and Catwoman, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle's child and her affiliation with her mentor/best friend Barbara Gordon(Commissioner Gordon's daughter and Batman's former protégé') who is now called Oracle and the new addition to the team Dinah Lance(Black Canary's daughter), which does not follow the comics exactly, but that is okay because of how well it plays out. As a show, it had a strong plot, good acting and writing, just about everyone agreed that Barbara Gordon was played very faithfully by Dina Meyer and so was Ian Abercrombie's Alfred Pennyworth. The show boasted a solid soundtrack, very solid in fact, the opening song ""Revolution"" and the final ones ""All the Things She Said"" and ""A Sorta Fairytale"" were more than perfect fits. Visually it was a dark leather, but not too dark Gotham, which wasn't bad. The show had more of a cinematic touch for its 40 minute episodes.<br/><br/>The cast was great, actors and characters, but all in all, any good story has a fantastic ending, and boy does this show deliver. It delivered as well as any show I have ever seen in fact. It had great pacing, and circular storytelling that is nowhere near trite, one easily can begin to believe in, and cheer for these characters. You begin to love and hurt along with them.<br/><br/>In the end, Birds of Prey was a great show, not just a good one, but a great one, and I would like that maybe someday, a network will bring it back with the same three lead actresses, at least as a made for TV movie series.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,,14 August 2011
708,Birds of Prey," Slick, fun, great cast","This show has the kind of plot structure that works best for addicting television shows. Like ""X-files,"" ""Buffy"" and ""Angel,"" the shows mostly focus on a plot that begins and is resolved within the one hour. However, many of these plots lend themselves to the throughplot, a second plot that lasts entire seasons and is basically the bad guy's plan to take over the town. So there's a bit of serial, but not so much that you can't come in mid-season. I don't know what confused the other commentator. The introduction makes everything very clear. There are humans and meta-humans. Meta-humans have '""X"" Men' type qualities. Two of our fighting trio are meta-human. Batgirl, who is called ""Oracle"" now, is just a human.<br/><br/>
It's great to see Mia Sara working again, this time as the ""bad guy."" She's obviously having a lot of fun playing the successor to the Joker and she's a lot of fun to watch. And you gotta give kudos to the network for having an inter-racial romance.<br/><br/>The action scenes are very well done. The wires aren't super obvious, the kicks are quick. I watch very little television as feature films are my main addiction, but this one is getting added to my personal faves. I also recommend The Dead Zone, Gilmore Girls and Alias.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,,3 January 2003
709,Birds of Prey, Had Potential,"This series really had a lot going for it. Too bad they couldn't hire better writers. If you saw the first episode then that's all you needed to see because every episode after it was exactly the same. They basically kept recycling the same script over and over again. Introduce lame villain-of-the-week (trust me, they were lame), one of the three girls develops a personal vendetta against the villain, against everyone's wishes she sets out to kill villain on her own, other girls swoop in and save the day, girl with personal vendetta learns her lesson (teamwork and justice not revenge and blah, blah, blah). Lesson learned until the next episode when the exact same thing happens all over again but with a new bad guy. It all got very tiring, very fast. Nothing new ever happened and character development was practically non-existent. Another flaw was that due to pressure from the teen-friendly WB network, the producers were forced to replace one of the characters from the comics with a new teenage character who was so full of angst that you wanted to smack her. She was also worthless. Think Dawn from ""Buffy"" only more annoying. Based on the premise alone, I really wanted to like this show but I was never given a good enough reason to like it. A wasted effort.",14 out of 20 found this helpful.,3.0,15 March 2007
710,Birds of Prey," A good effort, a shame it didn't last","OK, I'll admit it...I'm a sucker for women kicking butt. Xena...Buffy...Witchblade...I love all those shows.  I was never familiar with the ""Birds of Prey"" comic book, mainly because I have a disdain for anything with the DC Comics logo on it, so I was relatively unfamiliar when I tried out the series pilot.  Free of the fanboy adherence to over-analyze everything in a comic book adaptation, I was highly entertained.<br/><br/>The story is this: Batman and Catwoman have a child, Helena (Ashley Scott), who Batman is unaware of.  Catwoman raises Helena until the day she is murdered by a henchman of the Joker while Helena watches helpless.  At the same time, Barbara Gordon (aka Batgirl, played by Dina Meyer) is shot by the Joker, paralyzing her from the waist down.  Batman skips town in distress. Barbara takes Helena in, who we discover has ""metahuman"" abilities (replace that with ""mutant"" and you have the X-Men), and Helena becomes the Huntress, defender of New Gotham.  The two take in Dinah (Rachel Skarsten), a teenage runaway who has an ever-expanding array of psychic powers including precognition and telekinesis.  Of course, all of this is explained at the beginning of each episode by Batman's ever-present butler Alfred (Ian Abercrombie).<br/><br/>""Birds of Prey"" is shot beautifully, each episode featuring theatrical-quality cinematography...in wide-screen no less!  The special effects are above average for network television, easily the equal of established shows like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Angel.""  Dina Meyer is fantastic, easily conveying the complexities of a superheroine now confined to behind-the-scenes work, humbled by her own arrogant youth. Ashley Scott has the right attitude for her role, and she seems to get better with each episode.  Rachel Skarsten is only mediocre, however, as the budding superhero, and she seems to have studied her Buffy tapes way too much.  Mia Sara is also surprisingly effective in the role of Harley Quinn, Joker's vengeful girlfriend intent on destroying New Gotham...and masquerading as Dr. Harleen Quinzell, Helena's court-appointed anger management therapist (and, no, this isn't a spoiler since it's discovered in the first episode).  The plots and scripts for ""Birds of Prey"" are standard superhero fare, however, but care has been taken to keep episodes consistent, and there is an average level of quality the episodes always reach.<br/><br/>As superhero movies/TV shows go, this one is far above average...it's certainly better than the odious ""Mutant X"" and the horribly sanitary ""Smallville"".  The producers seem to have taken a cue from Bryan Singer, whose adaptation of the X-Men stands as one of the best comic adaptations of all time: be faithful, but be accessible.  Without pandering to the rabid Internet fanboys or to the legions of teenage girls who just want to see Tom Welling with his shirt off, ""Birds of Prey"" is a fine piece of entertainment...fun without being silly, dramatic without being ponderous. And people who've never read a comic in their life can watch it without editor's notes.<br/><br/>As I write this, of course, the WB has canceled this show. It's a shame, really, because with a full season and even a second one, the show could have developed into something great...remember, even ""Buffy"" (my favorite show) wasn't that great until 2nd season.  But there's always the movies...8 out of 10.",11 out of 15 found this helpful.,,29 November 2002
711,Birds of Prey, A comic book fan....,"The show had a good start. Some comic book fans are groaning because they strayed from the comic book storyline. Most are glad to see that the series exists.<br/><br/>Dina Meyer gave a strong performance as Barbara Gordon. She was a believable leader of the crime fighting trio. The other characters still need to settle in their new roles a bit. Ashley Scott has a good start with her Huntress metahuman abilities. She had decent fight scenes. Dinah (Rachel Skarsten) will probably draw in younger viewers to the show.<br/><br/>Harley Quinn is a character that should be used like in the Batman cartoon, otherwise this is a waste of a character. Mia Sara's portrayal is too sinister so far. It left me asking when the Harley Quinn we know and love will pop up. Possibly, this might happen when she sees the Joker? (I wonder what Kevin Smith thinks....)<br/><br/>Kudos for using Mark Hamill as the voice of the Joker.<br/><br/>I like that Batman is hidden in the shadows, because it builds up  mystery for the dark knight. This is not the ""Batman"" show. Its about characters that have a connection to Batman and Gotham City.<br/><br/>I'm hoping Birds of Prey gets a chance this season to build up its storyline. This WB show probably has the ability to knock UPN's Buffy out in the same timeslot. Its is fresh and probably has a following started already. (Its also filling the void leftover from the cancellation of Witchblade).<br/><br/>I will be tuning in next week....<br/><br/>
For those who don't follow the comic books:<br/><br/>1. Barbara's reason for being in a wheelchair was shown almost like it was in the tradepaper back ""The Killing Joke"". The Joker was trying to drive her father, Commissioner Gordon, mad not Batman.<br/><br/>2. In the Birds of Prey comic, Huntress is Helena Bertinelli. Her family was gunned down by a rival mob organization. The Batman/Catwoman story was used to pull in viewers who were not familiar with the charaters. (Its possible that this was mentioned in an alternate comic book timeline). They've tamed down her outfit (like the Xmen movie) to make it less ""comical"" and more ""real world"".<br/><br/>3. Dinah Lance was the Black Canary, who is the third member. The Dinah Lance in the tv series is a bit young. This will probably be explained in a future episode.....<br/><br/>4. Don't expect to see much of Batman, he's not a main player in the comic book series. He's more of a guest star.<br/><br/>If you want to know the real deal, get ""Black Canary/Oracle/Huntress: Birds of Prey"" Book 1 if you still can.....",19 out of 29 found this helpful.,,12 October 2002
712,Birds of Prey, Really Really Good,"There is a lot to say about this show, there really is. I remember watching this show when it first came on, the premise had intrigued me, and I was a comic book fan, so I was really alienated by watching a show with barbara gordon, it really is like watching Batman Beyond or the TAS or even the movies when comparing to the comics, but this is by no means a bad thing. Just as every reviewer has, the plot is about Batman and Catwoman, Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle's child and her affiliation with her mentor/ best friend Barbara Gordon who is now Oracle and the new addition to the team Dinah Lance, which so far it feels like an Elseworlds BOP comic, and that is exactly how it plays out. It revels in the mythology, but adding or taking anything away from it. For instance, the Catwoman and Batman portrayed are obviously Batman Returns material, which by all means isn't bad. Unless you're a fan of the mythos as presented in post-1986 DC, then you may have to adjust, for in reality it is an assembly of many things, No Man's Land's Earthquake for instance, but none of this bad, by all means it is far from it.<br/><br/>As a show, this is where things get interesting. It has a strong plot, good acting and writing, just about everyone agrees that Barbara Gordon is played very faithfully by Dina Meyer and so is Ian Abercrombie's Alfred Pennyworth.

You begin to love and hurt along with them.<br/><br/>I would actually be remiss not to point out the performance of both Harley Quinns, Mia Sara is fantastic, very visual and has a look, and Sherilynn Flynn who most likely would've been subtle, which may have worked equally as effective.<br/><br/>In the end, Birds of Prey was a great show, not just a good one, but a great one, maybe someday, we'll get to see what happens next to Batman's little girl all grown up.",24 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,27 November 2004
713,Birds of Prey, Another fresh look at the Batman Formulae,"Birds of Prey is set years after Batman's final victory against The Joker; a battle with a terrible price. Catwoman was killed, and Batgirl (Dina Meyer) was confined to a wheelchair for life. Batman disappears...apparently, too stricken with grief to continue. In his absence, Barbara Gordon (Batgirl) becomes ""The Oracle,"" acting as the eyes and ears of her protégée, The Huntress (Ashley Scott). The Huntress has a personal vendetta against the criminals of Gotham; she's Catwoman and Batman's daughter. So continues the Bat-legacy.<br/><br/>Enter `bird' #3: Dinah Lance (Rachel Skarsten), a young psychic who arrives to Gotham to explain the strange dreams she's been having. Of course, comic book buffs will know that Dinah Lance is the name of The Black Canary, thereby completing the ""Birds of Prey"" trio. However, for now, she's just a young novice, learning to be a super-heroine as the series progresses...<br/><br/>While comic-purists whine about comic-book inconsistencies, there is a lot to love about this ""alternate"" Bat-city. For one, their arch-nemesis is Harley Quinn (Mia Sara), who was once The Joker's main squeeze. The premiere also had the fun of Mark Hammil as the voice of the Joker, which he performs as brilliantly as he did in the cartoons. Best of all, though, is how The Huntress' eyes turn into feline slits before a fight; it may not be like The Huntress of comic lore, though who cares? It's a cool shot, plain and simple.<br/><br/>Regardless, some comic purists insist there is no way Catwoman and Batman had a child. What's the alternative, kiddies? That the rumors about Batman preferring the company of young boys are true.? Of course he and Selena Kyle were more than `just friends,' as we've seen in movies, TV, the comics, and even the cartoons. So yeah one thing led to another and Huntress was born. It could happen. Accept it.<br/><br/>Of course, you can never tell what series will be accepted by younger audiences. Back in the 1970's, ""The Six Million Dollar Man"" lasted four seasons, while ""Bionic Woman"" lasted only two; go figure. In today's pop culture, will a young Superman in ""Smallville"" be considered cooler than Batman's daughter in ""Birds of Prey""? If so, that's a shame. There is a lot to like about this series. I look forward to seeing Birds of Prey as long as it lasts. I hope that's a long while.",17 out of 27 found this helpful.,,10 October 2002
714,Birds of Prey, A great show with real potential!,"Hi there.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I watched Birds of Prey, since I like to give a comic book show a chance before writing it off. I did the same thing last year with the Smallville pilot, which didn't really impress me.<br/><br/>But this was fantastic! The guys that did this show, did an excellent job. It was like watching a spin-off of the Batman films. You know, the good ones. The passing glimpses of Batman were well done, Ian Abercrombie was a great Alfred, and the brief shots of Catwoman and Joker (voiced by Mark Hamill, how cool is that!?!) were all really well done. They used the movie Catwoman costume! Amazing!<br/><br/>I loved Dina Meyer as Batgirl/Oracle. She did a great job bringing Barbara to life, and I hope we get to see more of her in that kickass Batgril costume.<br/><br/>Huntress was great. I'll admit, when I saw Huntress in previews I was expecting to hate her, but she was really, really likeable. And her fight scenes were incredible.<br/><br/>Dinah LANCE (yes Lance, contrary to reports) was nice. She brought a good outsiders feel, and I can't wait to meet her mother, the Black Canary!<br/><br/>The shots through the city were great as well. The closing one with Oracle and Huntress on the rooftop, and the bat flying by the moon was so cool.<br/><br/>Bringing in Harleen Quinzel was a great idea and I can't wait to see where they go with this.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast was great, even that pretty boy, Shemar Moore.<br/><br/>I cannot heap enough praise on the pilot episode of Birds of Prey.

The action was cool and the acting better than I expected. Dina Meyor played Orcale/Barbara Gordon incredibly well, she was so realistic in the role and gave ""Babs"" so much depth it stunned me.<br/><br/>I also liked Huntress a lot, she too have depth and her relationship with the detective was good to watch.<br/><br/>Black Canary was okay but did they have to many her a kid? Ah well at least they made up for that by having the ""real"" Black Canary, Dinah's mother, show up in one episode.<br/><br/>My only faults with the series was Harley Quinn. She was so far removed from the ""true"" Harley (the animated series version will always be what I consider to be the ultimate portrayl of Miss Quinn) that they might has well have given her another name, since she was pretty much a whole different character anyway. Also what was the obsession with Meta Human's? There was far too many and it seemed every villain was one. That too was pretty stupid in my opinion.<br/><br/>Over all though Birds of Prey was a fun show. I'm sorry it got cancelled so soon, it's much better than most of the tripe on TV these days. It's too bad that more people weren't open minded enough. Birds of Prey deserved another chance. Shame it never got one.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,1 January 2004
719,Birds of Prey," Realism and science fantasy, blended beautifully","I sat through my first viewing of ""Birds of Prey"" in great delight.  The show has good characters with plans to develop them, a coherent back story, fun plots, background characters who are worth hearing about, well choreographed fight scenes, and excellent special effects -- not to mention the gorgeous and talented actresses! As a fan of the DC comic books and of the animated ""Batman"" and ""Batman Beyond"" series, I'm delighted to see true descendants of the Dark Knight, who are at the same time wholly their own people. Interestingly, one of the themes of the show is the grown-up Barbara Gordon (Batgirl/Oracle) outgrowing her self-centered vigilante self, in an excellent examination of the theme of maturity versus impetuosity. The fact that the actress looks and sounds remarkably like Tracy Scoggins of Babylon 5 doesn't hurt. And then there's Helena Kyle, a twenty-something smartass metahuman, the embodiment of impetuosity, who is the daughter of Bruce Wayne and Selena Kyle, and Dinah, a teenage metahuman dealing with high school (she has a very pretty lesbian best friend with a pretty girlfriend, and that plot point was brought out exactly as Dinah would probably have found out in real life) as well as crime-fighting. All in all, a very nifty show that I want to see again.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,27 November 2002

The only real flaw is that some of the special effects are kinda dated... but it is 15+ years old. This show had a fantastic cast. And if you compare the fight scenes to those on Arrow, Flash, etc., this is right there with them... only 15 years earlier. Most of the negative comments are from supposed *purists* that can't accept that this doesn't EXACTLY follow the comic book canon. Instead, it's a beautiful adaptation of an alternate to the comic books. Of course, the naysayers don't admit that there are more than 5 iterations of Batman and 8 of Superman, but no... how dare the BoP not follow their sexist, preconceived idea of what this HAD to be.

The Birds are pretty foxy and it does try to lean on DC myth with Batgirl/Oracle being disabled and Huntress being the Batbaby of Bruce and Selena. The trouble with DC stuff on TV film is that it can be really terrible, but Birds of Prey series is pretty good, probably not good enough for die-hard DC fans. I'm a huge Nightwing fan and thought I might catch Grayson making an appearance in the series, yet alas there wasn't. Anyway, it seemed like a vehicle for the Huntress character and 'Wow', I loved it for that. Hence, I'm now in love with the short haired Huntress. Traditionally, she has long dark hair but the style of this Huntress really suits the actress. I absolutely loved the series. Don't let the die-hard DC fans put you off.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,6 June 2019
723,Birds of Prey, They should have let it last longer,"Years after Batman left Gotham, trio Birds of Prey takes over his role.

There are also Alfred - Batman's old battler, Jesse - young inspector in love with Huntress, Harley Queen who tries to step in her old boyfriend's shoes and bunch of meta-humans. Show keeps Batman atmosphere while trying to distinguish itself from Batman story. It's not particularly original, but it's fun and holds attention.

724,Birds of Prey, A live action TV series about Batman's daughter fighting crime with the former bat girl.,"This is a short lived TV series that aired on the WB network(now the cw)in 2002. This is the first live action TV series based on the iconic batman comics since the classic 60's TV show. The producers of the great WB show Smallville produced this show. I used to watch this show and I eventually got it on DVD. I feel like this show had a lot of potential but was a miss opportunity. I'm a huge batman/comic book fan so I have a lot to say. First,the show is loosely based on a spin-off comic series of the same name, with the former bat-girl working with two female heroes, huntress and black canary. Which sounds like a great idea for a fresh take for a batman TV series. But the show made some good and bad changes. In the show ""the huntress"" is the daughter of batman &amp; catwoman, this is the original origins for her in the comics but was quickly changed to the huntress having no connection to batman &amp; catwoman. Barber Gordan was the original bat girl &amp; daughter of commissioner Gordan but in a 1988 comic book she was shot by the joker and paralyze from the waist down and became ""Oracle"", a professor x like mentor to the huntress &amp; black canary. They stayed pretty true to her in this show. Black Canary is one of the few batman characters that have a super power, a sonic scream. But she only appears in one episode, but her daughter of the same name took her place in the show. The show then added something unique, that batman left Gotham city, so it's just the girls. The show starts off strong with a great back story prolong in the pilot episode. Batman's butler Alfred tells the story of a war between Batman &amp; the joker that brought down joker's empire, he got his revenge by killing catwoman, who batman was in love with and paralyzed bat girl, which caused batman to leave Gotham in guilt. The best part of the entire show is this prolong which featured a cameo by Mark Hamil as the voice of the joker, saying the world's creepiest knock-knock joke and his best joker laugh ever. And the main villain of the show is Harley Quinn, the joker's girlfriend &amp; henchwoman, out to avenged the joker. This is all a great set-up &amp; premise for a new batman show, so went wrong? Despite, a great premise you need good episodes to keep you involved. First the star, the huntress played by Ashley Scott, could'eve been a better character then she was. Scott didn't do a bad job but they should'eve made her more like the comics with her purple outfit and cross-bows. Her back story was good but it was weird that she wore no costume and wore no mask, she just had a black duster. The writers tried to make her tough &amp; rebellious like in the comics but I felt the writers could never find the right balance for her, she came off as too unlikeable at times. The best part of the show was Diana Meyer as Oracle, she looks just like a older Barber Gordan and played the part perfectly. She was smart, logical everything Barbra should be. They also have the watchtower base Oracle operates from. Rahel Skarsten as Diana Lance but despite having the same name she was not Black Canary. ""Canary"" appeared in episode 6 as Diana's mom and as a possible set-up for Diana to take her mom's place. But she did not have the canary's power, her power was to see into a person future by touching them. It would'eve been a lot better to just make ""the canary"" like how she is in the comics. Here she's a little too much like the annoying little kid who wants to be in the action but told to stay ""here"". I like seeing Alfred as a regular and it's a good connection to batman. The biggest problem is that the show didn't draw more from the comics, the villains were mostly created for the show and not that great, like one guy can turn into water. It would'eve been better to see the riddler,bain, scarecrow, &amp; others as villains then the new ones they created. Mr. Zsasz, a villain too violent for the cartoons but would'eve been great to see here. Lady Sheiva, from the comics, appears, but just OK here. Harley Quinn played by Mia Sara came off as too serious not wacky like in the comics &amp; cartoons. But I still like the way Mia played her and it was nice to see a live action version of one of my favorite villains, Harley, as the main villain no less. But the worst thing are the plot holes. They made the season finale knowing they wouldn't be coming back but failed to fill these holes.The final episode showed that Clayface killed catwoman but no mention of the joker or how he found out about batman &amp; catwoman or how Joker knew bat girl's identity. Harley Quinn reveals her self as the main villain but how could Oracle or Alfred not know who she is when they fought the joker. And they never explained how she escaped jail time after her crimes with the joker. The season finale really had nothing too do with previous episodes and tied no lose ends. But I enjoyed watching Mia Sara finally act wacky as Harley Quinn. But they should'eve had her wear her court jester costume, that would'eve been great! The show had a great premise but the weekly episodes should'eve been better.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,7.0,28 May 2012
725,Birds of Prey, Do I have to wait till fall for the second episode?,"The only thing BAD about the Birds of Prey pilot episode is that it ends. After watching it with some doubt of enjoyment, I was left wanting more in the end. Does that mean the acting is perfection? That the show is perfect, flawless, wouldn't change a thing? NO, that's not what it means. However, you can tell there was a lot of love (or money at least) put into this Pilot. The city looks beautiful. Gotham City was a good computer-generated investment. I also recognize what a Pilot is, it's a beginning. Despite being the baby of the team, the ""reformed version"" of Dinah is anything but a helpless kid. I sort of accept that there's going to be something childlike about her, but it's clear she has the potential and dedication to be a good future crime fighter. Dina Meyer is Barbara Gordon, there's little doubt about that. A lot of people will be watching just for her. Huntress, well I'm giving Ashley a break. She is still learning how to change modes from sarcastic smart-mouth to a softer side of her character. Still she's fun to watch when she's being sarcastic and has amazing cat-like movement. Her fight scenes are great to watch. What will make or break this series, and I think it already the best part, is the Huntress / Oracle chemistry? The best thing about this series is Ashley Scott playing mostly opposite Dina Meyer? They reflect off each other well. The series most important relationship will be this friendship, not the Huntress/Resse relationship (that will they/won't they thing they're trying to build). ""Birds of Prey"" has the potential to be a good ""Gotham"" based series on the WB. This is the type of series you either love at first viewing or hate. You either accept the changes or don't. I really don't know if this will soar on the WB or fall flat, but I do know a) even good shows get canceled and b) this has the potential to be great. So I'm hoping for the best.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,,19 July 2002
726,Terra Nova," Good concept, but needs more original thinking","The whole family thing has the wrong feel for the situation. It's like they just moved there from Orange County. The teens are petulant babies. I doubt that would be the case if they had really just left an overpopulated, dangerously polluted world run by a harshly militaristic government. Why can't there be some original thinking about how people might behave in such a precarious situation with an uncertain future, dinosaur threats, and a competing population. Maybe this is a world where teens use their capable brains in new and interesting ways, rather than as trite selfish brats who need babysitting. I doubt that teens would act like that if they were in this situation. Yes, it's good to have varying levels of behavior; not everyone has to be brilliant or saintly. But behavior is influenced by situation and it should bring unique fears, force some creativity, plus there is an obvious ability to have impact in such a small population. What are the relevant issues in this world and how do they impact the inhabitants?",408 out of 523 found this helpful.,4.0,27 September 2011
727,Terra Nova, Terra Nova ... slow start but gaining speed,"Okay folks, <br/><br/>I get it that for most of you high and mighty reviewers Terra Nova seems to be dumb. but I honestly do not feel this way.<br/><br/>People complaining about some holes and everything is just ridiculous with a series that is sending people 80million years in the past. come on people, give them a chance. (if anyone is going to mention the asteroid again I'm going to scream ... 16 million years until impact you geniuses out there. that's enough for a thousand civilizations to rise and fall so stop whining and use your oh soo awesome brains)<br/><br/>so let me tell you that yes, the first 4 episodes a rather drama heavy with long character plots to get to know them. and yes, the CGI is not the best on the market. but that did not keep me from Doctor Who or LEX and it's sure as hell not going to keep me from anything else.<br/><br/>I really love the direction of the later episodes when the meta plot gets going and we get a broader picture of what is wrong with Terra Nova, Commander Taylor and the Sixers.<br/><br/>The acting still ranges between average and sometimes very good. episode 9 had a nice Stephen Lang moment.<br/><br/>give the show a try, maybe jump in the later episodes and forget about the CGI.<br/><br/>suspend the disbelief and just enjoy it. it's better than most of the other crap out there, and you can watch it with the whole family. <br/><br/>and dammit, it has Dinosaurs!",118 out of 149 found this helpful.,7.0,1 December 2011
728,Terra Nova," Well, SOMEONE Had to Like It...","I've watched five or so episodes of Terra Nova thus far, and I think it is quite good, definitely not the drivel that one would believe from scrolling through the first couple of pages of reviews on IMDb. Calling something ""family friendly"" doesn't really offend my sensibilities- why can't families have shows that are appropriate for all members to watch? True, the gore and body-count in the series is noticeably lower than we have be trained to expect from any offering that features dinosaurs, but I never finish an episode and say, ""Gee, I wish more characters had died and exposed their shredded flesh on camera to preserve my sense of realism this time!""<br/><br/>Obviously, the graphics and scenery are really well done, as one would expect from all the hype surrounding the large-budget production. The dinosaurs are better than anything I've seen on television, and I admire the care and planning that has been put into the futuristic trappings. <br/><br/>The cast and characters are generally well-done. Jason O'Mara and Shelley Conn have great chemistry and I have enjoyed watching their characters rekindle their relationship. I will agree that two of the children: the youngest daughter and the eldest son, are grating and pointless. The daughter seems to mainly have existed as a plot point in the pilot: to give the family a reason to escape to Terra Nova and ratchet up the stakes while still building sympathy for the parents. After that, she's just too cutesy-wootsy and tends to get in the way. The son is the dreaded ""worst offender"" of the show. I think that probably without him, a lot more people wouldn't have so much to complain about. Every single storyline for him is a mess of clichés, from ""son is inexplicably always angry with father"" to ""son is horny and will do stupid things for a hot chick"" to ""son is a moron and really deserves to die, but he is a main character, so we will kill someone else to teach him a Very Important Lesson."" The middle daughter is much more tolerable and her storyline is (dare I say it?) sweet. In that manner, I find it kind of refreshing to mash up family-friendliness with sci-fi stuff. How often in dinosaur flicks do you get to have ""sweet"" (not ooky-gooky, just tender) moments between characters? Not that often. Stephen Lang and Christine Adams as opposing leaders of Terra Nova and the Sixers are probably the strongest performers of the lot.<br/><br/>Overall, the stories have been pretty good, and never what I would consider to be offensively unwatchable. It's not LOST, but geeze, why should anything else try to be LOST? LOST was LOST and this is Terra Nova, and it is good at what it is. It's interesting and exciting and entertaining. The b-plots can tread on tired ground, as I have mentioned above, but the a-plots are solid.<br/><br/>Overall, Terra Nova does what it aims to do well. Sort of a loose contemporary spin on Lost in Space, but with dinosaurs. If you don't like those kinds of shows, guess what? You won't like this. And that's okay, but that doesn't mean that Terra Nova is badly done by any means.",80 out of 101 found this helpful.,9.0,3 December 2011
729,Terra Nova, Give it a chance,"No Terra Nova is not as good as Jurassic Park, but did anyone really expect it be be? <br/><br/>I believe that people are too quick to write Terra Nova off. Even great sci-fi shows such as Falling Skies, BattleStar Galactica and Stargate first come under negative reviews and yet went on to become successful. The acting and choice of actors has also come under criticism and yet no one would enjoy watching a series about a whole military base fighting the odd dinosaur and killing all enemies. The civilian element, much like the colonial fleet in Battlestar, helps to cause trouble within Terra Nova (ie the sixer spy). The human element is crucial to ALL sci-fi's -surely people must realise this? If not i recommend watching a different genre (Preferably a war film)<br/><br/>About the CGI used in Terra Nova. What can u expect from a TV Series? The big films may be able to get the best CGI but for a TV series it is incredibly harder (And has caused shows like Stargate to be cancelled). Is the CGI so bad? No, not compared to some current shows broadcast on SciFi.<br/><br/>Overall i believe People need to give Terra Nova a chance, especially as the story is now getting deeper.

730,Terra Nova, Family falls into time plot holes,"The show starts out in the future where humans due to ""greed and ignorance"" have destroyed Earth's environment. The rich live in domed cities (Logan's Run) to protect them from the bad air and the overpopulated poor. The main family, the Shannons, consist of two parents and their 3 children, the third being illegal. Since the planet (America) is overpopulate, families are only allowed 2 children. The police come in to search for this law infraction and the dad ends up getting arrested for fighting with the police. We find out later that the family would have only gotten a fine. Plot Hole: If there is such a strict law, then they probably would take the child and euthanize it, not just a small payable fine. If it was just a fine, the family would have just paid the fine earlier, because the mother has a very well paying job. It is her job qualifications that allows her to be selected to go to Terra Nova (without her husband) and not have to worry about winning a lottery selection.<br/><br/>Since the Earth is dying, scientist accidentally find a crack in the time/space continuum that allows them to go back in time millions of years. This is apparently a one way trip. We also find out that there is a probe sent, but never found, which leads scientist to believe that whatever they do in the past won't affect the current time line. It isn't explained how they know how far back the crack in time goes, since they can't find evidence left back in time. They also don't explain how they can communicate with whatever is sent back. Plot Hole: if they can't confirm that they are actually sending things back in time, how do they know they aren't disintegrating whatever they send through the event horizon? Obvious Future Spoiler: The probe has been found, which is why they know that they can affect the future from the past and why the ""Sixers"" were sent.<br/><br/>The Shannon family breaks out Dad from a ""maximum security"" prison with a simple laser cutter and not much else. Dad breaks into the ""maximum security"" time travel center using stuff left out in the open crowded train station by the family. Dad brings illegal daughter in a backpack and family goes through time crack. So many 'deus ex machina' moments in that sequence. Where was the illegal child being held during the 2 years Dad was in prison? If everyone is given provision when they get to the camp, then why do individuals bring backpacks with them? This is a science/military expedition, everyone would probably be issued clothes and other things and only allowed a few personal items.<br/><br/>Plot Hole: We also learn from the leader of Terra Nova camp that the difference between one person stepping into the time crack and the next is months. Yet, when 200 people go through, they all appear on the same day, not delayed. Did they improve the process and just leave that part out? Also, you hear announcements about more oxygen in the air and how much brighter the sun will be when they go back in time. There is no mention of how everyone in the current barely visible sun time line will require major amounts of sunscreen when they encounter clear skies and a blazing sun. <br/><br/>After everything is straightened out with the stowaway Dad and child, we get into the predictable plots. Teenagers living on their own who spend the after work hours (apparently the writers never worked on a farm) jumping the fence to go drink moonshine at the only restricted area near the camp. The group of teens enter a restricted area and get into trouble. <br/><br/>The family is clichéd out the wazzu. The boy teenager hates the Dad for going to jail for 2 years, which according to him is a very long time. Future Obvious Spoiler : The girl teenager is a science geek who will later figure out the drawings on some rocks left by the missing son of the camp leader. The illegal youngest child is inquisitive and calmly goes and feeds a brontosaurus, having never seen any animals in her short 5 year life. And the most that the Dad and Mom show for emotion is a little hand holding. They've been apart for two years!<br/><br/>Since there has to be more than every day life problems on Terra Nova, there are the ""Sixers"". The ""Sixers"" were sent in the 6th wave of time traveling pioneers by some unknown group determined to change the past, to control the future. In the end, you are given the feeling that the ""Sixers"" are good guys, while the camp leader is a bad guy.<br/><br/>The biggest plot hole is the mass extinction event of the dinosaurs. What is the point of creating a new civilization that could be possibly wiped out when the dinosaurs go belly up? <br/><br/>So far the show has been predictable and at times boring. I am sure most will find it entertaining enough to continue watching the series.",138 out of 206 found this helpful.,,27 September 2011
731,Terra Nova, There's nothing 'nova' in here...,"Season premiere was pretty bad. Mind you the production values are quite decent with good FX and costumes and whatnot. However...<br/><br/>The Story? Boriiiiiing. It started very good, in a dystopian future, which seemed pretty interesting even if not the most original of settings... But it only declines from there. At the end of it all, we're in a ""family drama"", a very cliché one incidentally, with dinosaurs.... so yeah.<br/><br/>The plot is dumb. Typical dumb characters that do dumb things because there needs to happen something to fill the time of the show. The characters are dull, completely un-original, their dialogue is often cringe-inducing, and sadly, the actors that portray them don't seem to be very inspired.<br/><br/>It's fine to have laser guns and dinosaurs and retro-sci-fi stuff, but give us an intelligent story please. I don't want to watch another show about the estranged dad, the angsty son, the nerdy daughter, the innocent child, the worried mom, the hot girl-friend and the over-confident military guy...

732,Terra Nova, Looks like this clay model broke it's mold,"At first, like most folks, I was excited about this show based on the trailer, concept etc. I watched the first few episodes and realized it's a rather conservative, formulaic show clearly designed to be a family drama that was safe enough for children to watch with their parents and of a topical arrangement tolerable for most modern parents.<br/><br/>However, the show has developed immensely in the final few episodes of the first season. The majority of the episodes were drab, capsulated pieces of neutral television programming. However, what has developed in the last few episodes leads me to believe that this show has tremendous potential. Main Characters die, big things happen, the plot twists and thickens and the action picks up quite a bit. I still can't call the plot original at all, it's Avatar/Jurassic Park/Earth 2/Lost/Stargate all the way but who cares? Firefly was just a show based on Han Solo, The Wire is just the Sopranos over again and Law &amp; Order...well need I say more?<br/><br/>In just 3 or 4 episodes, this went from a show I caught on Hulu because I couldn't sleep to a show that's now at the top of my list. Too bad they waited until the very end of the season to make the show worth while, there's a whole lotta boring episodes to sit through to get to the good stuff, that could alienate a lot of potential viewers. <br/><br/>Time will tell.",70 out of 104 found this helpful.,9.0,20 December 2011
733,Terra Nova," Terra Nova is great for families, give it a chance to mature","Terra Nova is a great show! Fox should be commended for producing a truly family-friendly series, a brave thing to do these days. Terra Nova and The Middle are about the only family- friendly shows on TV right now. Everyone else puts in sexual scenes or incidents that degrade the characters, distract from the story and jar family viewers for no reason. As Bill Cosby said, ""It's like someone put red pepper flakes in the Jell-O pudding."" Terra Nova doesn't do that, but still packs enough excitement to keep jaded teens interested.<br/><br/>(Full disclosure: I joined IMDb just so I could post this review. I'm not a big network TV fan but was lured back to network TV to check out a fairy tale show on a different network, which promised to have a ""Narnia"" feel to it. Alas, it has been disappointing because it has extramarital sex in every episode (Hollywood promoting its favorite fairy tale: casual sex with no emotional damage, or venereal diseases, or pregnancies.) But that got me watching network TV again, and I'd heard about Terra Nova so I checked it out. I was pleasantly surprised - and hooked.)<br/><br/>Four reasons why I really enjoy the show:<br/><br/>1. It features a functional family who are civil with each other instead of snarky and sarcastic (rare on TV, since sarcasm is a cheap way to create conflict and laughs). The family members engage in no extramarital anything. It is extremely refreshing. My teen and 5th-grader can watch it and I don't have to hide their eyes (except for some dinosaur-on-human scenes early on). The father of the family and the Commander of the colony are strong father figures, even honorable. Admittedly, this means the writers have to resort to implausible situations (like all the blackmail) to generate conflict and interesting story lines, but that's better than having to endure another parade of atrocious role models just because that makes it easy for writers to generate conflict and drama. Give Terra Nova time to learn how to generate exciting story lines without all the tawdry, cliché techniques other shows employ. Bravo, Spielberg, et al!<br/><br/>2. The show portrays the Cretaceous period very realistically (speaking as a lifelong dinosaur fan and a geologist). The dinosaurs aren't an invincible scourge that bullets can't stop; they don't lurk behind every tree waiting to pounce; instead, the Cretaceous is like the Serengeti - both have big animals that are dangerous if you get too close, but they can be subdued or avoided with the right approach or hardware. I like it that big animals show up only now and then, as big animals really would. Big dinos should be rare, since it takes a lot of food to maintain the big ones. Someday that nearby Brachiosaurus herd can camp around the colony; that would bring in some dinos that really could snap their fence in two without trying, and the brachs would attract the really big predators that everyone wants to see.<br/><br/>3. The sets are detailed and lavish. Somebody had to BUILD this colony in Australia; it's not CG! That alone makes it a pleasure to watch - it's more believable than CG. Their futuristic technology is well-designed and plausible; it forms a natural and interesting backdrop to the story. They use it, but it doesn't get in the way. Refreshing (but probably expensive).<br/><br/>4. Scientists, doctors, and engineers have positive roles in every episode (along with the soldiers and cops). Science or medicine helps the colony in every episode; it's vital to Terra Nova's survival. This is great because we need to inspire kids to enter scientific careers, so we can keep innovating at a rate that will be competitive with China and India now that those countries each graduate more scientists and engineers than the total of all U.S. college graduates!<br/><br/>Apparently the show didn't live up to the hopes of some sci-fi fans (judging by the early reviews in this series), but it is clean, positive entertainment and that's brave for Fox to offer (and they're the only ones doing it this season). Bravo for them! As to the complaint that it is unoriginal and relies on cliché plot lines and dialogue, that is true; but everything has been done before, so calling it ""unoriginal"" is a very unoriginal criticism. I admit the show is predictable, but I don't mind that; I've watched enough sci-fi shows in 45 years to be able to predict all of them. I watch the show for the realistic rendering of dinosaurs and the positive family role models. I say give them time; their writers deserve a chance to learn how to make the show more believable. Meanwhile, the show has enough dinosaurs and cool technology to keep kids and teens (and at least one geologist) interested.",83 out of 129 found this helpful.,10.0,29 December 2011
734,Terra Nova, After 3 episodes- I'm done with it,"After watching the awful pilot, I decided to give this 2 more episodes to give it a chance. I did, and it still stinks. I'm done with this drivel.<br/><br/>I am a lifelong scifi fan, and had high hopes for this series. It had the potential to be a lot better than it is had Spielberg spent the money for decent scriptwriters.<br/><br/>This is first and foremost a ""family drama"" and oh, there's some dinosaurs. The emphasis is on only one family, and their petty day to day problems. The problem is, this family is not only *not* interesting, they're downright annoying- they're grind your teeth and roll your eyes annoying and watching them for an hour is almost as bad as having a root canal.<br/><br/>In a dying overpopulated world with a limit of 2 children per couple, Doctor Mom and Officer Dad decide to pop out another child, despite the law. Their actions were stupid, selfish, and self-centered- not to mention illegal. This made me immediately dislike them.<br/><br/>So family winds up in Terra Nova, where angry rebellious teen son never misses an opportunity to vent his angst on Dad. This got old half an hour into the pilot.<br/><br/>Teen son immediately hooks up with the hottest chick there, and instead of going to class to learn about the place and things that might actually save his life, he, hot chick and their friends venture right out into man-eating creature infested jungle to get drunk and fool around. Have you not seen this cliché before in every bad horror movie ever made? And of course the dinosaurs appear to be un-killable, as no amount of rounds fired at them has any effect, just like horror flick villains who keep getting up after they've been shot 200 times. Cliché. Cliché, cliché....<br/><br/>There is brainy older sister, and cloyingly adorable little 5 year old Zoe, who is so cutesy and needy I feel like I need an insulin injection every time she is in a scene so I don't go into diabetic shock.<br/><br/>Mommy and Daddy haven't seen each other for 2 years, and naturally want to do what people do when they've been apart, and of course needy little Zoe is always there to spoil the moment because she needs a hug, she needs to sleep in their bed, she needs a glass of water, she needs a story read to her... hey- parents- teach this brat what NO means, you'll be doing her a favor. I was really hoping these kids would all get eaten by now- no such luck.<br/><br/>Now we have Officer Dad who is jealous of Doctor Mom's ex-boyfriend, who has shown up at the compound, and of course Dad is acting like a jealous 16 year old douchebag instead of a grown man who has more important things to think about- like not becoming lunch for something big, hungry, and bullet-proof.<br/><br/>All the major characters in this show have about as much depth as a piece of toilet paper.<br/><br/>People compare this to ""Lost"" a lot. Lost was far more interesting, with better characters. The story did not revolve around the same characters every episode. The day to day effort to survive, and the flora and fauna in this world gets little coverage at all. Maybe that's because the alleged script writers might have to do some *research* to make things scientifically plausible? This is more like ""Jersey Shore meets Jurassic Park"" complete with stupid, whiny, annoying people you want to strangle.<br/><br/>If you want to watch dinosaurs- watch BBC's ""Primeval"". Now that's a fun ride, with great story lines and characters, and good CGI.<br/><br/>If you want to watch good end of the world survival shows- catch ""Jericho"" from 2006, or BBC's ""Survivors"" from 2008.<br/><br/>I won't be tuning in for the next episode, I'd rather wash the kitchen floor or do laundry.",54 out of 89 found this helpful.,1.0,12 October 2011
735,Terra Nova, A very average show,"I was pretty excited for this show when I first saw the previews/trailers/etc. I got it on iTunes today and I'm a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>This show is really just your typical, clichéd family drama with some futuristic guns and a few dinosaurs. The acting is just decent and the story is actually pretty boring. The characters are all very one dimensional, boring, etc. The computer effects are sub par, which is a disappointment since they are used so often.<br/><br/>In short, it's just you're typical, PC Fox show. I don't know how many more of these they're going to make before they die away as a company.",218 out of 407 found this helpful.,5.0,27 September 2011
736,Terra Nova," Jurassic Park this is not, nor is it the new LOST","When I heard Spielberg was exec producing a show about dinosaurs, I half expected Jurassic Park: The Series. All the makings are here. Same for LOST, the two things that this show will inevitably be compared to. It shoots for the mystery and stranded feel of LOST, while throwing in the dinosaurs and the family dynamic of Jurassic Park. Sadly, this is neither, but something in between just shy of the quality of both.<br/><br/>For those unaware of the story, we are taken to the future first, where Earth has become an overpopulated, uninhabitable mess. To solve this problem, for a reason yet to be explained, humanity decides to time warp back 85 million years ago, where they can live in peace and harmony with dinosaurs. Or, as the first episode would like us to believe, can run and scream in terror as carnivorous dinosaurs keep people penned in their little colony and out of the jungle. The focus of the show is the Shannon family, new pilgrims to the colony who quickly learn what's what around Terra Nova. Of course, the most entertaining and interesting character is Stephen Lang, who plays a friendlier version of his character from Avatar. After all, who can't get enough gruff, military commander Stephen Lang.<br/><br/>For the most part, Terra Nova is entertaining, interesting, yet wholly disposable television. It has the Spielbergian touches and is somewhat reminiscent of early 2000, late 90's sci-fi TV. Where those similar aspects in LOST were unfolded in a slow burn to let things sink in for the viewer, or where our introduction to the danger of the dino's in Jurassic Park was slowly brought forth, here it's thrown at you in force. Not for a while, as we have to get acquainted with our main characters, but dangerous thunder lizards are soon enough thrown our way. The carnage shown is a bit surprising considering it's basic TV, yet there are no known deaths, just a few strong, gory moments (depending on your definition of gory) here and there. The dinosaurs themselves are less than desirable. Whereas Jurassic Park, which essentially perfected dinosaurs with a mix of practical and cg effects, had pleasing dinosaurs, here they seem a bit awkward and out of place. Almost completely cg, these dinosaurs look about 5 or 6 years old in the cg department. It would appear that the budget for creating the dinosaurs was less than sufficient, which sadly translates into poorly animated dino's.<br/><br/>Now, it's not all bad. Again, Stephen Lang is entertaining here as the military commander of the colony. The show also presents an interesting plot which I suspect could become more interesting as the season goes on. And while a show like LOST should have ended at probably it's fourth season, Terra Nova has life in it. Sadly, if it doesn't get better than the pilot, than I can't say we will see a season 2. And FOX is quite famous for canceling shows. Maybe the power of Steven Spielberg will save the show. Who knows. I'll ride it for as long as I can, I suppose. But for a pilot, the show was disappointing. What should have been a titanic, impressive two hours turned into a lackluster event with a lack of dinosaur action (and what is up with those names? Slasher? really? We couldn't go with real dinosaurs like velociraptors, compy's, or T- rex's?), turns out to shoot for the moon but only get so far as our atmosphere.",114 out of 210 found this helpful.,,26 September 2011
737,Terra Nova," If you don't like it, then don't watch it.","I consider myself a movie buff, and I don't wander into the realm of TV very often. But when I herd about Terra Nova I was so interested I counted the days until it aired, and because I work full time and am a full time student, I subscribed to Hulu just to watch this one show. Once I saw the pilot I was hooked, have watched every episode at least twice. I love this show to me it has everything: its got some drama, some action, some mystery. OK so the CGI isn't top of the line, did you really expect it to be? I don't care what the budget is this is a show on cable! The Dinosaurs look great! maybe not perfect but great. You may say the acting is horrible or that the characters would be more intelligent, look at the world they come from, Humans in 2149 have given up, the Earth is depleted, the atmosphere is unbreathable. As the time goes by the characters almost seem to wake up, its almost like they were just husks in 2149 and Terra Nova forces them to sort of flesh out. As the plot continues the show its self fleshes out, This is a big show with a big idea, you can't expect it all to come together in the pilot. In my opinion this show got better every episode and WHEN the second season comes out it will continue to get better and better. The more I learn about Terra Nova the more I want to learn to me this show was like a drug and if that isn't the goal of a TV show tell me what is, if you don't like it thats fine go and watch something else.",30 out of 50 found this helpful.,10.0,26 December 2011
738,Terra Nova," A dull, trudging parade of clichés","You've seen Terra Nova before, in dozens of science fiction shows and movies. There is really not a single original moment in the entire show and, alas, it doesn't seem to realize this.<br/><br/>The setup is a society that's on an ecological disaster (like ""Blade Runner""), where a family is sent back into the past (with dinosaurs like ""Jurrasic Park"") to form a colony (like ""Earth 2""). The family consists of a heroic father, a smart mother, an angsty son, a genius daughter (like Lisa Simpson) and a younger, cloyingly cute younger daughter. None have the depth of a cardboard cutout.<br/><br/>Storywise, it's a mess. There is never a moment when you can't predict accurately what will happen next. It's not even difficult to do so: when the doctor is treating an accident victim, you know she's going to say ""stay with me."" <br/><br/>It also makes no sense. People say one thing about the world, then act as though the situation is completely the opposite. The setup is ludicrous (a colony has houses like that?).<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is third-rate science fiction that's about as entertaining as watching a turned-off television. It may be worth it if you create a drinking game of ""name the cliché,"" but you wouldn't make it over a half hour before passing out in a drunken stupor. <br/><br/>There is bad, there is terrible, and then there's Terra Nova.",300 out of 602 found this helpful.,1.0,27 September 2011

740,Terra Nova, A great escape with great effects and good character development,This is a great series and I looked forward to watching it each and every week. The fresh new approach to the old science fiction genre was refreshing and the character development was stellar. The interaction between the characters keep your interest and the plot twist make it interesting. I hope the series is continued. The series balanced the dangers of the prehistoric jungle with the criminal element. The power struggle between the future powers as well as the father and son communication gap gave great depth to the story. I didn't find any slow parts to the episodes or any stories unrelated to the plot line in any significant way. This is kind of a Jurrasic Park meets Lost feel that I like a lot. Check this series out and don't let negative reviews cloud your judgment.,16 out of 25 found this helpful.,10.0,4 March 2012
741,Terra Nova, Terra-bul,"A liberal serving of cheese whiz is applied to this show. It is so corny and fueled by uncreative cut and paste action cliché. We as humans messed up the earth (yet again in the sci-fi world) and are in need of time travel to the stone age to save us. Some gimmicks are used over and over. For instance the show uses the ""newness"" of an: orange, the moon shining, and clouds floating, etc...we get it the world is so jacked up an orange is a special treat. You don't have to mention everything in Terra Nova as being so different from the polluted future world. The old ""wandering into trouble for no reason"" gag was also used a couple times. The youngest child wanders from the house to feed a long neck dino and scares the parents. Elsewhere a group is trapped in a car being attacked by dinos and a chick freaks out and decides to flee and hence gets sliced up badly (but doesn't die?). Nothing in the show really makes sense or feels like it would really happen. The two parents show up and within a few days the mom is a top medical adviser and the husband is placed on lead security. If Terra Nova really has problems with sabotage wouldn't there be a slightly more rigorous process applied before privileged info is given out to brand new people??? The CGI makes the show look like it could be Jurassic Park 6, not good but not terrible, just a cheap movie. The bottom line is I don't feel like I'm in a prehistoric world. Go plant a tree, read a book, go to bed early, but don't waste your time on Terra Nova.",62 out of 117 found this helpful.,3.0,27 September 2011

743,Terra Nova, Under-rated back in time action adventure well worth a second season,Reading other comments it seems increasingly difficult to please critics. Fortunately i watched this series on Netflix before reading any comments. The entire concept of going back in time requires a stretch of the imagination and raises a host of questions. Great special effects and the odd twist and turn are thrown into this action adventure movie as people from a bleak future fight dinosaurs and others who threaten them in the past.

744,Terra Nova, Special FX for the guns are bad,"So the 2 hour premiere has a few scenes with the humans fighting dinosaurs. Apparently, the dinosaurs are bullet proof because they wouldn't take ANY damage! All you saw was a ricochet effect off them, and in some cases they were using a 50 caliber gun mounted on a transport vehicle. This wasn't a plot point or anything so it comes off as very lazy special effects. This then leaves the problem, if the guns don't hurt the dinosaurs, why would you take a weapon out to defend yourself from them if it doesn't work? I mean they had about 6 guys shooting one and it eventually turned and ran. I can see maybe they wanted to tone down the blood and death a bit in the pilot but it came off as a major flaw.",87 out of 171 found this helpful.,,27 September 2011
745,Terra Nova, Fail. Are you kidding or what?,"Another senseless, excessively violent fantasy from producers who think we are all stupid. At least the hype machine is working, even if this series, I predict, will fail completely. From the plastic modified football uniforms to the extremely tired dinosaur fantasies, there is nothing real, realistic or promising in this new series. From the really stiff acting, terrible lighting and over-crowded effects and fake habitats, everything about this series if transparent phoniness. Given the really promising and outstanding series that Fox has dumped for no good reason, there is no reason to rejoice at this over-hyped and absurd story. I found the first episode unwatchable. There is nothing in the generic and cheaply shod cast to inspire interest or caring. The cast seems empty of talent, stiff and unbelievable. A good story introduces characters the viewer can car about. The now generic partially-shaved men in their silly costumes with their predictable dialog was boring from the first minute. Why viewers have given this a rating above 1 is beyond me. Perhaps the viewers voting here are children, as children seem to love anything with dinosaurs. yet the show disrespects children and is saturated with so much mindless violence that I regret even watching the few minutes of this turkey I could take before turning off my TV and going outside to the real world.

746,Terra Nova," Unoriginal, cliché, predictable, been done many times before (you get the idea)","Spoiler (or maybe not...)<br/><br/>(Approaches the kitchen drawer and pulls out a knife) oh, I'm sorry, I was in the middle of cutting myself after watching the first episode. Every character, every line, and every plot in this show is so unoriginal. ""Rebellious"" son, angry at his father for abandoning him and his family decides to do his own thing and hang out with teens his age who put themselves in danger, the daughter is a responsible smarta** who's well-read and condescends anybody who doesn't know what the hell she's talking about, the younger daughter is curious about the world around her and plays the part of an annoyingly ""cute"" and innocent little girl, the mother is Fox's version of Dr. Grey from Grey's Anatomy, the father is every protagonist in every shooter movie. I don't even watch a lot of movies and I could play the first episode out even before its segments aired.<br/><br/>Here are some cliché moments. I could easily watch the episode and pull 20 more, but I don't feel like wasting any more of my time looking back and watching this recycled garbage. So I included four cliché moments in the first episode:<br/><br/>1) ""Did we make the right decision in moving out here?"" (Mother discussing with the father whether they made the right decision in moving to the new world) <br/><br/>2)(Son purchases a fruit in the new world and doesn't know how to eat it, an ""attractive"" girl watches from a distance laughing, she confidently busts the fruit in two, and they introduce themselves to each other) <br/><br/>3)(""Attractive"" girl takes her clothes off and reveals a bikini so she can jump off a cliff and into a pool of water down below while the son stands there hypnotized at how ""good-looking"" she is) and she responds to his gaze with, ""what are you just going to stand there and watch?"" <br/><br/>4)""Take the wheel!"" (Old man tells father to ""take the wheel"" while he plays hero with his gun)<br/><br/>I think what happens is that shows like these which take from earlier works in film and television eventually find an identity of their own and create original content as the series moves into future seasons because the amount of content and ideas they can borrow is finite, but then again I'm not sure, I look at how many seasons ""Two and a Half Men"" produced and they're still going strong with the predictable and oblivious characters they have on there.",43 out of 81 found this helpful.,1.0,1 October 2011
747,Terra Nova, Terra Nova... Mostly a rip-off and yet watchable!,"Terra Nova wasn't horrible. It was derivative and a bit clichéd. For example, the troubled relationship between estranged and reunited father and son has been done to death, but the worst part was that it seemed to have borrowed heavily from two BBC series - Outcasts and Primeval.<br/><br/>That being said, the plot offered some good elements...who are the sixers, what is their story and where will that take us? There's plenty of room for plot and sub-plot and many ways to go with it, so I refuse to write the show off just yet.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it wasn't badly acted and did overcome the huge problem of telling everyone the back story without either confusing us by introducing too many characters or story lines. It offered us something for the future of the series without being over complex.<br/><br/>Jason O'Mara is a decent lead and by now, quite a recognizable face. His wife is played by Shelley Conn, who is well known to British TV audiences but making her debut in a US series. Stephen Lang first appeared to be playing a similar character to his role in 'Avatar' but later softened and we saw a sympathetic side not seen in his work in that blockbuster movie. <br/><br/>The lead characters were watchable but we didn't see much of Christine Adams who is the leader of the 'sixers,' and who we must assume will figure more prominently as the series goes on.<br/><br/>All in all, although this was in part clichéd and somewhat derivative, it has the potential to be more than that, and probably deserves a few weeks of viewing before we decide whether the show has a future.",53 out of 103 found this helpful.,,26 September 2011
748,Terra Nova, Earth2/Outcasts meets Primevel with dull characters,"A combination of 'Earth 2/Outcasts' meets 'Primevel' is the best way to describe the double opening of Terra Nova. The difference with Terra Nova is that it isn't another planet they go to but another version of a prehistoric Earth existing in another time slip stream but that explanation is thrown in so blaze you might miss it but it does account for not caring if they change the past and affect their own future cause it won't be theirs. What bugged me about Terra Nova is its focus on one particular family. Remember the awful '2012' disaster film with despite the fact the world is blowing up around them this one American family stay together to survive all odds, apply it to this on a slightly less cataclysmic scale. If the series continues to focus on this family it will quickly loose its appeal, we are talking about a colony, lets start meeting new more interesting characters rather then the white picket fence dream one of the writers is obviously aspiring to. Throw in Dinosaurs and its reminiscent of 'Primevel'. There is conflict amongst some of the colonists who have broken away like in 'Outcasts' but as yet the mystery behind it with such blah characters doesn't make you care. I like the premise but like Earth2 it could fall easily into the cutesy category rather than good science fiction. It does hold your attention and the possibilities are great but as with so many new series the writing and characterization just isn't great and unless it improves even with Star Treks Brannon Braga and Steven Spielberg attached it won't make a second series.",40 out of 76 found this helpful.,,27 September 2011

Where is the rhetoric or the implication or the humor? A computer could have written this show with more humanity, art, and soul.<br/><br/>The dialogue is a symptom of the same disease that pervades the whole show. Faithlessness.

750,Terra Nova, Joined Just To Register My Utter Disgust,"As a qualifier to what I'm about to say, I really wanted to like this show. Honestly, the science fiction genre always commands a great deal of latitude with me. Normally I will overlook the occasional bout of predictability, even certain production fails or FX faux-pas, remaining ever optimistic that things will all pan out in the end. Add the names and backing behind Terra Nova and I truly assumed great things would be forthcoming. So I've forced myself to watch every episode.<br/><br/>Having said that...<br/><br/>This show insults the intelligence of any sci fi fan. Actually, it insults the intelligence of my 7 year old boy. It is easily the largest bag full of character/story arc clichés I've seen since I forced myself through a few 'Leave It To Beaver' episodes when I was 12 and sent home from school sick with the flu. The show is crap, 100%. And sorry folks, but the FX are also just... completely... awful. Barney the Dinosaur looks more realistic than some of that CG work. Just awful. Of course I can easily expect a network to be found guilty of such ineptitude in creative decision making, but I just can't believe that Steven Spielberg would lend his name or studio to this brand of nonsense.<br/><br/>I really would like to go mental here, explaining in many paragraphs, the many levels of FAIL this show is responsible for, but now that I think about it - what's the point? Anyone with a palette for good TV, sci fi or not - will watch 5 minutes of 1 episode of this sugary sap and instantly know what kind of horse manure it is. Hell, I can't even describe the show as predictable or mundane - even though it certainly is all of that and more. The show can only be properly described in one word... HORRIBLE.<br/><br/>If my IQ were under 60, or perhaps if I was 6 years old, this might be slightly entertaining, maybe. On second thought, nope, it would still suck.<br/><br/>I can only feel sorry for the actors, in that I felt Jason O'Mara had some acting chops (Life On Mars US), and Steven Lang ... well... Steven Lang has tenure and street cred IMO. But having said that, the acting, even from the stars, it is SO terribly over the top and just ...well... cheapish. I mean, really, really, cheapish, in a 70's Charlie's Angels/original Star Trek pilot episode kinda way. Speaking of the original Star Trek, all of the fight scenes I've had the displeasure of watching in Terra Nova are eerily reminiscent of the cheesy, over-the-top Captain Kirk vs. *insert Alien here* fights everyone on planet Earth has had enough of. I can only assume that the actors looked at these horrid scripts and decided to save their skills for REAL writing.<br/><br/>I honestly wonder why a studio/network would waste so much time, effort, and money on what amounts to a poor and seemingly hurried mash up of Swiss Family Robinson + Dinotopia. There are so many original story ideas floating around these days, SO many talented young writers and producers who would much better serve the attention of Steven Spielberg and Amblin Entertainment. Those up-and-comers deserve a platform like network TV to showcase quality material and serve the future of their creative talents. The folks writing and producing Terra Nova? These folks aren't investing 1% of talent to the show. Sorry but this show deserves nothing but to be canceled, as quickly as possible, in the hopes that someone at Fox will grow a clue and seek out proper writers and producers the next time around. It's just a big colossal waste of time for everyone, from the producers and actors right down the line to the viewers - such as myself - who gave it every chance to succeed.<br/><br/>One question though, how does this creative drivel garner a 7 out of 10 rating here at IMDb? Has the viewing public been that dumbed down? I haven't checked other reviews r.e. Terra Nova yet, but I truly hope that I don't see too many ""it's a good show"" comments or I swear I will lose all hope in humanity.<br/><br/>Shame on whatever genius it was who made the final decision to let schlock writing like this get picked from the trash bin and produced.

I quickly decided that the producers should have stayed in the 19th - early 20th centuries, and across the pond. There's only so much suspension of disbelief one can expect from a viewer, and this is Historical Fiction not SciFi/Fantasy.<br/><br/>Examples: There was no gold in or anywhere near colonial Jamestown. Wolves do not spontaneously attack humans. Clothes do not walk themselves magically clean after a struggle in a swamp. In a society where men are so terribly starved for women, how is it there's a handy ladies' maid waiting patiently for an imported mistress to serve? No idiot would publicly admit that he cheats at dice in a culture that hangs thieves. And another reviewer mentioned the nagging detail about an ocean-going vessel docking in obviously shallow water at a small upriver pier. Even the music sounds unoriginal--I swear it's recycled from the show, Hell on Wheels.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope they get a script writer who has read some history. The cast deserves it.

They made some compromises for convenience, some to spice things up, and some probably out of ignorance but if it's spoiling someone's enjoyment of the story then that's on them because there's nothing ridiculous. <br/><br/>Overall I think it's a finely polished show, focused mainly on the relationships between the characters, and particularly the struggles of the new female arrivals to find their place in the settlement and carve out some agency for themselves. I like all of the main characters a lot, and I don't get to say that very often. Verity and Jocelyn in particular are delightful.

757,Jamestown, Great cast &amp; premise wasted on a poorly written script,"It looked really promising - heavily touted as a period drama about the arrival of women in the new world colony that has been solely inhabited by men for 16 years. What a great concept! Plenty of tension and conflict in that! But there just isn't. Tension between the sexes seems to fizzle almost immediately as all the women settle into their relationships with barely a murmur - Verity complains more than most, but even she doesn't seem overly bothered about being sold in marriage to the local drunk. And the early thwarted romance, which might have provided romantic tension and some much needed 'will they/won't they?' drama, is unthwarted by episode two. <br/><br/>The 'political' plot involving the authority figures of the colony never gets going, and the baddies are just a little bit too stupid and pathetic to provide any proper villainy. Whatever conflict briefly raises its head in the form of a love triangle with the blacksmith is quickly resolved when he turns out to be a nice guy and politely steps aside, and the fact that the secretary's wife actually ADMITS TO HAVING MURDERED A MAN is just quietly brushed under the carpet when the governor's devoutly Christian wife decides she's been through enough already, poor wee lamb. <br/><br/>I was shocked when the series had ended, because there was no sense of it either building to anything, or completing a story arc. In fact, there's no clear series storyline at all - events just seem to happen one after the other in a seemingly unconnected succession without ever amounting to anything. With the exception of Verity and Meredith, who provide some mild comic relief as the most unlikely couple ever, there's really not a single character I care two hoots to know what happens to. I can't believe that forgettable, lacklustre fair like this gets a second season, when the hugely enjoyable (if equally silly) Halcyon gets canned.

765,Jamestown, What a waste of good actors and what a poor production.,"What a waste of good actors and what a poor production. This is more a Harlequin novel adaptation than a serious attempt to provide an informative yet entertaining series. Within a minute of the beginning a clumsy cog about 100 years out of fashion survives a nasty Atlantic storm. The weather clears and a Caribbean blue sky dominates. One of the imported brides has died and her corpse consigned to the sea. All of the young women have had time and space to clean themselves up (How did the Avon lady get aboard?). In my life time I have crossed the Atlantic many times but by the time one reaches the Americas in five hours one is totally wasted; turbulence or not, regardless of a first class or economy class passage. Here we see the lovely freshly made up young girls emerging from confined smelly cabin spaces to land and proceed to their allotted stranger husbands (no preview videos available). Reminds me of the modern Greek movie 'Brides' or the reality of Les Files Du Roi, young would be French brides given each a small hand box of low value jewels as a dowry by the French king to help populate New France. That at least is real history. Back to the beginning; the first shot of the ship's ensign is the Union Jack, 100 years too early it was adopted only as a result of the Act of Union between Scotland and England in 1707.",26 out of 44 found this helpful.,3.0,11 June 2017

An older drunk man, who drinks all of the time...(not sure how he was able to purchase a wife)...and a man of high statue (this one makes the most sense). The women arrive and they begin to figure out misfortunes in the town. I thought this would be a ""we women should stick together"" type of story but no. They barely talk to each other. Silus and Alice hold each other all the time. Too many times. There's a lot of kissing but no sex. Not that it matters but it will play up the point of purchasing a wife for that time period. I'm sure the men didn't buy wives for a working partner. The women are, for the most part, clean yet the men are always filthy. How are the women bathing but the men aren't?

778,October Faction, Disappointing,"I rarely write reviews but felt compelled for a variety of reasons. First, the premise is excellent but so much potential was wasted. This show could have offered the viewer a semi-original experience but instead chose to roll stereotypical and predictable into a boring agony. Casting was the first mistake. Fred Allen and Viv Allen were played by actors too unbelievable for their roles. The actor portraying Fred Allen presented as weak and goofy with zero identifiable characteristics of a ""monster hunter"", while the actress playing Viv Allen so overplayed an unhappy teenager, you want her whiny, ridiculous self to be taken out by the nearest Presidio team. Second, for two teenagers who discover the secrets that they do, both Viv and Geoff's reactions are utterly difficult to stomach. As a frequent and dedicated follower of many fantastical shows, suspension of reality is expected and often desired, however these two teenagers react to all of the going-ons as if they were watching paint dry. They portray teenagers as selfish, whiny, foolish, ungrateful, and in general incredibly stupid. By the fifth episode, it was near impossible to find anything likable about either of them. Lastly, the writing. Occasionally, there was some humorous banter, but the overwhelming majority of the dialogue was contrived and lacked the ability to further the story or character development. Tedious. Disappointing.

Seeing the trailer of the show and the idea I was so excited to watch this show but after episode 3 I found my excitement diving off a cliff and smashing into the sharp and jagged rocks that are typical tropes and familiar formulas that are found in edgy teenage drama shows.<br/><br/>Firstly, dialogue is horrible. You've got two twin teenagers who are smart enough to learn Japanese from 80s sitcoms but stupid enough to completely leave their parents who are monster killing superheroes and super intelligent individuals to walk right into the arms of some Frankenstein monster mute and a warlock woman who has LITERALLY KILLED SO MANY PEOPLE AND INSANE BUT HEY SHE'S COOL AND HER EYES GLOW RED SO WHY NOT?!?!?

Listening to the conversations isn't just cringe worthy in instances, it's down right painful.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk acting. Perhaps with better writing the acting would improve. However, much like what so many others are complaining about, it falls flat. The actors aren't connected in any way to the characters they play. At least not in any way that comes across, be it positively or negatively. So far I feel with the exception of one or two actors, I've seen better in my local community theater. Find a way to connect folks.<br/><br/>Finally the characters themselves. I didn't read the graphic novel. However, coming off a reboot of Charmed, reboot of Roswell, basically just about every CW show, and all the other YA melodramas, even some that are multiple seasons in I'm getting very tired of respinng characters to fit modern PC culture. Once more same complaint. To all producers, executives, directors and the like. Your products are just like everyone else's.

790,October Faction," The time, the potential, the money... all wasted.","I actually came online to write a review about October Faction, its that bad.<br/><br/>I've written few online reviews over the years. Few on Yelp! perhaps, but rarely for media. Most of what little I watch these days is with my son. To have a part of the time spent with him wasted on this show demonstrates why I'm not a big fan of most media in the first place.<br/><br/>The concept, while not particularly original, had potential. The writing, is two dimensional, at best, and comes off as trite and cliche. Pacing is all over the map.<br/><br/>The acting... I do not feel the actors had much freedom to personalize/explore their characters, as the vast majority, if not all, of the characters are held to a level of trite, shallow conformity that permeates the series, a consistency which makes me wonder if such was decided higher up the chain of command, say with the producers. My point is that it's rare for an entire cast to be so disconnected/weak by chance, and in such a similar fashion.<br/><br/>One of the most significant and frequently recurring issues to me is the lack of continuity- the world building is careless, again at best. Well funded international monster hunter organization who's members don't' appear to have even a hint of combat training/aptitude/skill, or even basic sense, much less sense of survival. High-tech ""toys"" that glaringly stand out with a 1990's level of quality/subtlety. Being constantly reminded/bludgeoned that the vast majority of the world doesn't know that ""monsters"" exist, but there seemingly nothing provided/done to preserve this illusion. Needlessly over the top family angst, shoehorned in with the idea of family love, that contributes nothing. There are many more examples, throughout. One can only stretch suspended disbelief so far, even when one is hoping not to have wasted their time.<br/><br/>Am not familiar with the graphic novel it is based on, but the series certainly did not make me want to seek it out.

Sometimes it works out well for her, and other times it just makes things worse-which only intensifies as she tries to dig herself out of awkward situations that she creates for herself because she keeps talking. Her husband, Mike (Tom Everett Scott), is brilliant with his side glances and witty remarks as they banter back and forth. Their chemistry is on point. In fact, the whole cast fits rather seemlessly into the constant ribbing and shenanigans, especially her best friend and co-writer, Kyle (Jason Mantzoukas).<br/><br/>The only reason this is a 9 is because some of their 5 year old daughter's lines feel forced.

One character pretends to be or do something and the other one plays along for laughs. For example, Andrea will pretend to be a prostitute and her husband will remark like he is a pimp.

819,I'm Sorry, forced comedy,"I don't have any big objections to this show, based on the one episode I saw (the first one). I like the lead pretty well - I've seen her in a bunch of things over the years and she's always good. <br/><br/>And yet, a lot annoyed me just a little, even though it has annoyed me in other series less. A comedian starring in a series about a comedian isn't a terrible thing, yet somehow the series hits it too hard. It's not just that she's a comedian, but that she's viewing everything through that lens, instead of, you know, the lens of being a funny human being. <br/><br/>The premise of the first episode - the discovery that a neighbor is an ex-porn star - seemed a bit much for the pseudo-realistic sort of show it seems to be going for; it would make far more sense on something whackier like The League.<br/><br/>The lead's reaction to all this, being overly fascinated and then getting weirdly too involved in a really dumb way, seemed forced.<br/><br/>In fact, after writing that paragraph I rewrote the title of this review to say ""forced"" because really, I think that sums up all the issues I just mentioned.

Andrea: I don't enjoy you as a friend
Brian: I love you as a friend
Andrea: I don't enjoy you loving me as a friend
Brian: Enjoy your convo!
Andrea: ""Convo""?
Brian: Conversation<br/><br/>If that is improv, this show needs writers. If that's written script? That writer needs to slap themselves in the face. Hard.<br/><br/>Andrea Savage is very talented. This show isn't letting her display that. The first two episodes are what the show could have been - instead it kept getting worse. I don't understand what happened here. Shows are supposed to get better as they move along, this one went from episodes with great comic actors playing off each other with Savage - Jason Mantsoukas, Judy Greer, Brian Anthony Williams - and became the One Whacky Woman show starring Savage.<br/><br/>It's all become mindless ""banter"", glib responses, overreaction to a predictable exchange, and/or grinning at each other as if to say ""You're such a hoot, you.""
I put the word banter in quotes because it just seems like the writers are filling pages with glib words to get to the next episode. Nothing has weight, nothing is constructed, nothing is surprising.<br/><br/>As for the exchange between Andrea and Brian above, it makes it all the worse because how does a woman who speaks in her own made up slang, says the word ""totes"" instead of totally (just like the kids do - wink), lives in L.A., is a comedy writer - how does that woman get confounded by ""convo"" in 2018.<br/><br/>Question, reaction, banter, glib response, whacky response, extreme overreaction to all this - repeat this cycle for 24 minutes.<br/><br/>Savage is very talented, but this is a waste of it. By the middle of Season One it feels like there is no reaction by a character that is at risk of being genuine or relatable, nor does any interaction. Everything with her father is forced, dull, barely interesting - and the real crime is she has the perfect straight man being wasted here: Martin Fng Mull.<br/><br/>I stuck with this hoping it would get better, I stuck with it until Season 2 because of all the other comics on episodes I was hoping would take up more space in the show. The show went the other direction. It became all about Andrea, and everyone else is just window dressing waiting for her to say something whacky and outlandish - yet it's never really all that interesting what is actually said. Or, they are blandly speaking to tee up an obvious joke for her to swing with.<br/><br/>I keep thinking that someone at the network, around episode four or so, said to Savage that she needs to go do a completely hysterical version of Elaine from Seinfeld, but we are not hiring any of the writers:
""You can hire some millennials on the cheap that write safe stuff (edgy is a kid talking about a vagina!) that never goes somewhere interesting. As for the acting? Ramp it up. Make funny voices. Do sing-songy voices as you say words and that will make the words ""funnier"" (three times in three minutes in one episode) Also, go full manic, dance with your shoulders a lot, react even more, stammer ALOT, keep that confused stammer going for a full ten seconds, really turn it up to 11 because we have 22 more minutes to try and fill here!""<br/><br/>Andrea is half-yelling throughout the show while at the same time also exaggerating her reactions like it's a silent film. Doing both of these at the same time is like an assault.<br/><br/>I am at episode one of season two and I am really hoping Savage turns this whole thing around and poaches some funny people to write for her that aren't writing everything so safe and obvious. Please get back to some of the other funny characters.<br/><br/>Get outside, watch some real comedy, welcome to the twenty first century, you have a lot of catching up to do. It's the definition of safe, and also lazy. I am not saying those jokes can't be funny (they always can be) - but, it's like cursing, it become a crutch: Just because you get a reaction doesn't make it funny.",8 out of 15 found this helpful.,5.0,7 June 2019

827,Freud, People should study Freud before rating this series,"Honestly, I am appaled at the level of ignorance from both critics and simple viewers that write reviews here! If you just bothered to read thoroughly Freud's masterpiece ""Introduction to Psychoanalysis"", you would have figured out before the end of the first episode that this series is NOT about the real historical person, but a wonderful and daring series about his magnificent writings and yes, also a fantasy combined with thriller, horror, historical fact bites and a real bold vision to put this together. For ignorants, the title of each episode covers a name of chapter in Freud's book mentioned above and dwelves in the depiction of the mental process in the book by the details of the case. Yes, it is Sherlock Holmes plus supernatural, but the movie explains a lot of its hidden meanings, you just have to pay more attention to the dialogue. The actors are perfectly chosen, and each actor plays the role 10 out of 10 according to the weight of role they were casted in for. Freud is appropriately played by Robert Finster who had to portray a young psychiatrist that would display both stiff and tormented attitudes, which is quite a difficult partiture. Ella Rumpf has a challenging role in portraying a delicate and sensitive young woman and a powerful demon. The inspector and the others play their part admirably and their stories or subplots are adding to and enhancing the substance of the main story. The decor, setting, light, cinematography are excellent. Nothing is ridiculous, despite all negative reviews posted here. If you can get past the title and open your mind to a new experiment and vision, then you might be able to see this series in a different perspective. Again, this series does NOT propose a biopic or documentary about Freud, but it is inspired by his writings having Freud as a hero in search of truth to validate his theories.

It often feels like a delirium and delivers raw and brutal scenes I did not really expect. However, the presentation is phenomenal and keeps you interested all the time, even though there are some flaws. The acting is really good throughout the show.
Fans of Freud could be disappointed because the historical accuracy is not given. I feel like the show really wanted to show Freud in a new light and therefore show something different. This new concept creates some of the best, but also some of the worst moments of the show. It really tries to be many different things and does not always know what it wants. Therefore this show is definitly not for everyone and you should have an open eye to some of Freuds theories, especially hypnosis.

The show had good ideas, that I haven't seen used in a fantasy show. There were scenes, that were well made. Still they could have explored them more.
The acting wasnt that great. The actor, who played Freud seemed quite unnatural. I somehow couldn't find myself caring for our protagonist. I found Alfred Kiss and his story much more engaging.

844,Freud, Started good... Then became absolutely ridiculous.,"First of all, it's such a waste of good acting; the actors really did a great job, especially the main actor for Freud, what a disappointment. At first I though it was really going to be more of a biography about Freud... I mean one that sees such a title would assume so, but it wasn't. In fact I thought they just tried to add some dramatic elements into it, just to make it a bit more enjoyable since it's not really a documentary, especially since there is the subject of psychoanalysis, hysteria and all the things that are linked to neurology: so I had thought all those dreams/visions were just for drama and a sort of personal interpretations of historical events related to Freud's writings/experiments or whatever... Until I started watching episode 5 and oh boy what a disaster it was, it became more of an occult, satanic, black magic fiction type of show and at that point I realized what I had been watching... There was no anticipation for anything, one could think Freud would actually prove his ""theory"" of hypnosis, ""theory"" of hysteria or whatever, but no. It was just an anticipation of an orgy, that is an orgy of people going completely ""insane"", occult, satanic, basically the show became even more occult, paranormal to an unrealistic extent; so at that point it became boring, super boring. And the worst part is that they didn't even do a good job even when the show made a big turn, it was literally trash. At episode 6 I gave up, I started skipping and just looking at some highlights... Nothing interesting. Last episode is stupid, occult guys die, prince is in a mental clinic, some weird ""deep desire quote"" from Freud and... it's just ridiculous.",34 out of 45 found this helpful.,3.0,6 April 2020

855,The Widow," well crafted, weaknesses at the end","So a few thoughts to this show:<br/><br/>camera and director do many many things very right here.
first of all: the show's pace. The tale follows a certain pace that you don't find often especially on TV. It's focus is more of a psychological one instead of hitting you in the face with action yet it always keeps a steady tension that drawns you to the story. It doesn't work with changes like shows that would build up a tension, release full blown action for the sake of it and then slows down to give you a contrast. This show keeps the pace for all but the last episode. Scenes that show a lot of action aren't hectic, scenes that show investigating, or characters thinking don't slow down boringly; yet the whole thing doesn't feel mushy - because of the way the story is told -<br/><br/>The story isn't told linear. You find multiple temporal levels. There's a now, there's a then and there's a before then. And even within the same time period the story doesn't always follow the course of time. Some people may find this annoying, I absolutely dig it. Of course it requires some attention and certainly isn't light fare. In addition, while the show hints you at details it doesn't explain those details right away. Sometimes you have to wait an episode or two to get shown the scene missing in the episode you're watching. Jumps to scenes from the past create a tessellation of the background information to understand what's really going on and why everything in the now is like it is. But it's only offered in pieces and creates an analogy to Beckinsale's character - as she collects bit per bit, so does the viewer.<br/><br/>Due to this style your perception of the characters change. People who seem like good people at the time may not seem as good while you suddenly feel a certain empathy with people that you deemed being bad after you're fed some background. These kind of twists are very well made. They don't try to sell you black for white by a completely unbelievable explanation, they just show that life is often not black nor white; we're all broken and in the end we all got our reasons. Of course this being a mini-series you can't expect a character development/assessment on the scope of The Sopranos or The Wire but with what little time they have they do an outstanding job. As for characters' actions it was good to see believable actions for a change. Everyone's acting within their logical and ethical limits and you don't have for example Kate Beckinsale running around like a madman with a shotgun to seek justice.<br/><br/>The camera work is in my opinion very good. The angles, the colours, the composition is just very harmonic and offers good immersion. The cut isn't too fast and doesn't distract from what's happening. This of course puts greater pressure on the actors and the script to transport the story to the viewer. Now Kate Beckinsale with utmost certainty isn't the greatest actress of the 21st century but must say, she did a really solid job and I was pleasantly surprised. The other actors also performed reasonably well. As I see reviews here criticizing the acting in this show I really wonder what they're used to because I generally have seen a lot worse performances.
As for the mediocre/bad: I really disliked the last episode. It breaks with everything I've so far liked. It suddenly changes the pace, it skips the details and backgrounds and presents you with what seems to be an ending to fit the research of the studio as to how to appeal to the biggest audience - unfortunately not necessarily the audience that will watch all other episodes before. They should have probably gone with a different ending, but even going with this one it should have been either turned it into a 12-episode piece giving the events time to unfold instead of rushing through it in the last episode or just turned it into a written epilogue telling you the keypoints of what's happening in 5 sentences to the sound of violins.<br/><br/>Also when you got the whole story in front of you in the end there's slight disappointment since it's rather simple really and there are a lot of potentials or rather would have been that unfortunately can't be tapped due to the ending. There would have been enough material for a second season or a decent spin-off but unfortunately this has been blown.<br/><br/>Overall I can only say, go and watch it. You might want to go through it fast as I think it's not really meant to watch with lengthy interruptions. When you're looking for some light-hearted entertainment to shut your mind off to, this is probably not the show for you. Otherwise you're in for a treat.",63 out of 86 found this helpful.,8.0,3 March 2019

858,The Widow," A Widow's Web Of Deceit, Corruption And Truth","Harry and Jack Williams have created a penetrating mystery drama. This series has formidable direction, writing, cinematography, settings, score and acting. The score adds to the intensity of certain scenes and the overall tone of the series. All of the actors involved deliver superlative performances. In particular Dance, Olusanmokun, Ido and Fouche stand out. Beckinsale commands the series with an emotive performance. The plot revolves around the disappearance of Georgia Wells' husband Will during a plane crash that occurs in the jungles of the Congo. There was only one reported survivor who was a nurse that died later on during recovery. Georgia has been living peacefully on a Welsh farm, but still suffers inside from Will's death, until one day she sees footage of rioting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the DRC. She sees a man being pulled through the fighting wearing an orange baseball cap that is identical to what Will was wearing when he embarked on the fatal flight. This ignites an investigation into the possibility that Will is still alive. She travels to Kinshasa to start to investigate and soon a web of storylines begins which, in this viewer's opinion, is symbolic of a widow's web. Georgia starts by hunting down Pieter Bello who was the last man seen with Will in the footage. She does this with the assistance of her friend Martin Benson. Throughout the series we learn there was more than one survivor and that the plane crash was no accident. We learn this through a man who is now blind, Ariel who witnessed events that occurred leading up to the plane crash. Ariel has been hiding out of fear for his life, but eventually decides to come forward which could cause serious problems for General Azikiwe of the DRC and Pieter. We learn that Azikiwe, Pieter and Judith Gray are involved in illegal mining of coltan which is an extremely valuable element used in the technology of computers and cell phones. During Georgia's investigation she rescues a young girl, Adidja who was stolen from her village to fight for a militant group in the DRC. As the series continues Georgia solves the mystery of Will, but more importantly, in this viewer's opinion, uncovers the reason for the plane crash and who was behind it. The series has sort of a, ""Babel"" feel to it as it takes place in a few different countries and there is a language barrier at times. It also has a sort of, ""Blood Diamond"" feel to it because of the mining of coltan. Throughout the series we learn of the backstories behind most of the main characters including the fact that Georgia has a military background. The series does a considerable job examining the politics and corruption in the DRC. It also touches slightly on the horrendous acts of forcing children to kill for the merciless militant groups. The same goes for the human rights violations and vile child labor when it comes to the mining. It is understandable that the series does not go in to extreme depth on certain themes as the series tries to scrutinize a lot of controversial subject matter in only eight episodes, but again we at least learn of such goings on. The mystery is captivating but for this viewer I was more mesmerized by the inner turmoil and slowly developing insanity of General Azikiwe. The plot is gritty, violent, insightful, duplicitous, thrilling, sterling, intelligent and has a cathartic ending. This is a well rounded and exceptional series in the mystery drama genre.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,20 May 2019

862,The Widow, Botoxed Beckinsale is SO distracting,"Honestly. I cannot understand the reviewers who are raving about Kate's ""stellar"" performance in The Widow. I binge-watched the entire series and all throughout I found myself cringing cringing cringing at Kate's 1/8"" thick foundation makeup and truly ghastly botox job.<br/><br/>At times, her forehead was freakishly squinched up------ but only at the far ends of her eyebrows. It made it impossible for me to follow the dialogue. All I could think was: ""Did she watch this and wonder what the bloody hell happened to her real face?""<br/><br/>Harsh? Yeah, I guess. But cringing at Kate wasn't the only critical response I had to some of the scenes.<br/><br/>Along with a previous reviewer, I found myself wondering how anyone could be in Africa and never ever see a single wild animal. Not even a duck or any other bird. I don't even remember seeing any stray dogs or cats. How does that happen? Did the militia kill off everything animal?<br/><br/>Then the back and forth ""Here we are now"" and next ""Oops. Hope you can keep up with these countless flashbacks"" zip-zap-zoiks had my head spinning. Towards the end of the series, Kate is in Kinshasa and then, whiplash!, she's all bundled up and prancing around the frosty wilds of Wales, in search of a ""Sheepdog."" Since when is a Border collie called a ""Sheepdog?"" Maybe that's a Welsh thing?<br/><br/>On a positive note: I loved the cast. I always love watching Charles Dance. And that big teddy bear of an Icelandic dude. He's awesome. The actors, apart from Kate (and sometimes even Alex Kingston was a bit too over-the-top in her scenes)--------were all fascinatingly wonderful to watch. (This really made Kate's scenes even more painful to watch. When all the rest of the cast is pulling their weight and their acting is spot-on . . . then you can't really blame an off-putting performance on bad directing, now can you?)<br/><br/>Some of the scenery was delightful. You get a real sense of what it's like in some parts of the DRC and even a bit of Wales. At other times, things seemed constrained when so many of the scenes were filmed in this house or that house or at the same locations over and over. It got so it was a relief to see people slushing around in the red mud of the mining operation.<br/><br/>My one big question is, and I guess it's my fault that I must have blinked during a flashback and missed the info on this one: Who the heck was the blonde housewife cleaning and cleaning in General Azikiwe's kitchen? Were we supposed to know that he killed some white lady to take possession over her palacial home? I didn't get the memo, it seems.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was fun to watch this series. It does have a few scary moments and several times you might even jump a bit, too. I liked that. Just be prepared to roll your eyes at some serious plot holes. And, if you're like me, be prepared to feel sorry for Kate that, thanks to her cosmetic surgery and/or super duper foolhardy mess of botox injections, she has almost completely lost the ability to change her facial expressions to any measureable extent.

864,The Widow," Predictable plot, subpar acting, pretty awful writing","I don't think the writers of this show have ever listened to human beings have a conversation. The dialogue is so stilted, so poorly written, littered with expletives to attempt to improve the realism but littered with the wrong ones. I don't think I've heard the word ""bastard"" as much in my life as I have in an episode of this show. It reads like robots attempting to imitate human banter. It's not natural.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale was likely cast in the lead role purely because of looks. Her performance is far from stellar. She delivers her poorly-written dialogue like she's reading it directly from a teleprompter, and she is either surprised or angry, nothing else. No emotional range at all.<br/><br/>The plot was predictable. (SPOILERS AHEAD) The baby having died was a cheap plot device to try to introduce some stakes into the relationship between the main character and her husband, even though it's fairly irrelevant to the main story. And of course, once Kate Beckinsale finds her husband, he turns out to be a bad guy. Shocking. And he explains everything to Beckinsale (and the audience) through torturously long flashback sequences. It's not particularly ambitious, it's not surprising, it's not creative.<br/><br/>At least it looks pretty. Beautiful picture, and the cinematography is solid, but not particularly creative.

872,The Widow, Should have been a 3-part mini-series,"'The Widow' deals with a very little known yet important topic - The profiteering business behind corrupt non-for-profit organizations entangled with natural resource mining in Africa. It is a very worthwhile important subject matter for a thriller and lends itself well to shine a light on the sad reality and cost of owning things we use everyday that come at a very detrimental cost to the countries and people who are exploited for it. In the case of 'The Widow', it has to do with a mineral that is used in everyday smartphones.
So with that in mind, it could have really been an enlightning series to the general population. Set in modern DRC congo and Rwanda, the premise lends itself very well with the tales of endless warrying tribes civil wars, and fight for control of these countries natural resources by the powers that be and those who benefit from it - militias, generals, politicians, non for profits disguised as aid agencies, gun merchants and corporations.
It is reminiscent of Netflix 'Beast of no nation' with an even better premise as laid out above.
However, the principal flaws of this mini-series are too manyfolds to bring it to a level of greatness and ultimately the whole thing falls flat and feels like it's dragging forever.
Here are the reasons why.
First, as many reviewers have said the casting of Kate Beckinsale is a very poor choice. Not that she can't be a good actress but whatever has been done to her face (plastic surgery, botox or just elaborate skin care) is simply too disburbing to overlook at every single frame shots with often big close ups of her face and in 4K! Her face looks so puffed up, with fake tan, she often can't really show the breadth of her emotions an actor should be able to convey. She looks like a meg ryan or nicole kidman post-plastic enhancements (surgery or not). So it's just simply highly distracting.
Secondly, there are simply too many flashbacks that are useless and poorly timed. It shows the plot's flaws and the fact that the writers used them so much just shows that they wanted to drag it into an 8-part 50-min long show. They should have made it as a 3-part mini-series and it would have felt a lot tighter, more suspensful and engaging. Too many side stories, too many unnecessary and inconsistent escape scenes, too many plot holes that are resolved with cheap tricks.
Which leads me to this last point, the way Kate always seem to escape some of the most dire situations are just totally implausible. I can't believe how many times she escapes death by just running from a scene when you feel like there was no way she could have done what she did. Most of the time, it's because the other side, the bad guy is just simply the slowest or clumsiest badass out there. When you show professional killers with a gun pointed at you shooting another guy next to you, you just don't let Kate run away in front of you as if it took you 1-min to figure it out...
Really a shame... there are some really good supporting cast members, the movie setting and the subject matter is really compelling, the cinematography is pretty good, and overall production feels polished. What a pity for such a deserving tale.",20 out of 32 found this helpful.,5.0,8 March 2019

In the end this is as interesting as waiting for the number 93 bus, worth missing as no doubt another one or two just like it will be along momentarily.",27 out of 46 found this helpful.,2.0,5 March 2019
876,Batman Beyond, refreshing twist on the bat mythos,"I know many a hard core fan that resent this series based simply on the fact that Bruce Wayne is not Batman. Get over it. I find this to be a very well written, interesting show. The show is great looking, improving upon the stlyized animation of its predecessor. The only real flaws are the lack of memorable villains and the silly looking new batsuit. The show is still young, though and if given the chance to blossom further this could be a fantastic series. There have been many ""what if"" stories regarding what happens to the mantle of the bat after Bruce Wayne is no longer able to carry on. I think Batman Beyond handles the concept better than any other attempts that have been made thus far. So to all you purists who NEED Bruce Wayne in the batsuit, try and look beyond that one dimensional thinking and take the show for what it is. There's plenty to be enjoyed here.",46 out of 50 found this helpful.,,28 April 2002

878,Batman Beyond, At first glance it seemed silly but now I think it's great.,"Picture the scene. Young teenager enters a video rental shop. Suddenly his eyes fall on the video ""Batman of the future (as it's called in the UK) Rebirth a batman movie. First thought: ""What the?"" I thought I might as well try it. Used to watch the old animated series. When I first watched it I just didn't know what to make of it. A strange futuristic world and stuff. And the title sequence seemed well odd.<br/><br/>I didn't really think much of it then.<br/><br/>It was when I found out that it was part of a TV series I have to say that my curiosity got the better of me. After seeing several episodes I began to understand it more. It was more of a teenagey show when compared to the original cartoons yet good.<br/><br/>I don't know why but the show just grew on me. Just something about it made me want to watch it. I also like the references to the past series and seeing the old characters no longer young and answering the question I'm sure many have been asking: he can't stay batman forever so how will it all end? Well if you're a fan of the older cartoon series or the comics (which I've never read) I think you may not enjoy this show.<br/><br/>To the people who hate this show I just say ""well I liked it, maybe you should give it a chance mainly because the different style takes a little getting used to.""",32 out of 36 found this helpful.,,20 January 2006
879,Batman Beyond, Brilliant.,"Cartoons have come a long a way since I was a kid. Back then Batman and Superman were always 2-dimensional cardboard cutouts with interchangeable personalities. Depsite some commercial success, horribly retrograde filth like Pokemon do nothing but propagate this lack of imagination on the part of animators.<br/><br/>Now we have Warner Bros., whose Batman and Superman animated revivals challenge the long-held belief that cartoons are plot-wise inferior to their big screen and big budget brethren. The Batman and Superman cartoons of the early 90s have shown us a deeper, more tortured and angst-ridden side to our comic book heros while at the same time remaining firm to their virtue and nobility. This is the stuff that real dreams are made of.<br/><br/>Batman Beyond is just as ambitious. In the new world of technological revolution there is still need for a protector of justice. Like the original Batman, this one was again forged out of the victimology of social corruption and decadence.<br/><br/>By combining complex plot, intelligent dialogue, great Japanimation, an incredible cast of voices that at times have included Stockard Channing, Paul Winfield, James Sikking, Michael Gross, and Kevin Conroy, Warner Bros. has recapitalized the Batman myth for yet another generation. This new series is so smart and so edgy that I am constantly amazed by the levels of irony and metaphor. This is definitely entertaining for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>But don't take my word for it, check it out for yourself.

It's a show that's good but aimed at kids who simply know the surface details about Batman. I have always found the most interesting thing about Batman is that the main character *is* Batman, whose alter ego is Bruce Wayne, not the other way around. I've been fascinated with the 'psychology' of Batman and all this show offers me are a few insights into Bruce Wayne's psyche. The best being in the first episode when we find out why he stopped being Batman. Go to the next paragraph if you don't want to know what it is. When rescuing a kidnapped girl he collapses because of his heart and in order to save his life from the crook he picks up a gun and threatens him with it. Brilliant. There are a few other good insights into Bruce Wayne but most of those are in the spin-off movie ""Return of the Joker"".<br/><br/>But you've got to love the bit in the first episode where a punk dressed up as a joker tries to scare Bruce Wayne.",8 out of 8 found this helpful.,,5 November 2002

But at the heart of the series is the relationship between Terry McGinnis and Bruce Wayne.  Will Friedle and Kevin Conroy are excellent in their respective roles.	<br/><br/>I said this in my review of ""SubZero,"" and I'll say it again here.

882,Batman Beyond, Very Interesting and Cool!,"I kind of liked Batman Beyond a little better than Batman: The Animated Series. I also liked the really cool new Batman costume! It was a shame that my favorite Batman villain, Poison Ivy wasn't in this cartoon. She was my favorite because I had this huge crush on her! This series starts off in the future days of Gotham City where Bruce Wayne was retired and created this high-tech batman suit which was the last superhero suit he ever used. Terry McGinnis, a teenager whose father was killed because he was going to expose criminal activities at the company that he works for which just happens to be Wayne Enterprises. So then when Terry and Bruce meet with each other, Bruce trains him to become the new Batman! This show was really cool and had a lot of episodes. I wish another show that was like this, Spider-Man: Unlimited had the same number of episodes as this show did. I remember when this show first aired on Kids WB in early 1999 and then after it was canceled off of Kids WB, then Cartoon Network picked it up after Kids WB canceled it and showed reruns for a while and then canceled it again. I thought it was really cool with the new Batman costume and having a teenaged Batman do all the crime fighting and we also get to see a returning Batman villain, The Joker. Another villain I liked who I had a crush on was Inque. The action in this show was pretty neat and same with the animation! Pretty cool overall.",28 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,13 April 2004

884,Batman Beyond, Really strong first season.,"The first season opened with with new-age jokers and a focus on our hero, Terry McGinnis, dismantling government corruption. The characters were engaging and interesting, and each episode is packed with fun action sequences. I couldn't get enough of this show after watching the first few episodes, I finished the entire series in a matter of 3 days.<br/><br/>That said, the following seasons, 2 and 3, did not live up to the events that were set up in the first season. The episodes focused more on Terry's life in high school, and the villains were also more teen based. That didn't make the series bad, but it did make way for some extremely terrible episodes and a side kick who was more grating than helpful.<br/><br/>I still wish the show hadn't ended so soon, there were a few villains who I don't feel got appropriate closure.

886,Batman Beyond, A Worthy Continuation to a Legendary Series,"While only running a short 52 episodes, Batman Beyond makes its mark in the DCAU time-line with memorable villains, chilling plot twists, and meaningful character development. It is set 20 years after TNBA series, and can be thought of as a direct sequel. While featuring the same animation style as the series before it, it adds a Gothic, gritty, and at the same time epic coat of paint to both Gotham and the environments Batman finds himself in. Batman Beyond also features a different musical theme than the previous series with powerful guitars, interspersed with pumping dance vibes, and even some fresh remixes of classic themes. Even though this show aired in 1999, some of the comedy is timeless, the jokes are laugh out loud funny and don't detract from the serious butt kicking that occurs when Batman has to deal with his rogue gallery. It's a shame that the series hasn't received a reboot or more than one feature length film, but DC Comics has breathed some life into it with a new comic series.<br/><br/>In summary, Batman Beyond is a definite must watch in my opinion; It makes no difference if you have been following the series from the start or if you are just getting into the universe of the Dark Knight, Batman Beyond is truly a worthy continuation to a legendary series.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,29 September 2013
887,Batman Beyond, A slick look for a futuristic Dark Knight,"For a cartoon set in the future, 'Batman Beyond' appears slick and glossy. It is fun to watch, and is well-made.  Considering his fine voice work as Batman/Bruce Wayne in 'Batman: The Animated Series,' Kevin Conroy was a perfect choice for the elderly version of our hero in 'Batman Beyond.'<br/><br/>Here he is about 40 years into the future.  He may walking with a cane now, and unable to continue being Batman, but he can still give someone a good slug or two.  <br/><br/>It's been 20 years since Bruce Wayne retired from his life as Batman (due to a mild heart attack). Because of this, Gotham City had spent these two long decades without the Dark Knight.  But that changes when a teenager named Terry McGinnis enters the picture and makes the connection that Batman was really Bruce Wayne.  McGinnis becomes the new Dark Knight to avenge the murder of his father.<br/><br/>Bruce Wayne may be too old to be Batman anymore, but it's good that the persona has been reborn in Terry McGinnis.  Besides, without Batman (any Batman), Gotham City would fall apart.",18 out of 27 found this helpful.,,14 February 2001
888,Batman Beyond, The best Batman since the 90s animated series,"As a fan of the 1990s Batman animated series and the one with Kevin Conroy as Batman/Bruce Wayne, this was the next best thing in the Batman TV show lineup. It's Batman, but with cyberpunk (one of my favorite kinds of science-fiction) and futuristic technology. Flying cars, biker gangs, sky-high buildings, and laser guns all make it a sci-fi Batman. This was the first sci-fi superhero series I actually enjoyed. And Boy Meets World's Will Friedle joins forces with Kevin Conroy to deliver the ultimate superhero duo since the original Batman and Robin (not the 1997 Joel Schumacher debacle). Plus a whole bunch of new supporting characters and new villains. There's plenty to like, but if you're not into science-fiction and only like superhero action, this may not be your thing. Still, it doesn't hurt to try it. Not only do we get Kevin Conroy again, we also get some cameos from old villains from the original Batman.

890,Batman Beyond, A missed opportunity,"Batman Beyond has many things to recommend it. The animation is generally superb, with highly imaginative sequences. Likewise the voice artists are excellent bringing an authenticity to each character. The writing is very good too, with fully rounded characters and (generally) well thought out situations.<br/><br/>However, after the excellent Batman series, this sequel does not live up to expectations<br/><br/>First, the setting. A futuristic Batman is a fantastic premise and, with a bit of imagination, we could have had a Batman operating in, say, a societal breakdown or an authoritarian government. The possibilities are endless. But here we have a future which is exactly the same as the present day only with a few more gadgets (but not many).<br/><br/>This leads me on to the second point, the lacklustre villains. This rather ordinary future is run by evil Capitalist Derek Powers, basically a Lex Luthor wannabe who soon becomes glow-in-the-dark man. Almost all villains in season 1 are in someway relatable to him, something which becomes incestuous after a while. <br/><br/>Of the villains, Inque, despite the dull name, is the best. Otherwise we have revivals of hardly stellar silver age villains (The Royal Flush Gang and Spellbinder), a sonically powered villain called Shriek, and a veiled middle Eastern woman with a scimitar oddly called Curare, a name that has nothing to do with her appearance or her powers.<br/><br/>So not much in the way of originality in the 1st season and it is fitting that the best episode is Heroes which affectionately pastiches the silver age (but strangely Marvel not DC's silver age) not merely for a parody of The Fantastic Four but also a nod to Spiderman issue 33.<br/><br/>However the makers seem to be aware of the failings and season 2 is an improvement. Derek Powers disappears and the series grows mightily because of it. Here the future trend predictions become interesting. A gang of anti-social Joker imitators called Jokerz who appeared in series 1 as minor vandals develop some real menace. The theme of gene splicing is explored. And Batman battles his own suit.<br/><br/>The villains however remain pretty ordinary and there seems to be some pandering. In mid season 2, Batman is saved 3 times in a row but females, one a child. This diminishes the character of Batman.<br/><br/>Verdict: great animation but very average scripts.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,6.0,2 August 2014

The storyline takes place in the same continuity by going to the past and future.

897,Batman Beyond," Not As Great As Batman: The Animated Series But A Great Improvement Over ""The Batman"" series","Being a purist fan of Batman: The Animated Series, I was not as much into Batman Beyond, but I did enjoy it. I have now obtained and viewed the first two seasons on DVD and I await the final season. <br/><br/>I remember watching the Rebirth episode on prime time when it was originally previewed. If there could be a Batman to succeed Bruce Wayne, they came up with a great character in the form of Terry McGinnis. I like how this teen came from a broken home (divorced parents) and was so bad at one point, he had to spend some time in juvenile hall. He is a youth with a chip on his shoulder and his chance meeting with Bruce Wayne, his accidental discovery of who Bruce once was, and Terry's ultimate destiny of suiting up and taking flight as the new Batman was priceless. <br/><br/>The only episodes of this series that I don't like are the ones without Bruce Wayne in it. Sorry, but without Bruce, it just doesn't seem like Batman at all. Bruce Wayne is the actual reason I watched this show. I liked the he has a dog named Ace since Batman had a BatHound named Ace in the comics at one time. <br/><br/>Other than Bruce, the only other original character is Commissioner Barbara Gordon, the former Batgirl, whose relationship with Bruce ended bitterly (as did Dick Grayson and Tim Drake's associations with him) and now she is against any costumed vigilantes in Gotham. <br/><br/>Other than Rebirth, my favorite episodes were the ones that had tie ins to the original series, like the ones that returned Mr. Freeze and Bane as well as Talia and Ras Al Ghul in Out of the Past and the two part episode, the Call, which returned a slightly older Superman and the introduction of the future Justice League. I am thankful for that episode for paving the way to animating the Justice League.<br/><br/>I haven't seen all the third season yet, but I await its DVD release, so I can see the final episode, Unmasked.<br/><br/>As for villains, give me the Joker, Penguin, Two Face, the Riddler, and Catwoman any day over the likes of Spellbinder, Shriek, Stalker,Curare, and Inque. I also hated that Derek Powers/Blight did not return beyond season one. I do get a kick out of the Jokerz street gang trying to keep the Joker's legacy alive. <br/><br/>All in all, this was a fun show, but I prefer the original Batman: The Animated Series any day. But I will say that I consider Batman Beyond far more superior to the new cartoon ""The Batman"" any day.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,21 November 2006

The cool thing about batman beyond is he's a young cooler batman that goes to clubs and is in high school. If they make a movie I think they should make him in college though because he seems older then they make him out to be on the show. One more thing I think would be cool is if they got Val Kilmer to play Bruce Wayne because he was the best batman in my opinion and he's older now and they could age him a little more to make him look really old.

In my personal opinion my favorite batman series and one of my favorite TV series of all time.

It's starts with Bruce Wayne a few years after the new batman adventures, he retires and ends his role as batman once and for all and then get a new character named Terry Mcginnis who saves Bruce life from a gang called the Jokers (obviously a tribute to the Joker, accept no where near as good). Terry gets a job from Bruce Wayne however he discovers the batcave as well as the bat-suit and from then on he becomes the new batman. What I like about this series is the art design, the great voice acting, the music, as well as the new villains. Most of the villains are like the modern equivalent of the original villains but aren't tribute's to the original villains accept for the Jokers and the original Mr. Freeze makes an appearance in 1 episode.

Quite simply outstanding...the best animated/cartoon show to date followed by Justice League and Justice League Unlimited! People appreciated ""BATMAN:TAS"" for being a show for grown-ups...but that show was still a little over-the-top and careful to try to include something for children. This one, a follow up, into the future of BATMAN, doesn't feel bounded. It flows just so naturally... too bad the 9/11 tragedy didn't allow for a rousing finale for this show!

901,The Drew Carey Show, A once classic sitcom that became it's own worst enemy,"Network: ABC; Genre: Sitcom; Average Content Rating: TV-14 (language and strong scatological humor); Classification: Contemporary (Star Range: 1 - 4); <br/><br/>Season Reviewed: Seasons 6 - 9<br/><br/>To keep myself from stretching back into the halls of TV history I've roped off the turn of the century/millennium as a benchmark forward to look at a particular show's season. In the 9 years that 'The Drew Carey Show' was on the air it went through 3 big phases. The first was of a standard comedian-vehicle sitcom originating back in the days when every 2-bit comedian was getting their own self titled sitcom (signified by the 'Moon over Parma' intro). However, Drew Carey was better than the rest. The 2nd phase was the show hitting its prime- in that, its longest phase, it was a free-for-all comedy barn-burner. Like a little weekly Farrelly brother movie, 'Drew Carey' was crude, bawdy humor at its finest.<br/><br/>The show had the guts to center around a group of characters that where, without question, losers and made no attempt to glamorize them in the usual sitcom way. Drew was the ultimate, put-upon everyman and this show epitomized the workaday world of office life better than any other on TV. The cast was exceptional - with breakout performances from Ryan Styles and Diedrich Bader, who make their Louis and Oswald the classic drunken, aimless stooges. The writing was sharp, bawdy, crude and was often bust-a-gut hysterically so. Stick with the '5 o'clock World' or original 'Cleveland Rocks' intro that accompanies these seasons and you'll see a show that was heading for 'classic' status.<br/><br/>However, as we pick up with season 6 and forward the show is in its 3rd phase - a flaming, chaotic tailspin that strips away everything that made it great and innovative in the first place and ultimately sending it sinking into the abyss with barely a whisper. How did this happen? I can say the turning point where I lost interest came when Drew's transvestite brother Steve married and brought into the family Drew's long-time rival Mimi. But that was nothing compared to all the insane turns the show would take for the next 3 years. Drew nearly dies and sits in a coma for several episodes? Drew accidentally gets married to two women? To his long time loves and his boss Mr. Wick (a terrific Craig Ferguson by the way) no less? Drew looses his job at Winford Lauder and gets one at an internet company. The show was always absurd, but it used to have a solid foundation that it honored.<br/><br/>Worst of all Drew ditches his old persona - growing his hair out, losing weight and tossing his trademark glasses. In it's final years the show doesn't seem tired as much as it does a complete about-face, doubling-back to undo everything that it has set up and spitting in the face of the fans. It's unclear if Carey is mellowing with age, trying to conform more with the acceptance of the Hollywood establishment or has simply become arrogant. Arrogant in dragging this show out past it's prime and into territory it should know would disenfranchise it's audience. And arrogant into thinking that he can sing and is a great comic improve and so revamping special shows of nothing but musical numbers and live improve. What was once the voice of the working stiffs is now just a mouthpiece to nourish Drew's ego with a talented cast going to waste in the process. What was once the anti-sitcom has now taken turns fitting of an NBC tent-post series.<br/><br/>It's a sad state of affairs. The only one quick enough to jump from this sinking ship was Christa Miller. Caught in the thankless role of the straight-women in the locker room atmosphere of the show, she left for NBCs 'Scrubs' leaving 'Titus' alumni Cynthia Watros to fill the void. Anybody that thought the richly developed and sophisticated 'Titus' was just a standard dumb sitcom should have a look at the talented Watros now going to waste in this plane crash.<br/><br/>Jerry Seinfeld taught us all that the sign of a great comedian was one who knows when it is time to pull out and leave the audience wanting more. Drew should have been taking notes.<br/><br/>*<br/><br/>Series: * * ½ / 4",74 out of 91 found this helpful.,,25 March 2004
902,The Drew Carey Show, Gotta love the Drew,"Ever since I first discovered the Drew carey Show, it's hard not to get addicted. The chemistry of all the castmembers is awesome, and every one of them is so lovable. Drew's brand of humor has carried the show for seven years, along with the talent of his costars. However, you can't just watch this amazing show because of the jokes. Make sure you catch the dance numbers that made the show revolutionary, like the incredible routine for Five O Clock World and Drew and Mimi's real voices in The Brotherhood of Man. This show was the first to do live episodes the way they should be (go Ryan Stiles!). The Drew Carey Show is one of the most wonderful entertaining shows on TV! DON'T MISS IT!

Carey and his cast have done things never seen before and have pushed the envelope of mundane sitcoms. We should all be thanking the creators &amp; producers of this show for giving us an alternative to the run-of-the-mill sitcom bilge that has been pumped out over the past few years. One day, this program will be regarded as one of the most influential television program of our time.

904,The Drew Carey Show, A Cut Above,"I don't usually like shows starring stand-up comics. They end a great comics career and usually aren't acted that well. Drew Carey is different. Every part is played pitch perfect and it has good, plausible storylines.<br/><br/>
The show went downhill after Kate and Oswald broke up, but that happens with all shows. The Mimi/Steve pairing was well-played and emotionally fulfilling. I'm not much of a fan of Drew/Kate and the show would have been better without it. Wick is the strongest character, albeit cartoonish. But the whole show is.<br/><br/>My favorite episode would be when they attempted to win an Emmy. It was the epitome of the show-goofy.",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,,31 July 2004
905,The Drew Carey Show, The working class sitcom for working class people...,"U know, before Drew Carey got his own show, I didn't even know who he was. This show truly captializes his talents as a comedian and actor.<br/><br/>""The Drew Carey Show"" is by far one of the funniest sitcoms on television in recent years.  It also happens to be my third favorite show.  Our bespectacled hero, Drew, works in a Winfried-Louder Depaertment Store's offices, run by a dorky Scot, Nigel Wick (Criag Ferguson).  His archnemisis, Mimi Bobeck-Carey (Kathy Kinney) wears tons of make-up and tacky clothes, much in the same sense that Peggy Bundy on ""Married with Children"" was the queen of tacky.  Of course, Drew has his girlfriend, Kate (Christa Miller) and his dopey buddies, Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles, who upstages Carey) and Oswald Lee Harvey (Deidrich Bader).<br/><br/>This show is very funny.  The plotlines are always interesting, and of course, Lewis and Oswald have to accomplish some stupid feat in the 1/2 hour (ie: they used $8000 to record an album using classic songs, with them--""Tequilla"" or Lewis saying ""Wipeout!"")  Of course, everyone gets into a big mess, Mimi insults Drew, Drew plots revenge, and everything is said and done in the half hour.<br/><br/>I love this show, and highly recommend it to everyone who has a good sense of humor.  Drew Carey's standup is excellent, and this show just adds another good credit to a very talented man!<br/><br/>Cleveland truly does rock!

908,The Drew Carey Show, ABC killed this show,"I was a big fan of the show when it was on, and I've been watching a lot of the episodes again in syndication. Drew Carey was always a funny stand up. The cast was great...Ryan Stiles and Diedrich Baker are two very underrated guys in playing comedy, and Craig Ferguson was always fun to watch.<br/><br/>Maybe the show ran its course and it was smart for Drew to close it out on a high note, and wrap the series up nicely with a final episode, but I can't help but think that ABC killed this show.<br/><br/>The show was a staple of the network for so many years, and it finally began to slip in the ratings a little and ABC got worried to quickly and juggled it around to a bunch of different time slots. Add that with the reality TV craze, and a show like the Drew Carey Show which I think cost quite a bit to produce became obsolete very quickly.<br/><br/>That's a nice thank you after the show and the show's main actor did a lot to help the network.<br/><br/>A lot of people peg Christa Miller leaving the show as the down turn. I don't think so. Cynthia Watros was did a decent job for having to come in 7 years into a series and take over the lead actress role. The series was still funny and could have been had ABC left it alone.<br/><br/>Sadly, the final season was run completely out of order with large gaps in between air time which made it nearly impossible to keep track of.<br/><br/>Hopefully, they'll release it on DVD to give this very underrated and funny show a proper sendoff.",20 out of 31 found this helpful.,5.0,3 February 2005

910,The Drew Carey Show," In its heyday, much funnier than Seinfeld","The Drew Carey Show went off to a strong start in 1995 and kept getting funnier and funnier until it started to run dry right around 2000. Up until 1999, there was no funnier show on TV. PERIOD. The brilliance and wit of this show were criminally underrated. Yes, it was popular from the beginning but its popularity waned down until the show was forced to cancellation.<br/><br/>Very few shows were able to compete with the genius of this show. I'd say Frasier was the most powerful competitor (along with 3rd Rock from the Sun in its first two years), but at the end of the day, the Drew Carey Show came ahead. Friends was funny and consistently well-written. Seinfeld had quite a few brilliant Larry David moments (and Jerry's usual hilarious comedic banter). But not one show in my opinion ever came close to the Drew Carey Show's constant rapid-fire succession of killer lines and situations. Line after line after line, this show had some of the wittiest, funniest, cleverest, most brilliant content EVER. The show was just way ahead of its time. <br/><br/>Where does one start with this show? I'd say with the characters. This is a heavily character-driven show. Let's see:<br/><br/>Drew Carey (played by Drew Carey): lovable, overweight and in a rut. Those sum the poor man's life. He's been in the same stinkin' job for over a decade. To give you an idea how bad it is for him, his position is ""assistant director of personnel"", but there *is* no director of personnel, so had the job of both but without the perks or paycheck of the director. He has a hellish co-worker (Mimi) whose non-stop pranks, schemes and put-downs never seem to take a break, not even when she's pregnant or nursing her child. Drew deals with his life with laughing and making jokes, sometimes at his own expense. It's what gets him through life (oh yeah, and beer - lots and lots of beer). That and his friends. He does badly on relationships, but he doesn't quit, giving us endless joy and laughter in one trainwreck of a relationship after another. You can't help but love Drew. Something feels so homey and close about him.<br/><br/>Lewis Kinisky (played by Ryan Stiles): tall, thin and creepy. Lewis works in a shady drug company with a history of questionable practices and suspicious experiments. But, he doesn't care one bit. Why should he? He's 40, still single and still a janitor. He's got nothing to lose. So he's pretty trusted there, shifting up from his janitorial position at times and then demoted back because he screws it up somehow (he's not the smartest janitor out there). Ryan Stiles is absolutely hilarious in this part. An improvisation master, he had a cult following among the fans especially because of his improvisational comedy abilities on the British ""Who's Line Is it Anyway?"". Presumably, many of his lines on the show are also improvised.<br/><br/>Kate O'Brien (played by Christa Miller): she's the cold-blooded witch from Scrubs (Dr. Cox' ex-wife), but here she's just adorable. She's cute, she's funny, she's the second of Drew's close friends. Oh yeah, she's kind of a slut too. Absolutely shameless when it comes to sex and masturbation, she's quite liberated from society's judgments. She just doesn't care.<br/><br/>Oswald Lee Harvey (played by the supremely-versatile Deidrich Bader): the third of Drew's friends, he's Lewis' best buddy and arguably one of the dumbest people to ever appear on a TV show. Played to perfection by Deidrich, very rarely has dim wit and stupidity been played this good on TV. Let's see, Gob from Arrested Development, Bridget from 8 Simple Rules, Homer Simpson, Peter Griffin, I'd say those five are on anyone's short list for ""funniest dumb characters in TV history"". This character is absolutely hysterical. <br/><br/>Mimi Bobeck (played by Kathy Kinny): a nightmare on feet, she's Drew's arch nemesis in the office (and often times in real life). She puts him down endlessly about everything, she hatches evil plans all the time, she made him the victim of countless pranks, her mission in life is to ruin his. She was never intended to be a recurring character, but thanks (many thanks) to popular feedback from the audience, she was kept.<br/><br/>Nigel Wick (played by Craig Ferguson): Drew's English boss. He's my favorite character on the show. Played to extreme comedic heights by Ferguson (who's Scottish), you'll be amazed how well he gets the English accent. Compare his English accent to Americans doing the accent. God, so embarrassing. Craig gave me the surprise of a lifetime when he spoke his true Scottish accent one time. I was shocked. I could've sworn he was 100% English. Wick constantly ruins Drew's life, albeit not always on purpose. He's cold-hearted, selfish, self-centered, he's the epitome of the Machiavellian approach. Every line is a classic. Every scene is hysterity. One of the main reasons I watched this show.<br/><br/>The show only kept getting better until 2000, then it started to go downhill, unfortunately. Drew lost his trademark (and funny) weight, the comedians lost some of their glare, bizarre - and utterly disgusting at times - plots were hatched (the low point being the very old gay couple living with Drew, describing some ""intimacies"" that include waxing each other, ugh), and very sadly, the show was not what it once was. But from 1995 to 1999, there was arguably no funnier show on TV, not even Seinfeld. Sure, it was more popular, but by no means better. The Drew Carey Show blew Seinfeld out of the water. Now we just have a sad and fond memory of a brutally funny and well-written show that is no more.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,24 January 2007
911,The Drew Carey Show, My favorite show,"Drew Carey is one of the unluckiest guys on the face of the Earth. He has a no where job in a department store, he lives in his parents old house, and he can never seem to be a good boyfriend. This is the best show ever! When you think of a good sitcom you usually first think of Seinfeld or Friends. The Drew Carey Show over powers them all! All I do when I watch this show is laugh and laugh! Sometimes I can relate with Drew, the main character who can show how bad life really is. But besides Drew , Ryan Stiles as Drews friend Lewis takes the cake as best character. Every time he talks about his job at DrugCo. I bet you can't stop from cracking a smile. Example: ""We finally taught dolphins how to speak in human down at DrugCo."" ""Really, Wow! What do they say?"" ""Oh you know the usual, ""Stop! I'll talk, I'll talk, just quit shocking me!"" Along with Lewis is the dimwitted Oswald Harvey the delivery man. Together these two would just crack you up by building a house in the park by circus clowns or breaking their vents by playing mission imposable. Besides the two lunk heads is the only girl in the group, Kate. Throughout the series you'll see how relationships between Drew and Kate expand and shrink. Meet Drew's annoying boss Mr. Wick, Drew's cross dressing brother Steve, and Drew's ultimate nemeses Mimi. With this show you won't only get comedy you'll get love, drama, beer, and practical jokes between cubicles.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll get a hint of genius. So sit back, grab a drink, and enjoy the best show ever!",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,23 June 2005
912,The Drew Carey Show, Cleveland rocks! Drew Carey rocks!,"My friend admitted he liked this show a lot because at the time it had something different from other sitcoms- a setting not in New York. Also, the story pretty much revolves around Drew Carey- the others are always there to provide comic relief. Oswald (Diedrich Bader), which I just realized is a name rearrangement of the guy who shot Kennedy, and Lewis (Ryan Stiles) are like two dogs that accompany Drew to his misadventures; faithful, kinda slow, and pee a lot.<br/><br/>The Drew Carey show is down-to-earth and humorously self-deprecating. Drew Carey, the overweight man in thick glasses, works a dead-end job surrounded by those who work hard to make him suffer. The way Drew and Mimi (Kathy Kinney) sling insults and pranks at each other day after day provides one of those greatest moments of real life living. Most shows tend to avoid the workplace even though it consumes almost one-third of your life (except some like Just Shoot Me or Murphy Brown) You wonder how coworkers around you manage to stay alive. Example- Drew to Mimi- ""What's with this pile of crap? And what's with all the junk on its desk?"" Oswald and Lewis are there mainly as Stooges to make Drew's life more exciting. This trio can make a list of dirty jokes and all three are bachelors on the journey to a good time. Only Drew is slightly more moralistic, but Lewis and Oswald are there to cheer him up and tell him that he blew it on a chance to totally get some. Just like true chums.<br/><br/>The show has some similarities to Seinfeld, but less Jewish and more beer-drinking by all cast members. This sitcom is not afraid to deviate from the standard situational episodes once in a while, like the ""Emmy-performance"" or the ""live"" show. But, better than most shows, is the believability of the characters. They don't mind sitting around drinking. The characters sling insults at each other and shake it off so that they can drink Buzz Beer.<br/><br/>I like this show more because of its constant slew of great insults and misfortunes, while still giving the characters that down-to-earth feel. You don't always get what you want, and that's what Carey gets to learn when surrounded by an awesomely quirky cast.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,,28 February 2005
913,The Drew Carey Show, What used to be the best... is no more.,"Do not get me wrong, I still absolutely love the Drew Carey show, but the new episodes suck.

But let us go onto the good things about the drew carey show. Oswald and Lewis, pure genius characters... one of my favorite characters on any show! Drew (in the early season) used to be hilarious, I love it when him and Mimi fight! As for Mimi, her dresses are just crazy, love the dresses, especially the wedding gown. I don't care much for Kate, but as for Steve, he used to be really funny when he was a cross-dresser.

914,The Drew Carey Show, From best to worst,"This show used to one of the best satires of office life, ironically being aired the same year The Kids In The Hall ended. But at some point I watched it and said to myself ""what happened?"". It was innovative as a comedy, especially the shows where they purposely had something wrong. It was by far the best sitcom I've ever seen, which is saying a lot because I'm not much of a fan of American comedy. But mixing it with Whose Line Is It Anyway ruined it for both shows a bit. Then it became all the things it was set out to make fun of in the first place. Drew accidentily became a bygamist which led to Kate leaving- which is irritatingly stupid of the writers because in the same episode she would not quite belly-aching because she knew Drew would do something foolish. What, she wasn't expecting that?? The worst was the total change in the company. Now that it is the new millenium, it is no longer a satire for office jobs in the nineties, but office jobs in the new millenium. So it changed to having teen owners and Drew having no idea what his job really is. This was where it became the worst sitcom, because it didn't have any good ideas anymore. It used plots which were used by most other sitcomes that didn't even last two seasons: Steve cheated on Mimi, the new owners were fresh out of college, Drew went looking for marriage... on and on.  It lost its edge and it stopped being funny.      Drew Carey is one of my favorite American comedians, but he really needs to take a break and get that edge back or else his career will be on a decline.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,,28 June 2003

I have to say at it's outset,I had no idea who he was,having never seen him on The Tonight Show. I wasn't crazy about the ""Moon Over Parma"" theme either (I thought he said Move Over Mama which made no sense of course!) <br/><br/>I liked the scene,in the pilot,where he coughs and at the same time tears up Mimi's application for the cosmetics department...very funny! <br/><br/>The whole series was great (except for the episode where he almost passes away!) until ABC moved it to Monday nights. What possessed them to do that?! I think given his success with this show and ""Whose Line.."" maybe ABC thought he was getting ""too big"" and decided to sabotage him. (Not directly accusing but that's how it seems to me.)<br/><br/>So poor Drew and crew get regularly pushed back to late night due to the fact that football comes first! I actually had to stay up to see a show! Since I usually had work the next day,naturally i couldn't always do that. <br/><br/>So I lost track. I didn't even see the final shows until this past May. At least it had a conclusion and for my money,it was worth the wait. <br/><br/>Nice ending,Drew once again out in the rain playing pool in his back yard,with those closest to him watching from the window...thinking he's nuts!

925,High Maintenance," Wonderfully quirky, funny and engaging...for the first two seasons","(Review updated after Season 4).<br/><br/>A series of short stories on the lives of everyday people living in New York. All the stories have one character in common - a pot dealer known simply as ""the guy"".<br/><br/>Wonderfully quirky and engaging series of vignettes. A great mix of drama and comedy. The short stories, of which there are one or two each episode, suck you in with likable characters in interesting situations. From there it is a leisurely ride to a great punch- line.<br/><br/>Writer-director-creators (and husband and wife) Katja Blichfield and Ben Sinclair do a great job at keeping the stories simple, yet profound, and the characters relatable. Sinclair also stars as The Guy, and does so very well, coming across as an entrepreneurial version of The Dude in The Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>My favourite episode: S1 E3, where the dog falls in love with his walker. You actually feel you are seeing the world from the dog's eyes, and it's a wonderful experience. (Incidentally, the walker is played by Yael Stone, of Orange Is The New Black fame).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the writing quality started to diminish after Season 2.

exposition about the nuances of sativa and indica blends, but rather the Guy is the perfect, contemporary observer who weaves together wonderful, sweet stories of people coping in the big city, but with such a buoyant spirit I just want to drop what I'm doing and move to Brooklyn, which is more of a magical state of mind than a brick, asphalt and concrete borough of NYC. <br/><br/>I've read some disappointments with the highly
produced HBO continuation of the original web series. Well yeah, the original first season was delightful, brilliant with the atmosphere that was accomplished with no budget and compressed into 8 minute episodes. I would have been happy if it stayed in that space. But kudos to HBO for recognizing the talent here, investing in it, and allowing this team to see where it can go with all the tools they could use. They took it to an excellent place and I can't wait until season 3.",20 out of 30 found this helpful.,9.0,3 October 2018

I don't know how the scripts were developed, but my sense is that the actors were improvising and the scripts evolved out of that. It's hard to believe that all this could have come from the minds of one or two people, unless they are geniuses. I can't think of anything else I've seen that is so effective at giving the viewer a sense of truly being a ""fly on the wall"", getting actual glimpses of the lives real people live. Often, the scenes are utterly unpredictable, and the situations are hilarious, in a fresh, unforced way that doesn't feel ""written"" at all. It's really something special.

931,High Maintenance, Funny if not consistent,The new HBO comedic drama focuses on different characters throughout  each episode connected by a character known only as the guy who bikes  around New York City and sells pot to various people. Each character  has their own issues and reasons for encountering the guy played by Ben  Sinclair. The show started out as a web series and has graduated to  thirty-minute episodes that can encapsulate up to two different story  lines that interweave in strange connections not always noticed in  everyday life.  Stories range from a young Muslim student to couples hosting an orgy to  an entire episode from the point of view of a dog. The shows use the  slice of life to explore issues of the human condition that are both  humorous and emotional. The writers don't hold back on the awkwardness  of being a weed dealer that interacts with all sorts of strange  individuals that are either shut-in and antisocial or a bit too  comfortable and overly social. The guy takes all this in stride with a  relentlessly positive attitude.,14 out of 26 found this helpful.,7.0,25 October 2016

944,High Maintenance," Guy yes, but NYC is also the star","This is a great show about some quirky fictional but real-to-life New York characters. The short web series episodes were fantastic and left me wanting more. The one about Passover is hilarious! I died. On conversion to HBO the episodes became a half hour which was nice. At some point the husband/wife creators of the show, one who plays Guy the weed dealer and Katya who also played occasional characters - they split up and at that point I think there was a marked difference in the show's sensibility, I think for the better.<br/><br/>What is interesting to me is how some people got turned off by the ""dog"" episode. The first time I saw it I thought WTF. Totally out of left field. But after a while it occurred to me that this was some of the most creative moments I've ever seen on TV. I won't reveal what happens, but the shows context is that New Yorkers are by and large weird. You have to be to live there. NYC is weird. Brooklyn is really weird. Let's keep it that way.<br/><br/>The episode about the Indian girl was also very different. Like WTF. But when you try to understand what it's like to grow up in the rough &amp; tumble city in a family of first generation immigrants, the episode makes perfect sense in context of the overall gist of the series.<br/><br/>Other comments that the characters constantly change are true, but several of them do make recurring appearances. Beth from the dog episode surprisingly shows up with a dog in a later episode. And my favorite - Homeless Heidi makes several appearances. She is an abhorrent mooch, she gets under my skin, but hers is a necessary id in a world of insecure self-aggrandizing hipsters.

947,High Maintenance, HBO Remake Complete Trash,"So to give you some background this show has been around 2 years before HBO had anything to do with it, and back then it was a pretty cool show about a collection of stories that a pot dealer had from just delivering his weed all around NYC. And the original show was awesome I honestly don't know why they canceled it the first go around but anyway to the HBO version. <br/><br/>With this being on HBO you'd think that this show would be more to the point, but it isn't. For example the first episode started off pretty OK, and then it turned into something from Jerry Springer. Which I found kind of weird because as where once this was a show about a delivery guy with mostly the focus on what happens around him now it's anything but. And then it went into a whole segment about some gay guy losing his mind on meth which was completely out of left field. Bottom line the direction this show has started taking is not a great one, instead of focusing on the dealer and his stories they just kind of scattershot everyone else into it. 6/10 I'm hoping they were just trying something new with the first episode and it goes back to being a good show.<br/><br/>Second Review: This show is now complete hipster garbage, Well done HBO, you've managed to take a great show and turn it into absolutely intolerable trash. 3/10, if you value time don't watch this thing, not even remotely worth it anymore.",36 out of 104 found this helpful.,3.0,30 January 2017

949,Without a Trace, Marianne Jean-Baptiste,"WAT is the show I look forward to watching most every week (comes in a close 2nd after The Closer). I don't know why so many people think the show has gone downhill. It still holds my interest for that hour. My only criticism (and it's not about Rosalyn Sanchez) is that they have one of the most talented actresses alive today, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, and they hardly use her! She deserves much more character development and depth to her role. It's the same story with S. Epatha Merkerson on Law &amp; Order. Another underused great talent. However, perhaps after being recognized for Lackawanna Blues, NBC will wake up. Let's see more Marianne in the future. At least let her express an emotion every now and then. Even Tony LaPaglia is allowed to do that.",45 out of 56 found this helpful.,,10 July 2006
950,Without a Trace, A Somber But Often Poignant Detective Series,"I am sorry that ""Without A Trace"" went off the air after five years, though I agree with other reviewers that it had probably exhausted its possibilities. The show had many things going for it: a first-rate cast, a set of often surprising plot twists, and an ability to look at some of the darkest parts of New York city life. Anthony LaPaglia, as the head of the FBI missing- persons unit, gave a set of performances that were truly gripping: his character was always tough, devoted, and often very reserved, but there was always an enormous amount of passion locked within him which would come out at the most desperate moments. The rest of the cast were uniformly good, and I agree with many other observers that Marianne Jean-Baptiste was a superb actress and a perfect colleague for LaPaglia's plain-spoken FBI man.<br/><br/>It is true, though, that as the years went by, the script writers appear to have run out of ideas about missing/abducted/brutalized persons and turned more and more to examining the personal lives of the FBI agents. We had love affairs between LaPaglia and Montgomery, Close and Montgomery, and Murciano and Sanchez, not to mention the collapse of LaPaglia's character's marriage, and the show did become more and more of a soap opera. It was probably at that point that the show started to lose the interest of its viewers.<br/><br/>But the single most important relationship in the show -- not a romantic relationship so much as a deeply personal relationship between two characters who really respected each other, even when they fought with each other -- was the relationship between LaPaglia's character and Jean-Baptiste's character. They were the stars of the show, and the way they agreed but often disagreed about their jobs and their lives made the show the wonderful, poignant success that it was for so many years.",16 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,28 May 2012
951,Without a Trace, On Second thought,"A little while ago,I'd written a user comment that was faintly praising and perhaps a little more than cruel in dismissing this show as a sort of pedestrian,superficial attempt at sincere drama that is acted well-enough and scripted competently enough to be interesting. After watching more episodes(mostly in re-runs) and getting roundly unsupported by those who bothered an opinion of my review,I decided to do a rewrite.<br/><br/>While I still stick by my assertion that this show isn't quite as innovative or searing as it aspires to be,it's still quite compelling a drama. While the acting varies,from superb and sublime(mostly Anthony LaPaglia as the chief,but Marianne Jean-BAptiste and Poppy Montgomery are good as fellow agents),to completely flat(mostly Roslyn Sanchez,who IS easy on the eyes but not much more),the stories DO draw the viewer in,and the earnest and deliberate means of spelling out the Bureau's investigating a missing case. Good storytelling that is not (ordinarily) as graphic or de-humanizing as a CSI episode,that still handles the subject manner soberly(if sometimes short-sighted),this show may not be my favorite on the telly,but I will watch it if it's on more often than not. That,to me,seems like a more accurate assessment.",14 out of 16 found this helpful.,,25 May 2008
952,Without a Trace, Contrarian viewpoint,"I find this show engaging enough to watch fairly regularly but have to disagree with all the glowing reviews that have been posted. The plot lines are often simplistic and sensationalist and the long music-driven ""emotional"" scenes are pandering and boring. The characters are one dimensional and any ""development"" seems forced. I feel like Lenny on Law &amp; Order is my good buddy even though that show hardly has any character development, whereas the WAT characters seem more like bullet points--""the wise, good hearted leader with family problems"", ""the tough blonde going through an emotional crisis"", etc. The show is okay but it's really a slick presentation of something that could use a few more IQ points.",90 out of 132 found this helpful.,,15 February 2004
953,Without a Trace, Low-key and engaging,"After reading a half-dozen of the reviews convinced that a lot of folks who didn't like it were expecting a typical cop show. It isn't. May have been an experiment on Bruckheimer's part - turning cop show conventions on their head.<br/><br/>First there's the shows low-key tone: no screaming sirens, no melodramatic hooks, no heart-pounding chases or rescues. Chases and especially rescues do exist but, like all of the other expositional elements, they're portrayed in measured, deliberate and muted tones. Just like the ""teams"" response to each week's puzzle. All very quiet with just a hint of intensity and a clear demonstration that they care about their victims.<br/><br/>All elements that, except for the tone, Without a Trace shares with most cop shows. Just reversed.<br/><br/>Now here's the really radical departure - the show's focus is centered on what are usually the secondary characters: the victims and the lives surrounding them. In fact, most of the ""team's"" interactions are with the secondary characters.<br/><br/>Think about shows, very good shows, like Bones or Castle or Burn Notice or any one of dozens of cop shows: all centered on the ""team"" and it interactions. Victims, perps and puzzles exist mainly to highlight those interactions.<br/><br/>This is not a criticism. I love the shows mentioned.<br/><br/>My point is simply that Without a Trace reverses those conventions and does it very successfully. One one hand, enough time is spent on the team to humanize it; on the other, just enough emphasis on the victims and their stories to elevate them to the the primary focus.<br/><br/>Takes some getting used to but well worth the effort. Surprising, those few scenes dedicated to the ""team"", either as individuals or a whole, wind up describing a very rich set of personalities, though you might have to watch a lot of episodes to realize it.<br/><br/>Like all cop shows there there are problems with plot integrity and, with Without a Trace, the very premise: the FBI getting involved before the local cops and their 48-hour window. And like all cop shows, the inconsistencies and questionable plot lines are simply elements meant to invoke the suspension of disbelief. Nothing more.<br/><br/>If this was an experiment on Bruckheimer's part, seven seasons speak volumes to its success.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,9 May 2014

958,Without a Trace, Repetitive,"I have watched quite many episodes of this show. Simply because i have very few TV-channels with good reception during weekends in the cabin, and this show is conveniently shown Saturday evening.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of TV-shows. First the ones that get better the more you watch them, like most of the shows from HBO for instance. The characters get more elaborate, the story deeper and the show moves forward. Then there is the second kind of show that becomes worse the more you watch. Repetitive scripts, shallow characters, illogical story line. Unfortunately this show belongs to the latter category.<br/><br/>I don't really know whether that's so unexpected though. This show is about cops trying to find missing people and there are not that many ways for someone to go missing. Usually it's just variants on the same thing. Violent crime, teenagers run away from home, abductions, accidents. After a dozen episodes it more or less feels like i have seen it all.<br/><br/>And what are the positive points? Since i have given this show a five-star grade there should be a few of those as well. And there are. This show has a few qualities that i appreciate. Among them are the technical quality, the decent acting and the nice pace. Especially pace is something that's very necessary for a show to concentrate on. If i'm going to watch many episodes of a TV-show i need it to be well-paced. Not too fast-paced and not too slow. Both ruin the experience. This show is just about right.<br/><br/>With a bit more creative thinking in the script-department, a bit more character-development and perhaps also a bit less moralizing this could be good entertainment.

Malone is off-kilter so much he should be in jail for all the stuff he pulls. The personal drama between the characters detract too much from what's going on. The agents consistently abuse, threaten, and brow-beat suspects, witnesses, and victims that that whole unit should be looking for new jobs...or suspension at the least. I've stopped watching this show...no originals, no reruns, no more TiVo season pass.<br/><br/>I started watching because of Eric Close--I thought this show would give him a chance to truly develop into a top-tier actor, but that just has not happened. LaPaglia is good as Jack Malone, but the overdone maverick behavior of Malone so distracts from the show--greatly so. However, the one actor that truly shines in the show is Marianne Jean-Baptiste as agent Vivian Johnson. She is the only one on the show that acts like an FBI agent with the portrayal of the character's personal side being the most believable.<br/><br/>And to the CBS directors and writers, you guys need an FBI technical adviser for more than just a few shows...or fire Mark Llewellyn for doing such a poor job.",31 out of 55 found this helpful.,1.0,18 May 2008

It seems that WAT will not return for an eighth season.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought she wasn't that bad. She even won an award for her acting in this series. Has anyone ever thought that the way she acted was maybe the way her character was supposed to be? Lifeless, cold, emotionless, like a real FBI agent. I had no problem with her accent either. If anyone was mumbling on that show it was rather Anthony Lapaglia! Anyway, the first season was a little shaky with actors finding their characters. The second season was great. The third season had too much emphasis on character personal development and unrealistic involvement with each other. Almost to the point of having the impression of watching a bad soap opera.<br/><br/>And it went downhill from there, until the last seasons where the writing got a bit better, but not as good as the early shows.<br/><br/>Well all this is academic, since we've seen the very last of Jack, Sam, Vivian, Danny, and Martin. Oh, and I almost forgot, Elena.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, Marianne Jean-Baptiste was the best actress throughout her 159 episodes, even though we didn't see her character's private side as much as the others.<br/><br/>My two cents on it.",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,5.0,18 November 2009
965,Without a Trace, Weakest of the cop shows on TV,"This series started off with promise but has quickly faded to the back of the pack. The show is light on character development, which can be alright (see ""Law &amp; Order"" with Benjamin Bratt and Jerry Orbach). However, the plots are hackneyed and played out in overly dramatic fashion, which doesn't work for a show that should be grittier and uglier. Also, I don't mind figuring out the mystery a few minutes early, it happens from time to time with all shows, but figuring it out 15 minutes early and then having to suffer through melodramatic moments and elaborate epiphanies accompanied by music that sounds as though it came from a ""Soundtracks 101a"" class is just gut-wrenching. My recommendation? Skip this copycat and stick with the winners: L&amp;O (original), CSI (original), and The Shield. If you want a show closer to Without a Trace but with a bit more body, try ""Criminal Minds.""",47 out of 92 found this helpful.,3.0,9 June 2006
966,Without a Trace, Another CSI disguised,"Whereas CSI is about a crime scene unit team, Without A Trace involves missing persons and the FBI. Otherwise, it's nothing more than another CSI spin off. = ""CSI: Without A Trace"". People tend to disagree but they fail to see CSI: Without A Trace for what it is, Bruckheimer TV.<br/><br/>CSI deals with a crime scene to solve a murder or two while CSI: Without A Trace backtracks a person or person(s) last steps at a ""crime scene"" of sorts to find this person. Both shows genres deal with lengthy interviews with suspects or witnesses and the hunt for forensic evidence. Flashback scenes are used in both series and are filmed under similar sequences.

967,Without a Trace, Good and then less and less good but still not bad,"For three seasons this show about missing persons was a favorite of mine. Then the show itself went missing (it changed nights) and I never saw it again.<br/><br/>Well, okay, I did, once in a while. But I'd lose interest before the end and so was never moved to make a note of the new time slot. The show declined, like most shows, a little at a time; it never went bad, but the qualities that had originally drawn me to it slipped away. Really, they began doing so after the first season.<br/><br/>Of course the show was mistitled: the missing always left traces, without which there could have been no stories. The reasons for the disappearances varied (and varied more the longer the show continued), but the best and most characteristic stories were variations on the old song ""The Raggle Taggle Gypsies,"" about a wife who has a seemingly perfect life--rich husband, house and lands, featherbed--and runs away from it. In the song the reason is never disclosed; but on the show, in its best period, a series of interviews would build up a picture of the missing person, gradually revealing what was hidden in his life and in his psyche, so that the story became less a police procedural than a character study. The contrast between the victim's outward life and his inner one, which had become intolerable, gave the format a special resonance: the character had become separated from everything around him before he ever took off; he had left already.<br/><br/>At first glance the regular cast seemed absurdly over-qualified for this type of show, but their ability was essential to its coming off at all. It wasn't just that they were skillful actors but that they were all able to play in the same key, set by the lead, Anthony La Paglia. They behaved like people who had themselves lost someone (some of their losses were dramatized in later episodes) and thereby set the show's tone: an air of bereavement, of having lost something irretrievable, even after the missing persons were found. As a result many of the early episodes were truly affecting, without being forced. However, as often happens on TV, sincerity was the show's first casualty, and after the first season it seldom achieved the same level of poignancy.<br/><br/>Of course not all the episodes conformed to the same pattern. A handful dealt with serial killers, and although most of these were up to standard they weren't really in the show's line.<br/><br/>And it had its share of unlikelihoods from the start. Its style was similar to that of the British spy show Spooks: intense, low-key acting and gritty locales overlaid with flash camera-work. These combined to create an impression of devoted realism which masked the impossibility of the scenes: not one of the conversations could ever have happened as written, especially among people in the professions shown.<br/><br/>The biggest improbability was a prior affair between Jack, the boss, and Samantha, one of his agents, which continued to inform their dealings and the atmosphere of the office in general. The show normally observed such reticence about its regulars' personal lives that a viewer who left to get a Coke was apt to miss the only testimony to a hookup or a breakup; but this connection was supposed to remain unspoken and unsuspected (notwithstanding Samantha's habit of making doe eyes at her former paramour). The two characters evidenced no grounds for a romantic attraction, and their continual almost-but-not-quite flirtations were incredible from the start.<br/><br/>From the beginning, the show had a penchant for sensationalism, which came to predominate in later seasons, with particular emphases on children being molested and women being hit. And then there were the big scenes without significance: Jack tells one of his agents, ""You keep screwing things up, one more time and you'll be pounding the pavement""; but the agent hadn't screwed up before, and his status was back to normal next week. There were a few outright misfires, notably a dream play with one of the regular cast in disguise (but recognizable from the first shot).<br/><br/>As the show went on it continued to present many good stories and scenes, but more and more often these came to center on the team members rather than the victims. The writers had to strain increasingly to devise plots that weren't mere variations on what had come before, and so they came to rely more and more on crime show brutalities. Yet they always steered clear of certain subjects, e.g. although it's stated in one scene that wives often go missing because they've been murdered by husbands, I can't remember a single episode turning on spousal murder.<br/><br/>In the last seasons the writers tried out variations on Jack's character, at one point trying to make him into a funny man, with doleful results, and at another point turning him, more successfully, into Mike Hammer. However, the biggest error during the latter part of the show's run was the introduction of Miss Puerto Rico (not sarcasm; that's literally who she was). A thick accent isn't an insurmountable barrier for an actor, but Roselyn Sanchez didn't only sound like Desi Arnaz, she sounded like Desi Arnaz playing Ricky Ricardo. She acted like an official greeter at the Puerto Rico pavilion at the World's Fair rather than a federal investigator, and her breezy posturing--cocking her head, sharkishly flashing her teeth, tapping her toe, striking poses at odd angles like a character out of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari--killed every one of her scenes.<br/><br/>But she didn't kill the show; it just ran out of inspiration--and eventually, out of cases.",6 out of 10 found this helpful.,7.0,9 October 2010

And his team, with the exception of Marianne Baptiste, is made up of typical B-level TV actors, all very generic and interchangeable. LaPaglia's character initially was introduced on one of the CSI shows. I can recommend watching WAT for one reason and one reason only: If there is no LAW &amp; ORDER or LAW &amp; ORDER SVU episode playing. Then it is better than nothing. It's like COLD CASE or CROSSING JORDAN: They are good enough to watch while waiting for LAW &amp; ORDER.

970,Without a Trace," Flawed, But Better Than I Figured","If this hadn't been on sale for an extremely low price, I would never have seen it, which would have been my loss. This was good. Interesting stories, usually well-told and a cast of likable ""good guys.""<br/><br/>This show, which follows the number one-rated CSI show that precedes it on Thursday nights, is another Jerry Bruckmeier production and it shows. That means it will be stylishly shot, interesting, have a 40-ish male in the lead who is calm, have a racially diverse young crowd of people working for him, corny (expect a song the last two minutes with some corny ending), and a little bit of Liberal preaching here and there. All of that seems to add up to a hit show.<br/><br/>The best episodes in this first year came in the first half of the season, so it got viewers hooked. Straight, interesting crime stories. Then the PC baloney began to slowly infiltrate the stories along with some melodrama about the characters' personal lives. Who cares? Just give us the crime stories. Overall, I am not complaining. It was good first year and I enjoyed every episode except the last two-hour special which was nothing but a man sobbing and whining about his dead wife for most of the show.<br/><br/>Of the supporting cast, I liked Enrique Murciano the best with the boss, Anthony LaPaglia, a close second. Poppy (nice name) Montgomery was easy on the eyes but I didn't care for her attitude.<br/><br/>Finally, where is the second season on DVD?

971,Without a Trace, Slick FBI Drama,"""Without A Trace"" is my guilty secret. <br/><br/>Solidly acted, with clever plot twists, it's an above average US cop show where FBI agents track down missing persons. Why then, do I almost feel bad about owning up to liking it? The answer lies in the very smooth nature of the show. Jerry Bruckheimer's big-screen intellect translated into television, proves disarmingly seductive.<br/><br/>There is nothing ground-breaking stylistically. Told through a series of flashbacks, each storyline adds sufficient weight to the plot to add a new line of inquiry to the FBI presentation board.<br/><br/>The cast, are key to building the tension. Interestingly for a US show, three of the lead actors aren't American. (La Paglia and Poppy Montgomery are Australian, while Marianne Jeanne-Baptiste is English)<br/><br/>Although led by De Niro lookalike La Paglia, ""Without A Trace"" is very much an ensemble piece, with every character battling to stamp their authority on each case. <br/><br/>I admit the dialogue strays into cop-show cliché occasionally, but this is the unashamed glory of watching it - Big movie sensibilities condensed into an hour of TV.<br/><br/>In spite your better judgment, on Monday nights, you will end up caught up in the urgency and willing Jack Malone's team on.",23 out of 60 found this helpful.,,24 August 2004
972,Without a Trace, Another good example of a show with pluses and minuses,"Now I liked Without a Trace when it first started. It wasn't brilliant, but somehow it kept my attention. But later around the time Rosalyn Sanchez came on the scene, while not as badly as Special Victim's Unit did, it jumped the shark a bit. Without A Trace is slick, with nice photography and interesting locations, while the music is great. The best asset though for me is Anthony LaPaglia, who is excellent as Jack. That said, Without a Trace does have its problems. The story ideas are interesting and are decently written in general, but there is a lot of ponderous pacing in this show. I appreciate it is for character development and atmosphere but there is almost every episode with one scene with nothing happening other than haunting music and reflective facial expressions it does get a bit too much. The show's writing is not exceptional either, not awful granted but it can get uninteresting and repetitive on occasions. I also have to concur about Rosalyn Sanchez, I personally don't think she adds anything to the show, and her character does come across as rather cold and difficult to empathise with. Overall, it was decent, but it is a show of pluses and minuses. 5/10 Bethany Cox",4 out of 7 found this helpful.,5.0,21 November 2010
973,Without a Trace, Unmissable American criminal drama.,"I first saw 'Without A Trace' purely by chance, when the first series was repeated on Channel Four this year during the summer. I enjoyed it so much that I resolved to watch the forthcoming second series. Now, it is one of the few television programmes I will record rather than miss.<br/><br/>The series is set in the Missing Persons' Department of the F.B.I. in New York. Head of the Department is the ruthless, uncompromising but troubled Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia). Aiding him in the search for people who have disappeared 'without a trace' is his team of Agents. There is pretty, sensitive Samantha Spade (Poppy Montgomery), tough-talking, forthright but kind Vivian Johnson (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), handsome, charming Danny Taylor (Enrique Murciano) and thoughtful, intelligent Martin Fitzgerald (Eric Close).<br/><br/>The strengths of the programme are its intelligent, slick, intense, twist-in-the-tale story lines and the strong, rounded characterisations of the five leads.<br/><br/>The stories deal with topical, thought-provoking issues, such as the exploitation of illegal immigrants, parental pressure on a child prodigy and the consequences of the 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers.As each case unravels, nothing and no-one is what it seems to be. Nor do all the disappearances have happy endings.<br/><br/>The five leads are played strongly, the strengths and weaknesses of their contrasting characters brought out with the unfolding of the story and the twists and turns of the plots. As yet, we do not know a great deal about their personal lives. Malone is estranged from his wife and has two young daughters. Vivian is married with a teenage son. Samantha, Taylor and Fitzgerald are not married although Fitzgerald has family because he speaks of his nieces. Taylor had a less-than-privileged upbringing which included being stabbed. Maybe more on this is to come? Notwithstanding, the agents work well together and there is little rivalry, only a mutual desire to solve the disappearance and bring any criminals to justice.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend 'Without A Trace' too highly. It is not always easy to watch; but, always worth it, I hope it runs for many years.",17 out of 48 found this helpful.,,22 November 2004
974,Hart to Hart," ""When they met... it was murder!""","If you've read some of my other user comments, you'll quickly discover that Hart to Hart isn't the kind of thing I usually go for. But, surprisingly, the show works for me. A loving relationship, plenty of money, a wonderful house, nice cars, and a life filled with adventure and mystery - this is what has always drawn me to Hart to Hart.<br/><br/>At the heart of Hart to Hart is its two leads - Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers as Johnathan and Jennifer Hart. Has there ever been a more perfect television couple? It's easy to see that they were longtime friends in real life before the show started. They seem so natural together. Both are also accomplished actors and are capable of making even the most ridiculous of situations believable. And Lionel Stander as the butler, chauffeur, handyman, cook, and general do everything guy, Max, is also a real asset. Like Wagner and Powers, he came to the series with a long resume. It's a solid cast.<br/><br/>Looking back at some of the episodes, they may seem incredibly corny to those more accustomed to modern TV. Two people just don't find themselves in these kinds of predicaments week after week. One week you're running from drug smugglers, the next week your house is completely emptied by thieves, and the next you're recovering a priceless antique for a Buddhist temple. I could live a lifetime and never have one episode worth of the adventure the Harts experienced. And, you know what? - it's this implausibility that really makes the show work for me. I enjoy it because it is unrealistic and fanciful. Life is tough enough without having reality rear its ugly head disguised as entertainment on television. I love to turn on something like Hart to Hart (or Charlie's Angels or Wonder Woman or Banacek or whatever show you can name form this period) and be entertained, and, even for a brief moment, forget about the real problems we all face.

What I liked most about the show was how close the Harts were and also how very happily married. They knew each other extremely well and respected each others opinion.

The dashing Jonathan is a self made millionaire and CEO of his company, Hart Industries. His gorgeous wife, Jennifer, has had her own career as a freelance journalist.

And Stefanie Powers is one of the most gorgeous and charismatic actresses ever to grace the small screen (and would still blow her younger counterparts away to this day). <br/><br/>What I think sets ""Hart to Hart"" apart from ""The Thin Man"", is the sexual playfulness of Jonathan and Jennifer. These two couldn't keep their hands off each other, and amidst investigating a murder or an art theft, they'd be nibbling each others ears, or fondling their knees or groping each other in a hot tub. There's a voyeuristic quality about this show, as their flirtatious dialogue and just what Jonathan was doing to Jennifer under those hot tub bubbles got the mind going.

Wagner's Jonathan Hart was a superhero level fighter, and also a refined gentleman, very manly, but too humble, dignified, and willing to show his feelings to be macho and Jennifer was just as plucky, self-reliant and quick-witted; the quips and cute jokes made this show much more lighthearted than other crime shows, especially today's. Their laid-back, fun-loving butler gave a good amount of the laughs with his comedic deliveries. They were very wealthy and lived a glamorous lifestyle but didn't lose sight of what mattered in life and wouldn't hesitate to help anybody. Which is why they were amateur detectives in the first place. Their wealth, plucky resourcefulness, and street smarts gave them clearance to go on any caper and often made them targets for the nefarious villains. I have wondered why they never had children, I did think that was somewhat sad: one time there was a young boy who claimed to be Jonathan's son, a situation that came together by one of Jonathan's old loves and an unstable father where they were both very kind, devoted and protective parents who grew attached to the boy in season 1. Another attractive quality of the show is their cute little shaggy dog and how he was written as one of the family and one of the detectives. Most shows don't seem to write animals as that versatile and central to the story unless the show is about the animal.

992,Hart to Hart, Solid entertainment,"I was a devoted Hart to Hart fan when they first aired. I was about 13 years old and thought Jonathan and Jennifer were just about the most glamorous and fabulous couple. Recently I found it again on the Hallmark Mystery Channel and out is just a delight! Stephanie Powers, Robert Wagner and Lionel Sanders made a powerhouse team.
Yes, the plots were over the top but they were always entertaining. The main thing was it was so easy to get emotionally invested in not only the Hart's but the chauffeur and even Freeway, their dog.
Of course, it would be impossible to have this type of show today and that's a shame. These type shows provided a nice, easy and enjoyable 47minute vacation from whatever you may be facing and I am so glad to be able to watch them again!",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,7.0,1 March 2020
993,Hart to Hart, Another Hit Television Show,"This hit TV Series hit the airwaves on August 25 1979 starring Robert Wagner as Jonathan Hart, Stefanie Powers as Jennifer Hart and Lionel Stander as the butler Max. This was how the show started. This is my boss, Jonathan Hart - a self-made millionaire. He's quite a guy. This is Mrs. H. She's gorgeous. She's one lady who knows how to take care of herself. By the way, my name is Max. I take care of *both* of them, which isn't easy; 'cause when they met... it was *murder*! Jonathan Hart is self-made millionaire and the CEO of Hart Industries, which is a global conglomerate. Jonathan is married to the lovely Jennifer who's a freelance journalist. There hobby was private detective and found themselves in situation that resulted in murder, smuggling, theft, and or international espionage. Despite there dangerous hobby the two also found time to snuggle up to each other because they love each other very much. In the opening pilot that started this show on it's run has Jonathan pulling up to his company in his Royce. When Jonathan tries to enter Mr. Hart office the secretary won't let him in because she doesn't no who he is. When the secretary tries to stop Jonathan as he opens the door Markus introduces Jonathan to his secretary, the secretary has the look of embarrassment on her face as she shuts the door. Inside, Markus fills Jonathan in on what's happening with the business. When Jonathan leaves, he takes time to talk to his secretary who's only been with the company for six months. Therefore, Jonathan gets into his car and heads home to his mansion on the hill. When he gets there, he's greeted by his butler Max and his dog Freeway. Max became Jonathan Butler after Max help Jonathan get his business started. Max informs Jonathan that he received a telegram from his wife Jennifer who's in Paris France. Max mixes a drink for Jonathan who gives Freeway a lick of his finger and Freeway growls, which means he doesn't like it. So Max goes back and tries again and this time when Freeway gets a lick he barks which means it's good. Meanwhile a friend of Jonathans, Sam Roberts is driving away from a health farm called the Golden Goose Resort. When Sam is heading home his car goes over a cliff and burst into flames. While playing poker with his friends, Max and Freeway, Jonathan gets a call from Sam's wife, who tells Jonathan that Sam has been kill in a car accident. After talking to Sam's wife, Jonathan goes to see Sam's Doctor where he fines a brochure on the Golden Goose Resort so Jonathan sticks the brochure in his pocket. After getting no answers with Sam's doctor, Jonathan decides to head for the Golden Goose Resort to find out what happen to Sam himself. Jonathan starts down a mountain that has 12 miles of winding curves. On his way down Jonathan passes a yellow car along the side of the road that has no driver in it. After Jonathan passes the yellow car, a gorgeous red head gets up and pulls out. The two start racing down the mountainside while trying to pass each other. When the two come together, they must avoid a construction crews that have the road going down to one lane. The woman driver makes it through without any problems. However, Jonathan doesn't because he hits a police car which results in Jonathan getting several tickets. Down the road, the woman in the other car stops to make sure that Jonathan is all right before she pulls away. When Jonathan gets to the Golden Goose Resort the gorgeous red head is outside getting her car unloaded. Jonathans offers to her and goes to pickup her suitcase when it spills open sending her clothes to the ground. Jonathan meets up with the Red head at the counter and tries to apologize when his ink pen squirts ink on her blouse. Later in the evening, the lovely woman is sitting by herself in the dinning room when she sees Jonathan she gets up to leave. When the two meet in the doorway the gorgeous red head tells Jonathan she sorry and then smacks him across the face. Later that night the gorgeous red head is carrying a gun across the grounds and is climbing through the window of Jonathans Bungalow. Now a few thoughts on the show and the stars. I loved this show because for the most part, it was suspense full and it was very entertaining. I thought Robert Wagner was wonderful as Jonathan Hart. Lionel Stander was good as the butler and what can you say about Freeway. Now for Stefanie Powers! What can you say about a gorgeous red head that hasn't been said already. She was fantastic in her role as the gorgeous Jennifer Hart. She really looked sharp in the one-piece outfit. Then she wore a one piece in the gym scene and a one-piece bathing suit at the pool. For me watching Jennifer every week is what made this show a hit. Therefore, I give this picture 10 weasel stars on Stefanie beauty alone.",4 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,17 March 2007
994,Hart to Hart, Glad it's back in 2015,"Glad to see the series and the movies are back on Hallmark beginning 2015....there is a treasure trove of good old TV hidden away in vaults like Hallmark and Lifetime and yet Hallmark seems to be the only one bringing any back to our current times. Lifetime is so lacking in this respect and instead they choose to continue to show the same movies over and over and over, many with the same story lines ...Boring ...<br/><br/>Hart to Hart was/is good escapism and great to see the genre of yesteryear and how times have changed like no modern tech toys back then.

If you have Direct T.V. you will be able to catch the show at 11p.m. on FETV. Monday through Friday @ 11 p.m.. It is also on at 7 p.m. on Saturday. This was one of the best shows from the early to mid 80's. I am a sucker for crime T.V.. This one was much better than Remington Steele, because Robert Wagner and Stephanie Powers were perfect amateur sleuths. This show was almost perfect, but the way Stephanie Powers character was weak. I didn't like the way she was portrayed as the damsel in distress. It seemed like she was always calling on Johnathan to come to her aid, when she was overpowered. That was the only negative I found with the show. The viewer never got bored, because each episode was exciting and would get you involved. To me it was like being there helping them solve the crime. I highly recommend this show to anyone, especially those who love crime shows. It was and still is a guaranteed winner.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,8.0,3 September 2017
997,Hart to Hart, Excellent Crime Fighting Show,"Crime fighting shows have always been popular with viewers. Raymond Burr played a wheelchair bound chief of detectives in 'Ironside'. Edward Woodward was a retired special agent turned amateur detective in 'The Equalizer' whilst Peter Wyngarde played secret agent Jason King in 'Department S'. 'Hart To Hart' was one of America's best crime fighting drama shows of the late '70's/early '80's. It starred Robert Wagner ( in what what a role originally written for Cary Grant ) and the gorgeous Stefanie Powers as Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, him the head of a successful company and her a freelance journailst.<br/><br/>At times, the two find themselves acting as amateur detectives to put a stop to many crimes such as murder, armed robbery, espionage and so on. They are often assisted by the loyal butler Max. Even their pet dog Freeway is known to help out from time to time.<br/><br/>There was a fair display of violence on display. The Harts never failed to take the baddies down with the use of their fists if the occasion called for it. Wagner and Powers had a powerful chemistry together. Stealing the show however was the late Lionel Stander who as the gruff voiced Max brought a much needed dose of humour to the show.<br/><br/>I regularly used to watch this show when it was repeated on Granada Plus many years every morning before I would leave for school and to this day still hold fond memories of it and even fonder memories of the sight of the lovely Stefanie Powers.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,10.0,27 January 2021

They never fought, always kissed at the end, always went to some charity function, etc. As another reviewer said, Aaron Spelling cotton candy. Its an ok show, but I find Jennifer a little phony and the dialogue too fake. I mean , in the middle of an adventure, you dont stop to complement your spouse. And Jonathan was doing something every week to celebrate his wife. Not real at all. Had they toned down the lovey- dovey stuff, it would be better.

1002,Corner Gas, I Like It.....and I'm not Canadian!!!!!!,"I happened to catch an episode of this series when I was on holiday in Canada and became an immediate fan. The series is character driven, and similar in spirit to Seinfeld as a whole lot of nothing tends to happen in the small town of Dog River. There is quite a warmth about the characters and their interplay and the humour is generally good natured, focusing on human weaknesses and relationships. I am surprised it has never been shown on TV in the UK as I think a lot of people would appreciate the humour - there seems to be a lot of similarities between Canadian and Brit approach to comedy. If you've never seen it then it's well worth checking out",74 out of 89 found this helpful.,,28 December 2005
1003,Corner Gas," ""Corner Gas""","This show is a rarity in Canadian television - it's good! Too much of Canadian programing is slow, dry and boring - and aside from NHL hockey, there is not much else worth watching. A few shows have made attempts at being clever comedies, but have always failed because Canadian programming always tends to alienate the main audience by becoming too political, historical or just plain arrogant (vis-a-vis the CBC and CRTC).<br/><br/>But this show has succeeded and, more importantly, is extremely entertaining because its focus isn't on some political agenda, but rather on the art of entertaining. Brent Butt has figured out the formula that has made this series a hilarious success - and I think I can identify what some of those criteria are.<br/><br/>1. It has great characters - And character development. Just like other successful comedies (Seinfeld, The Office, Cheers, etc.) quirky characters are fun to watch.<br/><br/>2. It has great writing - The stories seem to be about nothing - but even nothing is something! <br/><br/>3. It has excellent pacing - It does not slow down at all, and continues to improve its pacing as the seasons go by. The more jokes you can fit in to the half hour, the better.<br/><br/>4. It is not sentimental - If anything, most of the characters are less than sympathetic, and that type of darkness of the human psyche is far more appealing and funny when you are making a comedy about quirky people in a quirky little town.<br/><br/>5. There is NO winter!! - Have you seen any snow yet in Dog River? This is critical for a successful Canadian comedy - because snow complicates things. It is bleak, uninteresting, and unfortunately too much of a reminder of reality for those of us who have to live with it for 10 months out of the year. In fact, with out the snow - it makes this small town in Saskatchewan look quite charming, and all the more interesting and lovable.<br/><br/>Now these are just my opinions - but if you want to take a chance on a Canadian TV show - this should be the one. Canadians should be (and are - for the most part, I think) proud of this series. I, for one, try not to miss it each week, and I own all the DVD's too...its just a fun show to watch, and I would rank it up there as one of the best new comedies on TV right now.",54 out of 65 found this helpful.,,26 September 2006
1004,Corner Gas, Great Canadian Television,"I had always been a fan of Brent Butt's comedy stylings, watching him on his specials and on Just For Laughs so when it came time to sit down and watch his new show, I was more than excited. Thankfully, I was treated to a fabulously written simple comedy about very small town life in Saskatchewan.  Having grown-up on a farm myself, I couldn't help but chuckle with the identifiable characters on the show with their small town foibles and mentalities.  I'm glad that Canadians have embraced this show and that it already has the green light for next season. I'm sure that any Americans (esp in the mid-west) who have access to CTV will also enjoy the humour being portrayed. Corner Gas is a simple comedy but that doesn't make it any less successful at its job; its a perfect blend of Canadian small town living and comedic satire.

1005,Corner Gas, A funny version of the truth,"Well, this show has been renewed for a second season, and I couldn't be happier. We, from Saskatchewan, are proud of this show because it shows the way we live (exaggerated of course), and locals have been used for extras (a guy from the town next to my home town, but went to high school in my home town was an extra and had one line). The show doesn't make people from small towns look like retards or inbred freaks, but focuses on how we know everybody, and as a result, trust everybody.<br/><br/>I love the interactions that the town of Dog River had with Lacey, in the beginning. It was so true the way they were suspicious of the girl moving from the big city to this tiny town. But once she showed she was planning to stay in the town, they warmed up to her. This happened to my family when they moved to my home town. The town warmed up to my parents when they had me and my brother because they knew we were staying and not going to leave.<br/><br/>I also love Oscar, the old and senile man who is so easily controlled by his stable wife. Honestly, I know a few people like Oscar. I loved the episode where he kept winning the stuffed animals from the claw machine.",57 out of 73 found this helpful.,,6 July 2004

1007,Corner Gas, Best Show Canada's Ever Had,"I am greatly proud and happy to know this show is from the same country I am. It is absolutely genius and could end up being my favourite show of all time. There are laughs around every corner with this show and some of the humour is especially smart where you have to really pay attention to get it. It's been called ""dry humour"" but it is plenty juicy believe me. This show works best for people who can relate to its small town humour but I reckon anyone can get amusement from it. I think it contains something for everyone.<br/><br/>All the main characters are great with some being more memorable than others but all very good nonetheless. My favourites are Oscar, Brent and Hank which is almost half of the main cast. They (as in anyone and everyone) often make big deals out of nearly nothing and find things to do that most people would never think of. I would classify it as similar in some aspects to Seinfeld but yet still much different. I like that there is no laugh track which is one of the many things that make it different and unique from other shows. It truly is a gem and one of a kind.<br/><br/>Here is a summary of the show: Popular comedian Brent Butt returns to small town Saskatchewan to portray the life he would have led had he gotten a real job - pumping gas at Corner Gas. Each episode of Corner Gas delivers a half-hour of comedic voyeurism in a place where everyone knows everyone else's business. The series is set in the fictional town of Dog River Saskatchewan, and focuses on the life (or lack thereof) of gas station owner Brent LeRoy, coffee shop proprietor Lacey Burrows and the folks who populate the area. Dog River is a nice town, but far from the quaint and idyllic little burgs we're used to seeing on TV.",32 out of 42 found this helpful.,10.0,23 June 2006
1008,Corner Gas, This is the cream of the crop on TV for comedies,"Of all the shows still currently airing new episodes, this is the funniest show on TV. My Name is Earl comes close, but doesn't quite match it. Simpsons isn't as funny as it once was, so that too is out of the running.<br/><br/>It began airing 2 years ago (and both those seasons are available to own on DVD) and the third season has just wrapped.<br/><br/>It revolves around a core of 8(Brent, Wanda, Hank, Lacey, Officers Davis and Karen, and Brents parents Oscar and Emma) characters, tied together my the small town of dog River, Sask. Only rarely do any characters leave the confines on the local coffee shop (The Ruby), gas station (Corner Gas), local bar, the insurance and liquor store, or the Leroy home. The comedy is all situational and there is no laugh track or audience participation. If a comparison to another show is needed, think Seinfeld, but on the prairies.<br/><br/>After three years there have only been 2 or 3 bad episodes, but 10-15 fantastic ones--a great ratio. Rarely do the episodes have less then 4 or 5 wonderful belly laughs or classic lines.<br/><br/>I used to like the character of Oscar the best, but now I like Hank a little more. If you want to see Officer Karen naked in another movie...track down one of the Wishmaster movies (part 4 I think).<br/><br/>This is a good show.",34 out of 45 found this helpful.,10.0,12 April 2006

(An example : an older lady, looking both frail and distinguished, is asked whether she is a Mrs. Clarkson, former governor general. When the lady replies that yes, this is indeed her name, she is immediately invited to help tear down a barn. Seconds later she is shown mauling a barn, with all the fervent pleasure of a missionary tearing down pagan idols - because hey, that's what you do when you're a Canadian.) <br/><br/>Firmly recommended : the episode where Dog River engages in a twinning project with a Japanese counterpart.

The last funny show this country had was Seinfeld and that's just plain sad. So...f you have a sense of humor and know what's REALLY funny, then this show is for you. I love the subliminal sarcasm as well as the in your face type it has to offer. I love that insults get tossed around helter skeleter vs holding it in or doing it under one's breath. How the occupants of the town always get into a predicament and always get out of said predicaments in the most circuitous ways is enough to make one laugh aloud. Tons of trickery and tomfoolery going around. If this isn't your thing, then you don't know what real humor is all about.

In fact 'News Radio' and 'Third Rock From The Sun' and to some extent 'Cheers' are similar entities... Normal people doing silly things in ordinary places. It's a good sign when the entire run has been unspoiled by an annoying laughter track!<br/><br/>Curiously, it seems to be set in some fictional climate that most Canadians will be unfamiliar with! It's almost as if it's Arizona every day in Dog River!<br/><br/>There's a very laid back feel to this comedy and the gags are usually understated. It's witty and has no agenda. Despite the characters being flawed and just a bit too naughty, the whole experience is very good natured and when people get out of line there's always payback!<br/><br/>None of the actors are familiar to me, even Brent Butt, but they all score highly on screen and there doesn't seem to be any weak links. In the IMDb reviews, there are some references to the dreadful Seinfeld which is strictly aimed at a USA audience.

This is a comedy without a laugh track but you don't need one. The acting is top drawer, everyone is great in their roles. Outside of Canada, the actors are not well known. Eric Peterson, who plays Brent's cantankerous father Oscar, was in a lawyer drama called ""Street Legal"" in the 80's, playing Leon. That ran on American TV for a while. Tara Spencer-Nairn was in a great indie film called ""New Waterford Girl"" before this, but the rest of the actors are solid Canadian actors with much to admire about their careers before this show. This is small town life, with the characters so well defined, you'll fall right into their quirks, moods and world (particularly small world) views. All six seasons are available on DVD and are highly recommended. Enjoy!",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,13 December 2010
1022,Corner Gas, The writing is better than Seinfeld...,"You may or may not have mixed feelings about Canada's contribution to the film and TV arts. (Short history: Government receives Position Paper in the 70s saying that tax breaks could create a whole new industry; government grants tax breaks; for 30 years new industry is dominated by lawyers and accountants with no prior experience in production, and the product shows it; meanwhile 100s of Canadian actors and extras take speech lessons to learn to lose that tell-tale Canadian accent; US producers looking to increase margins discover Canada in the 90s -- like oatmeal, it is cheap and filling; by about 2010 Canadian product almost indistinguishable from US product unless you have a very sharp eye and ear). History lesson over, here is the big reveal. Not only the best comedy ever produced in Canada, one of the best comedy shows ever produced, period. The characters are all huggable, yes, but it is the writing, the writing, the writing. Here is a quick test. Pick an episode of Corner Gas at random and play it sound only, no video. It will work anyway. The writing harks back to the days of radio, it is very clever, and it carries the show. Not to say that all those behind the camera were candidates for a Nobel Prize. Many alumni from this show tried hard to make lightening strike twice ... and it wouldn't.",11 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,9 November 2013

I received Season One as a ""whoever picks the most Oscar winners right wins a DVD"" prize from my Canadian brother-in-law. I don't think I could love this show more if I tried - it is magic. The writing, the gags, the characters - OH MY GOSH - is there a funnier group of people around? I don't theenk so. You have Oscar, the proverbial grouch; (reminds me so much of my mother in his insanity, it frightening) ""Don't come crying to me when you want a fuzzy lobster."" Emma, the put-upon wife who has all the qualifications for sainthood; ""Oh, Oscar! Don't leave me! I don't know what I'd do without you....HA, HA, HA! I almost made it through."" Brent, (oh wise one, I bow to you) the station owner; ""You have to admit, I do have a certain shirt powers."" Hank, his best friend; ""Maybe if you guys would heckle me, I could learn some snappy comebacks."" Davis and Karen, the Chief of Police and the rookie; Karen: ""I don't think you should try scalping."" Davis: ""Why? Because I'm a Cree man?"" Karen: ""No, because scalping's illegal."" Lacey, the newbie at the Ruby; ""I don't know what magic coffee fairy you all are used to, but here you have to pay for the coffee."" and MY HERO, Wanda - the queen of sarcasm and witty retorts; ""Hey Big Phone! Why don't you answer your big phone!"" Droll, clever, witty, sarcastic, fresh and funny, funny, funny. Do yourself a favor.

I, for one, was never convinced by the idea that the universe would somehow be exclusively populated by Californians.<br/><br/>Okay... so it's not ""deep"" or hardcore sci-fi, and some of the characters are a little 2-dimensional; but it seems to have potential to improve here, and it's just plain enjoyable nonetheless. Thankfully they haven't made the cardinal sin of just ignoring the laws of physics for the sake of a storyline (yes Fringe, I'm looking at *you*), and the level of comedy seems well balanced.<br/><br/>Definite overtones of Firefly, also maybe a bit of SG1 and possibly even shades of Farscape (without the aliens).

1025,Killjoys, Good banter but dull otherwise,"I'm in the middle of the fourth season. Is this really a scifi show? It's hard to tell aside from the shiny gadgets. Certainly not the space opera it wants to be. The only clues that this is a show that takes place in a space-age era are the occasional blips of space and spaceships. Otherwise, it feels like it all takes place in a pretty small world.<br/><br/>If you want to believe regardless that this a space show, all that goes out the window when you see things like a slow and drifting space capsule somehow find a planet in some far-off system in mere days, somehow not burn up in the atmosphere, and crash land safely. Distant stars are mere hours away while closer ships are days away??? It just depends on the laziness of the writers in resolving plot stuff.<br/><br/>Speaking of lazy writers, I'm tired of ultra-super-human geek characters that are at least 100 times more unrealistic than your average action hero that survives an impossible number of fights. Got a sticky plot situation? Don't worry, just put a computer hacker on it and all your problems will go away in just a few minutes. Such laziness in writing is boring to the point of offensive.<br/><br/>I find myself not caring about the characters or the story arc. They could live or dies, succeed or fail. Who cares? Thus the character development is obviously weak, as is the plot. I do, however, find the banter to be really well written and well delivered by the main characters. I would just like to see that banter and those characters in a more interesting show. The banter makes this show tolerable and a decent watch when I'm stumped for something better.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,6.0,10 October 2020
1026,Killjoys, Above average,"First, a response to one review which said:""The story was happening in some remote Galaxy, but strangely enough, there is only human in that galaxy."" No, not a galaxy far,far away. A star system reasonably close to Earth, in this galaxy. The first thing that a sci-fi fan needs to get straight is the real astronomy involved. As soon as they start talking about galaxies, you can usually just move on. This series appears to postulate a future in which FTL drive has enabled humans from Earth to move out into the spiral arm of this galaxy, and settle on various planets. While the astronomy of habitable worlds as satellites of a gas giant is stretching it a bit, it works well enough for our purposes. This scenario also appears to be lacking in aliens, indicating that none have (yet) to be encountered. But the real fun is the way that our little crew gets out there and has real adventures. I expect that more background and backfill will add some depth. The griping about poor acting, shallowness and general lack of grand drama is not appropriate to this kind of show. In fact, it's a pleasure to be spared the Grand Themes that plague so much sci-fi on the tube. I am hoping that maybe this show will turn out to be happening in the same universe as Dark Matter, and that our Killjoys get a warrant to go after the Dark matter 6.

1027,Killjoys," Killjoys is great, straight forward sci-fi","Killjoys is part of SyFy's attempt to reclaim science fiction from JJ Abrams and the CW and it is a positive sign of things to come. <br/><br/>The show, about interstellar bounty hunters, is pretty straight forward and fun. Science fiction should have some science elements to it but Killjoys doesn't fall into the trap of trying to be too clever or sciency. The great Sci-Fi series (Star Trek, Stargate, Dr. Who, etc) were always fun first and then added elements of mystery and future science &amp; technology where appropriate - Killjoys definitely follows that tradition, it is a fun, action oriented series first and foremost and any complications, interpersonal issues, mysteries and cool tech stuff never overwhelms the story.

1030,Killjoys, Exposition driven,"Killjoys has a catchy title, good sets and props but sadly, like so many drama's these days, at its heart, its exposition driven. That's fine if you like your sci fi lightweight and action focused. <br/><br/>For myself however, I prefer thoughtful series that challenge assumptions and conventions, whilst offering some excitement and a few good special effects along the way. So once again whilst many sci fi fans like myself hope for a series like Firefly to come along we realize that will probably never be the case.Its a shame too, but that seems to be the direction television in general is heading. Small wonder many of us are reacquainting ourselves with our book collections, which may be no bad thing.<br/><br/>Now then, putting my rant to one side what can I say about Killjoys. Story line is a little different but not unfamiliar, mercenaries in space has been done before. The acting quality is hard to gauge, because as I said, this series is driven by exposition. What there is of it seems fine. The key characters and this is tiresome, always look like catwalk escapees. Not a scar or a greasy follicle in sight. Barely believable given the job they are supposed to do. Five out of ten from me. Now then, where's my Heinlein collection?",70 out of 119 found this helpful.,5.0,24 June 2015
1031,Killjoys, Light space voyage with rich design and characters,"Killjoys is a sci-fi show about two mercenaries who work for a reclamation agency. Their tasks include capturing high priority target and possible termination for some. The show has a mild quality, offering a bit of humor and good chemistry between the leads. It looks respectably nice, the setting is decorated aptly for its multitude areas such as the slums, high end manor and spaceship interiors. While it mostly follows grayish futuristic tone, it sometimes produces vivid setting and costume which make the visual more appealing.<br/><br/>Soon enough the jobs take them into personal territory as some the principal characters' pasts are introduced. This set-up works by implementing small cast at the core while establishing the universe. Hannah John-Kamen as Dutch, the high ranking bounty hunter is a great cast. She has alluring on-screen presence and is quite capable for the role without shedding too much clothes.<br/><br/>Chemistry with other bounty hunters played by Aaron Ashmore and Luke Macfarlane is pretty good as they exchange banters. However, the show could be trapped in stereotypical love interest or family issue premise. The universe has plenty of diversity; each district is depicted with respective ambiance. Lighting and color tint make them easier to identify. While they are not full blown grand spectacle, the show gives enough foundation for the vistas to work.<br/><br/>Design with the props and costumes is presentable, occasionally giving traditional or cooperate vibe. It looks good enough, fitting for a sci-fi show. There are a few questionable aspects such as the slightly underwhelming effect for combat, action could be more polished and the tired use of harrowing pasts for subplots, but for most part Killjoys generates adequate start for fun treks in the future.",52 out of 87 found this helpful.,7.0,20 June 2015
1032,Killjoys," Science experiment, not science fiction","I'm morbidly fascinated by this show. Despite having a terribly low opinion of it, I've seen up to the conclusion of Season 4 (current as of writing this). It feels like a TV show made by artificial intelligence that was trained by non-humanoid aliens.<br/><br/>First, the positives. <br/><br/>The quality of the actors shines. Of note, this show makes good use of Hannah John-Kamen's range by using the multiple personalities trope. Aaron Ashmore's banter with Lucy, the ship, is always fun. Patrick Garrow's character remids me positively of Dr. Rush from Stargate: Universe.<br/><br/>The cinematography is competent, and occasionally stands out as being good. The worlds each have personality, and I feel like I'm surrounded by snobs on Q'resh which speaks positively to their ability to set a tone with sets and visuals. <br/><br/>And now for the rest...<br/><br/>Killjoys has serious pacing problems and somehow manages to be too fast and too slow at the same time. For example, the main storyline is ""Kill The Lady who is trapped in The Green"". What's the Green? Who's the Lady? What does she want? Where did she come from? Why's she trapped there? Four seasons in, I don't know that as a viewer. I'm pretty sure the writers aren't too sure, either.<br/><br/>We should have been done with The Lady in season 1. Finding out that humanity isn't alone blew open the universe and then they did... nothing at all with it. We literally discover that there's a galactic civilization, of which humanity and the Hullen are only parts in, and then... it's never mentioned again. Nope... just more Kill The Lady stuff (not plot).<br/><br/>On the other side of the coin, we have the times where the show tries to move along too quickly. Pip and Zeph's relationship for instance, or D'av and J'aq's. <br/><br/>Pip is introduced as an arrogant, spoiled brat, Zeph starts sleeping with him, his brain grows a spider, and he sacrifices himself to complete the mission. Zeph is devastated...<br/><br/>Except that I don't care. I shoud, because I like Zeph, but Pip hadn't been on the show long enough to make me like him. He certainly hadn't been on long enough to make me feel proud that he grew as a character.<br/><br/>D'av has an alien child and turns into a bumbling idiot in what can only be described as a disgusnting stereotype of concerned fatherhood. If they had put in a throw-away line about the alien nature of the kid influencing D'av, that would have been fine. Three hours after the kid is born, and two episodes after he was introduced, D'av and Jaq are played like we care about their relationship, and that they've had time to bond and share, except that none of that ever happened. Three hours after I had an alien kid, I'd be freaking the hell out *over having an alien kid*. I wouldn't be doting on him while sending him out the door to school.<br/><br/>Finally, the worse part of this show, and why I consider it to be garbage, is that things ""just happen"". About five times per episode, you have to stop and ask yourself ""How did they get here?"" or ""Why are they doing this?""<br/><br/>When it is explained, it's usually with exposition, which isn't a bad thing... except that none of the characters really make you want to listen to what they have to say.",13 out of 18 found this helpful.,2.0,24 September 2018
1033,Killjoys, Campy fun,"This is a very fun, campy space western. It pulls off quite a bit for a low budget, the sets each week do feel genuine- unlike some other shows, every episode doesn't seem to take place in a warehouse or mall. The world building can, at times, seem to take over the character building, although seven episodes in they seem to have struck a happy balance. It's nice to see a variety of female characters who feel dynamic and have power, which is all too often something reserved only for the male characters.<br/><br/>I'm not sold on the background music, at times it can be overpowering and distracting. The intro looks like it came straight out of a late 90s syndicated show. These are largely cosmetic complaints, though. I'm hoping it will stick around, although I'm not sure Syfy understands the potential the show has.",50 out of 86 found this helpful.,8.0,31 July 2015
1034,Killjoys," Terrible start, but gets better and better and better","I'm only writing this review to tell the people: don't get fooled by the first couple episodes. This show looked like trash. A small and skinny woman with no muscles and no hips is supposed to be a badass fighter and so sexy. Of course she is black too. Diversity! Yeah. The bossy woman (sorry, the actress wasn't convincing AT ALL at the beginning) has two sidekicks, two good looking man. The first one is the typical nice guy, bff material, the other one is a very manly man, a soldier with a war trauma. Of course there is some sexual tension going on between him and the female lead. To make it short: I wasn't impressed. Slow motion scenes and those cringy one liners while fighting ('I like to dance') weren't helping either. I dropped it after episode two, and came back because I had nothing better to watch. Even though it was stupid, I didn't hate it. Well, so why the high rating? This show surprised me from the very beginning with the great world building. It reminds me a lot of Firefly and Cowboy Bebop. It was so excellent and creative in this area, that I was wondering how they decided to go with such cliche characters. The thing is: those characters aren't cliche. They did an incredible job with developing them over time. The chemistry between all of them is great (it reminds me of Supernatural in that matter), the story itself is one of the most suspenseful I have seen in a while. At the end of the day it's sci-fi fantasy and there may be some plotholes, but overall this is the kind of storytelling that I thought wouldn't exist anymore. It is really, really smart. Everything comes together so well, everything is exciting and suspenseful. The show is not too sexual (like many nowadays), but has some mature dialogues I really enjoy.

Just go with Beverley Hills 90210 with more drugs and sex or whatever. There are a few good concepts where I thought the show might improve. Then the producers just kill it ( killjoys for sure ) with cheap, cheesy sentimentality that belongs to a Spielberg Hollywood drama .

Teach them to always combat this enemy that exists everywhere - and send them out into the world to make irrational illogical decisions that actually strengthen their enemy and turn more people against one another. It's how Vietnam was fought and why the war never ended. Don't go woke.,83 out of 156 found this helpful.,2.0,28 September 2020

1052,Woke, Woke Isn't Wrong,"There are a lot of things Woke does right. The cinematography/directing is great; they definitely had a vision and created it. From the color palette to the shots themselves. I particularly like the costume design as well, adding a bit more to each character style.<br/><br/>Where the show seems to falter is the foundation it's based on. The lessons are very heavy handed, which you might expect from the title ""Woke"" but they still seem to hit you over the head with them. Perhaps to drive them home but it does seem a bit overdone.
The writing is okay but I actually find the supporting characters to be the most compelling and entertaining. Blake and T Murph nail their on screen relationship and it's hilarious.<br/><br/>All in all I would consider this a good watch with the homies and a harmless way to approach deep issues about American society as a minority.

Certainly not by sitting around - experiencing nothing new, thinking about nothing challenging, talking about nothing uneasy, thereby learning nothing.

1070,Woke, It's eh,"As I only checked this show out because I heard some parts were animated, and that I wanted to check out a new live-action sitcom as well, I was pretty sold on the idea of a live-action/animation hybrid, and yeah this was just okay in my opinion.<br/><br/>I do like the supporting cast. Anaya, Clovis, Adreinne, and Gunther all bring something to the table. Like with Duncanville, while I enjoy the other Harris family characters, but not the titular character, I just can't get past the main character. He's so all over the place you just can't care for him. TAnd it's not just Keef. When they don't focus on the hallucinations with the animations and Keef going mentally nuts it works. It's when you have episodes like the one where he's stuck on the bus with all those koala-shill pricks that I think it just derails the story.<br/><br/>The episode with Keef stuck on the bus is just ass because everyone on the bus was freaking obsessed with a Koala. And the only thing Keef was worrying about was the lawyer, when there was nothing he could do about it. There's good social commentary being made there, but it's not great when everyone's just an ass the whole time. Even his roommates didn't even try to stand up for him, and that's just bad writing in my opinion. And while I knew the cop was faking it in the finale, it felt like the ending was a bit too safe, as I would have rather had a potential cliffhanger, but there's a possible cliffhanger between Keef and Adrienne that might have me reeled in?<br/><br/>Would I watch a second season if it was renewed? Maybe. It was surprisingly alright and I would likely only watch it just to see what the supporting cast does. Plus season 2 will likely tie the ends of the court story with Officer Wyatt and Keef, so that should be interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, Woke is definitely messy, tame, and not very compelling. I was never fully hooked on it, but I enjoyed it more than Crossing Swords. Hulu's worst original I've seen so far. Season 2 needs to do better at compelling me on Keef, and I know this show can be much better if it focuses more on comedy and commentary. I assumed they would nail the social commentary, but I was left pretty bored and not very awed.<br/><br/>5/10",21 out of 48 found this helpful.,5.0,13 September 2020

This is one of those rare treats and you have to hope that its audience finds it while this absolute miracle is still on the air. These people trust their maddest impulses and what you get is not only hilariously funny but also outrageously original and profoundly entertaining. Just when you think you know who these characters are they stun you with another of their many hidden ""facets"". Chloe (Krysten Ritter) is always in danger of running away with this one -- you just almost never see a performance this outrageously over-the-top that is also so beautifully nuanced ... but not so fast -- June (Dreama Walker) can turn it way, way up at any time and so can James Van Der Beek -- or possibly anyone in this all-pro cast -- who knows?",72 out of 86 found this helpful.,10.0,4 May 2012
1077,Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, Don't Trust The Bastards who control network television,"I must have been doing some research on Krysten Ritter after watching VAMPS, I suppose that's how I found it. The title's catchy and gives an idea of what to expect. I'm a sucker for Krysten anyway, I have loads of her movies, although most of them weren't originally bought with her in mind, but she happened to be in CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC, SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE... And I thought it odd that such a striking girl was always second-string. So I jumped at the chance for the complete box-set of DON'T TRUST THE B---- IN APARTMENT 23. I had the notion that it would be popular with me. That it might be very cute. I had high hopes for it. Wow, what I didn't expect was that it would skyrocket to the highest echelons of my own hit parade. I am currently just finished with the first disk, so I'm not a fully-fledged expert yet, but real glad about that, I have only waded in, there is still a glorious pool of fun to paddle in. Wow!<br/><br/>Krysten Ritter is absolutely 100% perfect as Chloe, the titular wild girl. Dreana Walker is the perfect patsy as June, who has got to be the cutest nerd in the world. And James Van Der Beek is a must-see in this hilarious send-up of himself. The whole thing is pure genius. I am just fortunate to have it on DVD, in sequence, as it was meant to be seen, as I hear the network really messed about with it, from start to finish, airing it wrong, and cancelling it prematurely.<br/><br/>""I don't think that's a good idea,"" to quote that little cartoon girl at the end.<br/><br/>My highest recommendation.

1080,Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, Love This Bitch,"The first episode is confusing and scary because Chloe's personality is simply so foreign and her behavior so carelessly wicked. However, as one adjusts to the idea of Chloe, James, and June, the more affectionate one grows of them.<br/><br/>Chloe is the exciting NYC ""it"" girl with an amusingly self-absorbed celebrity BFF, James Van Der Beek. The story begins when June, a naive, hopeful girl, moves in as Chloe's new roommate. Throughout, June questions different aspects of Chloe's rejection of human qualities, and Chloe, in return, questions June's naiveté/boringness. Through Chloe, June learns to be a little more city-smart and life-savvy, and through June, Chloe takes baby steps towards humanization. While the framework may not strike as being particularly impressive, the situations and personalities employed in each installment are lovably whimsical, and surprisingly escape oversentimentality.<br/><br/>One should treat these characters truly as characters and accept that everything will be exaggerated, maybe stereotyped, though faintly resonating with reality. It will be helpful to have an idea and a humored opinion of New York City, Indiana/Midwest, American celebrities, and Japan to appreciate the humor of Don't Trust the B----.<br/><br/>This show is goofy, sassy, young, and charming, and for those who crave a short comedy series that's girly but not ""too"" girly, I recommend it a try.

1081,Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, Friggin' hilarious. Too bad it got cancelled.,"An already cancelled, in the middle of its second season, gem from ABC. It has been quite unsuccessful, but it is, indeed, one of the finest sitcoms to come out in recent years and will probably end up as something of a cult item in years to come (hopefully it'll get a DVD or Netflix release so others can catch on). Dreama Walker stars as a Midwestern girl moved to NYC to work on Wall Street, a job which she immediately loses. She moves in with socialite Krysten Ritter, who at first is just planning to scam her out of her money. When Walker outsmarts her, the two form a tenuous friendship, which is often tested by Ritter's spoiled demeanor. Perhaps the greatest well of jokes comes from the third major character of the show, Ritter's best friend James Van Der Beek of Dawson's Creek fame. That's the actual actor James Van Derk Beek, playing himself as a washed up stud desperately clinging to his fame (in the second season, his whole arc concerns an appearance on Dancing with the Stars). Van Der Beek hilariously goes along with whatever self-deprecating silliness that's written for him any given week. Ritter and Walker are both great in their roles, too. The show is very goofy. One might say cartoonish, which is appropriate since creator Nahnatchka Khan was one of the main writers on American Dad!, which, in my opinion, is still one of the funniest shows on television. Paired with another ABC black sheep, Happy Endings, I don't know if I could handle watching those two shows back to back - seriously, I might have died laughing. Highly, highly recommended. Keep a watch out for it on video or streaming (some episodes are on Hulu, maybe all of them on Hulu+).",36 out of 46 found this helpful.,,17 February 2013

In being regular, the plot has the opportunity to be wayward and full of mischief, something that is taken advantage of perfectly. <br/><br/>With a dazzling and promiscuous female lead causing problems for her underdog companion, many people will be turned off by this type of comedy, but it certainly has its place among my peers.

During the brief time that it aired, week in and week out it its quality and comedic chops never wavered. The show put the stunning Krysten Ritter on the map and deservedly so. Her Chloe is a combination of Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly and an absurdly obvious scammer. The contrast between Chloe and Ritter's most recent score, Jessica Jones is remarkable. Dreama Walker, as June the naive Indiana girl, is the perfect counterpoint to Chloe. She's nice, earnest and can barely keep up with Chloe's schemes and cons many of which she's the victim of. Then there's James Van Der Beek, playing a hyper insecure, egotistical version of himself. His story arc involving Dancing with the Stars and the rivalry with Dean Cain gets funnier as it goes along. Of course in a stroke of fiction becoming reality, the Beeker is indeed on DWTS this season. Where is Dean Cain when we need him?

1096,Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, one word... AWESOME!,"I was turned off by the title. I don't like titles that sound negative or crass. <br/><br/>So when I decided to randomly watch it one day when i couldn't watch it. I WAS INSTANTLY HOOKED. Its become my most favorite TV show to watch and its the type of show where I can watch the episodes over and over and over again.<br/><br/>The show it like a fresh air. Its So FUN, surprising, quirkly. Its SO NEW YORK. Its breakfast at tiffany's ACTUALLY fun &amp; modern. really good pace timing wise but HILARIOUS!<br/><br/>It think its so relatable to New Yorkers because we all know a crazy girl like chloe or we are that crazy girl. Or we're that innocent thing that tries so hard to make it out here do the right thing but something or someone comes n our lives and changes that.

I also love the the little shocks that come all the way through. It makes me laugh as hard as I do when watching 2 and a Half men did and still does. Chloe and Junes character run beautifully together, even though I wasn't a regular Dawsons Ck watcher, I love the idea of having real characters.

1098,Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23, Why This Is The Next Best Comedy,"After watching the Pilot of Don't Trust the B---- In Apartment 23, I was hooked. This show is funny, sassy, and extremely entertaining. In addition, it received mostly positive reviews from critics.<br/><br/>Some people (critics as well as people I know) have said that it is a bad show because it ""lacks in taste"" and the heroine is ""a bad person and a con artist"". But here's the thing: this is NOT a show for little children. There's no need to make the main characters perfect do-gooders. I think that adults and young adults shouldn't have a hard time distinguishing a good person from a bad person, but I guess there are still people out there that can't seem to do so. <br/><br/>This show is honest, raw, and hilarious. The casting is great and there's a fun group of characters. <br/><br/>Chloe is the B in Apartment 23. The actress that plays her, Krysten Ritter, has excellent comedic timing and seems to know her character inside and out. Chloe is a con artist that puts advertisements asking for roommates on the web, but once they move in, she leaves them paying for the rent and makes sure they leave within a month by being the worst roommate ever.<br/><br/>And then there's June. June Colburn, played by Dreama Walker, is the smart, small-town girl that comes to NYC after being hired to work for a major mortgage company that comes with a huge apartment. But when the company is shut down by the government, June loses her apartment and ends up moving in with Chloe. <br/><br/>At first, Chloe tries to get June to move out, but June proves to be too clever to be out-smarted by the B in Apartment 23, and ends up living there as the two girls become good friends. <br/><br/>The cast is complete with Chloe's best friend, an actor playing a fictional version of himself (James Van Der Beek), a neighbor obsessed with Chloe (Liza Lapira as Robin), and June's boss (until she can get a new job), the manager of a coffee shop (Eric Andre as Mark Reynolds).<br/><br/>Another thing unique to this show is the amount of twists and turns, a plot element typically reserved for mysteries and dramas. An example of this is when Chloe sets June up on a date with a man that seems perfect for June, but little does June know that that man is Chloe's father! And if that weren't enough, when Chloe tells June her parents are separated, implying divorce, it turns out they were taking a temporary split for 3 days! And once again, if THAT wasn't enough, Chloe's mom is in a wheelchair. <br/><br/>Lastly, the set is great and the vibe of the city is perfectly matched with the spunky and quirky cast. <br/><br/>If you still don't like this show after knowing all this, well...to each his own.",16 out of 27 found this helpful.,10.0,29 April 2012
1099,Hightown, I live in this community and I work with addicts. It's closer to the truth than you think.,"I guess you could say that I am a ""townie"". I grew up and live on Cape and I work in addiction recovery. Once you get beyond the language and the sexual situations, you are left with 2 stories, the fictional murder/cop drama and the very real story of addiction and recovery which is messy and hard and has a lot of setbacks. It is an important story to tell and I am glad they are telling it even if it's uncomfortable for some people to watch. It's also important to see that this is a very bad problem even if you live in what would be considered an affluent community. Opiate addiction is a very bad problem here on Cape.

1106,Hightown, You guys do realize it's called HIGHTown right,"It's Called HIGH town for a reason. I'm not sure if other reviewers realize it's a show that revolves around characters who have been affected, in one way or another, from the opiate crisis. So, why all the complaints about the drug use and fault it for showcasing how hard the process of recovery actually is. As well as showcasing how sad and depressing addiction is. The process of Recovery, just like the process of addiction, doesn't happen overnight - it's a long grueling process with lots of highs and lows as well as setbacks and relapses. So, I can excuse it for focusing the majority of its attention on it. It's bleak yes, but so is addiction and recovery. They're no walk in the park. Also, Cape Cod is very LGBTQ friendly, both in real life, and on the show. Hating on it for these two reasons alone is where we end up seeing 99% of the complaints thus far. Nudity is also a reality (especially in beach/party town such the Cape. I do agree with others about how some of the side stories feel like different shows in some scenes, but I can tell that it's just trying to introduce all the main characters, and there are quite a bit of them. Only one Episode has aired so far, so I wouldn't be so quick to judge the entire series based on one episode alone; even though I too didn't find it to be the most entertaining episode in the world either. Nothing really hooked me and there was no cliffhanger to keep me wanting to come back; however, unlike other reviewers, I'm not going to trash it solely based on sex &amp; drug use, nor will I trash it for taking its time. I'll wait to see if it gets better, but so far it's pretty by the books, and not all that interesting...yet. And yes, there is a murder, which several of characters will be involved in in one way or the other, so we still have that crime solving aspect to look forward to. I'll admit it does take a back burner to the opiate crisis; though, what do you expect from a show called HIGHTown? It's going to be about drugs people. It says it right there in the title. For the people criticizing an actress for taking a role as a lesbian drug addict, instead of portraying the same character they associate the actress with is ridiculous.

1107,Hightown, One of the best shows this year?,"Looking at the ratings and am a bit befuddled. I too thought I would hate this show. I just saw a lot of red flags and thought they were going to rub agendas in your face left and right. Something about the marketing got my attention and I gave one episode a try.<br/><br/>Made it to the end of the first one. Ok, I actually want to watch the second. It got better! Went to the third! This doesn't suck! I'm impressed!<br/><br/>Unlike many other shows, they don't try to rub the agenda in your face and preach. It's the character, they let it be known and there are no surprises. I like that, a lot. They also don't bash the straight characters on the show or make one a caricature bad guy, which I also like.<br/><br/>Monica Raymund is a stellar as the lead playing the flawed drug addicted ""fish cop"" Jackie Quinones, definitely a catch. She definitely has a future in the movies. James Badge Dale is great as Detective Ray Abruzzo; anyone going back will remember him also playing a State Trooper in The Departed, so it's funny to see him back as a Statie after what happened in that movie. Atkins Estimond has a deeper than expected role as Osito, who at first comes across as a simple thug but turns out to be wiser than he seems.<br/><br/>I'd say this is one of the best shows I've ever seen, I hope more people give it a chance and it gets renewed.

The Cape Cod setting is a nice change of pace, and the show does an excellent job of setting itself apart from your usual big-city cop show. I think this show will do great if given the right exposure, I just hope it doesn't get lost amongst the Starz audience who seems to mostly be interested in period pieces.

1125,Diff'rent Strokes, Diff'rent Strokes Was An 80s US Sitcom Classic,"Diff'rent Strokes was and still is regarded by many as not just one of the most successful sitcoms in TV history but one of the very few, which succeeded due to the multi-racial cast of Conrad Bain as Philip/Mr Drummond, Dana Plato as Kimberley, Todd Bridges as Willis, and the lovable scamp, Gary Coleman as Arnold Jackson. The performances given by the main leads in Diff'rent Strokes was great, particularly Conrad's as the strict but fair, Mr Drummond. Mrs Edna Garrett played by Charlotte Rae was funny, charming and witty and a great addition to the cast. But the star of the show was Coleman as Arnold and his famous catchphrase 'whatcha talking'about Willis?'.<br/><br/>Even though it was a sitcom, the show wasn't afraid of tackling and addressing social and controversial issues such as child molestation, racism, bulimia, class division and sex for example. The writing was funny but also sharp, witty and clever. Arnold has arguably the best and funnier lines out of all the characters, although Philip isn't that far off either. <br/><br/>He was one of the reasons why Diff'rent Strokes was such a huge success story, as Coleman's comic timing was almost spot-on. The cutesy factor that accompanies his cheeky and somewhat mischievous persona as Arnold was a huge incentive on his part.<br/><br/>There have been many sitcoms past and present, which centred around youngsters as the main protagonists, but whilst most of them have tried they have failed, mainly because one of the reasons for this is that those shows do not possess a central character as humorous, as versatile as Arnold and of whom has a personality of which viewers can fall in love with straight away. <br/><br/>Diff'rent Strokes didn't have just one but three child characters in Kimberly, Willis and Arnold. The concept was original and addressed the issue of child adoption in a straight-to-the-point manner but at the same time combine laughs with clean cut jokes, good gags and great humour. It's such a shame though that the notoriety of the show, in regards to the child performers was always brought up; likewise Coleman's own brushes with the law and surprising fall from grace, Todd's battle with drugs, and the rather unfortunate and well documented demise of Dana and her subsequent death during the late 90s, slightly tarnished the mainstream success, as well as history of Diff'rent Strokes. Next year in 2008, it will be the 30th anniversary of Diff'rent Strokes, since its debut in 1978. <br/><br/>All in all though, this was a great little sitcom, starring a little guy with a big heart played by Coleman which was destined to be a big hit, which it was and one that captured millions of audiences hearts, worldwide.",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,9.0,23 August 2007
1126,Diff'rent Strokes, Makes me Wish I didn't know the truth!,"Watching the true Hollywood story on E! about the cast of Different Strokes was heartbreaking, after all, two of the three cast members had substance abuse problems and the star, Gary Coleman, had problems with his parents that he sued them. It's sad to watch the show, I wish I didn't know Dana Plato's problems because now I see how much she wanted her life to be like Kimberly Drummond. Conrad Bain was great as the father figure of the show. Of course, he was supposed to only be acting but I think he became a paternal figure to those youngsters. We went Mrs. Edna Garrett played by the wonderful Charlotte Rae who got her own show without all the drama of Different Strokes. She escaped it. I never approved of them dissing Dixie Carter for Mary Ann Mobley. I like them both in the role as the second Mrs. Drummond. Of course, there was the guest appearances of First Lady Nancy Reagan preaching against drugs. How little did we know the truth? Gary Coleman never escaped the image of the chubby cute kid on Different Strokes. Dana Plato who is gone to a better place never did get to experience the life of Kimberly Drummond except when she was on the set. I only wish Todd and Gary best for their future. I only wished that the off-screen drama was cut down for their sakes.

1127,Diff'rent Strokes, A sitcom classic that is still adored by millions of fans throughout the world today,"' Diff'rent Strokes ' is undoubtedly a sitcom classic, one of those hugely popular television shows that is still adored by millions of fans throughout the world today.  Through regular reruns a whole new generation is being introduced to the antics of the Park Avenue bunch, a bunch who so entertainingly captivated us all during the show's initial screening between 1978-86.<br/><br/>The family friendly series made a star out of Gary Coleman, forever immortalised as the loveable scamp with the chubby cheeks, Arnold Jackson, and his catchphrase ""Whatchu Talkin' About?"" made television history.  Yet despite it's cosy sitcom settings, ' Diff'rent Strokes ' was not afraid to address sensitive issues and during it's long run expertly dealt with the likes of racial prejudice, child molestation and bullying.<br/><br/>Conrad Bain, a distinguished actor who had earlier appeared in tv's ' Maude ' played Trans-Allied tycoon Phillip Drummond, the kindly widower who adopted the Jackson kids from Harlem, Arnold and Willis ( Todd Bridges ), after their death of their mother Lucy who had served as his housekeeper. The kids had to adjust to living in a swank Park Avenue penthouse with a new housekeeper ( initially Charlotte Rae as Edna Garrett, spun off into her own sitcom, ' The Facts Of Life ') and a teenage sister ( Dana Plato ) - cue plenty of comical misadventures!<br/><br/>Bain, Coleman, Bridges and Plato were a formidable team and you cannot help but warm to their likeable characters.  They were wonderfully supported by the likes of Rae, the late Nedra Volz ( so funny in the 1985 movie ' Moving Violations ' ) and Mary Jo Catlett as  housekeepers Edna Garrett, Adelaide Brubaker and Pearl Gallagher.<br/><br/>Once ' Diff'rent Strokes ' ended the young cast were unable to escape the pressures of fame and their various scrapes with the law somewhat tarnished the show's image.  The lovely Dana Plato for one sadly passed away in 1999 due to a suspected drugs overdose.<br/><br/>2003 will mark the 25th Anniversary of ' Diff'rent Strokes ' and I would hope that a reunion of sorts is on the cards.

1128,Diff'rent Strokes, One of the best older shows.,"Since I wasn't around when the show originally aired, I have to catch it whenever I can on Nick at Nite or TV Land. And since TV Land just showed a 48 hour fandemonium marathon, I was able to catch a lot of episodes.<br/><br/>
I absolutely love this show. The plot approach is different which works out great. The writing and quick comedy is terrific and the acting is one of a kind. The writing that was given to Gary Coleman was unbelievably hysterical, and being such a young kid at that time, he handled it so well. While I like the entire cast and think that they all did a nice job, I must say that I especially like Todd Bridges. I don't know, there's just something about him that you can't help but like. <br/><br/>This show like all shows has its moments where the plots could use some improvement but what show would it be if it didn't have its moments? Overall, the eight seasons are filled with the better episodes.<br/><br/>'Diff'rent Strokes' scared me a little during the seventh and eighth seasons when they hauled in Danny Cooksey and Dixie Carter/Mary Ann Mobley to join the Drummonds. I think that it would have been better off leaving the family as it was. Then again, the boys were getting older, they lost their afros, and Kimberly started to move on. So, it's kind of a tricky situation.<br/><br/>I would really like to see a reunion but it would be a little hard without the sadly missed Dana Plato. All in all, this show was an above average, very funny, good family get-together show.

1129,Diff'rent Strokes, Gary Coleman made this show......when lasted eight seasons and 189 episodes,"During my days as a kid,and partly through my high school years as well,this show was just that: The brainchild of Gary Coleman. Coleman made millions off this series,and when the show left the airwaves in 1986(and its repeats in syndication),it was totally discarded forever,never to be heard from again,despite of what the people may say about this show and the fate of its cast including Todd Bridges(who played brother Willis),and the sudden death of Dana Plato(who played big sister Kimberly),and also from Conrad Bain(who played the widower Mr. Drummond) who was a regular on TV's Maude before coming to this series.<br/><br/>If someone would come up to you on the street,they would asked ""What you talking about?"" in the form of that question.<br/><br/>Interesting point about this show: It started off as a show called ""Milk"" on the NBC network before it became a series. ""Diff'rent Strokes"" when it premiered on November 3,1978 became one of the network's biggest hits scoring in the top ten of the Nielsens during its astounding seven year run on the Peacock Network and made Gary Coleman a huge megastar. NBC canceled this series on May 4,1985 after 170 episodes.<br/><br/>Also Mr. Drummond would get married in the show too during the 1984-1985 season to Maggie McKinney(played by Dixie Carter before going on to ""Designing Women"",which was on a rival network),and also bringing in her son Danny as Arnold's other brother(played by Danny Cooksey-who would go on to star opposite Scwarzenegger in Terminator 2,and also do voice-overs for children's shows) Also,Janet Jackson would appear as Willis' girlfriend Charlene during the 1981-1983 season(which during this time Miss Jackson did have a hit album out along with this series at that time). Shavar Ross was Arnold's best friend Dudley. When the show was canceled by NBC on May 4,1985 there were several cast changes. Mary Ann Mobley replaced Dixie Carter on the show and also gone were Pearl(Mary Jo Catlett). On September 27,1985,the show moved to ABC-TV where 19 new episodes were produced before the network finally canceled it on March 7,1986 after 189 episodes.<br/><br/>This was a grand series that spawned two spin-offs,the short-lived situation comedy series ""Hello,Larry"",and another successful series ""The Facts of Life"",which would go on to become NBC's longest-running and successful series from 1979-1987.<br/><br/>If it comes back on the air,its worth seeing.",14 out of 23 found this helpful.,,8 June 2000
1130,Diff'rent Strokes, Easily The Best Family Sitcom Ever Produced!,"I know that this may seem like a bold statement, but it is true. Well, to me it is. After reading this review, you will respect my opinion and see why I think this is the very best.<br/><br/>Diff'rent Strokes became an instant success in the late 1970s as it was dealing with racism and a multicultural family. Having taken inspiration for some episodes seen in Good Times, Diff'rent Strokes tackled these episodes with, sometimes, better results than in Good Times. The issue of racism was more complex in Diff'rent Strokes because there was whites involved too. Multicultural families are still somewhat rare today, so Diff'rent Stokes is a good thing to learn from in that respect.<br/><br/>Diff'rent Strokes is about highly successful businessman and widower, Phillip Drummond, (Conrad Bain) who adopts his late housekeeper's two black sons, Willis and Arnold Jackson (Todd Bridges, Gary Coleman) from Harlem. Together, them and Drummond's daughter, Kimberly (Dana Plato) live the lap of luxury in a penthouse on Park Avenue. <br/><br/>Conrad Bain is a real actor who has done more stage work and who just finished the sitcom, Maude. He does an amazing job playing a wonderful and loving father. You can tell that he truly loves his family. He may be just an actor, but I can feel him. He may be the breadwinner of a filthy rich family, but he is strict and firm with his children. He isn't like any rich father these days that spoils their kid rotten and raises ungrateful brats. If I had a different father, I would want Mr. Drummond. When I have kids, I will be patterning myself after my own dad and Mr. Drummond.<br/><br/>Gary Coleman quickly stole the show as the extremely cute and adorable one. His huge cheeks, big eyes, low height and wisecracks made him a huge success. Everybody wanted to see the lovable Arnold Jackson. His quote ""Whatchu talking' 'bout...?"" has become an immortal catchphrase that many people imitate without even knowing that Coleman started the it. He was so great, more episodes were being shifted towards him and he became the one that carried the show. In the later seasons, if there was not an episode about Arnold, then Arnold would be the sole opposite that character. As a kid, he was severely overworked, sometimes doing 12 hour work days. Plus there was regular school stuff on top of it. It was different for somebody else like Henry Winkler doing Happy Days, he was a full-grown man with a formal education. Coleman was just a child. He grew sick of the show and sick of his phrase. His parents and agent used up all his money and he had to sue them. Coleman never touched drugs or anything, but he developed anger issues and had to go to court at times. Poor guy. But Arnold still is the best TV kid of all time. He's cute, hilarious, smart, witty, even his serious bits are awesome. VH1 ranked Coleman the greatest child star of all time. I very much agree that he is.<br/><br/>Todd Bridges is a wonderful big brother figure. As great as Drummond is as a father, that is how Willis is as a brother. Willis is one of those popular, rebellious, girl-chasers that's been seen in many sitcoms, but Todd Bridges was one of the first to do so. He is awesome. Dana Plato is just as great as Willis, but is a more straight-laced, daddy's girl. But she still is a wonderful big sister. Late in the show, she became pregnant and was written off. Her and Todd both had many run- ins with the law and became huge drug-addicts. Both at rock-bottom, Plato committed suicide via drugs, but Todd was able to pull himself out and become normal again. Gary's, Todd's and Dana's miserable lives became known as the Diff'rent Strokes Curse. But that does not change how good they were on the show and how great their characters were.<br/><br/>Diff'rent Strokes also has a fair share of celebrity appearances. Charloote Rae is the first housekeeper in the show who leaves part way through season 2 to do The Facts of Life, taking place at Kimberly's school. Janet Jackson is reoccurring as Willis' steady girlfriend, Charlene. Due to her singing career taking off, was faded out. Mr. T appears in an episode and helps Arnold see within himself. That was cool. Designing Women's Dixie Carter plays Drummond's wife, Maggie in seasons 6 and 7, but left for Designing Women full time. Maggie's son, Sam (Danny Cooksey) was a fine addition, I think he was used to replace Gary Coleman's cuteness since he was growing up. Sam was good, but no Arnold. Cooksey has gone on to do movies and play in rock bands. <br/><br/>Because the family was multicultural, there was issues from all walks of life that are talked about. Some have been done in every family show, but Diff'rent Strokes shows no mercy in how they show them. Most shows are afraid to show the true dangers of drinking and other bad habits, not Diff'rent Strokes. Some episodes are so bad and were so controversial that Conrad Bain had to do brief intros giving a warning for parental discretion to be strongly advised. They are known as ""very special episodes."" Two part ""specials"" include subjects about molestation, dangers of hitchhiking, and kidnapping. Other shocking episodes include bulimia, epilepsy and drinking and driving. Most are meant to put scares into children and make them think twice, and good thing they do! Even adults may feel uneasy with these episodes. There's so many life-lessons learned on this show, and not all of them are shocking. Some are nice and funny. <br/><br/>Fine acting, wonderful characters, and episodes that have strong and lasting impacts are why I find this to be the best family show ever.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,22 January 2015
1131,Diff'rent Strokes, Tender sitcom shadowed by a macabre reality.,"Who would think that the main characters from a naive, tender, family show would end up meeting such fatal fates? Well, that's another story.<br/><br/>""Diff'rent Strokes"" is an important sticom in American pop culture and also paved the way for comedy shows with a social message inserted.<br/><br/>Here, the inter racial situations mixed with poverty and social clichés were the spinal cord for the plot and even in jokes. Everything was extremely well done and executed with class. Nothing was vulgar or tried directly to impose a criteria; the situations were just put for the audience to judge it whatsoever they wanted.<br/><br/>The jokes were sometimes naive but always witty. The humor was family oriented but after nearly 30 years, none of them is boring. Sure, society has changed a lot but some things just can't disappear.<br/><br/>The acting is top notch. Gary Coleman is now some sort of cult hero for displaying a physical illness and being part of a social minority but his comedic skills and histrionic abilities make him one of the most likable child stars ever. Conrad Bain was excellent as the protective, tender but strong man that took care about his house. Dana Plato was extremely sexy, hot; she's the kind of girl I wanted to marry.<br/><br/>Anyways, watch this sitcom in order to witness part of America's pop culture talking about television.

1134,Diff'rent Strokes, NBC's flagship of lame.,"There was an era on NBC where every show was lame except for the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson. Of all of those shows, this show was the flagship of lame. Sub-standard writing, horrible acting and a script built around one unfunny catch phrase: ""What you talking about Willis?""<br/><br/>Of course, over the years, there were many variations, ""What you talking about Dad?"", ""What you talking about Kimberly?"", ""What you talking about Mrs. Garrett?"", and then there's the ultimate creative variation, ""What you talking about 'insert name of guest star of the week'?""<br/><br/>Secondly, has Conrad Bain ever been on a show that had any value? Then they surround him with kids who couldn't act their way out of a loosely tied Walmart bag and an old hag with a quivering voice? This is comedy? Worse yet, you can see the child actors often mouthing the lines of their costars while awaiting their canned ""humorous"" reply, or their eyes wandering left to right as they read their poorly written lines from a cue card.<br/><br/>To further the vomit aspect, they bring in friends of Arnold to add to the fun. The annoying little girl crush, the kid in a wheelchair (to posture the show as caring and all inclusive) and his pet gold fish, with which he has heart to heart talks. And as ratings fell through the floor, big name guest stars would be brought in to help salvage the shipwreck.<br/><br/>And of course, as expected each one would be asked, ""What you talking about?""<br/><br/>And yet there seems to be nothing but praise for this steaming pile of canned laugh track sitcom from NBC's era of suck. More than 1 star, seriously? No wonder all the child stars of this show crashed and burned. If it was this pathetic on the surface, I can only imagine how bad things were behind the scenes.<br/><br/>In summary, I could eat a box of Apha-Bits and crap a better script than any episode of this show, 1 star because zero isn't an option.",12 out of 30 found this helpful.,1.0,30 July 2013

I remember one where the old man touts the importance of Affirmative Action after the older boy doesn't make the basketball team because they needed a white kid. Yeah, that happened all the time. Enough to gag a liberal maggot. The cast was maybe the worst in TV history. Gary Coleman was an insufferable, unfunny brat; onscreen and off.

1136,Diff'rent Strokes, American Masterpiece,"""Diff'rent Strokes"" ranks among a handful of masterpieces that have made their debuts on American television.  So powerful and three-dimensional are its characters that it puts lesser works such as the over-bloated mini-series ""Roots"" to shame.  ""Strokes"" hit the airwaves like a bombshell back in 1978; most of its viewers had yet to see the harsh realities of the ghetto depicted on the small screen.  Before their eyes, they noticed two hard-edged African-American street urchins in a highly competitive game of basketball (these scenes were no doubt a key influence on the works of future African-American filmmakers Spike Lee and the Hughes Brothers). This no doubt awoke white America to the grittier, more nihilistic aspects of the urban community.  If that wasn't reality enough, the children are taken aback by the presence of wealthy WASP Mr. Drummond(who despite such class and ethnic differences is miraculously able to relate to the youngsters without resorting to urban slang).  In an act of great compassion, he hugs them and decides to save them from depravity in a modern-day Dante's Inferno.  The threesome soon rejoice as they enter Drummond's slick limo and take off.  Because of his frail demeanor, Mr. D is barely able to wave his driver off yet does so out of desperation. This is a terrific character quirk that genius actor Conrad Bain brings to such a complex role.<br/><br/>Had ""Strokes"" simply stayed on this route, it would've remained a TV classic.  However, nothing prepared audiences for the ground-breaking episode in which pedophilia, of all topics, was presented in such harsh detail.  Actor Gordon Jump blew away all his previous achievements (""WKRP"", Maytag commercials) with his remarkable performance as a seemingly benign old man with a dark, dark secret.  I won't spoil it for you here, but the reaction of the child's father is one of the most heartwrenching and subtle displays of Method acting in recent memory.  A great episode, and one indicative of this landmark series' finest moments.",6 out of 13 found this helpful.,,29 November 2001
1137,Diff'rent Strokes, Rest in Peace Mr. Bain,"*******Seven Out Of Ten Stars*******<br/><br/>The true star of this show, Conrad Bain, died this past January in the year of 2013. In my humble opinion, Bain really held this show together through the years. He was the only cast member to appear in all 180 episodes. And Bain always offered what I thought were the best comedic one liners in the series; and clearly was the most polished actor of anyone that ever appeared on the show. Other highlights of the show included the seemingly unending supply of guest stars: Reggie Jackson, Dorothy Hamill, Nancy Regan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Captain Lou Albano, Muhammad Ali, Milton Berle, and of course, Mr. T. Pretty incredible stuff. Also worth mentioning, is much of the social commentary the writers often tried to weave into the scripts; it didn't always work, but when it was did, it was really touching. Some of the episodes dealt with some pretty adult serious issues: Robbery, sexual abuse, racism, sexism.... it was progressive writing for the time. ""Different Strokes"" has a special place in my mind and in my heart. So God rest Plato, Coleman, and Bain.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,27 March 2013
1138,Diff'rent Strokes," ""Wodju talking about,users?","I hate to burst everybody who loved this show's bubble, but the sad fact is this is arguably one of the worst programmes to ever be unleashed on that box of tricks called a TV. Everything about it was bad, from the flat delivery of the characters they called acting, to Gary Colemans quickly irritating catchphrases that he seemed to say about half-a-dozen times a show. Also noteworthy is the horrible fashion and stupid hair that may have looked good for the 70's but will now provoke more hysterics than anything contained in the so-called ""scripts"".<br/><br/>So now we have realised that it has virtually nothing in the laugh department, what kept people watching for 6 odd years? What it the lead's height problem? The ""catchy"" theme tune? The disbelieving state of mind that a programme so awful could take up valuable air time? I have to draw a blank, I'm afraid. All I will say is: if you can survive half an hour of any episode of this without rolling your eyes whenever Arnold does his little routine, cringing whenever Kimberly opened her big fat gob to moan about how unfair life is or feel violently sick whenever Drummond spun yet another of his sentimental philosophies about family unity which always ended in a ""group hug"" then you are a better man than me.",10 out of 26 found this helpful.,,12 February 2003

1142,Diff'rent Strokes, Like a lot of shows that prominently featured children started out good and faded as they grew older.,"I watched this show as a child and I enjoyed it for what it was. However, as the show got older even I could see that Gary Coleman was getting a bit to old for the role and that is of course when they did what every show featuring children who age do. Do they simply end the show gracefully...No! They try to keep the show alive, by interjecting a younger kid to try and bring the cute factor the show once had and lost when the children grew up. They did this on numerous shows, this is one of the few that I actually saw that did it. I watched Brady Bunch a bit when I was a kid, but I have never seen an Oliver episode. This show is about a wealthy guy who takes in the children of a former maid or something. That is about all there is to it. He has a daughter of his own and he raises the children the best he can as they go out in the world and face all of life's little challenges, including a guy who kidnaps young Arnold (Gary Coleman) and Kimberly (Dana Plato) in an episode that was a bit much considering this show was aimed at the family market. I mean you want your child to be safe and all, but you also do not want them becoming fearful and paranoid. They also had one where cute little Sam (the youth interjection) got kidnapped as well. Then they have an episode where they basically try to capitalize on the success of the film ""Ghostbusters"".

1144,Diff'rent Strokes, Different Strokes For Different Folks,"Different Strokes (1978-1986): Starring Gary Coleman, Todd Bridges, Conrad Bain, Charlotte Rae, Dana Plato, Mary Jo Catlett, Danny Cooksey, Mary Ann Mobley, Dixie Carter I first saw Different Strokes sometime in the 80's. Being ages 1-9 in the 80's, I don't recall what year it must have been but if the show ended in 86, it must have been either 85 or 86 when the show was wrapping up. I had no idea it was on as far back as 1978. I recall enjoying the opening song, with its thought-provoking theme: ""Now the World don't move with the beat of just one drum....it takes different strokes to move the world, yes it does..it takes different strokes to the move the world."" During the opening credits, we see Gary Coleman and Todd Bridges looking out of a limo to the vast New York City vista of high-rise buildings.... Nolstalgia! The premise: A wealthy businessman who resides in Manhattan has adopted the children of his late maid. The mixture of black children and white parents must have been new and innovative at the time, like an interracial Brady Bunch. But it seems pretty absurd now, as so many families are interracial. The kids were cute and hilarious. Gary Coleman became a celebrity through this and all subsequent successes was due to his role as Arnold. ""What you talking' bout Willis ?""... The show dared to tackle issues that had never been tackled on TV before like unprotected sex, drugs, gangs and racism. The 80's was full of shows which tackled issues like these and often contained inspirational and educational messages to parents and kids after the show was over. I think it was because the 80's was Reagan's reign and he was a strictly conservative President who launched a lot of anti-drug and celibacy programs at a time when AIDS and drugs were a huge problem. This show was well-written and often moving. Actress Charlotte Rae who played Edna Garrett the maid would later move on to ""The Facts of Life"" yet another popular 80's show.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,,13 April 2006

1152,Save Me, Give it time and you'll be rewarded,"Nelson ""Nelly"" Rowe (<a href=""/name/nm0416694/"">Lennie James</a>) is a popular self-styled womaniser living on a Deptford council estate in London, whose life is turned upside down when he is arrested on suspicion of kidnapping his thirteen-year-old daughter Jody (<a href=""/name/nm8103815/"">Indeyarna Donaldson-Holness</a>) whom he hasn't seen in ten years. After convincing the police of his innocence, and frustrated with the way the case is progressing, Nelly decides to take matters into his own hands and try to track down Jody himself.<br/><br/>From a plot perspective, the first season of Save Me starts very slowly, but what it does do extremely well is build up a background of small details that help establish the milieu as authentic and lived-in. The housing estate in Deptford is essentially a character in itself, and the glimpses of the denizens going about their idiosyncratic ways gives an almost documentarian tone - from the guy doing tai chi on his balcony, to the kids kicking a football at one another, to the young lesbian couple stealing a kiss against a wall, to the meditating Buddhist, to the couple dancing slowly on a basketball court, to the woman in a burka carrying a skateboard, to the older folk watching it all happen day after day, it's a paean to the real lives that people lead in this kind of community. Indeed, one of the most consistent themes is the importance community in general. Elsewhere, the penultimate episode features a 'rape' scene that's exceptionally difficult to watch, but not for the reasons you'd think, and which offers a fascinating portrayal of how potent sexual power dynamics can be.<br/><br/>Lennie James, who also wrote the show, is predictably enthralling, with a simmering rage just below the surface, which is constantly threatening to boil over. <a href=""/name/nm0334318/"">Stephen Graham</a> plays Fabio ""Melon"" Melonzola, a convicted sex offender trying to put the past behind him, bringing his usual chameleonic abilities to a difficult part. <a href=""/name/nm1013087/"">Suranne Jones</a> as Claire McGory, Jody's mother, isn't really given a huge amount to do beyond a few generic scenes as the quintessential worried parent, it she plays the part well, going with subtlety and shock rather than histrionics. Strangely, a subplot involving her husband Barry (<a href=""/name/nm0911395/"">Barry Ward</a>) is inexplicably dropped in the penultimate episode. These missteps notwithstanding, the season is a fine amalgamation of a <a href=""/name/nm0516360/"">Ken Loach</a> warts-and-all tone with a more thriller-esque core that's well directed by <a href=""/name/nm1960322/"">Nick Murphy</a>.<br/><br/>Picking up eighteen months after the end of the first season, the second season, dubbed Save Me Too, also starts with slow early episodes which almost imperceptibly ramp up the tension, and once again, the last two episodes are exceptional. With this season's directorial duties split evenly between <a href=""/name/nm1425385/"">Jim Loach</a> (son of Ken) and <a href=""/name/nm0317328/"">Coky Giedroyc</a>, the show's aesthetic becomes slightly more adventurous (the second episode, for example, is primarily a flashback, whilst other episodes place us more directly in Nelly's head, with a more noticeable sense of subjectivity), but not to the point of distracting from what remains the core of the story - realistic characterisation.<br/><br/>Just as with the first season, the second is far more interested in characters than plot, and once again, James and Graham are exceptional. James goes all-in on Nelly's bull-in-a-china-shop mentality, making the character, if anything, less attractive than he was in the first season. He's still got the twinkle in the eye, but the events of the last year and a half have definitely had an impact on him. Never the most tactful character, his tendency to shout first and ask questions the next day after he's calmed down is even more apparent than before. And although characters such as Clair and Barry drop into the background a little, others come to the fore and help to expand the milieu; there's Tam (<a href=""/name/nm0002076/"">Jason Flemyng</a>), Nelly's kind-hearted cross-dressing friend; Bernie (<a href=""/name/nm8420166/"">Alice Feetham</a>), Melon's conflicted wife; Stace (<a href=""/name/nm0528462/"">Susan Lynch</a>), may or may not be in love with Nelly; Zita (<a href=""/name/nm1326375/"">Camilla Beeput</a>), Nelly's girlfriend; and, especially, Grace (an exceptional and emotionally devastating performance from <a href=""/name/nm2315236/"">Olive Gray</a>), who was once held by the same people who took Jody.",9 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,4 December 2020

I loved most of these people. <br/><br/>The acting is first class. If you are a lover of English dramas you will recognise most if not all of the faces here - they are magnificent. <br/><br/>The various mise en scene: again fantastic. Apparently they decided to shoot on location rather than use a lot of studio shots - and it shows. People on the estate let the programme makers use their flats to film inside, lending this a genuine feel of someone's home, rather than someone's 'idea' of what a council flat looks like. <br/><br/>There are some absolutely beautiful little 'asides' - watch out for the little boy sitting in a blow up boat in the middle of the ashflelt making up a story to amuse himself.

1166,Save Me, Some of Nellie's Blues,"And so yet another story about a missing child and the disappearance's affect on parents, friends and communities. Set in London and with a varied cast of characters, to say the least, this was gritty and at times hard-to-watch drama. Particularly as it drew to its anti-climactic finish, scenes where a teenage boy uses information about the missing child to force the girl's mother into having sex with him and an excruciatingly disturbing auction amongst low-life deviants to buy a little girl might have had some viewers reaching for the off button.<br/><br/>For me, it was all just a little too full on. The main character played by series writer Lennie James answers to the unlikely alliterative fictional name of Nellie and runs about everywhere in a bright yellow bubble jacket. On the face of it a likeable rogue, look deeper and you see a guy casually flitting from woman to woman, mooching favours from all and sundry, who's abandoned his daughter years ago when an out of the blue message from her on his mobile phone before she's abducted sets up the events which follow.<br/><br/>About that varied mix of characters, prominent amongst Nellie's friends is a guy who goes by the name of Melon previously convicted of corrupting an underage girl, only she's stood by him although not without lingering doubts as to his continuing proclivities no doubt as she moves past her own teenage years, a transvestite with a heart of gold, a group of young jeering teenagers who may know more about matters than at first seems, all of Nellie's ex and current girlfriends, including the one who mothered Jodi many years ago and who he's never quite got over and her slightly shady new husband so willing to try anything to erase her memories of Nellie he'll go to loan sharks to get reward money for news on the girl's disappearance.<br/><br/>As usual when these shows play out over 6 episodes, there are several sub-plots, red herrings and false climaxes en route, although I can't deny the last episode was gripping if tough to watch. <br/><br/>The acting was as you'd expect given the subject matter, deadly serious and mostly overdone by all. I found the direction unnecessarily quirky too with surreally strange background scenes inserted just for their weirdness it seemed to me. I also found the dialogue unrealistic in too many scenes for what purportedly was a near-to-real-life drama.<br/><br/>At the end of it all and after watching a slew of similarly themed programmes of late, I was quite drained and glad it was over.<br/><br/>Any happy-go-lucky shows out there just for a change?",14 out of 25 found this helpful.,4.0,22 April 2018

This HBO series shows us a original way to solve this problem, at least from the male point of view.<br/><br/>The great thing about this, is that the main characters, are so flawed and clueless about their own life, yet so human and relentless when life really pushed you against the wall. Impossible not to relate to the Thomas Jane role, who has seen life passed him by again and again. He really gave the role a distinctive masculine tone, but a real one, with all the faults we may have, and not in a depressing way.<br/><br/>The prostitution issue is not really the point of this production, it only set the background, and provides a lot of smiles (because it's definitely not a hysterical laughing comedy).

1175,Hung, Wonderful show,"I had a chance to watch episodes 1 to 4, though I'm living in Germany without HBO and I have to admit, that this show got me hooked from minute one. It's not only the actors who have convinced me - of course especially Thomas Jane, Jane Adams and Anne Heche. Actually, what I really admire is the tone of this show: it could have gotten so ridiculous, so absurd, but it's just funny and at the same time very serious. You are watching a man's struggle for money in order to get a burnt house rebuilt and to get his children back from their kind-of-strange mum, and it's getting to you. You wish this man, Ray Drecker, all the best and many ""customers"" as well as you wish his pimp, Tanya, that she's getting what she's deserved, a bit of appreciation for what she does. I am watching Thomas Jane's career since the stupid but very entertaining ""Deep Blue Sea"" and I enjoy seeing him in this leading man situation.

1176,Hung," Great Cast, Good Story","I don't understand why the other reviewers are being so harsh on this show, especially since there's only been one episode! This is obviously a show that has to be set up first, then it will surely kick into gear and fulfill all expectations. I found the idea of this show to be hilarious, and that's something you have to think about the entire time you're watching it. To think that Thomas Jane's character is a guy that once had everything, to only be forced to survive by becoming a gigolo... It's a pretty funny premise for a show if you ask me. The cast of this show is awesome, and all you can do is root for Jane's character Ray as he struggles to get his life back on track by ""pleasing"" lonely women. In my opinion, you should watch this show with an open mind and don't pay attention to the other reviewers who pride themselves in thinking they are professional critics, because they're probably the same group who thought Entourage wouldn't survive after the first episode.

1179,Hung, The Return of The Punisher,"This show interested me from the subtle title, and when I found out we had The Punisher himself, Thomas Jane, in the starring role, I was a goner, so to speak. After watching the pilot and the first official episode, I would most assuredly say to anyone who would listen: count me in for the duration of this bad boy.<br/><br/>Here we have a great premise - Divorced-with-kids basketball coach whose life is financially on the skids seeks a second income. In the brilliantly and meticulously detailed set-up (aka the pilot), it slowly dawns on our hero's consciousness that his tool is, in actuality, the tool he needs to hopefully drill him out of his financial problem.<br/><br/>With the help of a friend, Tanya (Jane Adams, also perfectly cast), Ray takes the baby steps required to bring his idea to fruition. (She has already sampled his wares and has been extreeeemely impressed.) In the first episode past the pilot, he enlists her help (as his pimp) in getting him some clientele. She comes up with a killer merchandising plan, very involved and thought out, and she has a friend who is a 'professional shopper' for older women, to boot. She suggests she enlist this friend, in the hopes that her shopping clients also need to get laid. There's a hilarious scene where Tanya coaches the coach in the finer points of female seduction, involving more attention to foreplay, compliments and yer basic overall studly conduct while in the field.<br/><br/>Although I loved this scene for the wit of it, I thought it was predictable in the way Tanya's character was saying all women needed tons of foreplay, compliments, blah blah blah, in order to get in the mood. In my experience, all women are hardly like that, and I was thinking the show was leaning toward a far more conventional turn than I wanted. This, however, was thrown out of the game in the next scene, where our SIT (Stud In Training) shows up at the client's door and she turns out to be anything but yer basic conventional female, commanding him from the get-go to do away with the tedious foreplay and compliments and get down to business, which she seemingly does, in every position known to man and the canine world as well.<br/><br/>Thomas Jane is more than up to his challenge here; he comes across as a 'normal guy' thrust into a situation he's not quite comfortable with, and that's the charm at the heart of this brilliantly conceived show. My only hope is that they can - pardon the pun, but it's almost obligatory - keep it up.",21 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,13 July 2009
1180,Hung," Funny, Smart, and Dark","HBO continues to air innovative shows reflecting aspects of life whether they be vampires living in the South, Hollywood hotshots trying to survive show business, a polygamous family, or it's latest concept about a man taking on the oldest profession in the world which is ""Hung."" Ray Drekker (Thomas Jayne) a Detroit high school teacher and basketball coach was once the school's most popular boy with an athlete's scholarship and married the most popular girl in school. All falls apart when he is injured and years later his dream girl wife, Jessica (Anne Heche), leaves him for a well-to-do dermatologist. Being a high school teacher and basketball coach does not pay very well. To make things even worse, his house catches on fire forcing him to live in a tent in his backyard and his twin teenage children move back with their overbearing mother. Ray goes to one of those scam ""get rich quick"" seminars and finds what he is also good at and the ""tool"" he has: sex and very...ahem...""hung."" He meets failed poet and corporate temp, Tanya Skaggle (Jane Adams), and enlists her as his pimp. The two embark on a business they hope will be successful in ""fulfilling"" women with happiness...will they successful? The show reflects on the subject of the economy very heavily and it's about time a show finally did. ""Hung"" is set in the backdrop of the economically beaten down but not out Detroit amidst layoffs and the public school system being federally underfunded. Thomas Jayne is perfect as Ray. He is your typical everyday average Joe trying going through economic hardship and through the profession of male prostitution he begins to have an understanding of women and of the direction of his own life. He continues to go on despite the ex-wife, his uptight next-door neighbor, and the economic hardships. Jane Adams is also wonderful in the part of passive aggressive but insightful Tanya. She doesn't face the same hardships as Ray, but she is lonely and sympathetic. Anne Heche is hysterical at times as Ray's overbearing ex-wife who is also going through hard times when her husband's finances take a huge a hit in the stock market.

His wife leaves him for a guy with money, he's trying to hold everything together and can't seem to find the time or the energy to do so. Eventually, he takes stock of his life, ""wasted"" potential, limited options, poor job, non-existent prospect and he turns to his one asset; his skill as a lover and the fact that he's ""hung"" hence the title of the show. This leads him to prostitute himself.<br/><br/>In the end, his plan goes awry and he finds and unlikely pimp. The pilot sets a great tone and leaves the potential for equal parts comedy and drama.

1182,Hung, Late to the party,"I only discovered 'Hung' when it became one of the Prime offerings on amazon instant video. The pilot felt awkward to me - as if the writers were trying to lay out the basics really clearly, something difficult to do AND sound natural. <br/><br/>After, say, the third episode, I was hooked. Thomas Jane plays Ray Drecker, a beautiful man and has a gorgeous body. But beneath that hunky exterior beats the heart of a great big old puppy dog: eager, sweet, loyal, trusting, and devoted. He's not good with money, he's not the best judge of character, and he's no businessman. Hence, his pimp. <br/><br/>Contrast that to the women around him. Tanya, who at first would seem to have lack the guile to maximize profits in her pimp business (but surprise, surprise), and Lenore, who looks like she could be anyone's trophy wife but is capable of almost any crime as long as she believes she won't get caught. <br/><br/>I knew this would be a GREAT show when I realized it was not about sex. I could see it would be about the challenges of building a business when a woman has very little talent for that. Tanya, Ray's pimp, can only produce baked goods with a gimmicky lagniappe but she talks a good game about the prospects of using Ray's natural well-endowed physique to please women for money. <br/><br/>Even there, her thinking is flawed. As a real pimp tells her, homosexual prostitution is where the money is at. What is she doing trying to find women who will appreciate a roll in the hay with Ray? <br/><br/>Tanya discovers soon enough that another woman, Lenore, will make life more difficult unless Lenore can become a partner in this prostitution business. Watching the women going at each other, fighting over material possessions, money, and even Ray's time, will instantly bring the female viewer back to the high school lunch room where such dramas played out for almost any teenage girl. Over a boy, over a man, over a dog - what's the difference? The skirmishes are the same. <br/><br/>I recommend sticking with the series past the first few episodes to get to the 'good stuff,' which is the birth of the business these characters will share. <br/><br/>One thing I learned from this show is how important the pimp's job is. Without the pimp, a prostitute is awkward, somewhat sleazy, and unprotected. Also, searching for johns seems to me to be a little like looking for a job. You really need to know the right place to go, the right person to talk to. It has to be frustrating and near-impossible to do it on your own if you are a hooker!",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,30 April 2017

Also, Anne Heche can consider herself very lucky to have gotten this gig. She, too, is pleasant in her role as the ex-wife and it has made me forget all her past scandals, something I didn't think could be possible.

1185,Hung," Sounded better than it looked, but still somewhat interesting","The premise of the show was interesting - a well-endowed man using his 'gift' to make extra money when crisis strikes. I hoped it wouldn't be cheesy or clichéd, and thankfully, it wasn't, for the most part.<br/><br/>I guess some of the episodic plots were predictable - man getting used to service unattractive ladies, trying to keep his side job a secret, learning how to please the ladies as a job rather than to get into their pants. Maybe it's part of the selling point of the series, but I found some of the sex scenes too long - it's almost like the producers are using the sex scenes to fill up the time. I actually enjoyed the before/after-sex scenes better, when he's getting to know the women better.<br/><br/>For a series that's about a well-endowed man being a male prostitute, it is surprising that became another subplot rather than the main plot after a few episodes. The other subplots are are interesting - man's relationships with his ex-wife, pimp and children, children's troubles, pimp's relationships, etc, but except for the man's relationships, the rest take up more time than should be expected in a show that's about a part-time male prostitute. I started out rating this 7.5, after the first half of season 1, it has dropped to somewhere between 6 and 6.5.<br/><br/>Once all that is said however, it is still interesting enough to watch on a slow night.

The more sexual encounters Ray has, the more derisive I feel about his ability to please a woman sexually. The show assumes that all women get off in the same way and will pay for it. A more realistic version of this show would be what the show started out portraying: rich, older, lonely, married, women who could afford to pay for an orgasm. Most attractive women nowadays wouldn't even consider such an expense when all you have to do is go down to a local bar and let it be known you're looking for a hookupbut I digress.<br/><br/>For all the talk of liberating women and whatnot by the writers/directors, it's just another opportunity for HBO to show a bunch of T&amp;A, and pretend that all women get off on BigD alone. The plot is mediocre, Tanya is a spazz, and the character development is minimal. But if you like a lot of sex and some humorously awkward situationshave at it hoss. <br/><br/>All that being said, I love Thomas Jane. He's amazing. And the character Lenore is phenomenal.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,7.0,3 March 2014
1190,Hung, Hilarious! Wished it didn't get canceled...,Hilarious show! One of my favorites. This show made me laugh out more than a lot of shows I see today. This is a masterpiece. Wish it didn't get canceled... :(,2 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,31 January 2021
1191,Hung, Not entertaining...,"It's not funny. It's not sharp. It's not witty.<br/><br/>It's predictable. It's slow. It lacks any surprise punch.<br/><br/>Are we supposed to sympathize with Ray? He's not the sharpest guy, but some of the writing makes him not only out and out stupid but also lazy. Not only can he not keep his bills paid on time, but he can't even clean his house.<br/><br/>An example of why you have a hard time liking this guy... After his divorce, he moves in to his deceased(?) parent's home (you get the impression he inherited it) that is quite run down. At a later time, he has a new neighbor that is moving in and the new neighbor approaches him and mentions a housewarming party. Ray thinks he's being invited, but really the neighbor is there to ask Ray to clean his own gutters before the new neighbor's friends come to the party and see Ray's house. The problem?... The writers intended you to:<br/><br/>a - find this funny.<br/><br/>b - feel sorry for Ray (being kicked when down).<br/><br/>c - dislike the ""lawyer"" neighbor.<br/><br/>But instead you don't feel any of that. It's predictable, as the house is an eyesore; you see the condition of the house and think Ray should be grateful he has a place available and take care of it; and you're more apt to empathize with the neighbor, esp. when the camera pans to the gutters and show plants growing out of them. It's worse than the Bundy's house!<br/><br/>It only gets worse. Ray constantly complains about his station in life, but he isn't looking for an honorable way to make extra money. He only complains and compares the present to how things used to be. Again, it's meant to be funny or have the watchers agree, but instead you just want to shake him and tell him to wake up and get over it.<br/><br/>There are times when he comes across as a nice guy, but then you'll learn something about him later to erase it. For example, in the Pilot, we find out the nature of his divorce and you immediately side with Ray. But later, in a flashback of the first time he ever met who will become his ""pimp,"" the timing of the scene reveals Ray is not beyond committing adultery. This makes you think maybe he deserved the divorce.<br/><br/>He's constantly portrayed as a victim, but not real likable. He wants money, but it comes across as he thinks he's entitled to it.<br/><br/>With his better days behind him, and him always looking back, he's just not a character I want to relate to.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time.",31 out of 71 found this helpful.,3.0,30 June 2009
1192,Hung, Goes nowhere with everything.,"Maybe this is a non-biased review, because I have not read any other reviews or opinions before posting mine. Or maybe it is biased because I saw Hung right after I saw Californication. A bit clarification is in order here. The way I watch TV series is that I record the entire season and then view it as a marathon. One sees a lot of things one would otherwise miss when viewed like this.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the review. I could not help but draw comparisons to Californication while viewing this. The first thing to observe is how lost this show is with what it wants to say. Is it about the adventures of a well-endowed guy who decides to use his natural asset to tide over a bad economy? Is it about the outcome of a bad economy itself and how it pushes people to do things they would normally never do? Is it about friendship and loyalty during bad times? The way I see it, it tries to cram all that and more (in terms of the lives of supporting characters' sub-plots) in a limited time and ends up doing justice to nothing. In contrast we have Californication that wickedly centers about the main character and revolves EVERYTHING around him. That kind of treatment to this show would work wonders because the idea of the show is solid. Hung holds back on everything, like it considers its audience to be pregnant and is afraid it might penetrate too deep. Nothing is explored in depth. Not the main character's relationship with his 2 pimps, not the relationship with his ex-wife, not his interactions with any of his customers, not his dynamic with his children, not the relationship of the twins with each other, or their mother or step-dad. Not even his work ethic is explored in depth.<br/><br/>To me this show is bittersweet because it oozes potential but trickles on actual delivery. I hope the creators mop up their act in the 3rd season.<br/><br/>Edit: Now, why am I not surprised that it got cancelled? Instead of focusing on the main character(s), this season, the show sought to make a supporting character out of Prof. Drecker, and almost succeeded in doing so. Instead of streamlining the plot, it brought in even more 'players', and instead of taking a direction with them, still huffed and puffed its way towards nothing. Damn shame, because it was such a great idea and Thomas Jane fit the part perfectly. Oh well, life goes on!",13 out of 27 found this helpful.,3.0,8 May 2011
1193,Hung, Hung Rocks,"HBO has another hit with this show. Hung is great show that I hope gets green lighted for more seasons. This show is interesting and fun to watch. Thomas Jane is excellent in this role and was great in The Punisher. His character is well balanced and he is just one cool dude. This last episode, ""Doris is Dead"", in which one of his clients played by Natalie Zea is a wickedly good show. HBO and the producers need to add her to the cast a regular. She seems to have a good chemistry with him. She would have a positive effect on this show. It's good to see HBO with a another great show since Showtime has been kicking HBO's ass for a couple of years. So its thumbs up for me,.",11 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,13 August 2009
1194,Hung, Desperately seeking redeeming qualities,"Hung is a classic case of a great premise that has been terribly mishandled. The plot of the show is centered around Ray Drecker, who turns to male prostitution in a last ditch attempt to turn his increasingly pathetic life around. However, the pilot moves forward slowly, highlighting more of Drecker's pathetic life and his initial foray into ""the world's oldest profession"". By the end of the first episode, the viewer doesn't really connect with any of the characters and the plot seems to have gone nowhere. The primary actors attempt to make the most of the material they have, but, ultimately, they fall flat in attempting to be likable to the audience.<br/><br/>The biggest issue is how casually the problems of Drecker were introduced, nonchalantly stacked on one another without emotional string pulling, so much so that the audience can clearly SEE the problems in Drecker's life, but don't really feeling the desperation of man that has no option but to market himself.<br/><br/>Lack of emotional attachment and a slow plot reveal drug the pilot down so much that half way through the episode, I wished I had a commercial break just to give myself an excuse to flip the channel. This is not a great start for this new ""comedy"" on HBO... but I have high hopes that things will turn around as the season progresses.",30 out of 84 found this helpful.,2.0,1 July 2009
1195,Hung," I watched only because of Alexander Payne but ""Hung"" is a mess,","No one does loser-hero characters better than Payne. The story of ""big Ray"" satisfying rich women was worth a look. Thomas Jane and Jane Adams do excellent jobs but there is nothing else interesting here. The plot lines are all over the place after only 5 episodes. Before the show's premise can even get off the ground, Ray goes from insecure stud, to confident prostitute to falling in love with a customer. His ex-wife goes from rich to poor and from cold to caring. Not enough character development to pull these shifts so quickly. The kids are truly annoying. I don't see how it can recover from that miscasting. Overall, it is not just that interesting. You can wait around to get your ""Boogie Nights"" thrill but I don't see how HBO could justify more episodes.",13 out of 34 found this helpful.,3.0,10 August 2009

It's outspoken and it's material is complex and very sexy in nature while being blended with funny stories. Yet it stays true to the current times of the economic recession and people having it rough to make ends meet. And very fitting the series is set in Detroit a city that's been affected the most with hard times and a person with do just about anything for a buck.<br/><br/>The series plot involves a man Ray Drecker(Thomas Jane)who was an ex high school star athlete and his current job is that of being a high school teacher and coach. All of a sudden Ray's life goes up in flames his classy and sophisticated ex sweetheart cheerleader wife Jessica(Anne Heche)has divorced him and left for a man with a bigger pocket a dermatologist. So Ray has lost it all his house, even his two nerdy and overweight slacker kids and you guessed it he's broke.<br/><br/>And with a tough job market he needs something to supplement his income so it's with his meeting of a local Detroit woman the lonely and scattered brained Tanya(Jane Adams)who's an apparent mentor and motivational job placement adviser an ideal comes to mind. You would have never guessed it Ray becomes a male prostitute! As the motor city has plenty of lonely and desperate horny housewives. As with any business that goes especially this one a sex for sell aside from pleasure it gets complex and guilt is felt even though the money is good. Tanya will branch out to a local business lady to run the service someone who has the business and money making knowledge that happens to be the sexy and elegant Lenore(Rebecca Creskoff)who's a flat witch of a personality.<br/><br/>Along the way this series shows plenty of skin it's fun to watch and it's funny as some of the episodes stories make you laugh. As a man desperate enough to become a male hooker has it's funny moments, still a lifestyle like this aside from the money has feelings of guilt and pain making feelings and life complex that's one reason aside from the sexy nature of this series that makes it so watchable.

This is Garcia's first foray into the cable world and so far I'm loving it. Being a cable show, it doesn't have to cater to your broadcast network standards and practices, and as a result, the jokes don't have to be played safe. That being said, this one is definitely not for the kids. But after you and your significant other put the kids to bed, be sure to check out this show for a lot of solid laughs thanks to a bevy of wacky characters. Even though it's an anthology series and you'll see new guests every week, it doesn't appear to just be standalone episodes. The townsfolk seem to have some developing story lines, which is nice to see and makes this series more cohesive than just your regular anthology.

1219,The Guest Book, Curiously delightful! And no laugh track is necessary!,"As far as the definition of black comedy goes this comedy television series makes light of such matters as infidelity, drug use, attempted murder, and even extortion which personifies what taboo TV was in the first half century of family television viewing on many of the older comedy TV shows. The Guest Book is welcoming in an new era of what mainstream TV audiences will view as a curiously delightful half hour sitcom far removed from the original concept of family TV viewing such as The Lucy Show, My Favorite Martian, or I Dream Of Jeannie used to represent to comedy.<br/><br/>This is a hilarious black comedy TV series that revolves around the seasoned character actor Charles Robinson (most likely remembered for his character on 180 episodes of the 1984-1992 TV series Night Court as court appointee Mac Robinson). Charles Robinson who plays Wilfred and his wife Emma, played by Aloma Wright run a cottage for rent in a tiny remote town where people come to forget about their troubles.<br/><br/>One of the people who has come to get away from his marital troubles is Doctor Brown played by Garret Dillahunt. Dr. Brown is estranged from his wife and his ten (10) year old son who he dearly misses. The local town Officer Kimberly Leahy played by Kellie Martin is smitten with the good looking Dr. Brown and she wants to get to know Dr. Brown a lot more intimatley.<br/><br/>There is also the towns local watering hole, a titty bar run by an extortionist named Vivian played by Carly Jibson who uses her radar power to seek out weak gentlemen that she can videotape in compromising positions. One of her victims is the motel manager Wilfred who she extorts to provide her with free motel rooms where she can continue to extort more male victims.<br/><br/>So each week we see new motel guests visit this picturesque rural area with a local grocery store and titty bar, and each week we see some new characters personal stories come to life which makes us laugh because in truth, we wish in some small way we could live the lives (even vicariously) these losers are living.<br/><br/>I give ""The Guest Book"" a solid 8 out of 10 rating and I trust season 2 will be filled with a whole new group of visitors to this motel community who getto sign their guest book.

1224,Spaced, All comedies should be like this,"Having just watched this series again, I am prepared to say that ""Spaced"" is definitely one of the greatest comedy shows EVER!<br/><br/>Funny, striking, imaginative, clever, compassionate, sarcastic, inventive, etc, etc, etc. You get the impression that co-stars and co-writers, Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, just cannot write a boring line of dialogue or envisage a predictable scene. Using its ""nothing new"" premise (mismatched couple pretend to be romantically entangled to find a place to live), this show twists and turns its way off into many brilliant and original directions, while never failing to provide the required belly laughs along the way.<br/><br/>It uses movie in-jokes and references in a way that would make Tarantino envious, and the hipness of its execution makes it both a show that, paradoxically, is of the moment but is also certain to be talked about in ten or twenty years from now.<br/><br/>The cast are all first-rate: Pegg and Stevenson manage to be both madcap and touching, and are backed up by a sterling supporting cast of fresh and exciting talent. Julia Deakin as Marsha, the flirtatious middle-aged landlady and Mark Heap as the pretentious but vulnerable artist from hell, Brian, make a hilarious double act; Nick Frost is a real find as military mad Mike; and Katy Carmichael as the initially snobby Twist manages to be dotty without turning up the annoyance factor.<br/><br/>Even the guest appearances are great. My two personal favourites are Michael Smiley as the chemically enhanced Tyres O'Flaherty, a non-stop raver who even dances to the ringing of a telephone; and the excellent Charles Dale (II), who is usually cast as the heavy, but gives a marvellous comic performance here as the ""yes man"" security guard who helps our bumbling heroes rescue their beloved pooch, Colin, from an evil freelance vivisectionist!<br/><br/>Credit must also be given to director Edgar Wright who has created a unique and vivid look to the show, enhancing the script's wired look at the banalities of everyday life with his brilliant use of camera movement, lighting, cross-cutting, flashbacks, etc. Even if it wasn't funny (which it most emphatically is), ""Spaced"" would get top marks for being the best looking show on the box.<br/><br/>I could go on, but ""Spaced"" is a comedy that needs to be seen to be believed, and then seen again...and again...and again...",139 out of 146 found this helpful.,,3 February 2001

I am about the same age as the main characters in the series and many of their traits and interests seemed uncannily familiar. Maybe I should be a bit worried about being able to easily identify with Tim's motivations and obsessions or about actually knowing people like Mike myself... Uhm, I'll better not delve into all this, but let me say that watching all those familiar situations, topics of discussion and reactions of people being acted out so convincingly by the cast was pure enjoyment for me - unlike anything else I had ever seen on the telly!<br/><br/>And then there are the pop culture references. Most of them are to films or TV series. If you are a film buff or comicbook/scifi geek and have always got some fun out of the film refs in Simpsons episodes _please_ by all means watch Spaced! Not only are these scenes all very well done and intelligently embedded into the narrative - it's also the whole context of the series and its characters that makes all the references so, uhm, fitting and, well, funny. (It's a bit hard to describe really, and I'm not going to spoil anything by giving examples... just watch it!)<br/><br/>Taking in everything in one go I also found it nice that there's a consistent story arc that stretches across all 14 episodes, and I also liked the references to earlier episodes that were sometimes made, especially in the 2nd series.<br/><br/>Well. I must say I feel a little bad now about having blown all this on one single day. I mean, you're supposed to save good and precious things and use them sparingly over time. But sometimes things are so f***ing good that you just have to have it all, at once, until nothing's left.<br/><br/>So what do I do now with no more unseen Spaced for me to watch? Bloody 'ell, I'll just watch all 14 episodes again, tomorrow!!",82 out of 86 found this helpful.,,24 May 2002
1226,Spaced, Possibly the best thing to ever happen to television,"The whole two series was as close to perfect as I can imagine. Funny, beautifully shot, well-produced, the only downside was that there wasn't more of it. Perhaps the reason that it wasn't as successful as it should have been was that it didn't get a large enough audience. It was aired in a time when ""The Royle Family"" undeservedly won all the awards and praise, whereas Spaced was considered to be aimed at immature adolescents, film parodies and comic book references only worthy of an audience that doesn't know quality when they see it. And this is a tragedy, because, if television series' can be considered art form by any stretch of the imagination, then this is a masterpiece, something to be admired by others, a definite benchmark for all other programmes.",161 out of 175 found this helpful.,10.0,10 January 2005
1227,Spaced, More Please...,"'Spaced' is, for my money, one of the best comedy series produced in the English language in the last ten years; genuinely, laugh-out-loud funny, scrupulously well-written, brilliantly acted and with a kicking soundtrack that has introduced me, at least (and I'm guessing a few others) to some fantastic little-known bands (Using LemonJelly long before they were famous, for example) - this must rank alongside 'Black Books' in its cult-but-inclusive appeal. The true genius is in the fact that you could probably watch this with your vicar and - apart from a low swearing incidence - they would find little to criticise (unlike, say, equally funny but edgier shows; Chris morris' work for example) but it still makes perfect post-pub viewing. When one sees the dross that usually passes for sitcom in the UK, once-great Shakespearean actors mugging at the camera and silently cursing their agent as the canned laughter robotically shrieks, you wonder why they don't just hand over the entire comedy drama section of UK TV to Pegg, Stevenson, Bailey, Moran and Serafinowicz.

Well, even without any subtitles (I get around in English), ""Spaced"" appears to me as the exact epitome of what British TV can do at its best : a perfect brew of comedy, rhythm, political incorrectness, extraordinary acting, stylish writing, socially-oriented matters... I really was mesmerized at the creativity both screenwriters and director displayed all along the 14 episodes, always renewing what could be taken as pure show-off style on the first one.

1230,Spaced," Americans should watch ""Spaced""","I've just spent five hours watching the most terrific British sitcom, ""Spaced."" Now my inner voice speaks with an English accent and I'm left wondering if maybe I grew up on the wrong side of the Atlantic. I am an American viewer, and I'm sad that it has taken so long for this show to reach the States.<br/><br/>In ""Spaced"" there are references comic books, Tekken, and Evil Dead II. It is also worth noting that Tim, one of the main characters in ""Spaced,"" lost his job over ""The Phantom Menace."" <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed my hours of uninterrupted British indulgence. I recommend ""Spaced"" because it's so darn funny. Tim, played by Simon Pegg, is the assistant manager of a comic book shop. His boss's name is Bilbo Bagshot (I'm serious) and said boss has slugged people out on at least two occasions because the one getting slugged said that ""Hawke the Slayer"" was crap. Also, Peter Serafinowicz (aka the Voice of Darth Maul) turns up as the slick-suit who stole Tim's girlfriend away. They have a great showdown on a paintball course.<br/><br/>Also wonderful is Daisy (Jessica Stevenson), the other main character. She's a writer, but comes up with all sorts of creative ways to avoid actual writing. The in-jokes are brilliant, the directing is fresh, the acting is endearing without being sappy.

1231,Spaced, Brilliant and entertaining!,"Okay, so I happen to be a partying, comic book reading, horror movie watching, video game playing, thirty something-year-old gal from the US, who is also a major Star Wars geek. And according to some that is the only audience that this show would appeal to. Well, I disagree. It really spoke to me, for obvious reasons, and I think that the characters of Tim and Daisy are much of an amalgam of the people in my generation who want to succeed but are either afraid to take the risk, feel like they can't get a break, or are just to damned lazy to do so! But there is also something about the relationship of the characters that I think could appeal to anyone. And the peripheral characters are deliciously strange. I think that it's well written and acted. I think that it's funny, and weird and bizarre and just really, really fun to watch!

1233,Spaced," It's life Tim, and boy, do they know it.","""Spaced"" is like watching the cartoon of the life of the average SFX reader or Ain't-it-Cool UK talkbacker.  It's the closest thing to fanboy (and fangirl) heaven there is.  By that, I don't mean it's a perfect word for word film version of Lord of the Rings nor even a big BBC production of Asimov's Foundation trilogy.  No, this is where really good fanboys (and fangirls) go when they die.<br/><br/>Set around the lives of Tim Bisley and Daisy Steiner sharing a ground floor flat somewhere in North London it shows in a disturbingly honest way the lives of the average late 20-something, recently moved to London, wannabe creative, painfully middle-class, skint people in much the same way that David Attenborough might bring to life the daily trials of a family of pandas.  Their many rituals and habits are studied in detail as they go about carving their way in the cruel world around them.  We see them go clubbing, going to sign on, in the pub, and rescuing dogs from animal testing laboratories.  The one thing that leads me to think that this is only a sitcom and not real life is that their flat is always suspiciously clean.<br/><br/>As Tim is a struggling graphic artist trying to break into the world of comic illustration, it's appropriate that the characters are all cartoons themselves.  They almost spew stylised behaviour, phrases and clothes. Some even have their own signature moves such as Brian's standardised description of his 'work' when he is asked what he paints.  The editing follows this lead with many cut-aways into people's thoughts much in the manner of a thought bubble.  The sheer quantity of cultural references is staggering. However, having lived a life similar to this, I know the number of cultural references in real life is at about the same level.<br/><br/>If you're currently aged between 27 and 34, this is the only sitcom you'll ever need to see again.  Well, Black Books is pretty good too.  Anyway, there are few things that make me laugh as much of this.

1234,Spaced, If you were born between 1970 and 1980...,"...this is the show for YOU.<br/><br/>It's hilarious on many different levels, ranging from the ultra-obscure comic book/film/TV/music references to the downright slapstick.<br/><br/>The much-celebrated references may cause you to roll around on the sofa clutching your stomach laughing, or they may pass you by.  It really doesn't matter.  The programme is also incredibly touching.  The writing and performances bring the paint-by-numbers characters (self-pitying cartoonist, lazy would-be journalist, tortured artist, drunken landlady, vain self-appointed fashion guru, weapons-obsessed idiot) to painfully vivid life, and no matter how cynically you may approach ""Spaced"" you will end up caring about these people and their relationships.  But hey, even if you don't, there's still the pop-culture references to cling onto.<br/><br/>From Tim fantasising playing ""Resident Evil 2"" and blasting zombies in his living room (before reality takes hold), Daisy seeing herself in the future in true ""The Shining"" style, and Marsha seeing how she might have been had she not turned to drink and rock stars, you'll start laughing and you won't stop.<br/><br/>In fact, it doesn't matter what age you are, you will identify with the characters and you will care about them and you will laugh with them.  A lot.<br/><br/>Which just leaves the evil hidden agenda behind the series: watch it, listen to the audio commentary on the DVD and it becomes clear that they will make you watch Evil Dead 2.

1239,Spaced, Sublime,"Since Red Dwarf drifted off into infinity, good sci-fi comedies are thinner on the ground than Captain Picard's hair. Think of The Strangerers, last year's woeful offering from Sky if you want further proof.<br/><br/>
For a generation weaned on Star Wars and Star Trek, many writers have either been too consumed with their own in jokes, or have treated the much maligned genre which has left millions turning off in their droves.<br/><br/>Luckily in 1999 there came a new hope which pushed back the final frontier of sitcoms. After a welcome re-run of series one, Spaced is resurrected for the 21st century and the gags are sharper than Luke Skywalker's lightsabre.<br/><br/>
If you like The Matrix, Pulp Fiction, Mission Impossible II and hated The Phantom Menace, then Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson have written a show just for you. <br/><br/>The series follows the continuing voyages of confused twenty-somethings, Daisy and Tim as they attempt to navigate life at a time when they should be getting serious but somehow are not. <br/><br/>Together with their ragbag assortment of co-conspirators - tortured artist Brian (Mark Heap), would-be soldier Mike (Nick Frost), fashion fascist Twist (Katy Carmichael), rock casualty landlady Marsha (Julia Deakin) and Colin the dog - they tackle the big questions the 21st century poses: who are they, what do they mean to each other and who should switch on the kettle?<br/><br/>
The second series proves just as good as the first, with Daisy back from her trek round Asia finding that little has changed. <br/><br/>That shopping trolley is still outside her house and the lads are still watching the same skateboarding video.

1240,Spaced, Thin,"A supposedly surprising sitcom based upon the very modern idea of a couple of twenty-somethings sharing a flat: 'Spaced' sounded as if it should feel fresh and original. But in fact the set up feels very familiar: the landlord (in this case, actually a landlady) lives under the same roof as her collection of sexually inadequate, loser tenants; although the permutations are different, 'Spaced' really doesn't feel so completely different from 'Rising Damp'. The one original quirk is that jokes are often followed up by vividly unreal exaggerations showing us what the characters really think. But this was done with more style in 'Dream On' and in this case, far from adding to the original joke, seems more to labour the point - this isn't the sort of comedy whose humour is allowed to nearly escape you. In some senses, these visual plays are more the equivalent of a laughter track - something to tell the audience to laugh. The odd line made me smile, but overall, I prefer a bit more realism in my comedy; there's no real bite when the characters are drawn so thin.",20 out of 40 found this helpful.,5.0,2 February 2010

1242,Spaced," Constantly clever, funny and imaginative - Friends doesn't even deserve to be on the same channel!","The adventures of Tim and Daisy who rent a room in Marsha Klein's house under the pretence that they are a couple.  Also in the house is frustrated painter Brian.  Together with TA fanatic Mike and Brian's girlfriend Twist the duo get into a series of situations with hilarious results.<br/><br/>From my synopsis this could be Friends UK - group of people live together and get into series of misunderstandings etc.  But this is channel 4, this is written by Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson! Of course it's going to be better than that.  Friends is all gloss and is pretty simple and contrived each week - Spaced has a mad energy about it that loses the gloss but replaces it with intelligence, wit, great dialogue and overall a great imagination.  The story lines are never along the same lines as Friends - instead we have confrontation with youths in a pub, lost dogs, mixed up comic art portfolios etc., and they're never solved in the same way as Friends' predicaments are.  Instead they are always far fetched - imagine a stand off with a group of yobs being solved by a huge, slow-mo shoot out using fingers as guns (this is really well down and isn't as silly as it sounds!).<br/><br/>The level of imagination around the stories is huge - it's filled with funny movie references like The Simpson, but more integrated with the action (i.e. not all background stuff), literally every show will have several scenes that echo scenes from films - but even if you don't get those there's still plenty to enjoy.  The dialogue is hilarious, the characters are larger than life and the stories are so imaginative you can't help be taken in.<br/><br/>The actors are all brilliant and buy totally into each episode - this is not Friends where each actor seems concerned with their screen time or making sure that they look great!  Would a Brian or a Mike fit into Friends - but I do know that 5 minutes in Spaced would have Jennifer Anniston in tears.<br/><br/>Overall this is a excellent series - continually hilarious, very clever, very imaginative and a wonderful example of British TV.

1244,Spaced, Another Bloody Classic,"This program is definitely another program of it's time. In the late 1990's and the early part of the Millennium Channel 4 had what was it's most fertile time with regards to producing situation comedies for all tastes. Amongst them were That Peter Kay Thing, Phoenix Nights, Father Ted and Black Books. But through all this there came Spaced with its touching tale of two flat mates and their strange assortment of friends living within the same house in London. But this was not the only winning formula that they had in there. There was also the film/television/art/theatre references which were sometime very surreal but they tapped into the post modern world we live in and highlighted certain statements by media guru's that say that there isn't anything original anymore.<br/><br/>Tim and Daisy meet one another in a café whilst they are separately flat hunting. A mad scheme as posing as a professional couple helps secure a flat from drink fuelled landlady who turns out to be one their closet friends. Also living in the house is Brian an artist whose work displays Anger, Pain, fear and aggression. Then there is Tim's best friend from childhood Mike who is an army fanatic who has been kicked out of the reserve army for trying to invade Paris with a tank. Daisy's friend manifest herself in the form of Twist a fashion guru that works in laundrette. These wonderful characters are supported by their comedy contemporaries. We have Bill Bailey, Ricky Gervais, Michael Smiley as the brilliant Tyres, and Reece Shearsmith as an angry soldier.<br/><br/>Like Shaun of the dead Spaced is very well written. Pegg and Jessica Stevenson make an excellent writing team. Each episode is skillfully written and each holds a lot of memorable moments. My favourite episodes are Epiphanies and Help which features the wonderful character that is Tyres played to perfection by Michael Smiley. Another favourite episode is when Tim and Daisy act out a shoot out to escape the clutches of an angry mob. Certainly not been done before to such a devastating comic effect.<br/><br/>Also there is the director Edgar Wright who to my knowledge has cemented himself as one of Britains most talented television directors with his fast camera moves. With out his creative input to this show each episode would have had fantastic script but it's final presentation would have been very boring and it would not have been as interesting or exciting.<br/><br/>If you want a quality TV Show that reflects modern day pop culture of the late 90's and early noughties then this intelligent comedy drama is for you.

1250,The Glades, Decent with horrible ending,"The Glades was a light-hearted Crime drama about a talented Homicide detective who gets kicked out of Chicago and goes to Florida after a scandal gets him kicked out of Chicago. It is enjoyable in that the detective is obnoxious yet funny, always catches the bad guy, and underneath does the right thing. The series is in the long story about him winning over the wife of a convict with a kid that he falls for in Season 1. The show is entertaining albeit a bit redundant in terms of the weekly shows basically all following the same plot. I enjoyed watching it on Netflix, just wish I had known it ended at season 4 with absolutely no closure. So while the show is good and it appears we are going to get the happy ending a show like this should provide we don't. Obviously the writers thought there was going to be a Season 5 because 4 instead of leaving the happy couple riding off in the sunset happy with dreams fulfilled, we are left with ""Jim"", the detective, shot twice bleeding out on the floor of the kitchen of the dream house he bought for his bride (the one she wanted since childhood). I knew it was either going to end very good or bad because I didn't know if the writers knew they were writing the series finale. Well, jokes on us poor suckers who watch it because they thought there would be a season 5 to wrap things up and instead we are left with a bride at the alter, the star of the show bleeding out, and the show cancelled. So while liking the show, got shafted on the ending real bad.

It's nice to see a cop who's not always beating his chest or tearing his hair out over a case. The interaction of ALL the characters is also refreshing. Actually seems more true-to-life than most. The little gibes, off the cuff remarks to each other really lightens the ""mood"" of the show.<br/><br/>This is a great example that a good cop drama doesn't have to be heart-rending or bloody. Don't get me wrong, I'll still watch other cop dramas. But it's hard waiting a week for each episode of The Glades. It's on my DVD ""series-to-buy"" list, no other cop shows made it, yet.",42 out of 51 found this helpful.,9.0,27 September 2010
1255,The Glades, Forget the usual Florida glitz and glimmer. The Glades is authentic.,"I've been in Florida for 35 years, working as both a script writer and newspaper editor. I've been on the sets of most of those made-in-Florida productions and invariably they try to over-sell the Sunshine State with the glamorous South Beach style that typifies almost every show since Miami Vice. The Glades, however, gets its right with stories about the warm heart of Central Florida, with stories most Florida shows forget. Instead of Cuban drug lords we get stories of the football heroes bred in Imokalee, the spiritualists in Cassadaga and the surfers in Melbourne. The cast is down-to-earth with the right accents and attitudes. Very shows have understood their material this well since Ivan Tors migrated to North Miami.",40 out of 51 found this helpful.,9.0,3 January 2011
1256,The Glades," Draws Similarities To Dexter, But It's A Different Show","Watching the previews to The Glades, I wasn't the only person I know that saw the similarities between this show and the hit series on Showtime, Dexter. The show is filmed in South Florida, revolves around homicide investigations, and the lead, Matt Passmore, even looks like Michael C. Hall of Dexter. However, unlike Dexter, Jim Longworth is a great cop who is NOT a serial killer. He's a just a decent guy with a good sense of humor who is a damn good investigator.<br/><br/>In fact, Passmore makes the show very enjoyable. Co-stars Carlos Gomez and Jordan Wall are great supporting Passmore and I do hope Michelle Hurd continues to take on a larger role in the show. The characters are good and are being developed nicely.<br/><br/>For this show to be successful, I do believe it will need to take on more interesting dark themes or it runs the risk of becoming a run-of-the-mill forensics series like Law and Order or Kojack...no knock on these shows, they were great for their time, but most audiences are looking for something fresh like Dexter and Breaking Bad. Let's hope The Glades remains fresh. I have watched the first 5 episodes and the back stories do seem to be building. If the show continues on this pace, it could be yet another hit for A&amp;E.

1257,The Glades, 'The Glades' makes the grade!,"A new show on A&amp;E is starting to catch on, a little like a stone that begins its roll down a nice, low-grade slope that gently falls away, eventually to lend same stone a fast free flow to the bottom. ""The Glades"" begins as a teaser, introducing us to Detective Jim Longworth (Matt Passmore previously of ""McLeod's Daughters""), a laid back, smart-arsed lawman, who blurs the thin blue line's line of authority on a regular basis. While he appears to lead with a smile in most situations, his wit works shrewdly away. He's great at subtly extracting personal information from others when necessary, but he's even better at withholding his own. Watch carefully, when he talks to Callie, his partner, or a perp. He often looks slightly over their heads or off to the side, not allowing them to see into his soul. Carlos Sanchez, his partner who is a go-by-the-book cop, is often the humorous object of some 'I'm not laughing with you, I'm laughing at you' dissonance. It appears Longworth's cockiness carries over to his job, and personal life, but I think that will be fleshed out, at least to some point, as we get to know him better. Slow talking, slow walking, wise Callie is the perfect 'possibly' for this lawman - a good balance to his jump-in-feet-first and who-cares persona. Although, she does bring some intriguing baggage to the mix, for sure.<br/><br/>I was an avid fan of of ""McLeod's Daughters"" and it is great to see Rachel Carpani, Passmore's real life girlfriend/fellow McCleod's player, acting alongside at times on the show. <br/><br/>With a Creator such as Clifton Campbell, who has also been involved in such greats as '""White Collar"", ""Profiler"", and ""21 Jump Street"", I have very little doubt that we will continue to see even better story lines as well as Longworth's past life unfold to mysteriously complicate his relationships along with his duties. All this and the lush environment of the 'Glades' delivers something to look forward to on Sunday nights. 10/11/2010",19 out of 27 found this helpful.,9.0,12 October 2010

He has a stupid, cocky, arrogant attitude to everybody and acts as though they have done something wrong even if they aren't even suspects. Who does he think he is?<br/><br/>If I were being questioned by him and he started giving me that kind of attitude, I would tell him to go to hell and fetch me a proper, professional officer who knows how to do the job correctly and treat people with respect when they have not even so much as been charged, let alone convicted (after asking for a lawyer of course, duh).",31 out of 51 found this helpful.,1.0,2 July 2013

Evidently the writers of the show aren't into 'happy'; no doubt they thought it was hugely funny, but reading through the reviews I don't appear to be the only person who was traumatised by the last 30 seconds.

First of all it is unique insofar as the hero is not constantly in a jam with his superiors and is not full of the most unpleasant character flaws, which most cop shows emphasize. Nor does he have a not-very-understanding wife and family. Passmore plays it extremely well, quick with his tongue, reserved about his insights, and most of all able to do what most cops on TV cannot: communicate nuanced feelings with his eyes and face.<br/><br/>His co-star is an amazingly well depicted woman with way too much to do but always responsible and never too lazy to do whatever she does and do it very well. She's a great actress and the only other film I've seen her in, The Perfect Getaway, she did the same thing as here: playing someone completely down to earth but with enough interiority and mystery to make her very compelling.<br/><br/>We hope the show goes ON!",14 out of 23 found this helpful.,10.0,19 September 2011

1269,The Glades, Horrible main character; annoying girlfriend; no good side kick,"I have only watched the first 10 episodes; so there may not be any real spoilers in here, but just in case -- anyone who has never seen the show before, watch it for yourself first before reading on. OK, so on my Amazon Prime (in Germany, which always lags behind US in regards to TV) I found four seasons of The Glades popping up. An IMDb 7.5 rating, plus four seasons, the show MUST be good, right? Well, there is Florida as a back drop. And that's pretty much it. We've all had to grow to the main characters in, e.g., Dexter, Life, Burn Notice -- but at the end of those first seasons you could not imagine anyone else playing Dexter, Det. Crews, or Michael, and their looks really improved over time. This is not the case with The Glades. I thought it might be a lost in translation thing, because I actually have to watch the show in German (Engl audio option missing, thanks Amazon). But now it seems that in English the main actor is even more annoying, and so are the other characters. That whole struggling single mom thing -- but then she goes back and forth between let's be friends and no can do 'cause I'm married and bla bla bla. I mean, really, in what universe would this situation play out this way? Ridiculous. Then, there is the ""oh, I heard about you, Mr, in Chicago..!"" from anyone he ever seems to encounter. But not much seems to have really happened that could have had a significant influence to how he is doing his job now. Well, except, that his character claims to have been a good detective back in Chicago. I know, it's just TV, but I don't WANT to buy that whole stick the way it is portrayed. It's weird, actually -- even though it is not over-exaggerated, the show and characters do not come across authentic.

The last episode when it was on Netflix &amp; it looks like browsing ahead on Hulu it is the same shows Jim Longworth getting shot multiple times just before his wedding when he was to marry Callie and that is how the last episode ended.

1294,Pearson, 'Pearson': Review,"USA's political procedural, a spinoff of 'Suits,' sees attorney Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) try to dismantle Chicago's political machine from the inside. The fish rots from the head. And in USA's new political procedural Pearson, a shadowy spinoff from feather-light legal drama Suits, that fish is Chicago, decaying from the inside out thanks to its corrupt mayor and his sinewy network of venal backers and malleable sycophants. Thankfully, new brooms sweep clean. (Or so they try.) Pearson is named for Gina Torres' steely do-gooder attorney Jessica Pearson, newly arrived from Suits' New York to clean up Chicago as a fixer in the mayor's administration. In a previous backdoor pilot, Jessica headed to Chicago to file a lawsuit against the city on behalf of an estranged aunt, only to end up accepting a high-profile job with shady young mayor Bobby Novak (Morgan Spector) in exchange for dropping litigation. Now wracked with guilt, Jessica must figure out how to support her struggling South Side family while publicly protecting the Novak administration (and privately scouring it from the inside). The central conflict revolves around her crushing, stiletto-healed ambition competing with her inconvenient sense of justice.
As Torres flips from supporting to lead in this new story, think The Good Fight, but dryer and less clever. There's apparently not much humor to be had when there are city aldermen to lobby and union leaders to hammer. Arguably 95 percent of Pearson's scenes take place in a dark room between two characters at odds with each other, a static pattern that became funnier to me the more I recognized its consistency. That's about as much fun as I extracted from this moody 10-episode opening season. Still, Pearson is a shrewd adult drama that takes its characters seriously. Like The Wire, it distills municipal infrastructure into palatable little chunks for the audience to nibble on. (Each episode is named for a local leader conflicting with City Hall: ""The Superintendent""; ""The Donor""; ""The Political Wife."") The show contains only mere hints of sex, romance and violence; you get the sense that the producers know what Pearson is not more so than they know what it is. It is not a soap. It is not a legal buddy dramedy. But in leaching out the elements that would make the show a little pulpier, they end up with freeze-dried fruit leather: a nutritious but tame diversion. As Jessica begins to untangle the Gordian knot of Chicago politics, she's thwarted at every turn by those who disapprove of her taking this job: her partner, her family and, most intensely, the mayor's lackies. The standout of the supporting cast is Bethany Joy Lenz (One Tree Hill) as aggressive city attorney Keri Allen, the only full-bloom character besides Jessica herself. (Prior to the first episode, Keri had Jessica disbarred, adding an underlying jaggedness to their eventual 'frenemiship.') Keri is Mayor Novak's right-hand woman, a canny and loyal vizier who also happens to be his longstanding mistress. (Spector's Novak is disarming, resembling a young Rahm Emanuel.) Pearson doesn't opt for tawdry thrills here, instead focusing on Keri's conflicted love for the man. Every time she says she's ""in a relationship,"" you feel the embarrassed pang of witnessing someone in complete denial of reality. One of the season's best and most surprising storylines sees Keri openly bond with her lover's ill wife (Betsey Brandt) over their mutual allegiance to the complicated man. Lenz sparks every scene she's in, pulsing Keri with confidence, insecurity, feistiness and vulnerability. Her needle-sharp scrappiness is a perfect foil for Torres' slick regality. Like Olivia Pope 2.0, Jessica is a strutting, crusading mid-career fixer draped in a chic white silhouette. (In fact, given its racially inclusive, woman-forward cast led by an Afro-Latinx actress, you can't help but attribute at least some of Pearson's progressive edge to the influence of TV pioneer Shonda Rhimes.) Jessica tussles with her dueling impulses to both do right and win at all costs. Her critical cousin Angela (Chantel Riley), a South Side single mom with two young kids, constantly pressures Jessica to give into her deep-down moral imperatives. This woman is such a martyr she elects to live on the streets in solidarity with her fellow evicted neighbors, rather than with Jessica in her cushy apartment, in order to send a message to City Hall. Unfortunately, Angela comes off as more a storytelling device than flesh-and-blood human, her arc merely a narrative window into the lives of the everyday Chicago citizens Jessica is supposedly looking out for. Pearson has better luck with Jessica's idealistic assistant Yoli (Isabel Arraiza), a young DACA recipient whose activism and political naivety is often at odds with her ability to effectively do her job. (She and Jessica have one of the most true-to-life dom-sub office dynamics I've seen on TV, Yoli often chastened and contrite when Jessica admonishes her.)",8 out of 16 found this helpful.,8.0,6 August 2019

The show's direction is nicely cohesive, with each episode's director clearly chosen for that particular episode according to style, emphasis &amp; content.

They never really engage in dialogue with other people, nor are any of them capable of actual introspection. What we're left with are a bunch of sex crazed morons, smashing apart every chance they have with happiness or personal growth. They just blithely do their own thing regardless of the consequences.

1301,Casual, It's Binge-worth...to a point.,"I like this show, and I confess I binged through the entire first season and i'm now about half way through the second...but there are things that really irk me so much that it took away stars.<br/><br/>It has his funny moments (and this is entirely dependent on your type of humor, I like quick and witty, sometimes dark/twisted). I can appreciate the extreme flaws and ironicism of each of the characters (ex. the therapist is by far the most unstable) and I think the cast is full of talented actors. <br/><br/>One thing I cannot stand is the mother that plays a 39 year old, but in reality i'd say she's closer to 50. It's not her age that bothers me, but why can't the creators of the show just let her be her real age? She's a woman that is newly divorced, struggling with her own shortcomings and mental issues while raising a dysfunctional daughter. She's a beautiful and healthy older woman - yes women age! Woman over 40 exist! They want sex too! The fact that the show constantly reminds us that she is ""39"" pisses me off throughout the entire show.<br/><br/>The second thing that really irks me is the amount of sex these characters have, it's really over the top. I'm pretty sure there is sex in every episode and I'd classify this series as soft porn - characters meet for the first time, say two sentences to each other and by the next scene they're in bed, or a chair, or a desk, or a school, or a car - you name it. I'm still waiting for the episode where someone caught an STD because statistically speaking, it's long overdue. Each character, including the 16 year old daughter has had hundreds of partners.

1303,Casual, Lots of promise based on the first two episodes,"Shows centered around dating are generally problematic because it's hard to empathize with the trials and tribulations of good-looking actors who have highly active sex lives.<br/><br/>This show got my attention in the first two episodes by bucking that trend in a manner I can buy. The protagonist, Valerie (arguably SNL's biggest firing mistake in history in Michaela Watkins) is an attractive divorcée in her late 30's with a sincere lack of confidence in herself. Sure, sex and dating are theoretically easy (her career is a successful psychiatrist proves that point) and obtainable for a woman who's willing to go out to a bar and take the first steps in propositioning a guy but if intimacy is a psychological problem, it can be more difficult in practice. Valerie's discomfort is just visceral which makes her lows relatable and will make her eventual highs (if she gets over her hang-ups) well-earned.<br/><br/>Her adult brother, Alex (Tommy Dewey), is equally filled with psychological hang-ups. He's been more successful in dating than his sister but he has a certain psychological distance from the whole thing. A good move on the show's part is to strip Alex of misogynist vibes: As a guy who wrote the algorithms of the dating site he's using, Alex simply feels that both men and women are overly predictable and that he's gamed the system. The pilot contains a double date (done in secret as Alex and Valerie are carpooling) which contains some relatable and truthful moments while also adding a whiff of comedy (lots of mileage to be mined out of Jill Latiano's fitness freak).<br/><br/>The relationship between Alex and Valerie is one of the stronger sibling portrayals on television at the moment.<br/><br/>Like many Jason Reitman films, this is a film with a blurred line between comedy and drama which isn't so bad considering the show portrays truth to it. One of the few shows centering on romance that's worth watching.<br/><br/>In the pilot episode, he condescendingly a woman for whom dating and sex isn't easy",27 out of 45 found this helpful.,9.0,11 October 2015

1305,Casual, Fantastic start but by the end of it all... A bit of a mess.,"I loved the first season which I would have rated an 8. The rating had to come down though for the remaining seasons - the decline was slow but real. I loved each of the three main characters to begin with, but Alex just started to drive me crazy and become really unlikeable in the subsequent seasons, esp 3 and 4. I was not rooting for him at all.
Talk about an attention seeking narcissist!
Similarly the daughter became as dull as dishwater as the series progressed. What made me see it all through until the end was the wonderful Michaela Watkins. I find her performances are always nuanced and her timing is fantastic (I know a lot of comic timing may be down to directors/editors etc, but I'm giving her credit).

1307,Casual," Huh, so that's why I can't date anymore...","At first glance, the show is full of selfishness, narcissism, and psychopathy. The ""selfie"" generation. At a deeper level, it is a commentary on the state of parenting and socialization; actually, the lack thereof. <br/><br/>The show focuses on three characters, all of which deeply flawed. Alex and Valerie are children of ""me"" generation parents, which means that they had to contend with not being the center of attention at all times of their parents. Valerie compensates to a terrible degree, much like most of her generation, in raising her kid. Her kid is a disaster; she was given no boundaries by her mom in her desire to be loved by her child and afraid to lose the attention that she did not get from her own parents. The daughter acts in all kinds of narcissistic, borderline psychopathic ways, and mom, a therapist no less, lets her get away with it because again, her desire to be loved overshadows her requirement to be a responsible parent. <br/><br/>There is no growth in this expose of millennial dysfunction outside of Alex. Maybe because he never had kids he is able to focus on himself and the problems within. He travels from intense swinger without a care to sensitive brother to Mr. Lonely quickly and satisfactorily. <br/><br/>Valerie is a failure as a therapist, and an odd duck to boot. She seems a little mentally unstable altogether, like someone headed for a breakdown perhaps. She is not likable at all, really, she is essentially lousy at everything. She actually can commit, actually commitment doesn't seem to be a problem for any of these characters, but it is to what they commit that is so worrying. <br/><br/>The daughter - this girl is really in trouble mentally. She is so scathed I cannot see her coming out of this without intense therapy, if she isn't already a psychopath and beyond hope. This is through no fault of her own and she should have been actually raised, not liberated way before she matured. This is a real reflection of what these over-permissive parents are doing to their children today and why we are ending up with terribly disturbed kids doing terribly disturbed things, if they don't contract the red measles or pertussis first due to the non-vaxxers. <br/><br/>In terms of the production - the sets are nice and full of interest and very Californian. The acting is good all around. There is a sense of claustrophobia in every scene, not sure if that is a function of the camera work or intentional. No shaky cameras though, big plus. What I am on the fence about and where I cannot score higher is the gratuitously liberal use of swear words and dirty talk (I for one cannot imagine and know no one who would talk with their brother about what Valerie talks about so casually...but maybe I am out of touch?). <br/><br/>As an aside, now I get why I find dating today so disgusting. I don't know, it used to be so much fun getting to know someone and anticipating the ""big"" night!

Laura is a blunt and cynical teenager and Valerie is a somewhat self-absorbed yet loving mother. Alex Cole (Tommy Dewey), brother to Valerie, offers his home to Valerie and Laura after Valerie divorces her husband because of his infidelity.

1327,Dallas, Dallas is back with a LOT of Backstabbing,"My parents bought the old Dallas DVDs years ago. I was hooked pretty much from the get go. <br/><br/>I was worried that this new series, Dallas: The Next Generation, wouldn't be as good. It isn't as good. It's better.<br/><br/>Good ole boy Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) has gotten diagnosed with cancer. Christopher Ewing (Jesse Metcalfe), his adopted son, is doing his best to make a name for himself using alternative energy overseas. But Bobby doesn't trust Christopher run Southfork up to his standards if Bobby dies from this cancer. So, Bobby decides to sell Southfork. And John Ross (Josh Henderson), JR's son, is not too happy about it, as he wants to drill oil on Southfork. Oh, and JR's (Larry Hagman) not to thrilled with the prospect either.<br/><br/>We find JR in a retirement home. Not for long, though. Not when there's oil to drill and Texans to deceive. JR is once again played masterfully by Larry Hagman. The 80 year is as good as he was 30 years ago. <br/><br/>Patrick Duffy was also excellent as nice guy Bobby. He has excellent chemistry with his new wife Ann (Brenda Strong). Rounding out the quartet is Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), a much more refined character than she was 25 years ago.<br/><br/>The cousins John Ross and Christopher take after their fathers. They're involved with Elena Ramos, the daughter of a maid, and the former lover of Christopher.<br/><br/>That's about as far as I'll go into the plot. This show was and is going to be people's guilty pleasures. Our economy obviously is doing spectacularly right now. So why should we watch a show about a rich Texas family?<br/><br/>Well, it's the same reason people love George Clooney. He lives the life we all want to have. He has it. Many shows and movies have beautiful women and fast cars, but that's not what makes Dallas unique. Dallas has the IT factor. It's a guilty pleasure because 99% don't live that life. We don't have enough money to even consider being that greedy.<br/><br/>Money fuels almost everything in life. and when you have it, you have power. And that's why JR is such a compelling character. He's successful because he doesn't think with his heart, unlike Bobby. Probably, because he doesn't have one. You can call him a terrible husband, an awful parent, or even a soulless son. But that doesn't matter in business.<br/><br/>Because ultimately, blood may be thicker than water, but oil is thicker than both.",27 out of 30 found this helpful.,10.0,14 June 2012
1328,Dallas, Riveting! Larry Hagman rocks!,"Having loved the original Dallas, I watched this with interest and an open mind. After watching the pilot and first episode, I am hooked, if for no other reason than Larry Hagman as JR is better than ever. Old age has only added to his charm and personal power, and every line is a delight. It's not clear how he ended up in a posh nursing home for clinical depression - I think it's unlikely someone like JR would ever be thus afflicted, but he's back in business by the end of the first episode, fighting off the attempts of his loving family to do him in. Everyone in the cast has their own agenda - as usual, money and power - and I am very much hoping that JR will come out on top. Anyone who enjoyed the original Dallas will not be disappointed in the new series, because of Larry Hagman's finely nuanced performance alone. Old age reaches all of us, if we're lucky, but seeing the added dimension it gives to a man who is singularly ruthless and cunning as JR is absolutely fascinating. The camera focuses closely on his facial expressions - his satanic eyebrows alone deserve an Emmy - and you are always wondering whether he is sincere or faking sincerity to achieve his ends. It's a shame that they didn't bring this series back 10 years ago, as Larry Hagman is now over 80. Enjoy him while you can!<br/><br/>Edited to add - Having watched four episodes now, I can say that Dallas 2012 is actually better than the original, mostly due to Larry Hagman's performance. Now, at the age of nearly 81, having suffered numerous health problems through the years including recent cancer, there is a LOT more depth to Larry Hagman which comes across in his face, his voice and delivery. As one critic said, he is less like a character than a force, like the villains in the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Further edited - Larry Hagman died yesterday. He had a peaceful, quick end, from what I read. I really hope he read this review and others, and knew how much he was loved and valued. Rest in peace, JR. You will be sadly missed.<br/><br/>Further edited - JR has been gone for awhile now and the show has had to find a new direction. I can say that this has occurred, thanks to two of the secondary characters, Mitch Pileggi as Harris Ryland and Judith Light as his mother, Judith. Judith is a stand-out, the true successor of JR. Her performance will make your hair stand on end!",25 out of 28 found this helpful.,10.0,15 June 2012
1329,Dallas, A Good Comeback for Dallas,"Finally after years of god awful reality TV shows, bad remakes of classic shows and other stuff, we finally have a real popcorn television show with Dallas, a continuation based on the 1978-91 prime time soap opera about a wealthy family in oil and cattle ranch in Dallas Texas, this time it's main focus will be on john Ross (scheming son of the man everybody loves to hate J.R. Ewing) played by Josh Henderson and bobby's son Christopher played by former passions star Jesse metcalfe and of course the three legends played by Larry hagman, Patrick Duffy and Linda Gray, although they are some flaws in this one, but the rest are just so good, including the emotional scene featuring bobby talking to J.R. at a nursing home about the Ewing legacy and how john Ross and Christopher should not follow the same mistakes that they made in the past, Jordana Brewster is also good as john Ross's love interest and Julie Gonzalo is also pretty good as Christopher's now wife Rebecca, and Larry hagman's back in top form as the man everybody loves to hate J.R. Ewing and so is Patrick Duffy as bobby, Brenda Strong (who was so good in the discontinued desperate housewives) is very strong in her role as bobby's new wife Ann.<br/><br/>Although I Have problems with the southfork ranch though, the HD is beautiful and the kitchen is nice, but it needs a feel to be home, still despite that, this is a very good version of a classic, something most TV shows lack today.<br/><br/>and I'm giving it a B+",29 out of 36 found this helpful.,8.0,16 June 2012

1331,Dallas," ""Dallas,"" Is Back!","This is a new generation of South Fork lies, backstabbing, deceit and greed. For the older generation who enjoyed the original series, there is enough continuity and history in the show to keep you intrigued. However, it is the new generation of Ewing's that have history repeating, and with delight! In my opinion, it is certainly the aged cast that intrigues me the most, and know that the show will heavily rely on the new blood. That doesn't mean that J.R., Bobbie and Sue Ellen won't have their moments to shine. John Ross, and Christopher Ewing are at the forefront of this new series, and there is much to say about the sibling rivalry of the past, coming forth into this cousin rivalry. I think the writing was well done, the opening sequence was similar enough to the original for the die hard fans, and the new cast certainly has a lot to live up to, and I think they will soar!

1333,Dallas, Will It Make The Same Waves?,"In 1978 during one of the worst recessions of the 1970's, Dallas originally started with Jock, Ellie, JR, Bobby, Sue Ellen, Cliff, Lucy, and a bunch of others. The top prime time soap contained something which fascinated everyone, an evil JR who played well being in oil which in 1978 was in such short supply that there were odd/even license plate days to get your gasoline. CBS had the top rated show on prime time television, while Reagen was running for his first term as President more people in the US were wondering who shot JR? The show had tawdry affairs, double dealing back stabbing business deals, and there was always someone getting tossed in the pool, and another deal being cut with JR cutting them out. There were motels, women, affairs, kids who were lied too about who their parents were and the oil barons club. There was a ball every year and there were always those scenes around the dinner table at Southfork. All the men drank so much that you wondered if any of them would survive.<br/><br/>Wonder no more, as they are back, the survivors, along with the kids who still don't really know who their parents are and have been lied to about it so long that they think they know. The kids are into bad blood too. If the first show is any indicator, we are not only back on track, but the pace is faster than ever.<br/><br/>The first show wastes no time in having Bobby ill, selling Southfork, John Ross Junior bringing in a gusher, and Bobby's adopted son Christopher preaching alternate energy while finding out it is not all it is cracked up to be. The women are here, and the younger generation of them appear to be smarter and more agile than Sue Ellen and the older generation was, but yet have trouble digesting lies and handling the rift between John Ross Junior and Christopher.<br/><br/>Bobby and JR are still at it too, only it doesn't start that way and there are other matters which will be resolved on upcoming shows. How will the ratings be? According to JR in the promos, this recession is much worse than the 1970's which means more people will stay home and watch. Is JR right when it is TNT trying to carry on the lighted torch from the old CBS warhorse?",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,8.0,13 June 2012
1334,Dallas, This has a potential of being better than the original,"I started watching ""Dallas"" in the fall of 1978; frankly, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to watch Victoria Principal rise up out of the pool, practically bursting out of a black swimsuit. I quit watching ""Dallas"" the season after the death of ""Jock Ewing"" (the late, great Jim Davis). The show was never the same after Davis' death and the scripts began repeating themselves; only the characters involved changed (""JR"" and ""Bobby"" nearly die in a plane crash; ""Dusty Farlow"" is crippled in a plane crash; ""Pam's mother"" dies in a plane crash. Give me a break.) However, I couldn't keep myself away from watching the ""Dallas"" reunion a few years back; I was pretty shocked how bad Victoria Principal looked, though she still had that heart-stopping figure. Anyway, I was curious to see how the updated version would be; and I have to admit, I am pleased. While the epic dramatic tension and warmth has not yet appeared (and none of the women can hold a candle to the young VP), the plot machinations are, if anything, better than the original show. Clearly, ""John Ross"" and ""Christopher are MUCH more complex characters than ""JR"" and ""Bobby,"" and ""Elena"" (Jordana Brewster) promises to essay a much stronger woman than ""Pam Barnes (Victoria Principal)and clearly won't be saddled with the ""Goody Two-Shoes"" passivity which, I am sure frustrated Principal and led to her dramatic departure from the show. It is clear much of the dramatic conflict of future episodes will revolve around the ""lover's triangle"" of ""Elena,"" ""John Ross"" and ""Christopher,"" and that is a good thing. This trio promise to become compelling enough to eventually carry the show as ""Bobby,"" ""Sue Ellen"" and ""JR"" leave by attrition. After all, Larry Hagman is 80 years old and has been in poor health.<br/><br/>On a less positive note, I am really disheartened that David Jacobs, who created ""Dallas,"" has been, reportedly, very badly treated by the new show's producers. I believe that is a mistake, as I read Jacob's book, ""Dallas,"" which was published shortly after the premiere of the original show, and he is a VERY good writer. The book was much too raunchy for the 70s or 80s, but would past muster on any cable network now; though, even now, Jacobs' ""Dallas,"" would probably feel much more at home on FX than TNT. No bother; the raunchy elements were not what made ""Dallas"" compelling; Jacobs ability to create memorable characters and situations was. I'm sure he could still teach these new producers a thing or two about creating compelling television. That being said, ""Dallas"" 2012 shows great promise and is off to a very good start.

1337,Dallas, Great!,"Who'd have thought it? It looked doomed to disaster, but in fact it's great. It has exactly the same crazed atmosphere and bizarre plot twists as the original series. I never thought they'd crack it. <br/><br/>There's lots to love: Linda Gray seems to have metamorphosed into an anorexic animatronic puppet, with the skin precariously stretched over her face bones. You feel she might shatter at any moment - but she is still strangely attractive and fascinating to watch. She can still pack a punch as Sue Ellen. Admittedly in season two she undergoes a complete mentality switch in no time flat, but, hey, it's Dallas. Bobby and J R are still very good (though J R's just died here in the UK run). <br/><br/>Perhaps more importantly the two cousins are very good actors. Josh Henderson is great as John Ross. The make-up and hair department have let him down a little by overdoing the sleazy look - who'd buy a gallon of anything from this man? Jesse Metcalfe is the perfect counterfoil. He has a more difficult part to play as the goodie, since in drama is notoriously harder to make a goodie interesting. The young women are only so-so. Elena is just a younger and less interesting skeleton than Sue Ellen and Pam just pouts most of the time. Neither of them can hold a candle to Victoria Principal in her prime, or to Linda Gray. However, Brenda Strong is excellent and has the best acting ability on the set, at least among the women.<br/><br/>Don't cancel it, TNT.

With J.R. as creatively devious as ever and now schooling his grown son in how to be a rapscallion the wonderful deceit upon which Dallas is built and thrives is as cleverly contrived as it ever was. Saddened, of course, to learn of the death of Larry Hagman, but interested to see how they weave his death into the new season and wondering if they will be able to maintain the dynamic into a third season without J.R.

1343,Dallas, Dallas 2012 – Review,"Based on the original Emmy award-winning CBS show of the same name, the new series of Dallas, currently showing on Channel 5 in the UK, follows the lives of JR and Sue Ellen's son John Ross, and Bobby and Pam's son Christopher, as they battle it out over whether to drill for oil on the South Fork ranch, or look for more ""green"" energy sources in Texas.<br/><br/>That's the official blurb, now let's look at some of the fine detail. It's ironic that it's Larry Hagman who's been fighting with cancer off-screen, while it's Patrick Duffy's character Bobby who's battling with the disease on-screen – making it tempting to side with JR's team right from the off. Meanwhile poor old Larry is clearly struggling to learn his lines – reading every word painstakingly through bloodshot eyes from an off-camera autocue.<br/><br/>Do we care? No. We're so damned pleased to see JR back on our TV screens we wouldn't mind if Hagman played every scene with his script written in lipstick on the heavily botoxed forehead of Sue Ellen.<br/><br/>Should we be concerned that all the 20-something male actors in the cast look so similar to each other that it's often difficult to tell them apart and keep track of who's zooming who? Not really. And who gives a heck if Victoria Principal is too busy to do the gig at all, and Cliff Barnes can't even be bothered to show up until episode three? Dallas got as popular as it did in the UK partly because Terry Wogan talked about it so much on BBC radio. It was he who coined such immortal phrases as ""The Poison Dwarf"" and catapulted the series to the cult status it enjoys today. Thanks to Terry, the Brits learned to love Dallas like we love the Eurovision Song Contest. Because it was so bad it was good. Well, it's still bad, and it's still good.<br/><br/>In this new incarnation we can additionally enjoy JR's massive eyebrows. It is rumoured that they have already been offered a spin-off series of their own. But best of all, we can hungrily devour such classic lines as, ""I was gonna tell you about the earthquake, dad. Really I was."" Long live Dallas. Now that it's in High Definition we can more clearly see the irony.",9 out of 15 found this helpful.,8.0,18 September 2012
1344,Dallas," Of all sad words of tongue or pen, the saddest are 'It might have been!'","While the ""new"" Dallas could have been much worse, it could have been exponentially better. Having watched all three seasons of the reboot here are my random thoughts which I expressed succinctly in the title.<br/><br/>1. Without regard for their good looks, charm, and acting ability, Josh Henderson and Jesse Metcalfe both looked too young and behaved too immaturely to carry their roles. Both actors looked closer to 25 than 35 and this lack of gravitas is a problem. As the ""good seed"" Metcalfe was too light weight to be a be believable counterbalance to John Ross and bad guys in general.<br/><br/>2. As the new series began, J.R. should have been in power and pulling strings and pulling levers from behind a desk (as he always did on the original) instead of traipsing all over from Dallas, to Las Vegas to Mexico etc trying to make a comeback. By 2012 Larry Hagman was too old to carry off the role as it was written, but it was not the proper milieu for the character in any case.<br/><br/>3. The role of Christopher was poorly conceived and written. He was not a strong enough character to be the good guy in charge so an aging Bobby once more filled that role. It is a difficult task to be both nice and tough and Christopher/Metcalfe were not up to it. He spent most of his time being judgmental and self righteous with no redeeming qualities like strength and forgiveness.<br/><br/>4. The show would have benefited enormously if the producers had paid for the rights to show flashbacks from the original. That it would have been a synergistic relationship should have been obvious to all. The new show would have gained depth and purpose while the owners of the original would have sold thousands of DVD sets that they otherwise will not.<br/><br/>5. I understand the need to introduce new blood but a blizzard of new characters dislocated the center of the show which had stayed true throughout 13 years of the original. As interesting as the Ryland clan was, and it was fine to feature them as the bad guys for an arc or two, as continuing characters they foolishly compete with the Ewings. Why was this new family invented out of thin air and the McKays relegated to one smart-ass nerd who gets himself hung? <br/><br/>6. To continue in that vein, why wasn't the old Carter McKay part used? Even if George Kennedy was too feeble for even a short guest role, his daughter Traci could have had a son, or even Carter McKay Jr (remember when last seen, McKay was back with Rose who was of child bearing age). <br/><br/>7. Way too many drug goons. When ordinary folk mix it up with drug king-pins, the ordinary folk wind up dead. It beggars belief that the Ewings would ever engage people like that in a tit-for-tat kind of game. The on and on with the Mexican drug story-line is not credible. <br/><br/>8. Not enough oil. Dallas was always about oil, and so it should have remained. While its reasonable that alternative energy would be featured to some extent, OIL should have remained the focus of the Ewing family. <br/><br/>9. Not enough Texas. The original was best in those years when its focus was close to home. The more the various characters went globe trotting the less believable it all was. Pam trying to find her mother in Austin was interesting, while her looking for Mark Graison in Asia was groan inducing. Cliff Barnes as head of the Texas OLM was believable stuff. Cliff Barnes as national energy czar, not so much. Trying to be ""the biggest independent in the state of Texas"" which J.R. identified as his goal early in the original, was far more compelling than the later attempts to take Ewing Oil international etc. <br/><br/>10. There should have been more meaningful roles for old cast members and their offspring known and unknown. Was everyone who worked on the new show unaware that Bobby had a son with Jenna that Ray, presumably, raised? What about J.R.'s other kids, the Beaumont boy (and his son) and Cally's child (and heaven knows how many others given J.R.'s lack of restraint). <br/><br/>11. John Ross was too bitter toward his family. One episode he even spoke harshly about Miss Ellie which made no sense at all given his relationship with her as a child. His condescension toward Bobby was over the top. His sense of entitlement was embarrassing. His father was such a strong character because buried beneath all the evil scheming J.R. did have some charm, redeeming qualities and love for his family. <br/><br/>12. Like any show of this sort, Dallas needed a decent center, a core of characters that the viewer can count on to generally do the right thing. The new Dallas turned just about everyone into messed up sleazy creeps. Bobby's new wife should have been a rock instead of an unstable head case. Bobby himself stooped to levels he would never have contemplated on the original. <br/><br/>I liked the two young female leads. Obviously they are both gorgeous, but they are two very different types, decent actresses, and frankly deserved better treatment than they got from their male counterparts. Bobby and Sue Ellen were not used to their potential but they did OK. In fact that sums up my feelings very well, the new Dallas was ""OK"". I watched it out of a sense of loyalty to the original and because even though sometimes it was pretty bad, occasionally it hit the sweet spot and made the time investment seem worthwhile.<br/><br/>(first written in October 2014, updated and expanded April 2015)",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,6.0,1 October 2014
1345,Dallas, Better than the original,"It is not often that a series tops the original, but we've now seen it twice in the last couple of years. It first happened with Hawaii Five-O, and now it has happened again with Dallas. It is the perfect blend of both old and new cast members. It amazes me to see Larry Hagman at 80 years old still being able to do J.R. just as good as ever. John Ross is a chip off the old block, even though casting wise Larry is closer being more of a grandfather figure, than a father figure.<br/><br/>I am also glad they brought Patrick Duffy back as Bobby Ewing. He is an underrated actor, and it has been way too long since he'd been on screen. I like the mentoring storyline with Christopher about Bobby showing him how to do things the right way, and J.R. showing John Ross how to do them the sneaky, underhanded way.<br/><br/>I know a lot of folks want them to bring Pam back, but I don't think it is necessary. I'm liking Bobby and Annie just fine. I did like the appearances for Ray, Lucy, and Cliff.<br/><br/>I give credit to the youngsters Josh, Jesse, Julie, and Jordana. They've have been given the reigns to one of TV's all time greatest shows, and they are really making it work.

Well many of the original cast have major roles in this new version of Dallas and they work well with the new generation of Ewings. It feels so seamless and natural the way the new cast blends in with the old. And as you'd expect if you were a fan of the original version there is just as much drama and betrayal as ever.<br/><br/>A truly fantastic soap drama that turns out much better than you could have imagined.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,13 February 2014
1347,Dallas, Great so far but I want more characters and glamour,"I recall the original as I watched quite a bit of it as a child. I do think that Dallas 2012 has the potential to be even better than the old series as the story lines are more thought out. However I did love the original for the cheese and glam factor and it was a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>Its a good start so far and I'm so glad Bobby and JR Ewing are playing real-time ages and they help to build that nostalgic feeling along with the South fork ranch. The casting is good especially Jesse Metcalf as he really looks the part and surprisingly acts well too.<br/><br/>However the actress that plays Elena (Jordana Brewer)doesn't seem to fit the bill, she is too gaunt and skull-like (great description from another reviewer!)and this makes the love triangle seem unrealistic at times. If she put on even 7lbs she may look as good as she did in Fast and Furious, she looks old and haggard right now almost like a recovering anorexic.<br/><br/>Apart from that a good first series and I look forward to the season finale next week and hopefully not too long of a wait for season 2 hopefully with more glamour , good looking people and all the other trappings of the wealthy we love to dream about!",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,2 August 2012
1348,Dallas, Worth the suffering for Larry Hagman,"I'm 52... well, I was when I wrote this! I remember not only that JR was shot but that it had made the staid and rather conservative 9 o clock news on the BBC! Thus was the impact that this show had on it's UK audience! A FICTIONAL murder had made headlines on the national news.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the internet age and a new (less patient and more sophisticated) audience!<br/><br/>First - THANK YOU for keeping the original theme music and the opening graphics which were identical to the original but updated with newer cameras and of course... wide screen!<br/><br/>Another nod to the past was the highlight of plush interiors and lavish exterior shots. The show is, well... beautiful! And of course so are all the people in it...<br/><br/>(Finally a thank you for including Charlene Tilton. She was too often overlooked in the original series' but I always thought she was easily the most, erm... 'do-able' bird in the nest!)<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all the new characters are pretty unlikable. By which I mean - I didn't care either way if they got screwed over or did the screwing over! Of course, with a younger demographic footing the bills for TNT it was written and marketed towards a more youthful television viewer. But that said, the brilliant TV series ""REVENGE"" had more of the Dallas 'feel' about it than this offering did.<br/><br/>But a salvage crew was on hand, lead by the masterful and simply wonderful octogenarian Larry Hagman. Thankfully he had enough screen time and managed to keep me hooked. (How is this man even alive?) Others from the original series were equally welcome and really, that's why I stuck with it.<br/><br/>The premise of this outing is a bit preposterous and there's pretty much no subtlety to the direction of the plot. But the cast are capable and do a great job... It's not them that fail to make this series happen.<br/><br/>There are basically two elements missing for me... first is the characters. I didn't like any of them! Young beautiful people mired in melodrama and self absorbed lust for themselves. Not attractive! Second was the lack of a decent story.<br/><br/>That said... If Larry Hagman returns for a second series, I won't miss a second of it!",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,7.0,15 September 2012

It's so constant that I just don't care about her. I just want it to end, in any way possible. Mostly with Charlie winning.<br/><br/>Season 2 attempted to get 'acting' out of the kid. I just do not understand why producers, writers, directors etc. do not seriously consider the capability of a child to 'act'. It is a rare case when it is plausible and engaging, most of the time it is ruinous and this is yet another example. Plus he has a mustache, which is creepy on a child.<br/><br/>Most of the characters do that thing that TV / movies are all to famous for, they make constantly weird / crazy / stupid decisions. I get people might do odd things under times of duress, but all the time as a matter of course is just impossible to watch.<br/><br/>The only character that engages me is Charlie Manx and in season 2 we get some backstory which is great but it isn't enough.

However there is a lot of silly scenes like the wraith running down Margaret and she purposely run towards open spaces and avoids hiding behind the dozen or so cars she walks past. There a few scenes like that just seem to be poorly thought out.

1360,NOS4A2," Great book, awful series","Note to Hollywood producers: If you buy a good book, just stick to the book. Is it that hard? One of Stephen King's finest series of novels ('Mr Mercedes') was utterly butchered for TV. Poor casting for almost every major character, dreadful additions of plot that weren't in the book and just a travesty given how good the books were.<br/><br/>Now, with King's son Joe Hill's superb novel NOS4A2, we see a similar treatment. A fantastic book, wrecked by TV producers. Where to even begin with this? For a horror it's a slow as a wet week. The awful 'rubber mask' makeup and over the top voice for Manx really set the tone for the lack of attention to detail across the board with this.<br/><br/>Given how strong young actors were in Stranger Things, this needed to remain true to the book and have a young lead. Instead we have an Aussie actress who is 26 years old, playing an 18 year old, and she's obviously way too old for even this role. The actress playing her mother is a mere 10 years older than her, and they look closer to sisters than mother and daughter. Oh and the mother's accent! Yikes!<br/><br/>But why did the producers feel any need to suddenly maker Vic an angsty teen? Crazy choice. Suddenly we're burdened with all this high school melodrama and the feisty young character is now a whiny teen, played by a woman who's closer to 30 than she is to a teenager. She's the wrong actress at the wrong age, in the wrong part with the wrong director, using the wrong accent. She was great in Puberty Blues, but she's just lost in this show, and to be fair they did not give her a lot to work with.<br/><br/>The pace just drags as we get endless family arguments and a tedious sub plot about how hard it is to get into college - I mean who cares?<br/><br/>I highly recommend the book, but this is total garbage. Avoid!<br/><br/>I note that Joe Hill wrote another fantastic book called The Fireman which is also now in production as a movie or series. I would be very worried if I was Joe, because like his father, Hollywood rarely ever gets novels right and his legacy might be 'writes good books, which make terrible TV'.",121 out of 187 found this helpful.,2.0,4 June 2019

1369,NOS4A2, watching to see what happens to Millie..... Vic too unlikable,"This show has an interesting concept and the actors are very good. Quinto being the absolute standout of the show. He is exceptional as Manx. Bachrach, who plays Vic's dad, is so interesting to watch. Every time he's in a scene I want to watch more of him. Conforti, who plays Manx's daughter Millie, completely steals the show. One of the main reasons I'm still watching the show is to see more of Millie's background and what will happen to her. Her newfound interest in her childhood home and the world beyond Christmas land is a plot line I'm invested in.
The problems with the show have to do with unlikability of the protagonist (Vic) and the unbelievably in plot development. For instance: 8 years have passed between season 1 and season 2. When season 2 begins we see Vic as a loving mother. Flawed (active alcoholism) and emotionally damaged (b/c of her experiences with Manx 8 years prior) but still, it's obvious that she is a loving mother. We are also shown that she has a loving relationship with the man she met in season 1 and they have been raising her child together. In the next episode we see her leaving her man , whom she just made promises of marriage to, and leaving her child who she clearly loves a great deal. It doesn't click at all. It's portrayed as if she left because she's an alcoholic and because of her obsession with Manx. However, that doesn't work at all. I was not convinced.
The other plot point that is unconvincing is the relationship between FBI agent Romans (played by Tabitha Hutter, a stunning beauty) and Maggie (played by Jahkara Smith). In season 1 Maggie is an emotional wreck and drug addict who is so strung out Vic finds her sleeping near a dumpster. A plot point is bluntly inserted about Maggie's parents not accepting her homosexuality. It's not very well done at all. It comes across as virtue signaling to the audience rather than something we can empathize with Maggie about. Then in season 2 Maggie is seemingly completely off drugs, emotionally mature and in a committed relationship with FBI agent Romans. Even if the audience believes that Maggie has grown up and cleaned up in the 8 years that have passed it's not believable that an FBI agent would be interested in someone like Maggie. I'm sure that mature upstanding people fall in love with immature people all the time, but it's just not convincing here.
I'm still watching the show though, even though Vic has become quite unlikable (it's very hard to root for her) and the audience is being asked to believe in some not very well done plot points. As mentioned above I'm very interested in what happens to Mille and Manx.",14 out of 18 found this helpful.,7.0,22 July 2020

1374,Fantasy Island," ""Fantasy Island"" deserves better treatment!","After reading some of the earlier nasty remarks, I had to put in my two cents. This show was NOT, despite what that goon in Essex thinks, the worst thing that ever aired on TV. I think most of today's TV is much worse (when is this stupid ""reality"" fad ever going to end??) and there isn't a current show I can stand to watch. Gimme the stuff I grew up with. I'm a 1965 baby and not ashamed to admit it.<br/><br/>This show has been my all-time favorite for almost 30 years. I was in high school when it originally aired and I think it helped me to hang on throughout those miserable days. I was such a misfit back then, and ""Fantasy Island"" appealed to my imagination. As I was a budding writer in those days, it provided incredible opportunities for me to practice the craft. What a wonderful premise! I won't say it didn't have its faults. Sometimes the scripts were pretty bad, and some of the problems seemed trivial; but it could be good too, and it was a blast to watch and still is. As for the cheesiness factor, well, I think it's unfair to label every single 70s product as cheesy. There was a lot of great stuff back then and this was among the ranks. (BTW, most of the seasons aired in the 80s!!) My favorite episodes came from seasons 2, 3 and 4 mostly.<br/><br/>To those who disparage Hervé Villechaize for his heavy French accent and his short stature: GROW UP and LEARN SOMETHING! It's so easy to make fun when you're ""normal"" and ""perfect"". That man made the best of what he was dealt in life, and if you don't like it, that's just tough. Have a little compassion. He's been dead 15 years, and how easy it is to cut down someone who can't defend himself. There's just no shame anymore.<br/><br/>I love this show. So it looks dated. Hate to tell you this, but we didn't have splashy special effects and Blu-Ray discs. We were lucky to have VCRs. Live with it. Accept it for what it is, and that's just plain fun. ""Escapist TV"" describes it perfectly, and that's what it was for me -- an escape from my rotten real life.

1375,Fantasy Island," Hey, it wasn't that bad...","Notwithstanding a liberal dose of 70's cheese, I loved and love Fantasy Island--I actually learned a lot from the show, since they would occasionally base plots on Wuthering Heights, The Picture of Dorian Gray, The Most Dangerous Game, and so forth. Mr. Roarke made an interesting God figure, an idea they played up in a few episodes. Most compelling of all is the idea that people go off on vacation to get what they want, and end up instead with what they need. Trite? Yes-- despite the rotating guest stars, it was basically a series of mini-soaps. Mockable points? Bunches, especially if you enjoy that sort of thing. And all those people you just saw goofing about on the Love Boat suddenly turning up and doing something semi- serious for a third of an hour could produce a fair amount of cognitive dissonance.

The show's writers had imagination too show what you want can turn into a nightmare. Ricardo mentioned this line in every third show.  Ricardo, and Tatoo were well casted.  As I matured, I will agree with the other posts that the storylines were thin, the sets cheap, along with rushed directing and scripts.  Hard to watch again, but the what kept myself watching for a couple of minutes is some of the neat concepts, and the freshness of having new guests every week.

Fantasy Island brought them back all right, but showed them the downside of that era and I'll say no more on the story. The morale of that show was be happy in your own backyard.<br/><br/>Host and impresario of Fantasy Island was the mysterious Mr. Roarke played by Ricardo Montalban. In interviews Montalban said that he never got the real career role on the big screen that defined other of his contemporaries. But on the small screen Montalban got two of them, Mr. Roarke and Khan on Star Trek which went to the big screen also. What powers Roarke drew on to show his guests what they really thought was ideal was left open to the imagination.<br/><br/>For all but one season Montalban had his dwarf companion Herve Villechaize and these two had a gentle and playful repartee. Villechaize had a sad and tragic life, but Fantasy Island left him with a career role and an identity that will linger.<br/><br/>I could never see this show revived because Montalban and Villechaise had such a special chemistry for the small screen.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,7.0,23 June 2016

1383,Fantasy Island, Where all your fantasies come true and then screw with you.,"I watched a few episodes of this show when I was a kid and it most certainly was not a show I enjoyed all that much. It was one of those shows that the others in the household enjoyed watching, and when there is only one television you have no other choice than to watch it yourself or go play in your room by yourself. I usually chose to go into my room and play, but I watched a fair amount of episodes during my day. Not enough to rate the show, mind you, but enough to make a short review anyway. The most memorable thing about this show was when Herve Villechaize as Tattoo would announce the arrival of the plane bringing more unsuspecting dupes to the island where they were hoping to live out their fantasy, but usually ended up learning a valuable lesson instead. This show had many genres that could be attached to it including comedy, drama and even horror so while it was not a favorite of mine, I will say it did manage to at least be different. One never quite knew what to expect when the plane would drop the visitors off because the show could vary wildly. I remember one where the island had some sort of evil spirits floating around. So that is the thing, the show did things differently and was not by the numbers, so while not a favorite I can still acknowledge that it was unique for the time.",8 out of 13 found this helpful.,,29 May 2012

This show was a spin-off of Love Boat again with celebrity guest stars from other shows and a cast that included the wonderful Ricardo Montalban and Herve Villechaise who said the ""Plane, the plane"" in the beginning sequence of the show. Sadly, Herve killed himself. The show was never the same without him. I think the show provided lots of jobs to actors who probably needed the job outside their own shows. Of course, I remember the episode with Barbi Benton as a mermaid. It was pure fantasy but remember to be careful what you wish for because it might come true and it may not be all that you wanted in the first place.

As quality television, it didn't get a lot of respect from its peers but it was one of those cult like shows that had a following that seemed to die off quickly which explains why its almost impossible to find it anywhere in syndication.

1389,Fantasy Island," When ""Fantasy"" meets reality..........","The bloom has worn off this fondly remembered series of which the memories do not match up to the reality seen during reruns.  When the show first aired, it seemed like a lush, star-laden piece of wonderment and entertainment.  With its tropical setting, unique lead characters, eventful and varied stories and the parade of name actors each week, it was a hit that lingered in the memory for decades.  However, now, after so much has changed in television, the series often looks cheap, seems trite and inane and, worst of all, comes off as pretty dull!  Montalban (the essence of class, dignity and charisma) was forced each week to react to the unintelligible, unfunny ramblings of Villechaize (a freakish persona who looks like the dwarfed love child of Freddie Fender and Charo.)  These forced, ludicrous scenarios (shown just before the guest stars' names appear) are downright painful to watch (and even more painful to listen to with Villechaize seemingly deliberately placing emphasis on all the wrong words and syllables in his dialogue.)  Then the ""stars"" arrive and it is criminally clear that all of the shots of the leads were done separately at different times.  The primary characters never even met during the legendary opening arrival scenes!  (Even worse, the SAME shot of the SAME dancer and musicians is shown over and over and OVER week after week!)  Even though it is always fun to catch a glimpse of once-famous or almost famous celebrities in their waning years (or also to spot up and comers who often don't even get billing in these episodes), the storylines are, for the most part, beyond lame and hugely predictable.  Additionally, the cheap-jack production values (aside from the location filming that was used again and again and AGAIN) spoil a lot of the effect of the guest appearances.  Many times the celebs are lit with worse lighting than Donna Reed complained about when she was given the shaft on ""Dallas"".  The show is worth checking out if one is a completist for seeing a favorite guest actor or if almost nothing else worthwhile is on, but unfortunately the show simply doesn't hold up today. Still, even this beats the wrong-headed, flop, 1998 remake version that starred Malcolm McDowell.  Oh well, at least the customized red and white station wagons were fun.",5 out of 23 found this helpful.,,22 July 2003

Along with the 48 minute limit on the stories, the low budget, the passing parade of stars and the eternal happy endings. It doesn't matter. Of all the dross that made it on to the commercial channels in those days, this magical production stood out like a 3-bar chevron. The theme by Rosenthal created purely for Fantasy Island is given the best treatment by the studio orchestra and dubbing crew.

1395,The Thick of It, Calling this sharp and funny just doesn't do it justice.,"Calling this sharp and funny just doesn't do it justice. It's a bit of a cliché to describe it as ""Yes Minister"" for the 21st century, but it does fit rather well.<br/><br/>Any British person who has followed the news over the last few years will be painfully familiar with ""spin"" as practised by the current government of the United Kingdom. Where ""Yes Minister"" dealt with hapless ministers being manipulated by the civil-service mandarins (the power brokers of the time) ... ""The Thick Of It"" deals primarily with hapless ministers being manipulated by spin doctors (the current power brokers). Spot the difference? <br/><br/>Series one kicks off with the clinical execution of a cabinet minister (department of ""Social Affairs"") by the party communications director Malcolm Tucker, played to perfection by a fantastically high-powered and abusive Peter Capaldi. In comes the completely ineffectual Hugh Abbott (Chris Langham) as his replacement -- the most recent in a long line we are led to believe -- and off we go. It's a picture of near-total ineptitude. The business of government is to please the media, all the time under the baleful gaze of Tucker and his team of ferocious Rottweilers, and of course the 24 hour gaze of the media... forever on the lookout for stories. Useless empty policy statements, petty oneupmanship, and doing anything to please ""Number 10"", or the Chancellor at ""Number 11"" -- or rather not, since pleasing one side can bring down the wrath of the other as you are obviously part of a plot to undermine them. No, it's best just to churn out focus grouped policies that are bland enough not to upset anyone, all the while dreaming of advancement to departments that matter.<br/><br/>It's all desperately funny and insightful. There are no bad performances. Series one and two combined add up to just six half-hour episodes in total.

Particular praise must go to Rebecca Front, who I have always admired, but who has produced here an award-winning performance and I hope that she does receive recognition for this.

1398,The Thick of It, Excellent,"'The Thick of It' is slowly becoming more and more popular especially as political scandals are becoming more frequent in headlines. The writing, acting and dialogue are all strong points in this series. <br/><br/>The acting from people such as Rebecca Front, Chris Addison, Paul Higgins and of course Peter Capaldi are excellent. They don't all play particularly likable characters but that is the purpose of this show, to highlight the dark side of British politics. <br/><br/>Armando Ianucci's direction and scripts are excellent, the stories are very realistic and on some occasions this show has even managed to predict an actual occurrence in Westminster before it has actually happened, that is how intelligent this show is. If you have an interest in politics you will love this show, if you dislike swearing you will loathe it; the dialogue particularly from Capaldi's Malcolm Tucker is obscene nearly all the time, he provides about 75% of the comedy in this series. The show is quite unique because of the amount of swearing included within it, especially since it is a BBC programme. <br/><br/>The first and second series were good but the third series has been the best so far. The only thing missing from the third series was Paul Higgins' character Jamie MacDonald who had small parts in the first and second series and worked really well alongside Malcolm Tucker. The fourth series has now been shot and is scheduled to return later on this year (2012). <br/><br/>Overall, I would thoroughly recommend this TV series. People outside the UK may struggle understanding the plots of each episode, however. Its documentary style filming method takes a while to get used to but it suits the nature of the series perfectly. If you like this programme try 'In The Loop', the film based on this series, also starring Peter Capaldi, Paul Higgins and Chris Addison.",25 out of 29 found this helpful.,10.0,29 June 2012
1399,The Thick of It, Mortified!!,"I am mortified that I have only just picked up on this wonderful series in the past 6 weeks!! I had read that it was good but felt I couldn't commit to another ""must watch"" TV series. However against my better judgement I recorded one programme to see what all the fuss was about. I was totally blown away by the whole thing. I never really rated Peter Capaldi before this but the guy is a genius!! His intimidating, foul-mouthed character is some creation!! Whether it is him or Ianucci that is responsible, I do not know, but the end result is pure gold. Of course lots of viewers are going to find the bad language hard to get past but it really is worth it. I am rarely shocked by bad language but it shocked me - at first I found it gratuitous and almost switched off. However when you get into it the language seems (for the characters) just right and very funny. Who knows if this is the way that the people behind the scenes speak but it works. I actually know someone involved in politics on the Tory side (not my preference) and can believe in the Thick of It characters totally. I am addicted top it already and am about to get the series I have missed on DVD. Brilliant is not the word for it. People who berate the camera-work need to get a life.

1401,The Thick of It, Dry humor in maniacal proportions,"It is difficult to find comedies that elicit genuine laughter these days and The Thick Of It distinguishes itself. A cold open format demands attention right away before the humor seeps in; by the time you realize what your gut is in for, the crays in Department of ""Social Affairs"" have crept their way into your system. Every preemptive political misstep creates so much hysteria and disaster it's impossible for bystanders not to find amusement in the absurdity and idiocy of it all.<br/><br/>I am rather cautious about over hyped programs. Especially after feeling disappointed with The Office (UK), Little Britain and The Peep Show. But the lyrical filth snaps and pops too delightfully in this one to look away. Par course for the comic timing seized with perfection by Malcolm and Hugh.<br/><br/>Although The Thick of It functions as satirical commentary on the British government, I find that anyone with a soft spot for political feuds and human nature will relate to it, and thus enjoy watching. Unless plot points and character device are specifically designed to allude to real life figures/events in each episode (in which case, I'm too uninformed to ""catch""), you don't need sound knowledge of UK's current affairs to ""get it"". Much like how you don't need to be black or American to acknowledge the simple premise behind The Wire—classic institutional dysfunction and media consumption. Only difference between the two being the latter is a slow-burning novelistic tale layered with stoic horror, while the former flips like a sprightly comic book punctuated with wags and wit.<br/><br/>Issues such as uninspired leadership, reluctant lackeys, chasing ranks, falsifying stats and information are things that guide and obstruct real progress within any system. In this sense, I think the appeal of The Thick Of It is universal. That the self-involved, self-defeating, borderline-sociopathic qualities harassing its spin doctors promptly blow up in their own clueless faces is just icing on the cake. Dry humor in maniacal proportions with accurate insights into the bureaucratic condition are worth the viewer ship. One season in and I think The Thick Of It is absolutely winning and hilarious.",17 out of 20 found this helpful.,8.0,16 January 2013

But on the other hand - and this is what elevates The Thick of It above being just a really good comedy - it also delivers heavy doses of cynicism, social commentary and character drama, and this becomes apparent as the show hurdles toward its dramatic conclusion.<br/><br/>The first three seasons - which are made up of only fourteen episodes between them - are almost entirely comedic and light in tone, and while still immensely entertaining it doesn't prepare the audience for the almost shockingly dark and bleak undertones of the final season... but that's what makes the series' conclusion - specifically the final three episodes - so brilliant and boldly original. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the humour is still there, and I'd even say that the fourth season is the funniest of them all, but from the very beginning of season four there's this creeping feeling of cynicism and barely controlled anger, a feeling that gradually builds and builds until it erupts first in the climactic scenes of the penultimate episode - a uniquely formatted one-hour installment that deals with the damaging inquiry into a public servant's suicide - in the form of Malcolm - the series' most iconic and popular character - unleashing a scathing, furious outburst about the moral degradation of 21st century politics, and then in his final confrontation with Ollie when he all but emotionally breaks down and reveals how empty his life is. <br/><br/>While for over a dozen episodes we've laughed at Malcolm and his brilliantly creative insults, the final two episodes reveal the deeper, sadder depths of the character's heart, and the story of his rise and fall in British politics is reminiscent of many of Shakespeare's great tragedies, Macbeth being the most recognisable and pointed comparison. I'll likely never forget just how powerful Malcolm's closing scenes are, where he begs Ollie to keep the media away from him so he can have a dignified exit from politics, but Ollie without hesitation betrays Malcolm, leading to a moment of immense shame for the once mighty figure of Malcolm Tucker, and the final image of a broken and defeated Malcolm riding away in a car as the media turn on him like a pack of hungry wolves.<br/><br/>The reason that not many pieces of fiction have deserved comparisons to Shakespeare is because most of them forget one of the key things that made Shakespeare great; the wit. The Thick of It has that in spades, but rather than that lessening the dramatic impact of certain scenes, it actually aids them in being even more powerful and resonating.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen this masterful British comedy/drama, I cannot recommend it highly enough. It's only 21 episodes (with two other great one-hour specials that form a connection between seasons two and three) and it's completely addictive. I'd be surprised if it took anyone more than a week to finish the entire series.<br/><br/>Truly one to be remembered.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,26 April 2016
1412,The Thick of It, The acting is great!,"It took me a while to realize whether it's a documentary filmed with a hidden camera or not. When I saw Armando Ianucci's name, I understood what I was watching, the guy is a super director.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,24 August 2018
1413,The Thick of It," Hey, Malcolm, go die in a grease fire!","Now that I've got that off my chest...no, really, I've known more than my share of real-life sadistic soul-murdering bastards along the lines of Malcolm Tucker who use their workplaces as their personal dungeons, which is why I avoided this series like the plague until a couple of months ago, when a friend convinced me it was essential viewing for Capaldi watchers. I do think it's a measure of Capaldi's talent that in a similar manner to what Anthony Hopkins did with Dr. Lecter and Hugh Laurie with Dr. House, he succeeded in making an essentially repulsive character into something relatable, even something of a folk hero. The ethics of doing so is another matter, as we live in an era where the ability to crush other humans without turning a hair is the most highly valued talent of all, which is why characters like this play so well with 21st century audiences. But Capaldi had to do something while he was waiting for his chance to play the Doctor, which one season in to Doctor Who is clearly the role he was born for, and Malcolm's not bad as roles go, sort of Capaldi's generation's equivalent of Ian Richardson's in ""House of Cards,"" with his vulgar catchphrase ""Come the f!@# in or f!@# the f!@# off"" equivalent to the aristocratic Francis Urquhart's ""I couldn't possibly comment."" <br/><br/>Which leads indirectly to the burning question, why does Malcolm eat fruit? Given his age, personality and build he seems more like the type who would chain smoke than engage in emotional eating. My theory is that he actually did smoke but was warned that if he didn't stop he would drop dead by the age of fifty, and that he ought to make an effort to take better care of himself, like eating more fresh fruit. So Malcolm has a crate of tangerines delivered every few weeks and grabs one whenever he feels like smoking. He's probably also got nicotine patches all over his arms the way Sherlock does. Which is really a shame because Malcolm is exactly the sort of person who SHOULD drop dead, the sooner the better, because he's no good to anyone including himself. Note that that his brutal style of managing his government's communications is grossly ineffective, only serving to demoralize the people he's supposed to be helping do their jobs. Also note that he screws up as often as the people he's constantly raging at for screwing up, and seems completely unaware of it. That's because he's focused on process rather than outcome: the process of controlling, immiserating and destroying the people in his charge, and of eating enough tangerines so that he can keep doing it as long as possible. The fact that he's helping to render his own government dysfunctional seems unremarked by everyone, certainly by whoever's protecting him at the top. That's the way it is with bullies, and that by the way is why we shouldn't be applauding them, but taking them down.",4 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,12 February 2015
1414,The Thick of It, Fantastic.,"What a fantastic series. Having seen Veep, definitely plays in the same ballpark, but it's edgier, darker, and meaner. The whole cast is absolutely fantastic. Capaldi is unbelievable in the role, already one of my all-time favorite comedic performances ever TV. Rebecca Front enters the series halfway and almost steals the whole thing. First two seasons are really good, but it's the last two that really resonate and make the whole thing hit another level. Great stuff. In The Loop is fine, but doesn't hit these levels. I find it especially impressive when a cast in a series knows they're in a comedy but know they have to play everything absolutely straight.

1417,The Thick of It, Brilliantly muddy,"It is fabulous but definitely not that funny.

These people have no vision whatsoever. They can advocate a solution today and exactly the reverse on the following day. They can be gross and pretend they are dainty, or just plain liars and let you know they are suffering so much because they told a lie because they could not avoid telling such a lie because otherwise their wives, husbands, spouses, boy or girl friends, plain friends, children pets or even gold fish, or whatever, would have suffered in a way or another if they had not changed positions and convictions during the night and over the week end. Then you end up wondering why they are in their position of power, who in hell elected them, and you suddenly realize you elected them by not voting at all or by wasting your vote on a marginal side-kick candidate. After seeing such a perilous voyage in the stormy waters of political intrigue and the schizophrenic superman complex, you can only finally decide to vote for the good side next time. But is there a good side? Can we vote for Head without seeing that Head entails Tail, or vice versa? The only thing that changes in these people are not the teeth but the dentures. They all bite abundantly with steel or gold but always with gusto since for them the public is a piece of meat and the media are the pepper and the salt of the barbecued beef.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID",8 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,3 June 2009

1423,Baghdad Central, Excellent and mind blowing,"I found the acting to have been very exciting and the story extremely intriguing . Being of Iraqi origin, myself living and working in Uk for over 20 years, and having watched the whole series, I can say that it made me feel very sad as I have been moved by the story and acting. It did bring back loads of memories. I miss the old Iraq very much and wish for it to return.<br/><br/>The actor, Khafaji was brilliant, so as the rest of the Arabic, British and American actors. Fast moving events and needed to concentrate, so as not to miss a single action. I liked the unpredictability of the events. I did find it very strange for the Arabic actors to not have a proper Iraqi accent which is bit of a shame. I think that the series would have become much better if it incorporated Iraqi actors. As I speak fluent Arabic, Iraqi accent, it was not difficult for me to follow the events at all. I understand why other non-Arabic speaking people have found it difficult to follow the translation as it contained fast moving events and sometimes it was difficult to follow if trying to read the translation. I watched the whole series (6 episodes) over two days. I don't remember when was it the last time I enjoyed watching anything on television that much. I watched it with my son who is 14years old, who doesn't understand Arabic, but he didn't struggle at all with the translation and he thought it was great.<br/><br/>I rated it 10/10 as I liked the story, the actors and mainly Khafaji.

1426,Baghdad Central," ""We should have resisted Saddam""","The movie was interesting from the very start. Showing how eager the Iraqis were to be free of the terrible reign of Sadaam Hussein.
The movie also drew attention to the numerous factions in Iraqi society fighting over power and control of neighborhoods in Iraq that made peace so difficult.
A few things I felt missed the mark:
Too much reliance on Moroccan culture and not enough Iraqi influence.
The actors shook theirvheads the wrong way for yes and no.
The lack of InshaAllah in the movie. In Iraqi society of the time , instead that's life etc.
A lot of blame for problems was put on Private Security firms, who weren't perfect, but they weren't as corrupt as portrayed. The film often used the term mercenary over and over.
The best part of the film showed Iraqis wishing they had done something to resist Sadaam' regime before the liberation was necessary.<br/><br/>Otherwise great entertainment and a god stab at trying to reflect the lives of Iraqis after Sadaam.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,3 April 2020

I sense this is for the US market which is in total keeping with the message that the story tells about ineptitude and hubris in an occupation which failed as comprehensively as the military triumphed in the war which preceded it.

So far, so obvious but the 'good guys' are all a bit conflicted, including our hero, the superb Waleed Zuaiter. Was he complicit in Saddam's regime? What actually happened this son? Nothing is obvious here. Some great characters and peerless acting. Bertie Carvel almost steals the show as the slimey Frank Temple and Carey Stoll is very good as the basically decent Captain Parodi. It is the various actresses who play key protagonists who smash it though. The enigmatic Professor (goodie or baddie???) is brilliantly played by Clara Khoury and Leem Lubany as Sawsan is a revelation.

1439,Baghdad Central, A superior crime drama set in 2003 Baghdad,"Prior to the invasion/liberation of Iraq Muhsin al-Khafaji was an inspector in Saddam Hussein's police force; now everything has changed and he is out of a job. He wasn't a supporter of the old regime but was a party member as it was a requirement of his position; now it disqualifies him. When his estranged daughter disappears he starts investigating. He is then approached by Frank Temple, a British man working to set up a new Iraqi police force. Frank doesn't care about the past he just wants a good investigator. He also offers to get Muhsin's other daughter treated in a coalition hospital. An American contractor is found dead in a 'safe house' and our protagonist is to investigate. He uncovers corruption amongst both locals and westerners which puts him in real danger; this doesn't dissuade him from investigating though.<br/><br/>I can't say how real the portrayal of life in Baghdad is but what is depicted here feels real. The story is gripping and provides a good mix of drama, mystery and excitement. The most refreshing aspect was that our protagonist is an Iraqi not one of the various western characters. There is a degree of ambiguity about him even though the viewer will almost certainly see he is a good man; the sort his country will need if it is to recover. Waleed Zuaiter does a really fine job in the role. The rest of the cast are solid too, notably Bertie Carvel as Temple and Corey Stoll as US Army Captain John Parodi. I liked the fact that when characters were meant to be speaking in Arabic the actors spoke Arabic (with subtitles) rather than accented English. I read, after watching the series, that a deliberate attempt at balancing genders and Iraqi to western characters had been made; while watching I never thought about it so the creators succeeded in doing it in a way that didn't feel forced... these were just the characters involved.

The incidental music really doesn't help in this regard.<br/><br/>The central performance is great, but some of the supporting cast are hamming it up something chronic.

All was going well... until Tim injected the Novocaine into himself and not his patient. Various parts of his body went numb. I remember him slapping his dangling right hand with his left--the numb hand swung back and forth like a half-filled water balloon. Then the left half of his face went slack. Then the right. The his right leg gave out and he had to sit on the chair with Harvey. I don't think I've ever laughed so hard, and poor Harvey almost slid out of his chair with laughter. A class act, all the way.

1447,The Carol Burnett Show," Classic show, classic people, classic memories","The Carol Burnett Show was one of the most fabulous shows ever on TV, and certainly the best of its type, the variety show, which is gone now. Carol, her delightful ensemble cast of Vicki Lawrence, Harvey Korman, Tim Conway, and her many guest stars always delivered a great show.<br/><br/>What stands out for me is her film takeoffs, and on this board, I'm sure that's what stands out for most of us. I had the misfortune of seeing ""Mildred Fierce"" before I saw the real ""Mildred Pierce."" So I laughed all the way through Mildred Pierce. Torchy Song and her marvelous Joan Crawford - when I saw Mommie Dearest, all I could think of was Carol Burnett. Sunset Boulevard - when I saw the movie after seeing her takeoff, she was all I could think of.<br/><br/>But there was one movie takeoff that beat them all - Gone with the Wind. An absolute classic. If Carol Burnett had in her entire career only walked down those stairs wearing the rods still in the drapes and said, ""Thank you. I saw it in the window and I just couldn't resist it,"" it would have been enough to make her a superstar. The skit was so brilliant that I can still remember watching it at home when friends came by to pick me up. They started watching it and laughing, too. When a commercial break came, one of my friends said, ""Okay, let's go."" Everyone moaned that they wanted to see the rest of it. My friend objected, saying, ""It's going to be hours - they haven't burned Atlanta yet."" The skit was so complete, he was sure he was watching a takeoff of the entire film.<br/><br/>I don't know why there isn't a place on television now for this kind of show, but I can hazard one guess. Burnett did takeoffs on the film The Heiress, Til We Meet Again, Mildred Pierce, Torch Song, Sunset Boulevard - if she was on TV today, no one would laugh because they wouldn't know what she was doing. I'm sure most people have never seen most of those films - certainly not enough to keep her on the air. It's an amazing thing to think about how the world has changed. I'm glad I was in the world before it did.",29 out of 36 found this helpful.,,29 September 2005
1448,The Carol Burnett Show," Wonderful show, delightful woman!","Being born in France in the early 70's, I wasn't aware of this show called ""The Carol Burnett Show"". I didn't even know this woman. I saw her for the first time last year in a ceremony where she received an achievement prize. But it is when I saw the 50th Anniversary Special hosted by Stephen Colbert last autumn that I started to really get interested because they showed sketches of the show. You Americans must stop hiding those talents from us! So I gathered so many shows I could find and I have to say that they are a delight to watch! There are some pretty awesome burlesque sketches in it and a lot of humanity too. And if you love the 70's, oh boy, you travel right back to that blessed period of time. And I have to mention the wonderful costumes made by a certain Bob Mackie. This guy is simply a genius! Some costumes look like Gaultier or Lacroix 20 years before!
I love Carol Burnett and I am very happy to now know this great performer!",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,9 January 2018
1449,The Carol Burnett Show, The Greatest Sketch Comedy Ever,"This was definitely the finest variety show of the 1970's.  The thing that made it great besides the cast were the various recurring sketches that were very expertly created.  Sketches like Tudball and Wiggins, the Old Folks, As the Stomach Turns, the kid sister and, of course, Eunice, which was the inspiration for the series ""Mama's Family"", helped to make this variety hour a classic.  Besides ""Mama and Eunice"" any one of these shows could have become a series on its own.  The only thing that caused the show to go downhill though was when Harvey Korman left.  He was probably the best player among the supporting cast and when he left the show declined from there.  Still, Saturday nights for me would always climax with this classic show.",19 out of 23 found this helpful.,,3 October 2003
1450,The Carol Burnett Show," The best show in TV history, bar none","The Carol Burnett Show, a.k.a. Carol Burnett and Friends, is my favorite show in TV history, without question. It made me laugh endlessly with its sketch comedy. For me, the best comedy revolves around lines that often seem ad libbed; the spontanaety often results in some of the best humor around. What also made this show special was Tim Conway's deliberate ad libbing of lines and actions to try to make the other actors bust up laughing. A classic example of this is when Conway, playing a NAZI officer in one sketch, tries to interrogate a POW (Lyle Waggoner) with an Adolf Hitler Puppet doll.<br/><br/>Whether its Tim Conway as Uncle Waldo, Carol Burnett as ""Missus Uh-Wiggins"" or ""Eunice"", Jim Nabors as Yung Fool, or Vicki Lawrence as Mama Harper, this show's absolutely priceless.",23 out of 30 found this helpful.,,18 January 2004
1451,The Carol Burnett Show, The BEST comedy series of all time!,"Half of the fun of watching Carol Burnett and Friends was watching the actors and actresses try to maintain straight faces during their skits, even when on the inside they were dying to burst out laughing. What made this series funny is that the actors and actresses ad-libbed most of their lines.  This way, even the other actors didn't know what would be said next. I've seen many episodes of this show and each one of them keeps me laughing.  This is comedy at it highest, at a time when humor was based on slapstick humor and the totally unexpected instead of sexual one-liners.  If you ever get a chance to see this show, watch it.  You won't be disappointed--especially if you're fortunate to see the episode where Lyle Waggoner is a prisoner of war in WWII interrogated by German officers Harvey Korman and Tim Conway.",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,,28 August 1999

Each Saturday at 10pm, Carol and the aforementioned regulars, along with some 'special guest stars' (such as Steve Lawrence, Betty White, Roddy McDowall, and Julie Andrews, to mention a few) would sing, dance, and perform the absolute funniest skits ever seen on American television.<br/><br/>Who could forget Carol's ""Eunice"" constantly being belittled and nagged by Vicki's ""Momma""? Carol's ""Mrs. Wh-Whiggins"" was a riot, along with Tim's ""Mr. Tudball"", and perhaps the funniest segments were those with both Tim and Harvey. The audience never seemed to mind it when Harvey lost control and laughed out of character.<br/><br/>Today's Hollywood elitist performers could learn a lot from this classic TV show: Carol Burnett and her co-stars entertained us for ten years without foul language, tasteless humor, sexual innuendo, or inserting politics. On the contrary, Tim, Harvey, Vicki, and Carol conducted themselves as professionals.<br/><br/>This show is classic American comedy for all ages.

This was a great cast of highly talented people not just the beloved star, Carol Burnett. Her former husband Joe Hamilton produced the show. Her friends like Harvey Korman, Tim Conway, Vicki Lawrence, and Lyle Waggoner were all uniquely talented and gifted. We can see why this show thrived. Most of the cast were there from beginning to end. After 11 years of superb Emmy winning and golden globe episodes, the show is available on DVD and can be seen on TV Land where it belongs with some of television's classics. It is still a classic.

However, most of what we were treated to was, if not funny, at the very least intelligent and amusing entertainment.<br/><br/>Without any doubt, the show provided some very memorable moments and characters. One of the most noteworthy being ""The Family"", which the NBC's Mama's Family was developed from.<br/><br/>The star herself is one of the most classy and cognitive performers ever to grace the screen, and the show was certainly a reflection of this.

1457,The Carol Burnett Show, Gen X especially but baby boomers too-great on many levels,"Thanks, Peacock, for showing free (a few ads-a 5th of the length of network television commercial breaks) full seasons of The Carol Burnett show. I know Amazon Prime has TCBS as well but not everyone wants to pay for (another) streaming service-if they have a service at all, it's probably Netflix.
So far they've only got the first three 1967-69 seasons, and hopefully they'll have the rest of the series through 1978 soon. That, apart from its genuine humor &amp; cleverness &amp; genuinely funny dialogue, is what adds to the enjoyment of watching this- the later 1960's &amp; 70's aura TCBS has. It's so cool, at least to people like myself, who just missed not being alive or too young to appreciate the feel of that time (which you don't realize at the time, obviously). It's a lot less wacky than I remembered, which is a good thing. A little more risqué that I remembered and that's also a good thing. Watching this show (which are mostly aired in the order and length they were originally) and grouped by season/years is much more enjoyable than those ""Best of Carol""-esque DVD compilations they were hawking 10+ years ago. And streaming so far on this new service has been great, except for the fact that the rest of the show's 8 additional seasons besides these are not yet here. If you love early 70's, everyday hairstyles &amp; clothes, but some of its now-garish looking outfits are still groovy af. And again, it contains many less weaknesses in the sketches comprised mostly of funny dialogue reflective of what was going on in the world vs. the physical. Some of the ""was that a double entendre?"" humor sometimes leads to bemused eye raising, like ""wow, they went *there* in 1970? Awesome.""",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,9.0,30 July 2020
1458,The Carol Burnett Show, Great Chemistry--Great Show,"Was there ever a better sketch comedy hour than this one. For eleven years, Burnett and fabulous company made each week a laugh fest. Only seldom did a sketch fall flat. Thus, success is also due the writers who had a firm grasp of cast and material. And what a cast— the infinitely versatile Carol, the perfect counterpart Korman, the inimitable Vicki Lawrence, and the goofy Tim Conway. Together, their chemistry year after year was darn near perfect. I did feel sorry for handsome Lyle Waggoner who never appeared to have a defined role to play. I'm glad he settled in with the Wonder Woman series. The icing on the cake, however, was when Conway replaced him, and the laughs really gelled.<br/><br/>My favorites among the sketches—anything where a loony Carol descends stairs with a coat hanger for shoulders; the hilarious take-off on dysfunctional families with Eunice and Ed and snap-dragon Mama; and anything where Carol gets to do an eye- bulging impersonation. Guest stars also shone at times—Steve Lawrence was particularly good at tough talking thugs, while Jim Nabors did his slow-witted hick to perfection.<br/><br/>I suspect one reason for the show's longevity was Carol's obvious rapport with ordinary folks, like her audiences. None of the Hollywood celebrity about her, and somehow I expected to find her in my supermarket checkout line. Thanks Carol and Company.

1461,The Carol Burnett Show, From Television City in Hollywood,"""THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW"",was an eleven year staple of CBS Television. During its run on the air,the show was the second-oldest prime-time series in the history of television,and the third longest-running musical-variety-comedy show on the air,which premiered on the network September 11,1967 and ending its astounding run on April 12,1978. It is in an era in which variety shows were rapidly disappearing from television,THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW,survived for more than a decade. The life span for other variety series in the 1970's rarely exceeded two or three seasons,and their total number had dwindled substantially from the heyday of variety shows in the 1950's and well into the 1960's. Only Carol Burnett managed to remain popular and successful which prove to be a solid ratings winner for CBS. The small nucleus of her regular cast remained constant for several years,with none of her original supporting troupes leaving until 1974(which consisted of actors Harvey Korman,Lyle Waggoner,and Vicki Lawrence). It was their chemistry that helped hold the show together. The binding force,however,was Carol Burnett herself,who was one of television's most versatile performers,who could sing,dance,act,clown,and mime with equal facility. Over the years,certain basic aspects of the show remained the same. There was in one point in each telecast,usually at the beginning,when Carol and the evening's guest star would answer questions from the studio audience,which was based from CBS Television City Studios in Hollywood. The comedy sketches to this day are considered ""comedy classics"" and let me explained way.<br/><br/>From comedy sketches that spoof TV shows,I do mean shows from the decade of the 1970's,popular movies,or other forms of mass entertainment that made THE CAROL BURNETT SHOW one of the most loved variety shows of all time. One of the most loved comediennes performers to this day. Several sketches are consider classics including ""As The Stomach Turns"",""Went With The Wind"",""Mr. Tudball and Mrs. Wiggins"",and lets not forget the classic sketch of ""Ed and Eunice""(which several years later ran as a series titled ""Mama's Family"" during the 1980's),which starred Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman as an uptight married couple constantly at odds with Eunice's mother,played brilliantly by Vicki Lawrence. Many more sketches were just as hilarious and were uplandishly funny.<br/><br/>Speaking about the cast,only actors Vicki Lawrence and Carol Burnett remained throughout the show's entire 11-year run. Lyle Waggoner left the series in 1974 to pursue other interests,particularly starring opposite Lynda Carter in the ""Wonder Woman"" series of the 1970's. It was there that after Waggoner left the show in 1974,other frequent guests included Jim Nabors,one of Carol's closest friends,and also actor Ken Berry. However,during the show's 1975-1976 season,that guest star Tim Conway joined the regular cast in the fall of that year and would remained until the show's final season,ending in 1978. The heartbreak came during the show's final season(1977-1978)that actor Harvey Korman decided to leave the series,which was a loss that was felt deeply by the entire cast. He was replaced by long time guest star Dick Van Dyke,who left the show three months after he had arrived. He was replaced by semi-regular guest stars Ken Berry and Steve Lawrence,but the ratings were beginning to slip dramatically. By the fall of 1978,after eleven years on the air,the show was about to face an upcoming end. The series final episode was a two-hour finale that premiered on April 12,1978. However,repeats were aired during the summer of 1978,and during the summer of 1979,and later into syndication under the title,""CAROL BURNETT AND FRIENDS"",which were edited into a series of half-hour shows from the original series to be repeated for local stations.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,,25 February 2005

1465,The Carol Burnett Show," lbliss314 is right . . . ""Must See TV"" WAY before NBC thought of it . . .","lbliss314 - I just read a short interview with Carol Burnett in which she discussed the unbelievable amount of work that went into this legendary show, and the utter impossibility of doing something like this on a weekly basis today. The cast of 6-ish, the full orchestra (Nelson Riddle, if I'm not mistaken), the 50 fabulous costumes per week (by, of course, Bob Mackie), the 6 - 8 sketches/numbers per week that had to be written, rehearsed, set to music, and performed live - WITH guest stars . . . it just went on and on and on. The bottom line: No, this could NOT be pulled off today - it would be prohibitively expensive, and require a small army of people. But boy, I'm so glad we had this time together. This came along during my childhood, so I had to beg to stay up late, too. When I was a child, I spent most Saturday nights with my grandparents, and I was trying to remember that fantastic Saturday night lineup. I remember Mary Tyler Moore throwing that beret in the air (of course, back then I had no idea the HUGE cultural shift that represented); I remember Bob Newhart walking past the ""Picasso horse"" in Chicago to work; and I remember Carol, but I couldn't put it all together. I knew this would be the place to come. You're right . . . CBS on Saturday Night was ""Must See TV"" WAY before NBC thought of it. I always wondered why Carol was never able to reignite that spark . . . it seemed like her ""light"" was dimmed before its time. I think the loss of Harvey Korman, together with Carol's personal ""issues"" (I seem to remember big trouble with her daughter, husband, AND parents . . . remember the ""National Enquirer"" debacle?) sent her into retirement way before her time. Like several others here said, I really wish they would collect the FULL show on DVD, not just edited-for-syndication snippets. But what a ride it was for 11 years . . . of course, everyone remembers ""Went With the Wind"" and ""Mildred Fierce"" (I can't even watch the original movies, because I think of Carol Burnett the entire time), ""Missus Awhiggins"" . . . and my personal favorite, ""Mama and Eunice,"" which was just brilliant at times (esp. with guest stars like Ken Berry, Betty White, and Jim Neighbors). I remember an episode of Mama and Eunice where Eunice tried out for (and was cut from) a ""reality TV"" show, and it was as moving as anything ""serious"" on TV.

This is a good thing.<br/><br/>Carol has a great talent which really showed when she would often come out &amp; take questions from her live studio audience. While the show was taped, it was done at CBS studios in front of a live audience much the same as Red Skelton did for many years in California. While Carol was always the star, she never minded sharing the air with some fantastic support.<br/><br/>The now late Harvey Korman, one of the great second bananas in comedy history whose memory now has a spot for all of us.

Vicki Lawrence, Carols alter ego on this show and often the seemingly straight female while Lyle Waggoner seems to be the male that fit this role.<br/><br/>As the show went along, Vicki learned more about doing comedy. Lyle went on to play opposite Wonder Woman. In a way, while Gleason created one sketch with this format which became ""The Honeymooners"", Carols crew did the same with ""Mamas Family"" which still runs a lot in syndication. I am hoping the DVD folks can get some of these seasons of Carol intact on DVD's soon as there were some great shows.

1467,The Carol Burnett Show, One of our favorite variety shows from the 1960s and 1970s.,"Carol Burnett is a talented singer and comic actress, and I don't doubt that she could have had a successful one-woman TV show.

Before Saturday Night Live ever existed, Carol and her regulars were putting on hilarious short skits.<br/><br/>Tim Conway was arguably the most inventive and funniest guy on TV back then, and maybe even in the history of TV. He had this way of crawling into the character he was playing and make it completely off beat. Add to that all the ad libbing he did, and in many episodes you could see the others on stage with him barely restraining their laughter. <br/><br/>Harvey Korman was also a jewel in the crown of her show. He was not as inventive as Conway, but was mostly effective as an ensemble player, and often the butt of Conway's humor.<br/><br/>Vicki Lawrence was an interesting cast member. I remember when she was added. Carol was looking for a 'look alike' to play her sister, and Vicki was chosen from among a group being considered. She was not new to show business and even has a hit record on her own. She joined the troupe and became a TV success eventually with her own show.<br/><br/>The list of funny and talented personalities that joined Carol on her show at various times is almost endless, but some of my favorites were Ken Berry, Joel Grey, Dick Van Dyke, Lyle Waggoner, Nanette Fabray, and Jim Nabors, trained operatic singer who became famous as Gomer Pyle.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,2 January 2005

1472,Defiance, Learn from Firefly,"I have read reviews on this site by viewers who do not like Defiance, sometimes comparing it to Firefly. Granted, Firefly is a great show, but what did we learn from its early departure from TV? The network wanted Firefly to capture the minds of its viewers quickly, so they did not air the first episode first. Believing that a more action-packed episode would grab new viewers more quickly, they shuffled the episodes--a strategy that alienated viewers and led to the show's demise. When I read criticisms about the pace of Defiance's first episode, I say let the show develop and see where it goes.<br/><br/>Now that we have seen a number of episodes, I for one am glad I stuck with Defiance. Here are some of my reasons:<br/><br/>1. It has an array of interesting characters. They are not interesting only because the different races are interesting. Each character is well developed and multi-layered. They are not one dimensional--all good or all bad---but portray strengths and frailties, positive and negative traits.<br/><br/>2. The cast is wonderful. Starting with Graham Greene, you have Grant Bowler (Hank Rearden in Atlas Shrugged)and Mia Kirschner (great in The L Word) Julie Benz and Stephanie Leonides, etc.<br/><br/>3. The music. I have particularly enjoyed some of the songs they have used as background, masterpieces of mood.<br/><br/>4. The innovation. Some have criticized the weaponry or languages used, for instance. But the action does not take place on an alien world, so it makes sense that the weapons are a combination of past and future, mixed with earth-based technologies (same with the vehicles). Considerable time was spent devising different languages for this show. I find them interesting but not distracting.<br/><br/>5. The various cultures represented are deeply portrayed, with their own music, rituals, prayers, languages, religions, prejudices, and personality tendencies.<br/><br/>6. Although the various races/cultures have distinctive features, characters still seem to live in the same world, coping with the same issues. As one character said, ""In this world we live in, there's no place for the fragile."" Everyone who has survived to exist in Defiance bears the scars of their struggles, literal and figurative. Defiance is named after the town/valley where it is set, and everyone in Defiance seems to believably come from the same town, living in a hard-won and dynamic harmony of different voices.<br/><br/>7. Defiance is a show about values. Love can overcome bigotry. Cooperation produces better results than warfare. These are examples and I am sure we will encounter more as the show continues.<br/><br/>8. There are also larger story arcs developing, and this gives me hope for much more to come.<br/><br/>9. Last but not least, Defiance has genuinely likable characters--one of the most necessary elements for a show you want to watch.<br/><br/>Update 7/21/14: After many episodes, this show is still good. Good characters and challenging stories.",116 out of 157 found this helpful.,9.0,18 June 2013
1473,Defiance, A lot of clichés done well makes for good TV.,"Reminds me of the old Masamune Shirow manga series, ""Appleseed"". Combine that with Mel Gibson's ""Road Warrior"" and a bit of ""Babylon 5"" with maybe a dash of ""Command &amp; Conquer"" (yes, the video game), and you've got yourself ""Defiance"".<br/><br/>Now, this sort of story has been tried before many times, and it has failed each time. (Earth 2, Revoloution, Dark Skies, Terra Nova, Outcasts) Either the writing was too naive and silly, or too dark and serious, or the casting failed to deliver engaging characters we liked and cared about. Or the budget simply fell apart. Any one of a dozen problems can sink this sort of show.<br/><br/>""Defiance"" might just get it right.<br/><br/>The story is nothing we haven't seen before, but so what? There are no new stories; it's all in the delivery, the fun of the retelling.<br/><br/>A pair of tough-as-nails left over warriors, survivors of a planet-wasting future war carve out a nomadic life for themselves in the badlands. They are tightly bonded, mismatched family for one another, an alien warrior princess and a human super soldier; they don't need anybody but themselves.<br/><br/>So when their path takes them into the middle of new colony filled with politics and problems, desperate, hopeful people of many races trying to build new lives, our heroes have every reason to make tracks and head for the horizon. Such a town is just too much trouble, a great place to get bogged down and probably get killed. No thank-you.<br/><br/>But of course, heartstrings are plucked, making it impossible to leave these babes in the woods to their own demise. Our heroes become protectors in the middle of impossible odds and ego-driven, racist rivalries and all the dirt which makes life a difficult place. A stupid, ugly town filled with stupid, ugly people. Who are also, people with good stuff inside them as well. An unfortunate mix, because if they were all bad, you could just leave them to rot without a second thought. But no, the audience is shown enough hope to want to see these people rise above themselves and just get along. It's fun as viewers to hope. And so our heroes decide to stay.<br/><br/>Such a story would be an unbearable cliché if it weren't done, as this one is, with such a good deal of competence.<br/><br/>The pilot worked, was entirely watchable, was fun, and shows plenty of promise.<br/><br/>No, it doesn't have the unique charismatic spark of a Firefly, or the (albeit wooden) broad-stroke genius of Babylon 5. But it does have all the parts you need for a thrilling series, and better yet, it has the casting and acting chops to make the characters engaging. And best of all, in the midst of all that grime and calamity, it retains the up-beat bounce to make the world a place to want to visit next week.<br/><br/>For a series pilot, getting so many difficult parts to work this well together is extremely hard to pull off. But they did it.<br/><br/>Presumably, as the actors settle into their roles over the course of several episodes, on-screen chemistry can only get better. Hopefully, they've got some good script writers on board to make good use of all this potential, and the budget and executive smarts needed to give this show the chance it needs for a good run.<br/><br/>I think it's just possible that we're looking at a winner. *Just*.<br/><br/>Because this particular road through the sci-fi wilderness is littered with the remains of the fallen. If they pull it off, it'll be a big first.<br/><br/>So I wish good luck to the aptly named, ""Defiance"" in the face of these long odds.<br/><br/>They'll need both!",151 out of 213 found this helpful.,,16 April 2013
1474,Defiance, Thoughts on the Pilot,"I don't normally write reviews on IMDb, but I thought I'd make an exception for this show. I find it rather weird that it has an overall rating of 8.1, but all the reviews so far range from mediocre to bad.<br/><br/>Personally, I really enjoyed the pilot. While most of the themes are ""cliche"", the show does a great job of still adding an original twist to almost all of them. I've always enjoyed shows that follow numerous characters, so I think there is potential in that aspect. I also enjoyed the two ""main"" characters; they have great chemistry together (if a little awkward at points) and are intriguing. I feel there is a lot more to learn about them, and that makes me want to keep watching the show.<br/><br/>I don't watch many SyFy shows, so I can't really compare it to anything they have done in the past. I can see the resemblance to Jericho, as some people have stated, but with a larger sci-fi theme. A lot of reviews state that they have ""seen shows like this before"", but I personally have never seen anything like this show before. The graphics are sub-par, but are better than a lot of other shows I have seen. Truthfully, I would take a great story over amazing graphics any day.<br/><br/>After watching the show, I have decided to pick up the video game. I find the show/ video game integration very intriguing. Now that both are officially out, I hope they compliment each other even more in the future. It would be fun to watch an episode, and then play the video game and get background info on the episode, and on terraform earth as a whole.<br/><br/>These are just my thoughts on the first episode. I encourage everyone to at least watch the pilot to decide for yourselves whether this is a show for you or not.",133 out of 215 found this helpful.,9.0,16 April 2013
1475,Defiance, Once you get past the stumbles,"Let me first point out that most of the highly negative reviews are from people that are either REALLY upset that their favorites shows were canceled, only want some super techie expensive POS, or don't have the mental capacity to understand what kind of depth and hard work went into this show.<br/><br/>That being said, I am a very picky viewer. Half the shows on network TV claiming to be Sci Fi are watered down and barely beyond their ""grounded"" approach to the genre. Defiance is first and foremost, Science Fiction. <br/><br/>I admit, the show started out really rocky. The pilot was confusing to a degree, and the limited budget was apparent. But unlike a lot of attention inept who've posted reviews after giving the show 40 minutes of their time, I stuck it through. Two seasons and a lot of emotions later, I can definitively say Defiance has found it's groove.<br/><br/>It's not going to hold your hand. This is in the day of the life of kind of drama. The show wants you to get the sense that these characters really feel, and have their own inner demons. Just when you think someone is an unabashed hero or villain without any dimension, the show begins to peel away at the outer shell and reveals multi-faceted layers.<br/><br/>From the whimsically religious, barbaric and sarcastic kingpin Datak Tar, his submissive yet secretly conniving wife Sahlma; Nolan the nomadic gun for hire and his mysteriously haunted alien daughter Arisa; intelligent Mayor Amanda Rosewater and her prostitute/madame of a sister Kenya who just happens to know the truest face of her clients, there is no shortage of unique interactions and dilemmas. Just when you think you know all there is to know about your favorite character, they surprise you with undeniably real and game changing actions.<br/><br/>The Aliens in Defiance do look human-like. So what. There is enough there to make them both familiar and yet completely other-worldly. The Linguist behind the Dothraki tongue in Game of Thrones has created some of the most beautiful and poetic languages for the major species that needs to be heard to be believed. A lot of time and thought has gone into complete religions, social structures and traditions for each of the 5 (6?) dominant species. Castithans are pale and beautiful, snobbish and cruel with severe repercussions for defying one's long standing cultural beliefs. Iratients are in tune with nature but love to fight and make love. You really must discover the others for yourself.<br/><br/>Special effects are here and there sometimes, but make do to progress the story along and sometimes can leave you in complete awe. And the Music? Amazing. From the Synth themes to the alien takes on well established earth tunes, it has to be heard to be appreciated. <br/><br/>All in all, this show surprised me, and continues to surprise me with it's depth, it's pain, and it's humanity, even if the world is completely alien to me. I never felt this honesty with Stargate, or even my fav, Farscape. With the exception of Ben Browder, they still felt like actors playing a role. These characters inhabiting Defiance seem like neighbors. With mix matched tech and the willingness to end you if you get in the way of their survival.<br/><br/>Give it a shot. Be defiant stop listening to the sore losers.",25 out of 35 found this helpful.,9.0,29 August 2014
1476,Defiance," Ah the curse of new Sci Fi! give it five episodes and you may feel like me, it's great!","At very i had my reservations about this show, but I've stuck with it and it's got progressively better, I've found a lot of my friends are in the same camp as me there. I often find when shows or films are quite new to IMDb they are more likely to heavily criticised than praised and that gives a sort of negative bias, until more of the positive reviews come in later. I seem to recall some very highly regarded films and TV show's being stuck on a score of around five / seven but then once they'd be through the judgemental tunnel of fire they did just fine.<br/><br/>This show has began to gather dept and feel and also has plenty of mystery and wonderful plot threads developing, it's a lot of fun and has many elements. Don't believe what people say about it being a huge mellow drama or just a sci fi soap, yes it has an element of that but not has much as people are making out.<br/><br/>The acting ranges from poor, average to superb, with mixed styles and feel and that is the only thing some people might find jarring, personally i don't mind it.<br/><br/>It's sort of an ethical, detective, sci fi western, shoot em up, mystery, drama, new earth world, adventure .... it's got everything and it's really starting to piece together and take shape as a show. It's about family, hope, feuds, survival and making a new world.<br/><br/>The plotting is really getting smarter as the show progresses, the pilot i was unsure about, but now i am hooked! it's got lovely sets and some great tunes on the soundtrack...there's a lot to love about Defiance...i feel some people are judging it too quickly and worse wanting it fail for whatever reason, well i had this show to succeed , because it's fresh and quirky and like i said fun.<br/><br/>You don't need to worry about playing the game to follow the TV series either, in case you were wondering.<br/><br/>Defiance really keeps you guessing with unanswered questions, but the web is taking form now and i can't wait to see how it all comes together...if your new to the show bare with it, the pilot try's to do too much in my opinion and the second episode is average, the third is a little better, the forth and fifth are fantastic and a lot stronger.<br/><br/>It's a little monster of the week for a while but the over running plot lines are coming in now. I'd say it has elements of firefly, Farscape, Buffy and a Town called Eureka in pace, feel and style. Also with touches of various post apocalyptic role games and books featuring gathering of alien races, but that makes it cool, because it's fun to spot possible influences for sci fi games and books i enjoyed. Don't get me wrong though it also has an originality of it's own that is fantastic. Enjoy!",80 out of 130 found this helpful.,10.0,16 May 2013
1477,Defiance, Quality is going up and I'm warming up to it,"The show started a bit slow in the first 4-something episodes. In the past couple of episodes, especially 6 and onwards the show has really picked up. More stuff is happening, new plot lines are opening up and the characters are getting broader and deeper.<br/><br/>I would agree with those that say the show is not the best thing ever, and a lot of it still seems random or unbelievable. In my opinion this is mostly because of the lack of back story. The latest episodes have begun to give us some flashbacks, so I expect this particular complaint to be resolved soon. <br/><br/>In a day where Original Sci-Fi on TV are slim pickings indeed, I find the show to be a breath of fresh air. <br/><br/>The quality of the show is definitely on an upwards trajectory, so I suggest everybody that can't quite get in it yet,to bear with the series. To those who haven't given the show a chance yet, I suggest you do. <br/><br/>Watching Sci-fi is the only way to keep it on the air after all.",51 out of 81 found this helpful.,10.0,4 June 2013
1478,Defiance, Better Than Most,"Defiance is a fine piece of a sci-fi show: unique world-building, good actors and a very good production (without CGI overload) makes Defiance one of a few (like e.g. Firefly, Farscape). In the end the show maybe did not hold the level of the first two seasons but anyway, still good enough to beat many of those ""modern"" sci-fi abominations of the last few years.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,7.0,16 July 2020
1479,Defiance," Good concept, bad execution","Defiance is one of those shows that you want to like, but often you just sit through episode after episode just shouting at the television. <br/><br/>Be it a weak script, nonsensical twists or just awful CGI, everyone has their issues with this show. When you first hear about the concept, it sounds almost like it couldn't fail, and in a way that's true. I find myself drawn to this show even though i'm constantly let down by it, because even with all of its shortcomings it still has its own charm. <br/><br/>The main characters are somewhat likable (mostly through good work of the cast who are the main reason the show is still watchable), even if you can't connect with them. And the settings are interesting even if they look awful on screen, but you will find yourself drawn to the world of Defiance nevertheless. <br/><br/>This is one of those shows that i would only recommend to hardcore SciFi fans, if you have enough patience then Defience might be an enjoyable experience as long as you don't expect to much of it. <br/><br/>You have been warned.",21 out of 31 found this helpful.,4.0,3 August 2015
1480,Defiance, Typical 'Sy Fy' and modern day melodrama,"You ever watch those shows where the actors and their 'issues' don't fit the surrounding environment? Where Emo and Juliet still try to live life as it was in the 'good old days', except the good old days refer to a time when shopping malls still existed and kids went to public school, not scrounging in gutters for scraps to eat amongst rubble left be either a bomb, aliens or mother nature?<br/><br/>You ever get the impression that writers just can't envision an apocalyptic future that's actually bleak, without it's hope pride parade, racial tolerance and sharing is caring characters who always look on the bright side and make cliché promises to children about how 'everything is going to be OK, because now more than ever, we have to stick together, no matter our differences.' It's as if Hollywood can't ever stop with the subliminal political messages about the state of identity politics, and just actually make a television show.<br/><br/>Programs such as Defiance, Falling Skies, Revolution and Terra Nova all suffer from this double life leading paradox where they have large budgets, promising actors, fantastic set pieces and costumes...yet the writing and dialogue is diabolical and over dramatic.<br/><br/>Defiance is another one of those in-house workshop projects that are synonymous with the now cheapened 'Sy Fy' channel designed to appeal to the masses of sheep TV viewers.<br/><br/>It stumbles under it's own star struck weight, of Battlestar Galactica ex employees, Bear McReary's repetitive soundtracks and a viral marketing campaign of being connected to a video game.<br/><br/>If you appreciate true post apocalyptic scenarios, then give this a miss. Like the other shows mentioned above, everything is too convenient, clean and transparent.<br/><br/>I would have liked to give it a five for the CGI and setpieces, but they too are poor.",148 out of 267 found this helpful.,1.0,22 April 2013
1481,Defiance," Terrible, juvenile writing, awful direction, poor animation","I was looking forward to Defiance, especially after seeing the cast list. Grant Bowler, Julie Benz and Jamie Murray have all excelled in Dexter and Outrageous Fortune, but the script they've been handed doesn't give them one solitary chance to exhibit their talents. The writing is on a par with a third rate computer game cut scene, choking on its own clichés, dialogue is non-existent, characters tell other people who they are, or what they are doing, but no one actually has a real conversation with someone else.<br/><br/>The opening scene establishes that Earth is visited by aliens, then we see their decimated fleet floating in orbit, now earth is a wasteland and different species of aliens are everywhere. I was still getting comfy in my seat and I had no idea how we'd gone from earth invasion to Mad Max meets Babylon 5 in about one minute. It doesn't get any better.<br/><br/>We're introduced to a young couple and told they're in love, their families don't approve, but we don't get to see them being in love, which is how you convince people your story is real. The girl's father at one point says he's going to kill her lover and storms off, next scene he's in a brothel where lo and behold, the boy is playing cards. How did the father know the boy would be there? Does this family man frequent the brothel enough to know they hold card games and that her lover will be there at that moment? It's lazy, derivative garbage.<br/><br/>Now for the director, time after time, tension building opportunities are squandered. The 'lovable rogue' character is running through some woods carrying a wounded girl. It soon becomes apparent they are being hunted by animals moving so fast we can barely see them, they surround our plucky hero in a flash and then proceed to do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING whilst he shoots them one by one, and they clumsily fall over in an animation that looks like it was ripped from a video game circa 1990. Then our hero runs out of ammo - oh the tension - only for a Deus Ex Machina to arrive (in the middle of a forest remember) just in time to save them.<br/><br/>Then there's the props, how do you show your audience you're in the future? You make everything glow blue, from guns, to drinks, to surgical equipment, to knives, to alien artifacts, just make 'em glow blue and voila, the future.<br/><br/>From the one dimensional characters to the woeful sets and props, shocking script and inept direction this show is a mess.

1482,Defiance, I don't know how I missed this gem,"I know the show is old, but I shame myself by not giving it attention earlier. I somehow get the same feeling that I got when Fringe finished: I want more, but I don't want it to spoil with overcomplicated plots and lifeless seasons.<br/><br/>For the 3 seasons this show got, it was seriously well made, with a lot of attention to details. I know the special effects lacked in ...well, everything, but that didn't break the narrative one bit.<br/><br/>Languages and dialects for all the alien races, specific music, well developed characters who blur the lines between good and bad, nice twists here and there, great dialogue, compelling storyline. I was amazed on how much love was put in this particular show.<br/><br/>For everybody saying it's underrated, believe them.

1484,Defiance," Obviously far more is spent on effects and makeup than on good writing. And to think they canceled "" Firefly"" !","SOMEWHAT of a sad, bad soap opera. The production folks spent a lot of time on makeup for the aliens while providing them with absolutely no difference between each alien species. All aliens have the same human-like values, local politics ( Deadwood on planet Zeeno ), dialog, personal problems, sexual identities, motivations, and issues like teen anxiety. A knife fight between the local human teen bully and the heroic smaller alien boy. OH Pah-lees . Nothing original, unique, or even interesting here. Males of the main races are chauvinistic, females docile and submissive - for the most part. The only thing really alien about the aliens is the makeup. So how could they ever possibly write any kind of interesting plot....Well, they can't.<br/><br/>Why is it that almost all of these sci-fi series are so poorly thought out? Obviously far more is spent on effects and makeup than on good writing. And to think they canceled "" Firefly"" !<br/><br/>Aliens are humans with makeup and no discerning difference in personalities from the average human. The sets are filled with phony looking plants and some Mad Max wreckage. Occasional special effects are thrown in to keep the fourteen year old male audience coming back for more ... but this 'show' has very little value for anyone who thinks, is an adult, or simply appreciates thoughtful and well told science fiction stories. <br/><br/>The amazing thing to me is that huge piles of money and effort are spent on such huge piles of trite, trivial, and troubling tripe. But, I guess, that's the way it is: with the lowest common denominator being a fourteen year old male with a two digit IQ. BIG YAWN.

1485,Defiance, Nothing new but highly enjoyable,"Anybody who has watched the first episode of Eureka will feel a little deja vu. It's not necessarily a bad thing. This show is easily a mix of Deadwood, Battlestar Galactica, and Firefly. It is a western that happens to also be a sci-fi.<br/><br/>The best thing this show has going for it is Rockne S. O'Bannon. He is the brilliant mind behind Farscape (possibly the best sci-fi ever). If you felt the story was a little slow, well so were the first few episodes of Farscape but then it really got going.<br/><br/>Is the CGI a little lacking at times with some aliens and creatures? Sure, but so was the tiger in Life of Pi and the Cylons in Battlestar Galactica. The producers were smart in where they used the money. The CGI at other times is great, including the close-ups of the aliens in the big battle.<br/><br/>The story is nothing new, but it's incredibly fun. The characters are likable and you find yourself pulling for them. I guarantee the more you watch the less you'll focus on the makeup or CGI and the more you'll get sucked into the world O'Bannon has created.<br/><br/>Some of the best shows on sci-fi (Eureka, Stargate SG-1 and it's offspring, Farscape, Warehouse 13) have all had some campy dialogue but it's always overshadowed by the talented actors, especially when a scene with heavy drama presents itself.

It didn't take long into the pilot to realize that I wasn't watching a show, I was actually watching a compilation of snippets from virtually every post-apocalyptic movie, game and TV show ever made. The acting was stiff and forced, as if the script was written on the fly, and the abuse of poorly-executed CG made it nearly unwatchable. I really should have not gotten my hopes up, knowing this was a SciFi show but after the untimely ending of Eureka, and the cancellation of SG:U, I was expecting more.

1490,Defiance, Garbage,"I almost feel bad about writing this, since there is enough negativity being spewed out all over the internet already. But I have to say that this series is, so far, the worst sci-fi I've ever seen. Why even make this? Its like the producers of this show lack respect for their audience. I can almost hear them telling themselves ""Wow, this really sucks! But those nerds will just gobble up anything we serve them anyway, so screw it"". Everything about this show is mediocre at best. The makeup is ludicrous. The script seems to be written by a second rate sci-fi hack. The concepts introduced in the pilot are confusing and shallow. Most of the alien races act mostly like humans, except for the fact that they are quite obviously wearing make up and prosthetics, and speak cringe worthy made up languages. Its not that the make up is bad, really. Its just so obvious. Some of the actors are clearly having trouble acting through it - looks like their faces are being constricted. Editing and continuity suffers throughout the show. The CGI parts don't mesh well at all with the purely live action scenes, and everything feels rushed. Yet it manages to become very boring. Some things are just silly oversights, like in one clip we see snow on the ground, then in the next there is no snow on the ground. In the CGI clips we see lush alien vegetation, yet in the live action parts there is only barren ""earth"" vegetation. Two things deserve special mention: the CGI and the music. The CGI is lackluster at best, and just terrible in some places. Some console games I've seen look as good as this. It completely ruins the suspension of disbelief. The music is totally embarrassing. In some places they insist on singing in the stupid made up language of the alien race(s). I was forced to mute the sound every time there was singing in order to be able to endure the show. What saddens me is that there were probably some talented and ambitious people involved in the making of this show. There always is - even in bad projects. I hope the mention of this show won't screw up their CVs when it inevitably gets canceled.",58 out of 114 found this helpful.,2.0,17 April 2013
1491,Defiance, Not trashy - just trash,"Defiance is bad TV and bad story telling. The pilot begins with a few mumbled lines about the Earth being invaded by aliens. A lot of this is unintelligible. It genuinely seemed as if the scriptwriters didn't know how to describe what must have been an apocalyptic event in the ridiculously short time they were given, so they direction given to the actor was ""mumble"". This had me worried from the start. If you are going to tell a story then tell it. If you are going to put something in the script then make sure you know darn well what it is and why you are putting it there. I had just been watching Deep Space Nine on my Tivo so I had been spoilt. There was a story in DS9. Every word meant something and there were characters you cared about. None of this applies to Defiance. The new mayor (whose last job I suspect was one of the voices for the chipmunks) gave me a worse feeling. The fact she was giving a speech celebrating the ending of a war that had decimated earth, and the welcoming of the genocidal aliens guilty of the extinction of most of Earth's lifeforms was laughable (the chipmunks survived). The Romeo/Juliet element between the Earth girl and the troll with the purple hair was truly embarrassing (remember the toys?). The fact that the head alien in the town is a criminal is just unbelievable (I guess the law cannot touch him because it wouldn't be politically correct to do so). This is not trashy TV. Trashy TV can have no real worth but it will make you want to come back for more. Defiance is just trash. Unwatchable trash at that.",58 out of 115 found this helpful.,1.0,17 April 2013

1493,Defiance, Great cast and production values wasted,"The main character is the sheriff in a ravaged post apocalyptic town with a rebellious alien adopted daughter.

The token black guy in this one is the deputy.<br/><br/>In the series, the sheriff heroically solves the problem of the week.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with the actors, I'm fine with the special effects and production values, but it's the same formula that the Sci Fi channel churns out over and over again. Same character dynamic, same plot, same everything. I wish those in charge would read a few decent books by good authors for a change and try to do something with them. Seemed to work OK with Game of Thrones. I'm not saying they need that level of production values or number of characters. But something new and interesting for a change, please.<br/><br/>No more Sci Fi law enforcement officers would be a start, as would a few characters with a bit of depth.

Now picture that scenario where Earth has been taken over by aliens and you have Defiance. It's a Western set in the future with the same tried, lame, plots regurgitated.<br/><br/>After the pilot and one episode I'm left asking this questions: Does this work? No. There's no Sci-Fi element. It could be set 200 years ago in the wild west with absolutely no appreciable difference to the story.<br/><br/>There's suggestion of an underlying plot to destroy the town Defiance, so that the ex-mayor can recover some artefact. I guess you should feel some empathy for the characters that they may come to harm, but as much as I want to like Defiance, I really just don't care for it.<br/><br/>UPDATE - I've made it as far as S1E5 (A Well Respected Man).

Seven episodes (even at 30 minutes a piece) is more than enough time to develop characters and have them come to terms with the actions they took in the first episode, but the plot suffers from a slow start followed by too much packed in to the middle. What happens in episode 5, however, completely derails the entire purpose of the show (to use a train pun the writers ignored.) The fumbled insertion of exec-producer Phoebe Waller-Bridge (whose American character is astonishingly unconvincing) and the related sub-plot completely takes away from the narrative of the story which was driven by two actors completely capable of carrying the show. There was literally zero consequence or purpose to this sub plot, and it almost seems like the writers were stuck digging their way out of a needless major plot twist. Was there a different story that was quickly rewritten at the last minute? Or maybe it was written as they shot? All we know is that this waste of almost an entire episode worth of story killed the entire series and left the ending completely rushed, without enough time for the leading duo to do their thing and wrap up the season. Next time you try to cross breed ""Fargo"" with ""When Harry Met Sally"" consider the consequences.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, the writers arrogantly assume there's going to be a second season for them to undo the damage of the final three episodes.

With this show, I stopped everything I was doing and was glued to the screen. I particularly loved Merit Weaver in this. I'm very surprised it doesn't have a higher rating. I've seen several reviews saying they didn't approve of the morals of Merit's character and therefore, didn't like the episode / show. Since when do we not watch shows based on the morality of the characters?? The majority of great films throughout history should have been flops by that logic. I was also disturbed to see reviews with negative comments about Merit's appearance. It seems that some men have a difficult time dealing with a female lead character that doesn't align with their idea of how a woman should act or that isn't the height of their particular idea of female attractiveness.

I HAVE to say Fear the Walking dead first season, should have been more like this show. It is survivalism, selfishness what is shown here and it is the truth.

Cinematography is great. Suspense-building for the jump-scares that may or may not come are overused, but usually well executed.<br/><br/>But as with most ""bad"" zombie shows, the problem lies with the scripts -- usually written by Hollywood types who, between tokes of weed, just simply suck at anticipating what human beings actually do in a crisis as they write. They don't know anything about psychology, they don't know anything about guns, they don't know anything about the military -- they just want to make a show that manipulates emotions, often on the level of your average CW programming.<br/><br/>I was only able to watch the first three episodes, and once I saw that last one go full-on Lord of the Flies, I knew I couldn't continue. It was a stunningly stupid premise for how people (in this case children) would behave six weeks into a disaster.<br/><br/>I don't want to include any spoilers, but the show is fraught with unrealistic dialog, reactions, thinking, planning, etc., and it was just painful to watch.

1528,Black Summer, A gritty on the edge of your seat zombie treat,"This is my first IMDB review. I felt compelled to support this series after reading some overly negative reviews which I cannot comprehend. Some say the acting is awful. I disagree. Unlike acting in many higher budget series, the acting here is 'natural' shall we say. Realistic. The lines aren't delivered as actors from drama school. They feel unrehearsed adding to the authentic feeling of chaos and break down of everything. The speech in this series is also limited. That's also a good thing as it doesn't distract the viewer from the atmosphere of uncertainty and paranoia. Similarly to Walking Dead, often the humans are as deadly as the undead. There's not much you want to say to someone trying to kill you! And the atmosphere is awful. There is hardly a moment to relax in this short series. Like the characters themselves, it feels as if you are rushing from one awful circumstance to another with barely a pause to rest. The makers of this have captured the panic and chaos of the breakdown of society really well with fast paced editing and clever camerawork. Of course, the Zombies are similar to other Zombies. But the 28 days later approach is the correct one in this case. The Zombies are rabid, crazed, fast and relentless. It forces the pace of each episode to keep rushing along because you can't afford to stay still very long. Yes, you can pick silly little holes in the story like any sci-fi, horror or fictional themed movies. The one that got me was when they stole a load of guns but seemingly no ammunition. Silly, yes, but forgiveable and when you are in sressful environments it is possibly realistic. I haven't watched Z nation. However, this is how I like my Zombie flicks. Dystopian, gritty, adrenaline-fuelled and intelligently made. Even humorous whilst being horrifying.

1530,Black Summer," Relax, Don't Compare and Just ENJOY","I am a loyal TWD fan so in between seasons to quench that Zombie thirst, I dug and searched and searched and dug and watched literally hundreds of shows in the Zombie/post apocalyptic genra. I'll tell you what there are some pretty terrible ones out there with very few gems. This one is a GEM.
Some critics talk about how the characters are unbelievable stupid and mentions a few plot holes. I certainly can not disagree with those statements. Yet there was so much action going on and the plot moved so quickly that I was able to let those things go easily and not let it hinder the fun I was having in watching the show. I would say that if you are the kind of person that notices details easily and lets them bother you enough to ruin the show then maybe you should skip this one....which really is too bad)
The acting is excellent, comparable to famous and well regarded actors and actresses in Hollywood. The direction was awesome, the sound affects and score was right on and the editing very well done. The camera work and lighting was also top notch...(I have never been a fan of the shaky camera during high action scenes but again this technique was not used so often or sloppily that it bothered me)
I was pleasantly surprised by the many quick twists and turns that came out of no where and kept me glued to the show.
I believe that they have the start of something really good here.....I hope that they listen to the audiences and make those few minor adjustments with the next season to pull this all together on an even higher level.
One of the other MAJOR things I enjoyed was that although there was some serious Zombie ass kicking done, it was done with the PERFECT amount pf blood and violence. In other words the blood/gore/violence/killing was NOT one of the major characters and with as much action as there was, there was not one scene I can recall where it went over board just for the sake of highlighting the violence just for the SLASHER lovers sake.
I binged watched the first season and I am hoping that more people will write some critiques and that the movie makers will take it into consideration....I have HIGH hopes for this show and since TWD is wrapping up quickly we are going to need a replacement.

1533,Black Summer, Not as bad as you'd think,The chapters we're great. Helped with the characters and their locations. Actors are not as bad as most reviews say. Not any worse then TWD or FTWD,5 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,17 April 2019
1534,Black Summer, Simultaneously frustrating and enthralling.,"I hated this when I first started, but found that I couldn't stop watching. I wound up binge-watching the whole season,. Even when I was frsustrated by the characters, and yelling ""Close the door behind you,!"" ""Shoot for the head!"", I still couldn't stop watching. In the end I have to admit it was rather genius. A lot of really well choreographied single-shot chase scenes. People who dissed this series should watch again, just for the way certain long shots were handled. And cleverly executed practical effects. The result puts you in the middle of the action. No time for exposition or lengthy philisophical monologues. The dead are coming! RUN! And the frustrating way people acted...? Well, it's easy to think clearly sitting in your living room. Everybody likes to think they'd be just as smart with the undead on their heels. This was good. I admit, I wound up loving it.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,17 April 2019

1536,Black Summer, Love it!,"I personally loved this show and ended up binging it ina day.
I was very nervous when I saw that this was a ""prequel"" to the syfy show z nation because I think that show is hot cheesy garbage, but I was pleasantly surprised after the first episode.
One word That I would describe this show as would be Tense! Honestly every episode my heart was racing at one point or another from the fast paced nature of the show, and the brilliant close up almost POV camera angel.
Acting i think is solid. I see a lot of review calling it out, but to me I thought the acting did what it needed to. It portrayed a group of unskilled people trying to survive in the beginning of a zombie outbreak. Very little dialogue, no BS love stories, just raw survival.
Hope there's a season2!",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,15 April 2019
1537,Black Summer, Surprised by the low rating,"This show is awesome, stands its ground, from beginning to end.
A lot different than the Walking Dead, has more in common with Train to Busan as in the emphasis is on survival in the strictest sense. I liked how each situation is fleshed out, some we've seen before, but some are quite unique and really tense. The characters feel realistic, unlike other zombie shows. It's not a soap opera with zombies, but a real survival tale of random people.
I only hope, that they have a clear direction with the story and they won't keep making it, until people sick of it. Looking forward to the next season",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,15 April 2019

1539,Black Summer, Very impressed,"I was quite impressed with this show.<br/><br/>It's centered around the early days of a zombie apocalypse, and those who have to live through it. It adopts an almost documentary style that I found to be particularly effective.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the fact that the characters are always on the run and that no place is safe. The zombie menace is omnipresent and the zombies are actually, you know, deadly and aggressive. Even a lone zombie can be a real handful. It almost feels like a war movie. The characters are clearly shell shocked as the world they used to know collapses around them. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I enjoy the fact that the dialog is minimal, as it better represents the horror these people are living through. In other zombie shows, they'd be drinking lemonade at a farmhouse whilst spending 3/4 of the season endlessly talking about their feelings.<br/><br/>Now granted there is some ""cheese"", some questionable decision making by the characters, but you can't have a zombie show w/o some of it.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope this continues. It's better than Z-Nation, and miles better than TWD (which I used to love). I have no way of knowing, but appears there's some review ""brigading"" going on. I'm guessing it's the devoted fans of TWD.",232 out of 385 found this helpful.,7.0,12 April 2019
1540,Black Summer, Don't compare this to TWD!!!!!,"If you're a casual zombie fan don't bother, this has the classic zombie tropes, human error, stupidity, you'll be shouting 'why don't they just do this' many times but that's the genre! It's slow and there doesn't appear to be much of a storyline at present.<br/><br/>Every episode is broken into short episodes with a title, which works great. Fast zombies add menace and urgency and the plot is simple, as we see the group attempting to make their way to safety.<br/><br/>The show doesn't make the error of trying to find a cure from the off, we don't have all the answers in the group, it's simple and it's welcome in my opinion. I look forward to the next season!",175 out of 293 found this helpful.,8.0,14 April 2019
1541,Black Summer, Great filmography and a lot of potential but STUPID!!!!!!!!!!,"I never review movies or series and i mean never this is the first time, but i couldn't handle how stupid this series is, what is up with the Korean lady who doesn't speak English but understands it perfectly, or the guy who was chased by the same zombie for two days without being able to escape, so he easily killed the guy who killed the zombie but not the actual zombie i mean what the hell!!!, or how stupid they acted in the school i just cant handle this stupidity anymore, i just reached episode 5 and i m not going to spend more time of my life on it, i wouldn't recommend it at ALL!!!!!",215 out of 368 found this helpful.,3.0,13 April 2019
1542,Black Summer, Really enjoyed it!,"I really liked it. No, it wasn't TWD, but it was action packed and probably a more realistic depiction of how an outbreak would go, especially with fast zombies and especially in the beginning when the useless people were being weeded out. Yes, I screamed at the TV because it drove me nuts that most of these people didn't even TRY to arm themselves, but maybe that's how it would be. We have to consider the fact that this is a world where no one has every heard the word zombie, and even though these things are dangerous, the survivors are still seeing them as people. It would take some time to wrap your brain around the idea that it was okay to kill them even if they are attacking you. Regardless of what we think when watching a show like this, the average person wouldn't be able to pull the trigger and kill a person so easily.<br/><br/>Having said that, it seriously irritated me how stupid some of the people were and how they walked by dozens of things that could have been used as a weapon in the absence of guns. I'd personally rather carry around a lamp and try to use it to beat the things off me than walk around empty handed. Even if the lamp didn't save me, at least I tried! But really, no one had a baseball bat? Golf club? A knife from their kitchen??? What in the world?!",97 out of 159 found this helpful.,8.0,14 April 2019

1544,Black Summer, What would happen if the world was full of idiots and the zombie apocalypse occurred,"What can i say, this series is frustrating, here is why:<br/><br/>Follows all the typical politically correct cliches of 2019, strong female lead and caring mother, all ethnic groups covered (Arab, Black, Chinese, Hispanic, White). Men are mostly made out to be cowardly idiots with all the logic (What there is) coming from female characters.<br/><br/>People pack supplies and then drop them on the floor and dont collect them like supplies arent important in a disaster event. Bad decisions are made such as risking others lives just to get their infected husband onto the evacuation truck. There is also an abundance of vehicles as the disaster has only just started yet people fight over a single mini van when many vacant working vehicles litter the road.<br/><br/>Often when you get a group of survivors band together or meet a new person next to no communication or greetings occur, its like everyone got rude all of a sudden and ignores one another. In one scenario you get a group of four people travelling the road searching for a safe location and during that time only two of the four characters talk and they ignore the other two who seem to be there to just be background dressing / zombie fodder.<br/><br/>Apart from one military guy with a gun nobody in the group picks up a blunt weapon or knife to defend themselves with until episode 5. Precious limited gun shots are wasted shooting from a distance and missing rather than taking more careful shots at closer range to the head to conserve ammo and increase chances of success.<br/><br/>Characters make noise, walk into a room without checking its clear and safe first and fall for obvious bait / robbery traps. Staying on high alert seems to be a low priority and nobody stands guard or looks out for threats when walking into hostile areas.<br/><br/>One character destroys a perfectly good car trying to ram a high powered Dodge Ram pickup of the road that up until that point has not given them a reason to attack it beyond acting suspicious. The character also tries to outrun the powerful engined pickup truck in his minivan, logic would say he is unlikely to be faster or more manoeuvrable.<br/><br/>Man goes into supermarket and pickups up Shreddies, hardly practical .. so hes going to have a breakfast with milk in the middle of the Zombie apocalypse. Barricades the front door of a fire station to escape a zombie when there is a giant garage door at the side partially open. Ignores all the undamaged gassed up ready to go working order fire station vehicles to remain on foot, fails to kill a single zombie when armed with a fire axe and one on one.",148 out of 250 found this helpful.,5.0,13 April 2019
1545,Lark Rise to Candleford, My One Weakness,"After Pride and Prejudice, Jane Eyre and this winter's Cranford, I thought that the BBC couldn't do any better: that it had reached its peak. Boy, was I wrong. I was apprehensive about watching Lark Rise because of this, but those doubt were removed immediately as I fell in love with all the characters, especially Julia Sawalha, who surpasses herself, obviously moving away from her most famous role as Lydia Bennett in Pride and Prejudice, and she does so delightfully! <br/><br/>The hamlet of Lark Rise is so sleepy, and yet just as enthralling as the 'modern' town of Candleford. All the little stories within each episode, as well as those expanding throughout the entire series, make it a joy to watch, and an awesome way to pass the evening and forget all of one's woes. In producing two enchanting series so close to one another, the BBC has certainly surpassed itself.",88 out of 94 found this helpful.,10.0,2 March 2008
1546,Lark Rise to Candleford, performances excellent ~ beautiful sets shot carefully,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who says this was 'dreadful'. Film and television adaptations of ANY novel inevitably have to be stylised. I found the performances excellent, and have to pick our Julia Sawhala, unrecognisable from here Saffy days, and her presentation of the dialogue was a wonderful balance of sincerity, wit, warmth and pathos.<br/><br/>I might agree that Dawn French was 'larger than life' but along with Liz Smith the presence of these 2 actors in the cast gave it instant familiarity.<br/><br/>Now, 'dire dialogue'? I don't think so, we were ROARING at the sisters Pearl and Ruby, teary-eyed at the scenes of 'Twister', and watched EVERY moment of the 10 episodes.<br/><br/>Visually, INCREDIBLE, beautiful sets shot carefully and I felt it WAS 1850! I REALLY hope the BBC are planning a second third, fourth and FIFTH series ! THAT is how GOOD it is.<br/><br/>As the BBC replied to the critic 'What Lark Rise to Candleford does do very well is to draw in an audience who normally wouldn't watch this sort of programme.' It certainly drew me in ~ I will now read the books, so YES it's helping bring literature to a TV audience! My vote? 9 out of 10.",67 out of 71 found this helpful.,9.0,12 April 2008

1548,Lark Rise to Candleford," A glorious &amp; charming production, may it ever continue","The previous posters I feel are nit picking at what is one of the most glorious productions I have enjoyed in many years. Not having read the books from which the series is taken, I came to it not knowing what to expect. It is beautiful, glowing with a golden warmth, a lyrical love poem to the people and village life of England just over a century ago, making it hard to return to daily life without regret. It reminds me almost of Laurie lee's Cider with Rosie, the love with which this time and people are conveyed, the richness, glowing like late afternoon sunshine seeps into our drawing rooms as we watch and makes one long for a time and place long vanished. The heart which has been put into this production, into the performances by every member of the cast and production crew, the love portrayed, I can't find a better word for it, warms one, melting away the chill of 21st century living. The poor not dirty enough some say?! Perhaps it will surprise some to know that the poor of that time, as now, had their pride and kept as clean as circumstances would allow, which meant at least clean looking. The other users comments are churlish, this is the most lyrically beautiful, heart warming &amp; charming series I have ever seen. The humanity and touching wisdom in the way characters are portrayed, slowing revealing the reasons for their behaviour are truly moving. Everyone involved in this production should be cheered to the rafters and begged for an encore. I hope, as do all I know also, that the screenwriters will be asked to take the series on from where the books end, and never stop giving us new tales of this golden idyll, where the community sheltered those living within it's boundaries, as an extended family does, as opposed to our dislocated times. If you watch this series, you will be fully rewarded, your only regret will be that you can't enter the screen and stay forever in Candleford. The performances by everyone are rich with humanity, pathos, comedy and utterly stunning. I have grown to love everyone that lives there and everything about Candleford, so will you. It is a joy &amp; does one good.",104 out of 119 found this helpful.,10.0,18 February 2008
1549,Lark Rise to Candleford, Not just for old ladies!,"I'm a 40 year old straight single guy. I would have never even considered watching something like this if someone described it to me or I saw a commercial for it. BUT, the only channel we got clearly at my family's lake house was PBS until the digital transition. After fishing and doing yard work one day, I was drinking a beer and was too tired to get up to change the channel when this came on. I was a little angry at first, but after about 15 minutes I realized that I really wanted to know what happened next to this lady. I ended up watching the whole thing and realized at the end that I had laughed a few times and even welled up with tears once. And I don't think it was from the beer! I watched two more full episodes when I went back to the lake (kind of looked forward to it). I think I need to let me ego heal for a little while before I watch any more, but just had to say that this show has incredible acting, writing, scenery, authenticity to the place and period, and much more. If you grew up watching Little House on the Prairie, you'd really like this (as another reviewer mentioned). Same overall feel, but much more complex stories and more mature themes. I usually don't quite have that willing suspension of disbelief required for something like this, but it is so well done I feel like I'm sitting in the room with them in 19th century England... as if any moment someone will turn toward me and ask if I'd like a spot of tea!

And after all, what's so bad about with having one show on television that actually leaves you feeling better about people?",38 out of 42 found this helpful.,9.0,23 February 2010
1552,Lark Rise to Candleford, Julia Sawalha is fantastic,"A couple of other reviewers have complained about this series not being faithful to Flora Thompson's books - thank god for that, is all I can say. The books were among the most dreary, plodding tales I have ever read, and they left me depressed for days. I couldn't see the bucolic charm for all the squalid poverty and starving.<br/><br/>However, the series has been a pleasant surprise. I watched a few minutes of the first episode because I'm a big Julia Sawalha fan, and couldn't believe how she managed to inject a huge dose of humor and likability into the whole thing. Plus I think the 'vignette' approach which made the books so boring actually makes the series quite good - each episode can focus on one or two of the little anecdotes of the story.<br/><br/>There's no question they've sanitized the visuals - I'm quite certain that the 'real' Lark Rise people didn't have actual staircases in their houses, or much in the way of pictures on the walls (in fact I seem to recall the books making it clear that the houses had ladders to lofts, a paucity of candles, and no gas lamps, as they do in the TV show). And people have more teeth than they probably did in real life.<br/><br/>But who wants to see toothless people living in dark, dank sheds, anyway? I do agree that the Dawn French character is misplaced and/or overdone - I know she's supposed to be a quite literal representation of the big-heartedness of the cheerful poor person, but she ends up seeming an awful lot like the nut-job she plays in Jam and Jerusalem, and ultimately just an example of the stereotype of how stupidity, irresponsibility and poverty are inextricable.<br/><br/>If you don't like costume drama, this isn't going to change your mind. But it's an engaging adaptation of a singularly unengaging book, and if you've ever liked Julia Sawalha in anything, you should give this a try.",25 out of 27 found this helpful.,8.0,5 April 2008

Twister had me in stitches in many scenes. While Dawn French was a little over the top I believe it to be her character anyway so it did not take much away from the series.<br/><br/>Julia was perfect for the part she did very well with all her scenes.

1555,Lark Rise to Candleford, Flawless!!,"I know that this is a very lengthy review but I hope you will read and enjoy it.<br/><br/>The BBC has long been known as the undisputed world leaders when producing period drama for the TV.<br/><br/>When you consider the absolutely wonderful period dramas Auntie Beeb has produced over many, many years, it is an accolade indeed to be able to say that Lark Rise To Candleford is by far the very best they have ever produced.<br/><br/>Although so far I have only watched series one and have reviewed that, I cannot wait for the second series to come out on DVD.<br/><br/>I am shocked and dismayed that this drama appears to have been only nominated for a single award, which it duly won.<br/><br/>Every part of this production was immaculate from the script, the actors, the production, the direction and finally but definitely not least, the set and costumes.<br/><br/>SPOILER BEGINS: <br/><br/>Lark Rise To Candleford is the story of life in Lark Rise, a small village about 8 miles from Candleford, a small town.<br/><br/>It tells of the hardship of Lark Rise and about life in the somewhat more affluent Candleford.<br/><br/>The two story-lines are wonderfully intertwined.<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS <br/><br/>When you consider the choice of actors selected for the various parts it is amazing that each and every one of them were given the most perfect part.<br/><br/>Although it is virtually impossible to single any individual out as the best I would like to mention a few of them.<br/><br/>SPOILER BEGINS: <br/><br/>Dawn French was cast as Caroline Arless, a mother of several children, with one on the way, whose husband was away at sea. She was more than a little partial to a good flagon of ale and this was eventually her downfall when she was carted off to debtors prison. Don't fret though, she came back. I cannot see anyone else being able to fill this part.<br/><br/>Liz Smith was her usual and impeccable self playing the part of Zillah, the housekeeper to the Postmistress in Candleford. Liz was 86 when she appeared in this series and has lost none of her extraordinary acting abilities. I can only describe her as perfection personified.<br/><br/>Julia Sawalha played Dorcas Lane, the Candleford Postmistress. She was oh so prim and proper and cared for everyone and helped anyone who was in trouble. She grew up with Timothy Midwinter, now Sir Timothy and the Squire of Candleford. She loved him and he her. Sir Timothy asked her to marry him but she refused as she felt it wrong that she should marry someone who she considered her 'better', but they still loved each other even though he has now married someone else.<br/><br/>Linda Bassett and Karl Johnson who played wife and husband Queenie and Twister Turrill were perfectly cast in their respective roles. It was a joy to see how well they interacted with each other.<br/><br/>Matilda Ziegler and Victoria Hamilton played the sisters Pearl and Ruby Pratt. It was as though these two sisters were literally joined at the hip and they did everything together, they even dressed in the same clothes for the most part, even though they were the proprietors of the Candleford milliners shop.. They played their parts as the Candleford busy bodies wonderfully and were convinced that they were better than anyone in Candleford and thought the residents of Lark Rise were the lowest of the low, even though they started from extremely humble beginnings themselves.<br/><br/>Last but not least there is Laura Timmins played by Olivia Hallinan. Laura was sent from Lark Rise to Candleford in order to work in the the post office and to better herself. The story is narrated from the writings in her journal. I have a feeling we will be seeing a lot more of Olivia.<br/><br/>SPOILER ENDS <br/><br/>I could have something to say about each actor who appeared in this drama as they all played their parts superlatively.<br/><br/>Finally the direction by Alan Grint, John Greening, Charles Palmer and Marc Jobst was again absolutely marvellous and you would never realise that there had been so many directors.<br/><br/>It is plain to me that everyone of the cast and crew got on extremely well together, which can be seen by the way this series was so wonderfully produced and acted.<br/><br/>The final thing I would like to say is that it is a great pity that 10 is the highest mark I can give Lark Rise To Candleford.",17 out of 20 found this helpful.,10.0,10 April 2009

1557,Lark Rise to Candleford, A rustic spectacle that grows-up fast,"Am a U.S.viewer, watching Series 1 on an all-region DVD player. I ordered this series as something my elderly mother might enjoy and have become engrossed myself. Sounding initially like a British variant on LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE, CANDLEFORD turns out to be a rich spectacle which discovers complexities in itself after pleasant but lightweight opening installments and by episode 4 becomes something altogether finer (I've seen only 1-7 so far). I think it not entirely accidental that this same fourth episode engineers a lengthy hiatus for LARK SPUR's most egregious blemish, the already oft-slammed Dawn French as the hamlet's debtor-reprobate. French isn't distractingly familiar in the U.S. but her lazy anachronistic performance, straight out of the classic ""Coarse Acting"" handbook, is an irritant just the same. Might as well note the other flaws that persist, noted in the more critical IMDb critiques: the usual over-explicit music; some wobbly continuity from one episode to the next (particularly notable in the lack of carryover after the milliner-sisters' traumatic reunion with their father); the disregard for the 18 mile separation of communities so forcefully laid-out in episode 1 and subsequently ignored; and, yes, the absence of squalor. Can't comment on the adaptation's disregard for the source-book since I haven't read it. <br/><br/>But lordy, how much else excels! The writing, encompassing parlor-protocol and pub-chatter, has Dickensian swagger. If LARK SPUR's creators disembarked from the original text, they found their independent stride within a few traversals of their 20-or-so characters. Note how the Welsh postman, an evangelical stereotype and already tiresome within the first hour, in Episode 5 has a spiritual crisis, conveyed in a layman-sermon whose earnestness emits a skittering undertone of near-madness (wonderfully performed by Mark Heap). The porcelain lady-of-the-manor of Eps. 1-2 by 6-7 emerges as a tragic heroine. Twister, Lark Spur's aged comic layabout and scrounger, in Episode 6 has recall of a long-dead sister he imagines come back to haunt him in scenes as rapturously sad and true to senescent remorse as any great tragic work (Karl Johnson, an actor I've never noted before, is extraordinary). More than simply showcasing the series' mostly wonderful cast, the collective of directors grows increasingly muscular in their framing of scenes as LARK SPUR progresses: a complex moment in Ep. 7, in which the squire's wife watches her husband across the street and submits to the goading of shopwomen she dislikes, imagining the worst, is shot with an economic forcefulness that moots distinctions between TV and cinematic filming. Nothing ""twee"" about craft of that order-- nor about the series itself, once past its establishing episodes. <br/><br/>Yet subtleties noted here are secondary to something LARK SPUR has in fixed place from the start: Julia Sawalha's post-mistress, and her rapport with lifetime friend and village squire Ben Miles, an attenuated near-romance that in abstract sounds an embarrassment-- two terrific actors who appear to realize they have found gorgeous grown-up roles in the unlikeliest of projects, and like the rest of the production's cast/crew, perform as if BBC's calculations about ""Sunday night programing"" wholly underestimated their work. I cannot push these Reg. 2 programs at friends, who haven't the equipment to play them, and so I can only enthuse here.

1560,Lark Rise to Candleford, Modern People in Period Garb,"Period pieces are really hard.<br/><br/>Done right, they are incredibly powerful because they demonstrate how random our prejudices are by showing plausible people with entirely different prejudices who still manage to be entirely human. Think, for example, of how Master and Commander made it seem not only fully real that a 12-year-old could lead men into battle but also completely natural within the film's world.<br/><br/>But tricks like that are very hard to pull off, and nearly every period piece falls into one of two opposing traps. Either they show people who act in ways that modern people cannot fathom — without conveying why they act like that — and thus make their characters seem wooden and fake. Or, at the other end of the spectrum, the characters speak and act in entirely modern ways that seem ridiculous to anyone with even the haziest memories of history class.<br/><br/>Lark Rise to Candleford falls into the latter category. Only one of the show's two dozen characters expresses any Christian faith whatever and all the other characters clearly think him a fool for it. (And he clearly is both a fool and a condescending hypocrite who doesn't understand anything about Christianity.) Men and women interact with absolute equality, at least among all the remotely sympathetic characters. Entire communities are just fine with obvious infidelity and basically everything else that would seem fine to a modern BBC exec but would, in actual history, horrify a Victorian yokel.<br/><br/>That's not to say it's the worst show on earth. To the contrary, it's likable enough, but it's no more an actual period piece that Monty Python's Life of Brian. If that's going to bother you, don't watch.",14 out of 20 found this helpful.,6.0,4 August 2013

1563,Lark Rise to Candleford, Not a Righteous Man in Lark Rise?,"I started watching this series a couple of months ago. Good acting, sets, cinematography, etc... but there was something about the basic ongoing plot that didn't seem real or believable.<br/><br/>A recent episode (Season 4, Ep. 5) brought this into plain light when Dorkus began talking to the other women about more or less ""allowing"" the men of Lark Rise to believe that they possess feminine qualities and pretending not to be the superior species that they truly are.<br/><br/>Now I was able to put my finger on the lack believability. In spite of the good acting, interesting stories and superior production quality, there was one important ingredient missing in the town of Lark Rise, unless it appeared fleetingly in some earlier episode that I missed; there is not a single competent, righteous, stable male, capable of existing without the direction and supervision of the town's women... that is, unless they're ""assumed"" to be there, just not appearing in the series.<br/><br/>Sure, some of the women have there flaws, but not so much so that they are unable to rain supreme over the town's mix of chronically flawed men who, without female guidance, would flounder haplessly and probably starve to death. I guess it's a good thing that those poor men have all those women to correct and redirect them repeatedly throughout each episode! <br/><br/>Seriously though...

1564,Lark Rise to Candleford, Harmless fun,"Harmless fun sums it up really, and nice to look at; ideal Sunday night untaxing stuff really. It bears little or no relationship to the books although if it gets people reading them that can only be a good thing. Dawn French lives down to all expectations; the Mrs Arless of the books was a slightly aloof and mysterious figure as I recall, from a different background to the other hamlet women, not a knockabout drunken clown. The accents are interesting too; the only one who has anything approximating to the correct accent for the area is Queenie's husband. I swear that in the first scene in which he appeared, Laura's father had a Scots accent. Pedant Alert: One thing, Lark Rise is based on Juniper Hill in North Oxfordshire near the Northamptonshire border. It is NOT in the Cotswolds.

1565,Lark Rise to Candleford, Nitpicking,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series, there are a few, shall we say technical details that bothered me throughout all 4 seasons. In the first episode we find that Lark Rise and Candleford are separated by something over 8 miles of road. A bit less if you cut through the fields however the walking time in either case would be about 3 hours each way. Through all of the episodes we see people moving between the communities as if they were only minutes apart. How did they move about so quickly? My other observation is that although Lark Rise is obviously a farming community, we never see any farm animals. Once there was a chicken on Twister's roof, Sydney's goose and of course there was Queenie's Berkshire pig in season-4, but no real farm animals. They always had lots of stews and sausages to eat though. These technical oversights always bother me, it is my one weakness...",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,12 July 2012

From what other poster's have commented, it would appear this television version bares no resemblance to the novels, but that is of little consequence, as it clearly does not aim to be.

1569,Lark Rise to Candleford, Like a family Soap Opera...but with period costumes.,"I've just finished watching season 1 of this series and, to cut to the chase, I'm not impressed. The acting was usually tolerable - Julia Sawalha and Olivia Grant were clear stand-outs and a pleasure to watch. The other actors have my pity: almost all the characters have been denied the basic right and necessity to develop and create depth. The writers and producers of this series (the first season, at least) should to go back to film school or pick up a history book to learn that 19th century life had far more meaningful worries than a lost parcel or teenage love triangles. <br/><br/>Many of the episodes start promisingly and tease the viewer with the prospect that they will soon be witnessing something more than inconsequential frivolities; and then in the last five or so minutes of the episode every inch of seriousness is cut short and the loose ends tied with a pretty yellow ribbon (no doubt purchased from the ridiculous Pratt sisters). To the credit of the show, it does occasionally present serious issues such as domestic abuse, financial mismanagement, and alcoholism. These issues are, however, trivialised in the show by the inability of any of the characters to develop and change after being inflicted by these issues: the beaten wife returns happily to her husband after she magically returns from the workhouse, the Pratt sisters are distraught and form a bond with Dorcas after being conned by their father only to be, five minutes later, back to their snarky old selves, a love interest to Dorcas (who was born in the workhouse and is therefore resilient) leaves town a few days after arriving in Candleford to avoid being fired from his job and to avoid one day, perhaps, growing unhappy with her, etc. <br/><br/>It's probably better for this show to steer clear from the serious stuff entirely unless it's going to address the harsh reality, and unhappy endings, which they may cause accurately. This series, set in two small country towns had the potential of being great if it didn't try to sugar coat every issue and with fluff. As such, I can only say that it is good - even then I'm being generous.",8 out of 14 found this helpful.,8.0,9 March 2013
1570,The Midnight Gospel, My thorough review: Not a traditional TV show... don't evaluate it according to those standards,"I'm seeing a lot of reviews that make inaccurate assumptions about the nature of this show. It's not merely podcast-inspired, a large portion of the dialogue is actual interview clips taken from Duncan Trussell's (Clancy) podcast ""The Duncan Trussell Family Hour"". Pendleton Ward was a fan of the podcast and collaborated with Trussell to create this show. Because of this, the majority creative voice that comes through in the show is Trussell's, so if you're looking for more Adventure Time, you won't necessarily find it here.<br/><br/>With that being said, I'm going to evaluate the show 1) as animation, 2) as entertainment, and 3) as education.<br/><br/>1) The animation in this is show fantastic. It's psychedelic, colorful, and imaginative. There are tons of tiny details packed into the background to look for, and it makes use of different drawing styles and mediums in a really creative way. People have complained that the conversations that take place in the show don't relate to the animation at all, but that's just not true. The animation usually serves as metaphor for or exploration of the topic of the conversation; a lot of the time this is executed in really clever ways that become more clear as the episode progresses. A minor gripe is that the animation frame rate is noticeably low in places, but I think it is understandable considering how much more detailed this show is when compared with other animated shows.<br/><br/>2) This show has two main sources of value: the spectacle of the animation and the conversations that Clancy has over the course of the show. If you come to this show looking for the entertainment you would get from a traditional TV show, you're bound to be disappointed, because there's not much in the way of plot, character development, or narrative tension. However, that doesn't mean there isn't any at all, and the story that unfolds over the course of the show relates to the themes of the conversations Clancy is having (The best example of this is the episode ""Annihilation of Joy"").<br/><br/>It's hard to say whether Clancy himself has changed by the end of the final episode. I think that Clancy is supposed the represent the human condition, especially of someone living today. He seems to run away from everything in his life, retreating into his universe simulator and escaping by entering other's lives (cough, Netflix, cough). He's so desperate to do so he doesn't pay attention to the beauty of the world around him, the suffering or needs of others, or even the obvious warnings coming from the simulator itself. He doesn't pay attention to the present!<br/><br/>I think he also serves as a critique of the detached stoner that this show is marketed towards, because he seems to convey gaining genuine understanding and insight during his conversations, but then can't seem to apply that to his own life. I will say that one weakness of the show is that it does seem like Clancy has things illustrated or explained to him that he should already understand, because the podcast conversations themselves are from various different times in Trussell's life (For example, Clancy expresses interest in mindfulness in the first episode and then seems to be unaware of the concept of presence much later in the show).<br/><br/>My main problem with the show from an entertainment perspective is that I don't think it succeeds in becoming something truly cohesive. If you go into it knowing it is derived from a podcast, you can easily distinguish the podcast dialogue from the new dialogue, and it can kind of take you out of the experience. If you go into the show knowing nothing about it, then it is bound to cause you confusion because the dialogue simply does feel disjointed from the show at times. I can sort of understand why others mistakenly thought the podcast and the animation were done completely separately, or that the podcast dialogue itself was scripted. Basically, I'm not sure that the show as a whole is always more entertaining than either just the animation, or just the conversation.<br/><br/>3) I'm pretty upset that this show was released on 04/20/20 for marketing purposes, and to be honest I wonder if it was Trussell and/or Ward's decision at all. I watched the first episode while high and found it impossible to keep track of what was happening. Sure, the show has psychedelic animation that makes it amazing to look at while high, but the conversations that are being had are of a genuine and complex nature. It is difficult to pay attention to both and that is a weakness of the show. THERE ARE REAL INSIGHTS PRESENT IN THESE CONVERSATIONS that you can learn about and benefit from. One weakness of the show is that these conversations can seem very surface-level for someone who has already investigated these topics. However, I think part of the value that this show has is presenting conversations about these difficult subjects in a way that is appealing and accessible to people that haven't looked into them or heard about them.<br/><br/>Some of the guests in the show are real philosophical, spiritual, and medical experts and the dialogue is not mere pseudo-intellectual stoner LSD babble as some others have characterized it. While psychedelic drugs are often abused as mere playthings, they can give people genuine insight. Some psychedelics have been scientifically proven to alleviate depression. There is also scientific evidence for the benefits of mindfulness meditation, a kind of meditation derived from Buddhism which is discussed in the show.<br/><br/>Please, watch this show sober with an open and non-judgmental mind, and research the guests and their backgrounds. No matter how druggy, unrealistic, stupid, depressing, or strange you think it is at first, I promise that there is meaning to the madness. You don't have to agree with everything (I don't), but I think it is disingenuous to dismiss the dialogue as shallow dribble, and it might be worth giving these ideas a second thought.<br/><br/>In sum, I think this show succeeds in experimenting with pairing incredible animation and meaningful podcast conversation. Has it pioneered the next big thing (long-form podcast animation) that will be imitated and iterated on in the future? I'm not sure, but it seems unlikely. It's possible to watch this just for the animation and the humor, but I think the conversations have a lot to offer as well.",221 out of 259 found this helpful.,8.0,22 April 2020
1571,The Midnight Gospel, Relax and listen without judging,"As others pointed out there are many 1,2 star reviews and I don't want others to think the show is bad. I think it's excellent, the conversations aren't scripted (since it's a podcast) so in a way, the conversations are much more real than the ones in any other show where the characters have dialog sheets that they have to follow.<br/><br/>I also think the animation style makes it worth watching each episode twice: once paying attention to the dialog, second time to the animation.<br/><br/>One of the ideas of mindfulness is not judging, to simply observe our thoughts and I think this show simply presents ideas. It doesn't judge, it's not saying ""you should think this because X"". It is simply presenting view points which I think is helpful to help anybody that wonders things like ""what's the purpose of life?"", ""what's the deal with people talking about presence and meditation, is it all just false?"", ""what is enlightenment?"", ""why do people talk about a separation between the thinking mind and the conscious, observing self?"", ""why do I FEEL like I'm suffering?"" etc. As such, the show simply presents ideas. It is up to everybody to decide which ideas (if any!) they accept. I don't think that makes the show bad, right?<br/><br/>Finally, I wonder if any of the bad reviewers have bothered to watch the full show, including the last episode. I think the last episode is an example of a level of truthfulness I don't think I've seen on any other series/film and tbh I ended up crying. I don't think one gets that from a 1-3 star show.",40 out of 49 found this helpful.,10.0,20 May 2020

Maybe because I feel like I've listened to podcasts or interviews around these topics that's pretty much the same or even better. They just don't have the means to put it in animation.

1583,The Midnight Gospel," Genre bending, watch with an open mind","I've been incredibly moved and entertained by this show. Many of the criticisms made by other commenters may be valid to their personal experience or their expectation going-in, but they ultimately miss the point of what The Midnight Gospel is about.<br/><br/>At its core, this is an animated podcast with elements of dialogue scripted and recorded by podcast guests much after the podcast's original creation. You have to accept fundamentally that the show's dialogue will not be fully coherent with the ""plot"" of each episode. While watching the first episode, I was very confused why the Little President character was referencing Ram Dass and Buddhism while also fighting off zombies. But I quickly came to realize that the dialogue was very intentionally detached from the show's ""plot."" You must accept that this is the nature of the show. Some of these podcast guests are not entertainers or voice actors so it is understandable why the dialogue seems less natural than a traditional cartoon.<br/><br/>There is an over arching plot to the midnight gospel. However, It develops slowly over the course of several episodes. I found Clancy's character development and plot interesting. I likely would have found a show solely based in fiction and the Clancy character just as interesting as a standalone project. But watching the Midnight Gospel you have to except that exploring the simulated worlds and Clancy's life is not the only or even primary purpose of the show.<br/><br/>Many of the podcast guests are genuine professionals in their fields. Other commenters have argued that the dialogue seems dumb-ed down or simply stoner talk. But you have to remember that each episode of the midnight gospel condenses a several hour long conversation into a digestible short format. Of course each conversation is not going to reach its full potential. But there are many genuine insights to be found through the conversations on the show. Interestingly, each guest has their own interpretation of mindfulness and existentialism some of which contradict each other. The show does not place a value judgment on these philosophies but merely offers them up for the viewer to interpret and judge themselves.<br/><br/>If you are not the kind of person who is interested in existential philosophy, Zen Buddhism and death acceptance then the midnight gospel simply won't appeal to you; but it's not fair to leave a negative review because the nature of the show's philosophy is disquieting to your worldview.<br/><br/>The art style is incredible. It's psychedelic nature is certainly drawing on inspiration from other adult cartoons yet develops its own unique character. Psychedelic adult cartoon is certainly becoming a form of entertainment and art in itself, especially in our culture which is becoming more accepting and open about the use of marijuana and LSD for both recreational and therapeutic purposes. But on the first go, I would watch the midnight gospel sober in order to enjoy the philosophical discussions.<br/><br/>The final episode, which hosts a conversation between Duncan and his late mother, was incredibly moving and has stayed with me for days. Especially paired with the penultimate episode, where Caitlin Doughty discusses the death acceptance movement in the United States and the idea of being mindful and prepared about the nature of our own mortality and the mortality of our loved ones.<br/><br/>Enjoy this genre bending show with an open mind!",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,13 September 2020
1584,The Midnight Gospel, Disappointing,"I watched the first five episodes hoping it would eventually get better, thinking that there might be a more interesting guest on the table next. I must say that each episode is a downright chore to sit through. Something like this should be right up my alley, and when I saw Pendleton Ward's name and read the description I was thoroughly excited. Ever the cynic, I watched the trailer and had my hopes dashed immediately. Slogging through episodes has only strengthened my feelings.<br/><br/>One of the top and most extensive (and well-written) reviews here claimed that the animation is often metaphorical to the conversation. I must disagree completely. Sure there are very loose threads here and there, but it's more of a general theming (i.e. stoner ideologues are zombies for thinking weed is good, deer-dogs wax on death while going through a meat processing plant, a robot cat Fisher talks about Western spiritualism while bursting out of a larger version of himself), but aside from that theming the two are entirely unrelated.<br/><br/>Just what about giving an old witch (who milks crow teats to make potions out of her eyeballs) a child bomb, before slaying a pirouetting demon has ANYTHING AT ALL to do with listening and fostering a sense of community and compassion? I'll wait. Exactly nothing. Aside from that very loose theme in the setting of a knight questing to save her boyfriend in this dangerous and lonely world, the actual episode itself has nothing to do with the topic at all. They don't capitalize on this theming to enhance and explore the message either, it's just there.<br/><br/>As amazing as the artwork looks, the animation is terrible. I'm generally opposed to making this complaint, but I can't help but do so here. I watch a lot of anime and cartoons, generally shaking my head as elitists screech about dropped frames, cgi, and any cost-cutting measures by the respective studio at all. In my opinion, the story and characters far outway the graphical fidelity; I just want a passable product with an engaging world and characters. The Midnight Gospel has no real characters, and while it has a variety of imaginative worlds, neither of these concepts nor the overarching main plot have any depth at all. They are merely cardboard cutouts that attempt to distract you from the boring conversation.<br/><br/>And, oh boy, is the conversation boring. I don't understand how people consider this deep. I was one such stoner waxing philosophy for a time, and I can assure you that the conversations I had with my friends were more substantial than the drek presented here. This level of discussion is so basic that it's essentially two people completely blitzed out of their minds given a more extensive vocabulary. There's no real insight. There's no real passion.<br/><br/>Each speaker may have a tentative grasp on their subject, but they fail to convey that subject to an unfamiliar audience. The end result feels trippy (I've been there with other products) and mind-blowing, but that's because they are bloviating about, drowning the topic in endless jargon and unnecessary personal references, without ever getting at the true ESSENCE of it. Of course the end result feels profound and difficult to understand to the uninitiated. In reality a whole lot of talking is going on, but very little is being said.<br/><br/>In my case, I have no knowledge of the spiritual practices of Aleister Crowley or LeVayan Satanism. I find both quite interesting but never cared to delve into the topic myself. Therein lies the greatness of a podcast-- it can whet my appetite in a low-effort manner (on my part anyway). And yet I learned absolutely nothing of value from that episode. It actually made me not want to think about Crowley ever again because of how steeped the discussion was in literal psychobabble. The skeptic in me was screaming the whole time, 'Will someone please challenge the idea that you can crystallize your soul in solar energy and use it to reincarnate and astral project!' but alas my pleas went unanswered, hindering the discussion by keeping it disconnected from the real world. How else can those ideas be applied? What other interpretations are there? What use are these practices to a person uninterested in Nirvana? Exactly how are these practices different from intensive forms of meditation? What would you say to someone advocating for those instead? What is referenced by the word magic? Are there rites and spells? Do you hold sacrifices? Is this term merely for differentiation from Eastern practices? How does your magic differ from the various popular conceptions of magic? Not a single one of those questions is ever posed or answered. This episode barely even dipped its toe into something outlandish, and left me entirely disinterested and bored. It fails as an introduction to the topic and would cease to be relevant for a higher level discussion among those familiar.<br/><br/>I think this is indicative of their guest list as well. Up to this point they've all been pseudo-deep people making their living in the self-help grist mill. Dr. Drew alone made me cringe. If these are the most poignant discussions Duncan Trussel has in his podcast, I don't think I would enjoy chatting with him in person very much.",100 out of 200 found this helpful.,1.0,24 April 2020
1585,The Midnight Gospel, Wanted to Love This,"On its head, the premise of this short series sounds and looks intriguing. A show that it going to tackle existential questions in a less roundabout way than popular shows like Rick and Morty, and less fast and looser than Bojack Horseman. Animated, psychedelic-everything about this series says it should be good, but it's woefully disappointing. It is essentially an animated podcast. It's a rambling circlejerk with pseudo-deep conjecture. Ironic that it seems to take itself too seriously considering the absurdist cartoon backdrop. Maybe if there was a plot? Maybe if the conversations were more structured instead of just streams of consciousness? I wasn't bothered by the gore (there's a lot of it). The conversations just went nowhere, and not in the sort of philosophical sense that these are age-old questions with no real solutions. They just stopped at weird end of the high points. The animation on its own is interesting, I'd suggest listening on mute and playing Be Here Now or your favorite existential podcast or trippy soundtrack, but everything else is over-inflated ego at work.",110 out of 224 found this helpful.,1.0,20 April 2020

The animation is great, the worlds they go to for the most part seem interesting, but you find out very quick that you won't get the opportunity to explore any of it because two people you don't care about from real life are just going to talk over it the whole time. It honestly feels very lazy, as instead of actually creating characters or an actual story, you have completely unrelated audio on top of completely detached animation. It makes the show incredibly hard to follow because the talking is NONSTOP. Its so annoying. Its very easy to get taken out of the show too when these animated characters just start talking about jesus or the bible, when they're supposed to be robot fish people living in a world where jesus shouldn't even be a thing. OR when the podcast guests just say things like ""hey I've known you for so long so I can tell you this"" when in the show these ""characters"" literally just met. You can tell theres no care whatsoever into making the show cohesive in any way, obviously because its easier just to have random people talk for an hour and use that for audio rather than writing engaging characters with a plot and story.
This show could MAYBE work, if the people in the podcast tried at all to act like a character in the show. I actually love the idea of a podcast between an interdimensional wizard and a deer about to be slaughtered, if those are the characters I'm listening to.

For fans of Adventure time with Finn and Jake, you wont be too put off by the super weird premise of an alternate universe traveling dude having conversations with the strange characters he meets. But what's different about this, what makes it very grown up, is the subject matter explored both visually and verbally by the show's creators Pendleton Ward and Duncan Trussell who also lends voice to the main character. Psychedelics, high magick, death, ego... my 12 year old watched them with hypnotic focus and listened attentively to the delivery of this information: it's a podcast, animated with ridiculous beauty and sprinkled with the occasional buy-in to the fantasy painted in the mostly unscripted dialogue. Naturally flowing from being very aware that the exchange is taking place in what is probably a very ordinary studio to the interviewee's seamless participation in the visual story line, allowing the viewer to really give in to the uniqueness of the format.

1594,The Midnight Gospel, Lazy and uninspired,"I started watching this show without having heard anything about it beforehand. Thought it would be a fun, beautiful, whimsical animated show reminiscent of Adventure Time (only later did I learn that its creator was involved in this).
Well, after just one episode, I thought was done. It was the most uninteresting thing (I wouldn't even go as far as to call it a show) I've seen in... a while. The core concept just doesn't make any sense. Why would I ever want to listen to a podcast (and a pretty bad one, mind you) while looking at choppy nonsensical animated action sequences ? I would actually be grateful if someone could explain to me how this notion is appealing in any way.
I have to admit, though, I was not completely turned off. There was a little part of me that was still curious. Suffice to say, that glimmer of hope was gone after the second episode. For most the second episode I thought that actually the show was secretely a parody or a mockery of religion, spirituality, meditation etc on account of the discussion of Christianity. I held onto this belief after it was over. I was too exhausted to continue so I did what any sane person would do and went online to check what this ""show"" is really about. And, I frankly couldn't believe it. According to the few people who seem to have enjoyed it, it's about having deep and profound conversations on existential topics. Unfortunately, the first two episodes are anything but that. The conversations are mostly nonsense, jumping from one topic to another without any real insight causing more confusion than clarity.
So, my two cents - don't watch it unless you are high or completely insane.",69 out of 142 found this helpful.,2.0,21 April 2020
1595,American Idol, Optimistic to the Point of Foolishness,"There comes a time in every reasonable man's life when he must sit down in his living room and watch an episode of American Idol. Truth is I'm not a reasonable man. Or even a reasonable woman, now that I think about it. I have, however, watched an episode of American Idol and will go so far as to say that I have religiously watched three seasons of it. First season was great. Second season was good. During third season, I got wiser and realized that the show wasn't as good anymore, but still I watched. It had lost its magic, its X-Factor, you could say. During fourth season, I watched four or five episodes. By then, I had rediscovered sitcom television. Now comes fifth season, and the inevitable disappointment that lurks around the show reappears again. Yet, people still watch the show because they are too brainwashed not to.<br/><br/>Then again, what else is there to watch on Tuesdays? Or Wednesdays. Or Thursdays. Or any other night of the week, for that matter. I mean, why watch anything else when I can watch the new season or reruns of past performances made readily available via my Handy-Dandy DVD player? (Yes, we bought the Best of Season One. So sue me.) I must say that American Idol has become predictable. A ""dude, man, dawg"" from Randy Jackson. An ""I just want to eat you up and make all our viewers sick to their stomachs with my infinite well of gaga comments"" from Paula Abdul. And ""Enter sarcastic, British remark here"" from Simon Cowell. Cue Ryan Seacrest's idiotic retort and make-the-girls-swoon smile. The contestants are the same: air-headed bimbos, wannabe rockers, real rockers, melt-the-camera-with-a-stare heartthrobs, belters, and the like. For goodness sake, give us something good to watch again! Every now and then we get fantastic singers like Kelly Clarkson, Tamira Grey, and Clay Aiken. The rest are a little more or less than mediocre. Come to think of it, I can't remember the last time I heard Ruben, Fantasia, or Diana on the radio. Don't even mention Justin Guarini. What a waste of his perfectly good talent. The only thing Idol can do for you is give you a year, if that, of fame, then send you on back home to the karaoke bars in Oneida, Tennessee. Tough break, kids.<br/><br/>It is just unfair to see what they do to these contestants. They get the same amount of men as they do women to avoid any legal problems about gender bias. Completely bogus! Sometimes, there are better men than some of the women on that show (and vice versa), so why should they be cut just so the Idol producers won't be accused of discrimination on the cover of tabloids. The real crime is letting a bunch of less-than-worthy singers get on just to balance things out. And then some of the singers get scolded for song choices. Oh, no, Heaven forbid someone does a Mariah or a Whitney! No, no! Those are untouchable. I just have my fingers crossed that one contestant will finally lash out at Randy, saying, ""Well, Mr. Jackson, you give me a list of songs I'm not supposed to do, and I'll make sure I sing them all just for you."" Even if they are really good, nothing is as good as the original, so just give up.<br/><br/>The producers of Idol need to take a step back from the show they've created and look at what it has become: a rigged popularity contest. The only thing Idol is good for is delaying House episodes for weeks at a time. What a waste of an Emmy and Golden Globe winning show. Producers, you need some variety in this show. Just keep your fingers crossed that you choose the correct Idol this time, as you seem to think that America is too intellectually inept to do so themselves. Greenlighting this overstayed-it's-welcomed show for another season and thinking that the same people are still going to love it would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.

1597,American Idol, Yer basic love/hate relationship - more hate than love by 2013,"I've watched every episode of this show from its inception, and, sadly but not surprisingly, I have seen it become more and more cheesy as the years go by. <br/><br/>For starters, Seacrest has to go. If you look up the word smarmy in the dictionary, you will see his picture. And the judges are all a joke at this point - they've become caricatures of themselves, it seems, and nothing they have to say means anything, nor do the viewers' votes actually count, since I believe the producers of the show will not have someone win whom they do not approve of (meaning someone they can't control). The contestants are still good, though, which is why I still watch: I'm a sucker for a talent show and I do love seeing someone do really well, as Jordin is doing this year. And let's face it, the show is an incredible spectacle - the modern equivalent of, say, the gladiators in the Colosseum. <br/><br/>Last night, they kicked off the ""Idol Gives Back"" thing, where, for every vote cast, ten cents would be donated by the shows' sponsors - Ford, Coca Cola, and A T &amp; T - toward the world's hunger crisis. Seacrest stood there, in all his sanctimonious smarminess, preaching to us about how we were not just voting this week, we're ""saving lives."" I'm all for ending hunger in all countries of the world, beginning with our country, don't get me wrong, but this to me feels like a very underhanded and sleazy way to obtain more publicity for the show.<br/><br/>The corporations in question have enough money to fully end all world hunger if they wanted; they do not need our votes to contribute to that cause. And it would be a tax write-off for them, to boot. By telling people they are ""saving lives"" by voting, the producers of the show (and Seacrest, as their shamelessly pathetic talking head - he's like Max Headroom without the soul) are implying that the opposite is true, as well: if you don't vote, you are NOT saving lives.<br/><br/>About the show itself: the worst thing is how they never let the contestants sing a whole song, they have to condense their song into a minute and a half, and then they get criticized for not having enough feeling or enough conviction or enough personality, blah blah blah. A song has to be complete in order for it to legitimately 'live' - the emotion or feeling of it has to build and you cannot genuinely do that when you're forced to cut out most of it. They have time on the show for all sorts of crap, but they can't make time for the performers to actually SING. I commend anyone who can come on week after week and manage to give a credible performance under these conditions, something the judges don't seem to acknowledge or appreciate.<br/><br/>Where will it all end? I predict a few more seasons, and then hopefully the network will take the show off before it deteriorates into an even tackier circus than it's already become.<br/><br/>Added 3/6/13 ~ This season hopefully will be the last. Brutal.<br/><br/>Added 2/21/14 ~ Still going' on. It's a joke at this point; everybody feels it. Keith Urban, J-Lo and Harry Connick Jr. are very strange judges, not much credibility there, and of course Seacrest is still on board, still smarmy as ever. This time the question is : WHEN will it all end? I couldn't even watch the preliminary episodes this year, the whole selection process and the Hollywood thing, the group challenge, blah blah blah. Cannot stand how they play with the contestants' heads, when they call them in to That Room, making them walk from the elevator all the way to their desk in Outer Mongolia, only to torture them with the 'well, you know we can't pick everyone and we're really sorry, we don't know how to tell you this...(long dramatic pause)...but you're going through!""

His blunt matter of fact, tell-it-like-is approach to telling the unvarnished truth to the no-talent wannabes who audition is something I find very refreshing. Especially when their egos and attitudes are directly proportional to the extent that they suck -- meaning the more they suck, the more ego and attitude they tend to have. (Not with all, but certainly a lot of them) Then there are others who don't have attitude and are devastated by criticism and can be seen in tears later, and even if they were bad I feel a little sorry for them. But that's simply the reality, of the music business and if these kids can't handle it, then they shouldn't be trying to forge a career as a musical artist.<br/><br/>That's reality, and Simon gives them this much needed reality check.

1601,American Idol," Elegant proof that the RIAA still does not get ""it""...","The basic premise behind American Idol, a talent show in which a large number of contestants battle it out to get a recording contract, is one that has inspired a number of films and television shows. The problem is that the idea is one rooted firmly in the 1960s, when the Recording Industry Assocation of America was relevant, people's tastes were so underdeveloped that one genre would capture most of the world's attention, and the so-called top ten actually reflected what people were buying. But the revelations of the past twenty or so years have turned that entire notion on its head. No longer do we believe that the top ten is actually a reflection of our tastes (in fact many articles have been published to the effect that the pop charts are rigged), and the RIAA no longer has sole control over how we hear artists. In fact, independent, underground recording labels have seen their business explode tenfold since the MP3 revolution, and for the first time in history, the advertising of recording artists has truly become a level playing field.<br/><br/>All of this translates into increasing irrelevance for talent quests like American Idol. Much of the commentary I hear about the show revolves around the three judges, who are in essence the real stars. Do not look at them, however, they are not the reason the show is entirely irrelevant. In fact, they are about the only connection the show really has to the present-day market for music. Paula Abdul reflects the overly optimistic approach that many of the RIAA's marketeers suffer from, Randy Jackson highlights the irrelevance, and Simon Cowell repeats exactly what the more intelligent section of the buying public is thinking. Indeed, for all the complaints about Cowell's cruelty, he is about the only thing worth watching the show for because of his unflinching ability to slap hopefuls in the face with reality. To quote his comments to William Hung, you cannot sing, you cannot dance, so what do you want us to say? Ironically, aside from one contestant, Hung has achieved far more recognition and fame due to his uncynical, earnest attitude than anyone else who has appeared on the show.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the contestants themselves. To partly quote Alexei Sayle, I might be stupid like, but I happen to know that butchering the material of other people is never going to give a fair indication of how much ability an artist has. Although Kelly Clarkson's post-Idol material is irrelevant to me, it also demonstrates she has enjoyed the most success of the lot because she can create something of her own. Covers of top-forty filler songs that were not even relevant to the audience back then will prove very little. Even the selection of songs is so tepid as to be monotonous. Once you have heard one talentless pretty face cover Whitney Houston, you have heard them all. At least on the versus albums released by the black metal underground, they challenged each other to cover each other's songs, as well as songs by an artist that they would otherwise not normally play, such as GGFH or Frank Zappa. Even something as straightforward as Glenn Danzig would baffle the imagination-challenged idiots of Idol.<br/><br/>The scary thing is that after nine out of ten finalists fail to get so much as a mention after their term on the show is over, the powers behind it still want to blame piracy for ailing record sales. They fail to understand something that the independents and underground long ago incorporated into their market strategy. You see, as much as I disparage the Beatles or their ilk for being the original boy bands, they made it big when they did because at that time, nobody had heard anything like them. They had the right combination of novelty and semi-solid songwriting that also propelled bands like Black Sabbath or Bathory to notoriety. Kelly Clarkson, Justin Gaurini, and everyone that has followed after them, just have nothing to offer that is exceptional or unique. Twenty-five years ago, when radio fare was not nearly so narrow or limited, acts like Devo created a stir because they pushed envelopes. Funk-punk, electronica, and punk-pop had observers that were of the same age then as Cowell is now asking what was next.<br/><br/>So when I say that the present crop of pop musicians that shows like Idol attempt to promote as if they are the hottest thing since tofu are little more than a damp squib, I want you to understand my full meaning. As I stated differently in my comments about Metallicrap's recent aping of Spinal Tap, the world has moved on from this kind of thing. Maybe it is time that Simon Fuller and his cronies realised this, because I am kind of certain that Simon Cowell and to a lesser extent Paula Abdul have realised it. Indeed, as I sit here listening to Danzig, a man who has more creativity in his fingernails than every single contestant who has been on every iteration of Idol worldwide would have in their collective bodies, I find something is quite rotten in the state of the music industry. While I wish Clarkson the best in her efforts to exploit the fame that Idol brought her, I really just wish these people would raise their bar concurrently with the way the ears of the wider world have raised theirs. At the very least, we could get Red Symons of Skyhooks fame to judge a few shows. With him and Cowell on the same panel, contestants might spontaneously combust from the ego-checks.<br/><br/>American Idol is a two out of ten show. Nobody on the show save Cowell seems to know a thing.",36 out of 57 found this helpful.,2.0,5 May 2007

1604,American Idol, I'm with Simon.,"Far too much of this show is pathetic. From the cheap looking stage to the under choreographed numbers to the sugary judges, this show frequently misses the mark. But there are some fine singers. Most of them have the pipes, it's just control that they lack, a good singer knows when to not use their powerful voice. Sometimes, in some numbers, you can see what the show was intended to be, a display of top talent fighting for break. The high note for me is the unflinching honesty of Simon Cowell. While Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul spent too much time glad handing decent performances, but Simon keeps his emotions in check, trying to dispense advice. Too often he is put down by window dresser Ryan Secrest for not having fun. It's refreshing to listen to someone try to honestly dissect a performance and for those who think he is too harsh, a lot of people will be telling these contestants that they aren't good enough, it's time for them move past their natural talent and grow thicker skin.

The choreography was often under-rehearsed, the singers sometimes pick the wrong songs for their voice(a huge danger when it comes to singing), the lighting was dim, the clothes that some contestants wear either in auditions(ie. Bikini Girl and the guy in the Pink Rabbit suit) or on the live shows(ie. Carly) are either too revealing or unflattering and I am not a fan of Ryan Seacrest's presenting. Also the show is very exploitative, I know the X Factor is quite exploitative, but this brings the meaning of exploitation to a whole new level. It is not entirely the show's fault though, the media are mostly to blame too. Then there are those who don't make it through Hollywood or the live shows, they cry and say that American Idol is their life. Give me a break, I am not trying to sound insensitive, but there are many many good things you can do with your life other than go on American Idol, if you really want to sing, join a pop band, a musical theatre or opera group, you may find they are better in terms of time value.<br/><br/>Overall, formulaic, tired and predictable, not to mention exploitative. 2/10 for the auditions.

Another disgusting aspect of the show is that people think it's funny. Believe me, it's as funny as seeing Oklahoma slaughter Texas A&amp;M 77-0 in a football game or USC pound the Sooners themselves, 55-19. There is no difference between humiliating somebody on a football field and crushing somebody who can't sing but is trying. Anyone with those beliefs should die or be my slaves.

1608,American Idol, Please go away,"I enjoyed the show in the first couple of seasons and enjoyed some of the products that came from this show. But, it is time for this show to go away. I know I have an unpopular view, but I am sick and tired of 3 days of programming being taken up for this seemingly endless parade of over inflated egos and a line up of people whom I never want to see on TV ever again. Not to mention the relentless beating of the dead horse with Idol Rewind and the hours spent on showcasing the worst of the worst in American Karaoke. There has to be a better way for these kids to be discovered and/or rejected than taking up our time and patience. Please go quietly into that good night and don't look back.

1609,American Idol, Absolutely Ridiculous,"It is wholly inexplicable and mystifying that a nation could be so obsessed with a show like this, a worthless, fifteen-minutes-of-fame, trashy-so-it's-bad piece of garbage that captivates more collective attention than the average Presidential race. Constantly, I am forced to hide in my room when this show comes on because it overrides all other shows where I live. With paper-thin walls, I can hear every minute of it: the generic pop voices, the horrible auditions at the beginning of every season that throw pathos out the window, and the growing absurdity of the judge's sweetness, complacency, and ruthlessness. It is by far a more rewarding experience to watch unintelligent programs mock this show than it is to watch it itself-- ""Shrek 2,"" anyone? And ""American Idol Rewind,"" a vapid expansion of the show's early years, is even more heinous and pointless. Yet people continue to watch the competition, from talentless winners (Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Taylor Hicks, etc.) to unique, worthwhile losers (Daughtry!) But guess what. Even Chris Daughtry hates it when people mention his appearance on this show. Because it is, in its own, Idol way, a puerile, infantile, mindless and banal exercise in finding the next unlikely hero to throw through the ruthless pop culture gum-ball machine. A word of advice to the people who actually tune in every January: go and watch the classic 1981 movie musical ""Shock Treatment."" Once you see its town overwhelmed to Orwellian proportions by TV shows like this, you will see the error of your remote-controlled ways.",26 out of 45 found this helpful.,1.0,20 January 2008
1610,American Idol," Popular yes, but that doesn't make it good . . .","Sure the show pulls high ratings, provokes fevered discussion and might even be fun for its viewers. They've assembled a tight trio of judges with good natured rapport and enough of a comprehensive critical eye to weed through the shallow, fame-craving riff-raff . . . however . . . I am here to bury Idol, not to praise it! At most the show is a guilty pleasure, as hollowly insubstantial as it is trite. It's best fit as passive, ultimately forgettable recreation for a preadolescent audience with no other life concern except perhaps their schoolwork. The final irony is that all of the ""American Idols"" picked by the judges and the viewers, with the possible exception of Carrie Underwood, have sooner or later vanished from the formerly adoring public eye that created them!

Randy's ""yo yo yo"" is just old and annoying, Paula as the ""nice one"" is quickly becoming annoying, Simons sarcastic British comments are becoming overly done and Ryan Seacrest is possibly *the* most annoying host on television.

I find it cruel and unnecessary. I also find that Simon Crowell's comments are pretty accurate about the contestants. I used to watch Star Search, with Ed McMahon, and thought that was great, but this is much more interesting. I would like to see the handling of cutting contestants changed.

1615,American Idol, With Its' Way Ups and Pretty Pathetic Downs,"This show is a reality show at heart. Thousands of people audition in front of three judges, the infamous (yet truthful. People, if they're bad singers, don't blame him!) Simon, Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul. They're mostly given the boot but some pass and go through many elimination rounds until we, the viewers, get to vote and slowly one-by-one toss out the final ten until we get one American Idol.<br/><br/>The first episodes are definitely the ones that spark its' popularity. As an exchange for a free contract deal, FOX is allowed to videotape and broadcast anyone they want.<br/><br/>This is the 5, 000+ auditioning stage. With so many people of so many cities, we've got to find at least a dozen people who think they can sing. I'm talking about the bad ones. Emphasize on THINK.<br/><br/>It's sad when they say they've always had a singing dream and are awful. But it's hilarious when people outburst because they now THOUGHT (or still think) they can sing. One guy on a recent season 2 episode thought he deserved to be the American Idol 'cause he thought he could sing and he stood out 5 days in the cold. Too bad he sounded like a bird being strangled.<br/><br/>There was another one of the same episode who said he had a dream(so far sad) of being a singer. He sings, and puts way too much into it(he's trying to sound like Enrique Glasias"", and is turned down(still sad). He's OK, though, and walks out with a smile(right now confusing). He then walks out and proclaims to everyone he's going to Hollywood(the next round)(a little funny). About an audition later, the camera finds him sitting waiting for an audition. He explains to the security guard with the cameraman he's been invited back(now funny). As this never happens, the security guard doesn't hesitate to correct him and boots him out(kinda funny). He yells while leaving(the security guard lets him walk out himself) ""I'll see you all in Hollywood!"".(funny)<br/><br/>One last one, a girl couldn't believe they said she was just under average, good only hidden in a crowd of a choir. She denies being turned down, and when the host(with proof) asks her didn't she get refused Hollywood, she states she doesn't know, and tries to get back in to find out. One thing: she's a terrible liar. For ratings, she's allowed back in. Simon asks her hadn't they already seen her. She clearly wants a second chance, but strangely tries to start with (maybe the host was there) ""I wanted to know if I'm going to Hollywood"". ""No, because you're terrible."". And it ends.<br/><br/>The second round is OK, as the crowd of about 200 is brought down to 30. The people who don't make it get a chance to speak out.<br/><br/>After that, we start voting, while the judges provide their thoughts. In a clearly planned move, you take away the bad singers now, and wind up with audience interaction. It's not the same, but you still see one vote and wonder how many people are trying to mess it all up by purposely trying to wind up with a bad singer winning.<br/><br/>I really enjoy the first parts more. But it's truly speechless. You have to see it to believe it.",27 out of 54 found this helpful.,,22 January 2003
1616,American Idol, America still doesn't get it...,"Words cannot describe my anger and frustration towards this karaoke style reality show. Clearly, I don't understand the popularity of American Idol. I really don't, and it's shows like this that explain the outer frame of today's mediocre television line-up.<br/><br/>It's basically a who's who contest of finding pop singers who can make it to the top in fashion. Because I'm no critic, I'm not going to present this review in an overly sophisticated fashion where the average person has a hard time understanding it. Instead, I'll get straight to the point and tell you why American Idol needs to leave our social conscious.<br/><br/>The reasons for America enjoying American Idol are in fact, shallow and poorly presented. Reality Television has transformed into nothing but seeing average people make an idiot out of themselves just so they can gain the money and fame they so desperately needed. For most of the auditions presented at the beginning of each season, that is what we're seeing. The premise is obviously scripted and there is nothing that relates American Idol to real life situations. Every year we see young adults and kids who try out to advance further in the frame of American Idol. They humiliate themselves on national television, and we're supposed to think that's entertaining. The judges, on the other hand, are the ones who perpetrate, and get away with it. Simon Cowell is well known for his overly biased personality, and he feels obliged to bash a young woman to tears. But with the majority of contestants possessing no talent, he may as well give it up and try something that is more pleasing to the human mind.<br/><br/>This is what we see every season, and for some, American Idol is growing weary. I can't give a clear reason why America becomes overly obsessed with such an unoriginal, stale show that makes people think that it was something influential. Every contestant who has both failed and succeeded in getting a record deal has offered nothing that is exceptional or unique. The only singers that American Idol accepts are pop singers. If you're trying to find a rock singer, band player, or a rapper, look elsewhere. American Idol only adds to the realization that the current music industry is in horrible shape. Radio fare has become so narrow and close minded that once you've heard a few songs, you've heard them all. American Idol has done nothing to help that problem, and many of the winners are quickly forgotten after the season's end.<br/><br/>Let's give ourselves a big break and end American Idol. The newer seasons have nothing new to offer and it's only there to have the mentally-challenged idiots try to put up a show that hit rock bottom from day one. American Idol is an insult to the music industry, pure and simple. If talented, hard working musicians play second fiddle to talentless, pop singer wannabes who earn their fifteen minutes of fame, then you know something is wrong. They have no actual need to build a steady, long lasting career in the music industry. After they end their run, they are quickly forgotten in the general audience. The season ends and American Idol presents itself in the coming year with the same material. Rinse, wash, repeat.<br/><br/>So in perspective, American Idol is a reality show that earned more than it should of. It has helped contribute to the Reality television genre as a norm, and it's a good reason why most people today don't possess much intelligence. The show is unintelligent and pointless, and we're supposed to shove it down our throats in the hopes that most of us will get recognized by an overly biased producer. American Idol is part of the shallow pop culture machine, a premise that insults our intelligence and social being. If more people were smart enough to turn off their television to do something worthwhile, than Reality television, as a concept, wouldn't exist. But instead, Reality shows are presented in the dozens, showing everyday Americans at their worst. I refuse to take any part in the American Idol society of mindless teenagers and socially unaware critics. Reality television is anything but reality. By all means, avoid.<br/><br/>One out of Ten.",12 out of 21 found this helpful.,1.0,9 March 2009
1617,American Idol, Fake,"Won't say who it was out of respect for their privacy, but a friend of mine went to audition for this atrocity to television. <br/><br/>They didn't even let this person audition. They filmed everything up to the top 20 on the same day and made it look real. When everyone comes for the audition, they actually mean they're going to decide who will actually audition. They will randomly tell people they can go just because they look funny and think it would be hilarious to see on TV, and don't let other people go because they look to ordinary or they don't look TV material. Then they let some of the people they chose sing for 5 seconds, and if that 5 seconds doesn't please them they don't get to audition with the judges and move on. This happened with my friend.<br/><br/>This is INSULTING. Many artists would feel privileged to have the opportunity to express their paintbrush for the world to see.

When the judges give their honest opinion..if it is a bad one, the fans boo when they were actually bad. and what is worse is all the reason for voting is so the cute guy or hot girl can win i.e. Sanjaya, John Stevens and they stay on while the ones that are actually good and have a future get off. i.e. Daughtry. and they take their sweet time just getting to the results.<br/><br/>As for the judges, Randy Jackson ain't bad, Paula Abdul can get very annoying and well Simon is probably the main reason why this show is still on.<br/><br/>I don't see how people can sit and watch people sing.

1622,On Becoming a God in Central Florida, The brilliant Kirsten Dunst headlines a superb Emmy-worthy takedown of capitalism,"Ostensibly about a multilevel marketing scheme (MLM) called FAM, what this show is really about is the American dream, capitalism, and the lies we tell to maintain an air of immense success right around the corner when nothing could be further from the truth. In one of the few series about working-class people, Krystal Stubbs (another iconic character from the truly underrated Kirsten Dunst who should have a million Oscar nominations by now) is a water park employee whose life is tragically upended because of her husband (Alexander Skarsgard, darkly hilarious) snarls, hisses, manipulates, and deceives up the ranks of the same pyramid scheme she despises.<br/><br/>Dunst is spectacular. There is really no other word for it. In her hands, Krystal isn't really an ""anti-hero"" but someone you actually really root for and empathize with-everything, after all, is for her baby daughter, Destinee! And her relationship with her ""superior"" (called ""upline"") Cody (Theodore Pellerin, destined for big things I'm sure) is twisted and delicious.<br/><br/>There's this crazy tone to the series. I've genuinely never seen anything like it. Sure, it's faithful to Florida weirdness but the surreal, weird, dark, and really, really funny is balanced with a tremendous amount of empathy for the working-class characters populating this show. At the end of the day, it's Dunst's show. And like her, the show doesn't give a crap about looking too ugly or being too weird or vicious or surreal or really, really funny. And it definitely doesn't give two hoots about its brutally satirical takedown of the peculiarly American brand of capitalism.",63 out of 87 found this helpful.,10.0,26 August 2019

1624,On Becoming a God in Central Florida, So far so good,"From reading previous ratings, I think some people (a) might not enjoy dark comedy and (b) also don't understand how dark and twisted the world of MLM's can actually be. The people who say the story is outlandish must not really know much about point 'b'. A story about that world SHOULD be dark. and should be full of unlikable characters. I can also assume a lot of really low reviews might be from people involved in MLM's because the rating for the show on here currently is really right about where it should be (a 7-8 is fair I think). I don't see any way this show warrants a one star review.<br/><br/>The acting and story are both solid. It's a dark show with comedic elements, based on what is a really dark topic. Read up on how MLM's ruin some people's lives, and you will likely appreciate the story more, and why it's being told the way it is. I think it delivers on what it's trying to deliver on.<br/><br/>One thing I agree with other reviewers whether they have left good or bad reviews is that I am not sure if this show could hold up for too many seasons.

1625,On Becoming a God in Central Florida, Great first few episodes.

Due to some unforeseen writing reasons, she takes the same road her husband drove, literally and figuratively, and finds herself in a predicament seen miles and miles away. This makes the character appear senile and beyond desperate - stupid and reckless. There is a point in the story where she contemplates faking orders to keep her status, days/weeks, especially after finding out her husband did the same thing. Why? Bad writing.<br/><br/>Characters: What was the point to Marti? She had potential but you gave her a drug problem and threw the character under the rug. Either they had big plans to bring down FAM in one season, but it was renewed so they completely threw the story off course.<br/><br/>Acting: Not terrible but good.

They come off as authentic pathetic Americans hoping to work their way up to a fantastic life through the false promises of a crap pyramid scheme which still very much exist today.<br/><br/>Not to mention, it starred Alexander Skarsgaard for only the very first episode slaying his role as he does in every single thing I've ever seen him in. There's a reason the producers of True Blood took him from a secondary temp character to a main character for the entirety of the remaining seasons.<br/><br/>I don't know how else to hype this show, but for Showtime it may be my favorite series on the network since Californication and on any network period.Definitely worth checking out.<br/><br/>And now very slight spoilers, if it is even that- I think now 6 episodes in this show is going to take a turn like Weeds did. I think it is only a matter of time before Dunsts character snaps and starts breaking the law in every way possible.

1641,On Becoming a God in Central Florida," Story is an 9, acting is a 7 (carried by Dunst) - so this is a solid 8 in my book","I actually lived in Florida in the 90's - and the whole pyramid marketing scheme thing was rampant... so yeah - this show hits home, even if everything is a bit over-exaggerated... I even remember being invited to a 'business meeting' where I was told to wear a suit/tie - and when I got there, literally every person was wearing a cheap suit and had one of those hard briefcases with the combination locks... The main 'hero' got on stage and the crowd went nuts over this guy... literally - just like this show. For those of you too young to have seen this in real life - believe me. this actually happened, pretty much just like this show.<br/><br/>The story is good - the first episode was a little off balance w/the slow build-up of the 'be your own boss' pyramid scheme infatuation - but the dramatic ending was rushed for sure, and maybe a little bit unbelievable... however if you can forgive and forget - you can move on to the 'real' story, which is all about Kirstin Dunst's character.<br/><br/>From there - through episode 5 (where I am right now) - the story line is playing out nicely. Character build-up is great, and the portrayal of lower-middle class Florida in the 90's is well done.<br/><br/>so far so good - worth a watch in my book.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,19 September 2019

Scenes.<br/><br/>Why???<br/><br/>This had so much potential.

It was real, it was authentic, it was exciting... stuff was happening... things were moving... and then all of a sudden towards episode 6 you're lucky if you get a couple things to happen, the rest is just slow dialog, slow acting, slow editing, slow everything.<br/><br/>The one good thing about this? Obviously Kristen. She's perfect for the role. This was basically written for her. She's a joy to watch. And once the old man started acting crazy that's when things got really bad. Like, no please. I'm not sure why writers haven't gotten it by now - we don't want to watch your weird storylines that you wrote when you were high that go absolutely nowhere and nothing happens. Please stop. We want to see stuff happening. That is relevant to the plot and the main storyline. If it's not - then cut it out. We don't want it.<br/><br/>Jeez.... makes you wonder who's writing these things.

1648,The Other Two, A well-crafted skewering of today's pop culture landscape,"I've watched the entire first season and every episode has been loaded with ""sick burns"" at the expense of what passes for popular culture these days. ""The Other Two"" are the virtually washed up, late 20s siblings of the latest internet sensation, the Justine Bieber-ish Chase Dreams. Riding the fringes of their brothers success and celebrity, this show brilliantly illustrates the vacuity and cynical marketing of social media fame. The fact that it's all so recognizable makes me wonder why it hasn't been addressed head-on like this before.<br/><br/>Icing on the cake: people of all ages can enjoy it. The older siblings experience moments of growth and, as the trio's mother, Molly Shannon is a treat as a woman who willingly walks through every door that opens to her. And they do a decent job of wrapping the season up, finally bringing to light how her husband/their father actually died the year before (something they allude to all through the season).",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,10 June 2019

1651,The Other Two, A Clever Satire,"Chase Dubek aka Chase Dreams (Case Walker) is a 13-year-old social media phenom in the early stages of stardom. Mother Pat (Molly Shannon) is complicit in his attempt to achieve success. Chase's older siblings are the other two---Brooke (Helene Yorke), a former child dance student who dabbles poorly in real estate, and Cary (Drew Tarver), a waiter who wants to act. Their love lives are a mess and they long to achieve any goals they once envisioned.<br/><br/>The show is about dreams. Chase seemingly has the world at his feet---the tween world, at least. Brooke and Cary keep reaching for their dreams, but the world keeps dragging them back down. But their ""dreams"" are ill-defined (and mostly defined by others), having to do with social media ""likes"" and facial recognition.<br/><br/>And Chase is just a programmed cute-bot, the product of polls and momentary memes. He lives in a virtual world, with his mother and his manager, Streeter (Ken Marino), acting as interfaces with reality. He has no opinions of his own and shills for whatever is presented to him.<br/><br/>When I first started watching this series, I thought it was unfunny, focusing on shallow characters. But by the second episode, I knew it was an acerbic satire. By episode four, it was apparent that the writers (Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider) are talented and gifted with an eye for insights. In their vision, the key to success is a cryptic code in an absurd Kafkaesque nightmare. And self=esteem is something granted by other vacuous wannabes. The show is a send-up of pop culture, virtue signaling, the cult of celebrity, narcissism, and what might be called Hollywood culture.<br/><br/>I read a review of the series ""A. P. Bio"" in which the critic wondered how it could be executive produced by Lorne Michaels. Lorne Michaels is also EP of this series and has made a bold choice to back SNL writers Kelly and Schneider. Fortunately, the humor of this series exceeds the standards of SNL in recent years.<br/><br/>A brief wrap-up after each episode features the show runners and the actors in informal conversation, providing back stories and personal observations.<br/><br/>The main characters are hapless and mostly clueless, but I enjoy watching them. Though they are totally without haps or clues, they are not so much tragic figures as they are comic foils, and the actors are up to the task. Watch for some fun cameos and bit parts.",7 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,18 March 2019

1670,The Worst Witch, Not! A! Ripoff! and Worth the Watch! *spoiler free*,"The Worst Witch. The book series by Jill Murphy was first published in 1974 and continues through to 2013 at least.<br/><br/>Harry Potter. The book series by JK Rowling was first published by 1997 and continued through to 2007, with more stories rumored on their way.<br/><br/>The Worst Witch. The first film adaptation came out in 1986 starring Fairuza Balk and Tim Curry. A television series then ran from 1998 to 2001.<br/><br/>Harry Potter. The first film adaptation came out in 2001 starring everyone you could ever want and more, and the series culminated in 2011. A prequel film then was released in 2016.<br/><br/>I love Harry Potter, but I'm old enough to have watched the Worst Witch and remembered it. The overlap and obvious repetitions between the two stories kept me from enjoying HP until much later, but today I have a healthy love for both stories, as they really do tell two different stories despite all the similarities.<br/><br/>British boarding schools, especially to American viewers who are by and large unfamiliar with boarding schools as a concept, may mistake normal behaviors for particularities unique to one universe or the other.<br/><br/>Now that we have THAT out of the way, this is a fun version of the misadventures of Mildred, the Worst Witch. Magic takes a backseat to telling a rather mundane, but poignant story about friendship, fitting in, and hard decisions.<br/><br/>It is perhaps a simpler story than Rowling's work, leaving out so much of the backdrop of the past that conveyed the breathing magical world of Harry Potter. The Worst Witch instead skips over the hidden world and takes on perhaps a more mythical sense. The cheaper effects are highly charming, and the children give solid performances.<br/><br/>This is a great series for kids perhaps not quite old enough for the darker Harry Potter world, but ready to embrace a magical school.",50 out of 51 found this helpful.,6.0,23 July 2017
1671,The Worst Witch, JK Rowling was 9 when this book came out,"As has been said in other intelligent reviews, The Worst Witch book series significantly pre-dates Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Since JK Rowling was 9 years old when the first Worst Witch book was written, we might well assume there was some early influencing going on. The similarities exist, as those who don't know about the books and think THIS is the rip-off like to point out. However, any similarities would work the other way around. Did she intentionally plagiarize? Probably not. How many of us remember everything we read as children? <br/><br/>This series is a remake of a series that came from a movie that came out in the 1980s (from the book written in 1974). There has already also been a reboot: The NEW Worst Witch. <br/><br/>As with all the others, this is a relatively low budget production, but seems quite cute and would likely be very enjoyable to children, and to those who would like to know the original inspiration for the world of Harry Potter.",34 out of 37 found this helpful.,6.0,26 July 2017
1672,The Worst Witch, Hilarious and heartwarming -- Give it a try!,"I know this show is really new, and that is likely why the rating is so low, but I think it is also probably because people think its copying Harry Potter, when it is in fact based on an older book series/ TV show/ movie. I have never been exposed to Worst Witch before this, and it is a great show! The child actors are fantastic, especially the one who plays the lead (Mildred) and the show does an excellent job of keeping the magic aspect fun and exciting while also using it to show normal growing up struggles-- something many shows try to do but which Worst Witch does really naturally. I recommend that if you like Harry Potter, as I do, you give it a shot, and enjoy the similarities instead of judging. Also, recommended for both males and females.

1680,The Worst Witch, Expanded and updated take on the books.,"I was a large fan of the 90's series 'Worst Witch', which made me feel that this 'reboot' would be unnecessary and unable to match the first series. I expressed my dismay even from the promotion pictures, noting that the lead actress lacked Georgina Sherrington's natural charm and that even the cat looked wrong!<br/><br/>But, upon watching it - the acting is really well done, and they've expanded the world-building quite a bit. There have been law-suits filed because 'Harry Potter' seemed to take a lot from 'Worst Witch' (the Worst Witch books started in 1979 and feature a wicked potions master and a kindly old headmaster who disagree over a young student's magical aptitude). This series seems to take a lot 'back' from the Harry Potter movies though - The actress who plays Ms. Hardbroom at times seems to channel Alan Rickman's nuanced performance of Prof. Snape; and the Headmistress has the dark reflective moments we've seen from Dumbledore on occasion. Whereas in the original series (and the books) the world of Magic seemed not to be a secret, here the school is shrouded from non-magical eyes. Whereas in the original Mildred seems to come from a magical family - here she is the only magical person in her family (similar to Hermione's back-story). So in a sense they've amalgamated a more coherent world.<br/><br/>This is a well put together program; the sets are very nice. The actors are well competent. The stories from the books work themselves into the episodes naturally and in bits; readers of the books will see poignant moments like Ethel getting turned into a pig.<br/><br/>I still love the 90's show, but I have to admit that this is a better production. There is no stilted comedic acting, and the characters seem to have an inner dimension that is visited often. The writing is done cleverly and the pacing comes off well. Perhaps the special effects are not spectacular; but this is a show about relationships and characters - and both of those aspects are well done.<br/><br/>In closing - it's not a 'dumb' kids show. It can be taken seriously on its own merit and I highly recommend that parents and kids enjoy it. The main character is a good example to children because she DOES make mistakes and poor decisions and have insecurity just like real kids do.",13 out of 15 found this helpful.,7.0,5 July 2017

1685,The Worst Witch, Season 4 - Embrace the change,"Season 4 kicks off with a new look for Mildred Hubble, and at first that takes some adjusting to. Unlike some, who decided to judge a whole series after watching less than one episode, I've watched all of season 4 and I see the season as a whole as a real return to form after season 3 (which was good, but not the best). I really warmed to Lydia Page playing the new Mildred. Bella Ramsey is going to be missed, but after she left the show for mental health reasons (and I wish her all the best in addressing those) a replacement was needed and I'm more than happy with the choice they made. Lydia has captured the essence of Mildred whilst bringing her own character to the part, and she delivers some great comedy moments, as well as drama and pathos where needed. It didn't take long before I forgot about the change and she simply was Mildred. As Hardbroom says, 'New look, same old Mildred Hubble'.<br/><br/>Nitin Ganatra is a great addition to the cast as Mr Daisy, and his interactions with Miss Tapioca and her daughter Mable (both of whom I love) showcase some great comic talent. New girls Izzy, Azura and Fenella strengthen the cast further, and the regulars are on as good a form as ever. Over the season there are some great individual episodes. Episode 3 is bound to bring a tear to the eye of any fan of the show, and episode 10 is a clever and satisfying time-twister. The contest for head girl provides a strong narrative thread throughout the season, and other plotlines are integrated well into the overall storyline. The season climax is thrilling and brilliantly done, with the last four episodes being the strongest of the lot, IMHO.

The Worst Witch 2017 has undoubtedly gone above and beyond all aspirations. Considering the show is aimed at children, the first series has proved to be extremely entertaining and a fantastic adaptation. <br/><br/>Some plot lines clearly reflect the audience age, but this doesn't stop the characters from having a great deal of depth and complexity. The teachers definitely make the show, Clare Higgins portrays both Ada and Agatha Cackle brilliantly, but it's Raquel Cassidy's Miss Hardbroom that brings a mesmerising new image of the formidable potions teacher and deputy-head. The new Hecate Hardbroom (Not Constance) tops even the legendary Kate Duchêne, and we can't get enough of her!",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,16 November 2017
1687,The Worst Witch, 10 Stars on all counts!,"This program combines seasoned professional character actors with child actors who portray children. The mix of the two is done very well in that each episode Just let me say I've become a tremendous fan of Raquel Cassidy as Miss Hardbroom with her over the top badness. Bella Ramsey was Lyanna Mormont in GOT so she is also a very talented, very young actress. 
The children in the program remain children, thank God. The writing is not so cliched that I can recite dialogue along with the characters as happens pretty often in mediocre fare.
Books were published well before Harry Potter and I suspect JK Rowling read them in her youth since some ideas could have been poached, even on the subconscious level.

1694,The Worst Witch, MORE major character CHANGES?!,"I'm out! I watched the first three seasons and although I was mad about them replacing Meibh Campbell who played Maud (who was excellent what happened to her??!!) with Megan Hughes who is a total dud I sucked it up and dealt with it. Season 3 they added Indigo Moon (eww) but I still hung in there because of Bella Ramsey. Tonight I sit down all excited to watch season 4 and they got rid of Bella (she said it was her decision to leave for mental health reasons), Philip Martin Brown (Mr. Rowan Webb) who was annoying BUT he's been with the show from the beginning AND Wendy Craig (Miss Bat) who was also not great but there since the beginning. They replaced Bella with some no name who is not only hard to look at but she cannot act and in fact I could only stomach 10 minutes of her in this dreck before I made the decision to pass on this. I mean changes can happen BUT this many and it just kills the vibe. How is it that some shows can go for 10-15 years with the same cast yet this one can't go two seasons without changing actors.

It's obviously queer but people that expect more gay scenes to be involved say its queer-baiting. The story is slow, which I get, can be seen as boring but at least to me it took me around 3 episodes to actually like Beth and if anything bad had had happened before I wouldn't have felt sad for her at all. On top of that, the characters. I've never seen that we'll thought of characters! They all have amazingly annoying flaws like that Beth is super insensitive and Addy is blind concerning everything that happens with Coach (I know that's part of manipulation though). But I'm completely biased with all of them!!! Right now I actually feel like I'll won't be able to watch normal shows anymore cause the characters are almost always so blank....

I suppose I also related to Sam but I don't want to give any spoilers away. This show doesn't hide behind the facade most shows featuring teenager girls do, but instead shows you a gritty truth behind codependency, infatuation, lies, regrets and a true competitive nature. As someone who played sports and has had many girlfriends, this can't be more true. I have never met anyone more competitive than a woman and this show exposes all of the insecurities that come with such a inherent nature.",34 out of 44 found this helpful.,8.0,24 February 2020

However, this show hardly keeps me longing for the next episode. It's a show that is good enough to watch when there is nothing else on, but is by no means a ""must see"". It's interestingly boring if that makes any sense. The characters are all unlikable, and not in a good way that makes them captivating or sympathetic villains. They are stereotypical mean girls that aren't interesting enough to love or love to hate. The adults aren't any better than the kids as there is not a single role model for the cheerleaders because the adults are all flawed. It tries to sound ""deeper"" than it really is by having the narrator use phrases like ""it was beautiful until it went to far"" or ""nothing is as scary as a bored teenage girl"", but it comes across a little like its trying too hard to be a groundbreaking teenage drama like 13 Reasons Why or Euphoria.

1703,Dare Me, Not sure why it's getting some bad reviews,"I kinda expected to see some negative reviews on IMDb as it's basically a forum for whiners to complain these days. And since the cast is mostly female I definitely expected some people to see it as pushing a ""feminist agenda"". But when reading the negative reviews it seemed these people actually did give the show a chance but it just wasn't for them. Which is fair enough but when saying watching the show was a waste of time, why waste more time writing a review on it?? I never bother writing reviews for something I didn't enjoy. In fact I only ever write reviews for things that not only I enjoyed but I feel are getting a lot of hate for no reason. Like I said, this has become a place for people who simply like to complain. Probably more than watching tv or movies. I mean one user didn't like the show because it was about a cheerleading squad. Erm you could see that from the trailer which is something you should always watch first. So they can't really blame the show for their own stupidity.<br/><br/>The show, in my opinion is good. If, like me, you enjoy mystery dramas, I would say give it a go. If it's not for you, move on to something else. If I want a critical opinion about a show. I'll read something by an actual critic who gets paid to point out flaws. Not some random with a superiority complex who states their own opinions like they're facts.

I truly think the actresses emulate the characters in the book so well. This isnt a series about glitz and glam Cheerleaders like Bring It On, it's a dark and mysterious story set in the world of highschool Cheerleaders. The main story is behind the characters and the flaws and secrets they hold, putting on masks trying to not let anyone see behind then. The actress who plays Beth is amazing she does such a good job and reminds me alot of Effy from Skins. I agree that this series isnt for everyone as it's pretty dark and surfaces alot of underlying issues with young teens in their years of highschool but also the stress, pressure and heirarchy of the cheerleading world. Broken families, people feeling lost, losing themselves and trying so hard to turn it around and build themselves back up again or tear themselves apart by the obsessions they nurture. It may be a slow burn but if your paying attention there are clues in every sceen, alot of looks that mean so much and cracks showing beneath the surface.

1718,Dare Me, dare me,"I actually really enjoyed this series. when i first saw what this was about i was sure it would just be a bunch of cheerleaders getting into trouble but it went further than that. it had episodes where you had the perspective of every main character and episodes where you really got to see into the characters lives. one thing i do wish is that every character got more of a roll to shine. i understand this is based on a novel but some of the characters only had a couple lines and the main three pretty much had the rest of the series which did get a bit boring at times as you did get over those characters. some of the minor roll characters like Cori, brianna and tess were really pushed aside and for three actors which such great potential it did make me enjoy it less. i think RiRi and Tacy had the perfect amount of lines and scenes that really kept you interested and wanting more but when it came to Coach, Beth and Addy they would pop up in another scene and another and another, and i understand that is the role of the main characters but they honestly weren't exciting enough and i feel like when you have characters like that you really need to utilize the background actors to keep the viewer interested. it certainly inst a show i could watch more than 3 times but i found the second time i watched the series i noticed a lot more details i had missed out the first time round. i definitely recommend this show and am really hoping that Netflix picks it up for a season 2 because it was truly amazing.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,12 May 2020

1720,The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Popular 007 Spin-Off Created a Sensation...,"'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' was an bona fide television phenomena when it first aired, in 1964. The brainchild of producer Norman Felton, who was a fan of Ian Fleming's 'James Bond' novels, the missions of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement (U.N.C.L.E.), would be set on an international scale, pitted against SPECTRE-like THRUSH, an organization composed of terrorists, anarchists, and megalomaniacs. In the original concept, a 'civilian' would be drawn into the intrigue, each week, to aid U.N.C.L.E. on a mission, and provide a link that viewers could relate to.<br/><br/>Felton sent his notes to Ian Fleming, asking the author to create a name for the series' hero, and Fleming came up with 'Napoleon Solo', the last name 'lifted' from a gangster character from 'Goldfinger'. He offered a few other minor suggestions, and gave Felton his blessing on the endeavor. With a 'pedigree' like this, how could the series fail?<br/><br/>Veteran writer Sam Rolfe came on board to write the pilot script and co-produce, and an excellent cast was assembled. Oscar-nominee Robert Vaughn, who'd worked with Felton on the series, 'The Lieutenant', was cast as Solo; young Scot actor David McCallum, fresh from THE GREAT ESCAPE, would play the supporting role of fellow agent Illya Kuryakin; and, in a casting coup, legendary character actor Leo G. Carroll, who'd portrayed a spy chief in Alfred Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST, would assume the same function for U.N.C.L.E. (Getting Carroll required some creativity; while his 'official' birth date was listed as 1892, he was actually born in 1887, and NBC would never have permitted a nearly 80-year old series regular...Felton stuck with '1892', and made his scenes as easy as possible, which worked, as Carroll survived the entire series' run, not passing away until 1972).<br/><br/>Shot in black and white for the first season, and featuring a marvelous 'bulletproof glass' opening sequence, with a majestic, John Barry-influenced theme (by Jerry Goldsmith), 'U.N.C.L.E.' debuted in 1964 as both FROM Russia WITH LOVE and GOLDFINGER were in theaters, and soon became a major hit...then reached unprecedented heights, when McCallum, with his 'Beatles'-like haircut, captured the attention of younger fans caught up with the 'British Invasion' of Rock music, and became an overnight sex symbol nationwide. McCallum's role was quickly 'beefed-up' to co-star status, and U.N.C.L.E.-mania had begun!<br/><br/>With a terrific mix of action, tongue-in-cheek humor, and what NBC would allow for sex, the first season offered many memorable moments, including the first appearance of future 'Star Trek' stars William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, together, in an episode (Shatner was the heroic 'civilian' called in to aid U.N.C.L.E., Nimoy was the villain's henchman).<br/><br/>NBC was very pleased with their hit series, and Vaughn and McCallum were soon doing 'cameos' in other series, as well as promotions for the Peacock Network. One of the first 'primetime' series to be extensively marketed, a line of U.N.C.L.E. merchandise appeared, with dolls, toy guns, lunch boxes, comic books, model kits, cologne, clothing, and more filling store shelves. It was a heady time for everyone!<br/><br/>For the second season (1965-66), 'U.N.C.L.E.' was produced in color, and a 'guest' list of legendary stars lined up for appearances on the series, but despite respectable ratings, the overall quality of the show fluctuated, with some episodes downright silly. Just as the 'Bond' films peaked in popularity in 1965, with THUNDERBALL, then began to decline as the 'craze' subsided, the novelty of 'U.N.C.L.E.' began to wear off, and new 'line' producers were more interested in comedy and campiness, discarding, by season's end, any 'edge' the series first had. By the third season (1966-67), 'camp' was the rule; a spin-off, 'The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.', flopped; and the writing was on the wall that the series was on it's way out.<br/><br/>The producers made a last-ditch attempt to return the more dramatic elements to the series at the start of it's fourth season, in 1967, discarding the campiness, and, unfortunately, nearly all of the humor, as well, but the newly 'serious' 'U.N.C.L.E.' had lost it's audience, and the show was canceled in early 1968.<br/><br/>The impact of 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.' cannot be minimized. It paved the way for 'The Wild, Wild, West', 'Get Smart', 'Mission Impossible', and all the other 'spy' shows that followed in it's footsteps, became a 'cult' favorite after cancellation that is still generating interest, to this day (with successful conventions, a 'reunion' TV-movie, and a steady stream of fan mail continuing to be sent to Vaughn and McCallum, 35 years after the final episode first aired), and there is talk of a feature film in the works.<br/><br/>And, as we fans will always remember, without the cooperation of the United Network Command for Law and Enforcement, none of this would be possible!",82 out of 83 found this helpful.,,11 December 2003

It blended tongue in cheek humour with action and adventure for an end result that was extremely entertaining. Unfortunately, all good things cannot last. The first season (when it was still shot in black and white) and the second season (the first one shot in colour) place The Man From U.N.C.L.E. among the best television has to offer. All of this changed with the third season, when the series became so silly that watching its episodes became nearly unbearable. The show recovered somewhat in its abbreviated fourth season (it would be cancelled midway through), but by that time The Man From U.N.C.L.E. had lost its charm.

Each week Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin saved the world or part of it from the evils of Thrush, an organization bent on world domination.It started as a cult show but quickly became a hit and at times the #1 show in the ratings to losing it's focus by the third season when it decided to copy the campy tone of the ""Batman"" TV show which turned off viewers who had liked the more serious tone of the first two seasons. As someone growing up in the sixties the Christmas of 1965 was flooded with secret agent toys with ""The Man From UNCLE"" even rivaling James Bond as far as toys and other product tie-ins.

And Robert Vaughn and David McCallum did a terrific job in their roles, skirting just on the edge of silliness, but still with a certain gleam in their eye that let you know the whole business was just too outlandish to possibly be real. Secret headquarters, outlandish villains, super spy gadgets, MFU had it all. And it was all great fun! <br/><br/>Leo G. Carroll played the unflappable Mr. Waverly, who always seemed to be one step ahead of his agents. Season 1 was undoubtedly the best, although 2 had its moments. Season 3 was not entirely a disaster, but the producers tried too hard to make it all silly comedy, a la Batman, which was a campy hit, and lost the flavor of the show, although there are some outstanding moments, as when Solo is busy kissing the girl in the warm comfort of a car, while Kuryakin is fighting the bad guys in the pouring rain. As he stands there, drenched, Illya looks at his warm, dry partner and remarks, ""we make such good partners."" But by the time season 4 rolled around, the damage had been done, although they tried going back to the original concept. All the actors had lost interest and it was canceled. <br/><br/>It's still fun to watch and nice to know both actors are still busy performing, Vaughn in the British series, Hustle, and McCallum in the CBS hit NCIS. I still miss the fun of the Man From UNCLE. No-one ever did a spoof better, and we'll never see anything quite this good again.

The Man From U.N.C.L.E was one of the best spy shows ever to come out of a period which the cold war,civil rights,and the height of the Vietnam War was a great escape for young minds back then. Since the show was a huge hit on the NBC network when it premiered on September 22,1964,it was something that no one thought of at that time: a character who was in the same ranks as James Bond 007 himself!

Robert Vaughn was a true gentlemen and a suave secret agent who was in the same category as Sean Connery,but he made the role very interesting as Napoleon Solo,and his Russian counterpart Illya,played by David McCallum,the coolest ever with a 60's shag blonde look(who looked like a rock star instead of an secret agent)!! The show's first two seasons were very dramatic and their was a great chemistry between the actors themselves which kept the action intense and very hipped!!! The sad part is that when the show's color episodes came it wasn't dramatic or very appealing anymore,but incredibly silly by the end of series' final run in 1968 (the 29 black and white episodes from 1964-1965 were the best ever and some of the best gadgets too). Jerry Goldsmith's theme score for the series was the best ever for a TV series,and still is to this day. U.N.C.L.E was so,so good it spawned two feature films,and dozens of toys,comic books,mystery novels,and posters,and can you believe that David McCallum have a hit record out based on the show back in 1965(which he teamed up with Nancy Sinatra on a hit song,which hit the top of the charts too-very rare to find that album nowadays),plus a very short-lived Saturday Morning cartoon show? The repeats are rarely seen on TV nowadays,but they can be seen on TNT every once in a while if possible. A total of 105 episodes were produced with 29 episodes of Season 1 were in black and white. 76 episodes of Seasons 2 thru 4 were in color until the series finale on January 15,1968.",34 out of 40 found this helpful.,9.0,14 June 2000
1725,The Man from U.N.C.L.E., One of the 5 greatest series ever.,"Hollywood has missed a bet by not capitalizing on the fact that Robert Vaughn and David McCallum are still alive. There should be another series or a movie with these two, but it would require some good writing to get a show worth watching. DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE ON THE AVENGERS MOVIE. I've always maintained that if you wanted to watch a show about the past, you could watch Wild, Wild, West; if you wanted to watch a show about the present, you could watch Man From Uncle; if you wanted to watch a show about the future, you could watch Star Trek; if you wanted a foreign flavored show you could watch The Avengers; and if you wanted to watch a comedy, you could watch Get Smart. MFU started in 1964, WWW and Get Smart in 1965 and Star Trek in 1966. The Avengers with Emma Peel hit here around 1967. You can get by in life just watching these shows. My feeling is that the Sixties started in February 1964 with the Beatles on Ed Sullivan and ended with the Manson murders in August 1969. Those were 5 magical, wonderful years that I wish could be recaptured and relived somehow. Anyway, what made MFU such a hit? There were numerous teen-age baby-boomers who thought the exciting life shown on the show was how life was going to be. Women, travel, women, cool suits, women, weapons, excitement, women, etc,. Did I mention women? Sure beat the work-a-day world our Dads had to live in the 1960s. We were in for a big surprise when we grew up.

1726,The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Fun and enthralling spy series features a charismatic duo,"Like other baby boomers, I grew up with this weekly spy series. It was very popular with all my classmates, and the talk the next morning at school after its TV showing would invariably be the latest exploits of the daring young Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin. The boys all wanted to be just like them, and the girls were all besotted with them. We were all hooked on their ridiculous intelligence seeking or defensive gadgetry devices. After the spin off series The Girl From U.N.C.L.E. premiered, then all the girls wanted to be just like HER.<br/><br/>The show chronicles the assorted adventures and derring do of two agents of the agency U.N.C.L.E. (the United Network Command for Law Enforcement)... the American Napoleon Solo and the Russian Illya Kuryakin. (For a change, the Cold War enemies were comrades here.) Together the pair use their charm, wits, and of course assorted spy gadgetry to defeat the forces of evil, notably the terrorists and other threatening international villains of the wicked agency T.H.R.U.S.H. The duo take their orders from the older Mr. Alexander Waverly. <br/><br/>The two lead actors had the looks and the charisma to carry off the show, with great chemistry between them. Robert Vaughan plays the suave, dashing dark haired Solo, and David McCallum his cool, blond, British accented sidekick, Kuryakin. The role of Mr. Waverly is portrayed by the gentlemanly Leo G. Carroll.<br/><br/>It's been quite a few decades, have not seen it in re runs, so have forgotten many of the details. However, it was an adventurous, suspenseful, and primarily fun show, shades of James Bond's 007. Lots of fights, close calls, torturing villains, assorted intrigue, and of course beautiful women! Around this era there was also a cute comedy spy series, Get Smart. To this very day, whenever The Man From U.N.C.L.E. comes to mind or I chance upon either of its two stars on TV, I'm filled with a great sense of nostalgia.

1727,The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," The united network, you know the rest!","Watching a ""Christmas Carol"" and seeing Leo G. Carroll, more or less made me remember the ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."". Napoleon Solo, in my humble opinion, was the only other spy who could seriously rival Sean Connery. Vaugn was not only kool and suave, but handsome and cunning, much like James Bond except that Napoleon Solo had a quite different style. Illya Kuryakin, aka David Mcallum, was excellent as the right hand man for solo and was the first time I had seen an intelligent Russian portrayed on the screen. Although I had previously seen Mcallum in ""The Great Escape"". Finally, Leo G. Carroll gave a commanding performance as Mr. Waverly, a man who had complete control over his agents yet had a fatherly kind of feel.

The show was very cool, and so were Napoleon and Illya. Heck, that is why there is still a huge following forty years later.<br/><br/>Yes, the shows look as if they were filmed on back lot. They were. The pace and budget did not allow for on location scenes. Look at old Star Trek and you will see the same limitations.<br/><br/>Many shows were intended to be funny or at least tongue in cheek. The episode with Joan Collins is a riot. The agents are trying to get a low class woman to pass off as a lady. This episode, The Galatea Affair, is a take on My Fair Lady and introduces Noel Harrison as Mark Slate. OF course you will remember that his father had the task of transforming Liza Doolitle in MFL.<br/><br/>Try the very early pairing of Shatner and Nimoy in Project Strigas or The Ultimate Computer Affair, another great MFU episode.

1729,The Man from U.N.C.L.E.," Fun in the 60s, Does Not Hold Up Well...","Actually, after reading all the glowing reviews here, I was reluctant to weigh in, because, speaking generally, other users don't like it when you knock their favourite shows off the pedestals they put them on. But this is a database, and it is intended for different perspectives. So here we go. For the time, this was ground-breaking and fascinating. Much like MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, its contemporary, also unique. If you were a kid in the 60s (guilty) you could not get enough of these shows. In fact, even today (2013) I have friend who will phone me and the first words out of his mouth are ""Open Channel D."" But the real test of these shows I think is whether they stand the test of time? UNCLE was part of the spy culture of the era and trust me, there were spies everywhere. I mean in the bookstore, in the drugstore, on TV and in the movies. (No computers then, no streaming media). With hindsight, however, we now know (from numerous biographies) that Fleming was just a frustrated frat boy at heart, sitting on the beach, typing with one finger, and banging out fantasies with characters like Pussy Galore. If you were a serious writer, like John LeCarre, or even semi-serious like Donald Hamilton (Matt Helm) you had trouble finding a filmic audience in the 60s because the viewer demand was for stylized action and superficial situations. (Matt Helm movies, so-called, reviewed elsewhere on IMDb, with a lot of subsequent angry feedback from groovy 60s kids in serious denial). This series was clever. At first glance Vaughn seemed an excellent counterpoint to David McCallum, the latter being the very definition of ""foreign hunk"" for the period, and guaranteed a high female turnout from week to week. And part of the ""gimmick,"" according to TV GUIDE of the era, was that there was to be at least one ""innocent civilian"" involved in each episode, to try to ground the series and avoid the mad Bond-esqe fantasies. Still, in the opinion of this reviewer, the series quickly fell into the same traps experienced by shows like WILD WILD WEST and BATMAN. Similar plots. Similar villains. Predictable plot arcs, including the obligatory ""Rescue/Resolution"" with only 7 minutes left on the clock per episode. No one's fault. Not blaming anyone. But viewers in the 60s wanted their action shows like they wanted their coffee -- sweet, double sugar. If someone had tried to do a Bourne film with Matt Damon (in theory) back then, they would have been arrested for excessive violence. And notice that this show was really the only point in Vaughan's career where he tried to be likable. He ultimately ended up playing bad guys, and McCallum ended up hosting multiple reality shows. The truth is that you wanted serious spy action in this period, there were lots of books, but your TV/film choices were limited. I have on IMDb done a very positive review of the Danger Man (Secret Agent) series out of Britain, followed by the Callan series, also from the UK. If the question on the floor is, which product holds up best over the decades?, and could be enjoyed even today, I give to nod to the latter titles. THE MAN FROM UNCLE is, I think, very dated and very specific to the period.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,6.0,10 December 2013
1730,The Man from U.N.C.L.E., When Napoleon Was Dynamite!,"""Open Channel D!"".<br/><br/>I never saw 'U.N.C.L.E.' during its '60's heyday, I regret to say. I came to it in 1972, when I.T.V. broadcast the movies ( beginning with 'The Karate Killers' ) at peak-time on Saturday evenings, followed by reruns of 'The Persuaders!'.<br/><br/>My first glimpse of 'Napoleon Solo' and 'Illya Kuryakin' was of them in a silver sports car being chased by a squad of mini-helicopters, equipped with rocket launchers. I was hooked. For the next seven weeks, I was in secret agent heaven. These were the days before I.T.V. bought the 'James Bond' films, so 'U.N.C.L.E.' was the next best thing.<br/><br/>Then I found some paperbacks in a second-hand book store, and from these learned that 'U.N.C.L.E.' stood for 'United Network Command for Law and Enforcement', and was an international spy organisation whose main headquarters were in New York, cunningly concealed behind the facade of a dry cleaners. Its main adversary was 'T.H.R.U.S.H.' - the Technological Hierachy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humanity ( actually, that acronym was invented by the writer David McDaniel in his superb novel 'The Dagger Affair'. It was never used on the show ). 'T.H.R.U.S.H.' wanted to take over the world, and 'U.N.C.L.E.' were out to stop them.<br/><br/>What really made the show a big hit was the chemistry between Robert Vaughn and David McCallum. Vaughn's 'Solo' was the extrovert, McCallum's 'Illya' was the shy intellectual. Leo G.Carroll played their gruff boss 'Alexander Waverly'.<br/><br/>Each week, 'T.H.R.U.S.H.' embarked on a new world domination project, usually with the aid of some fantastic invention - earthquake machines, tidal wave machines, invisible killer bees, mind control devices, death rays, even exploding apples! The stars were cool, the girls were hot, the action fast, the whole thing was executed in a colourful, tongue in cheek manner that was simply delightful to watch.<br/><br/>The show ended in 1968. The spy craze had run its course. Whereas 'Mission: Impossible' was able to reinvent itself as a crime show, 'U.N.C.L.E.' simply could not follow suit. One could not imagine Napoleon and Illya hot on the trail of 'The Syndicate'. Its equally impossible to imagine it being set in any era other than the '60's. The concept of an American agent working alongside a Russian was a novelty at the time. Guy Ritchie's remake tried sticking to it but was an unmitigated disaster all the same.<br/><br/>""Close Channel D!"".",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,3 March 2007

She just looks so darn beautiful and gorgeous , especially when after she takes off her glasses, with her lovely voice to match. Also, I could really see the bonding (this being a spy series, no pun intended) between Napolean and Mandy in the scene in which they are both captured.<br/><br/>All and all, this show is great, and in my opinion redefined the spy genre.<br/><br/>R.I.P.

1733,The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Crazy Sixties Spy Series,"I believe The Man From U.N.C.L.E. was made to cash in on the success of the James Bond success. It was certainly an interesting and camp show even if the actors and actresses looked like they were close to laughing at the show's ridiculousness at times.<br/><br/>Robert Vaughan played Napoleon Solo (must have been bullied at school with a name like that) whilst British actor David McCallum played the Russian Ilya Kuryakin (what's this-a Russian and an American teaming up during the height of the cold war and a couple of years after the Cuban Missile Crisis?). Solo and Kuryakin worked for U.N.C.L.E. (United Network Command for Law Enforcement). U.N.C.L.E. was based in a secret HQ behind a dry-cleaners shop and Solo and Kuryakin received their orders from Mr Alexander Waverly played by the late Leo G. Carroll.<br/><br/>If you thought James Bond was tongue in cheek, then this was even more tongue in cheek. Each week, Solo and Kuryakin armed with their array of gadgets battled the villains of T.H.R.U.S.H. who were more camp than any Bond villain you could come across. There were guest stars galore throughout the show and some of the craziest plots you could ever watch. The villains seemed to delight in torturing Solo and Kuryakin rather than just putting a bullet in their heads.<br/><br/>Gadgets, fight scenes, total camp-that was The Man From U.N.C.L.E. and it was an awesome show.<br/><br/>One more thing-T.H.R.U.S.H. stood for Technical Hierarchy for the Removal of Undesirables and the Subjugation of Humans.

1734,The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Seminal Sixties Series,"The mid-1960's saw a proliferation of fantasy-oriented series, starting out in the domain of comedy, with 'Bewitched' and 'Dream of Jeanie.' 'Man From UNCLE' (MFU) is historic because it was the 1st major big budget dramatic fantasy series to capture an adult audience (Irwin Allen's big budget 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea' also premiered in 1964, but it never gained an adult audience).<br/><br/>Besides being on the leading edge of the fantasy trend, MFU was one of the 1st TV series to utilize a truly cinematic approach to the photography of the scenes, which makes the series more interesting and exciting. MFU also featured some elaborate fight sequences, stunts, and car chase scenes...MFU resembles movies more than any TV series prior to it.<br/><br/>MFU also featured TV's first Beatle-haircut character, Ilya Kuryakin, who was quite popular with admirers of male beauty...it helped that David McCallum and co-star Robt. Vaughn were both very fine actors with high personal appeal and good screen chemistry...they set the bar for many other 1960's heroic TV duos, such as Kirk and Spock, West and Gordon, etc.<br/><br/>MFU was a ratings success and was appreciated by critics as well because of the dry banter and quasi-satirical touches (such as early episodes featuring an intro that broke the 4th wall). The success of MFU was a factor in the 1965-68 explosion of dramatic or quasi-dramatic fantasy TV shows: Mission Impossible, Wild Wild West, Time Tunnel, Lost in Space, the Invaders, Land of the Giants, etc. <br/><br/>Two hugely influential series, Star Trek, and Batman, both premiering in 1966, were also part of this trend. Star Trek, to a large extent, was basically MFU in outer space...especially Season Two. And Batman was an simply an exaggeration of the the spoof element of MFU.<br/><br/>Today, most popular cinematic and TV scifi owes something to Star Trek, and the whole superhero movie explosion that began in 2000 owes a debt to the 1966 Batman.<br/><br/>Another way MFU broke ground was in outright sexiness...compared to dramatic series before it, MFU had quite a lot of sexy stuff going on. But despite the sexual liberties, MFU never got political, except in the most oblique sense...perhaps mild satire of nations and politics in general, yet never getting anywhere near jabs at actual identifiable persons or institutions. <br/><br/>MFU's first season was the best...the producers were still experimenting with the format, the humor and satire were used with restraint, and the crisp B/W photography helped mute the cartoonish elements of the series and gave it a certain resemblance to film noir.<br/><br/>Subsequent seasons are generally enjoyable, but humor, satire, and camp increased in Season 2 and took over in Season 3. In Season 4, a new producer stepped in and the humor was greatly reduced and the camp eliminated...Season 4 is nearly as good as Season 1.<br/><br/>It was too late and MFU cancelled in early 1968. But, between 1968 and 1970, everything else from the mid-1960's fantasy explosion was also cancelled...my pet theory is that the sudden and irreversible evaporation of ratings for 'Batman' in '67-68 spooked everyone, causing them to flee the realm of fantasy as though it were a sinking ship...and no doubt, new trends were waiting to be mined.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,26 September 2011

In my view most boxed sets are very badly designed and totally unacceptable. Without exception when I come across them I always put the disc's into spare storage cases and throw the unacceptable packaging away. However in this instance the spare triple and quad storage cases I had put to one side in advance of delivery of this set, in order to cater for no less than 7 discs, were not actually required.<br/><br/>The reason being that this box set is supplied in a proper DVD storage case (or box if you prefer), very much like the 6 disc DVD storage cases, despite this one being slightly narrower. Yet it caters for the 7 discs containing all 29 episodes of season one. There are 5 episodes on disc 2 and 4 episodes on all of the others, which of course gives us the complete first season.<br/><br/>Season one was, for the most part in B&amp;W, however two episodes were filmed in colour as there were plans to turn them into feature films. They were the pilot episode ""The Vulcan Affair"", along with ""The Double Affair"". Both were actually broadcast on TV in B&amp;W anyway. All subsequent seasons were in colour.<br/><br/>I sat through ""The Vulcan Affair"", this afternoon switching from 4:3 to full 16:9 modes. Eventually going back to 4:3. The entire collection has been digitally remastered, but the picture quality does show it's age a little. Still one has to make allowances for the time when the filming took place. Season one being transmitted in the USA, at least, in 1964/65.

1742,The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Different from Bond,"There was an original style in this TV series that made it fun and different from James Bond. Bond is a super spy who works intently for England and for the world. Solo and Illya were ""salaryman"" spies which manages espionage as a job. Most of the stories, whether good or bad, had this atmosphere. One I remember is The Deadly Toys Affair. In the scene in the beginning, Solo and Illya are told by their boss, Waverly, that they are expendable, and they are sent out to destroy a Thrush factory. In the midst of a shootout with the Thrushmen, they receive next instructions from Waverly thru their pen communicator without forgiveness, saying that they are not expendable anymore. I guess many people working in an organization had an experience of receiving a forcing message from their boss in the midst of an important meeting or work. This had turned into an everyday situation now due to the cellular phone, and it seems that the present was predicted 40 years ago. The sympathy of those who work in an organization is obtained, which makes this series fun and interesting. It was also because of the three wonderful actors that was able to have this peculiar wonderful atmosphere of this show. If an UNCLE movie or another series is to be made in the future, this atmosphere must not change. The actors must be good and must understand the original UNCLE concept, they must not be too tall, they must be handsome and smart looking, and neat, and clean. I mean, no beard or mustache, no hairy actors. Everybody involved in such plan should understand the original atmosphere of UNCLE, or will fail like most of the remakes. Also, it must not be forgotten that the music by the greats (J. Goldsmith, L. Schifrin, R. Drasnin, G. Fried, W. Scharf, R. Shores, M. Stevens, N.

So I went back to it &amp; got pleasantly surprised. Some episodes were as good as full length movies. I particularly liked Jonathon young's character, Nikola Tesla:) Amanda played an extremely believable lady from England &amp; I thought her accent was just great. It was a complete transformation from Samantha Carter of SG1. This character was a more domineering in control person who knew what she wanted and how to get it. The settings &amp; special effects were pretty darn good I thought. It seemed a fair amount of thought and time went into these areas. Like all TV shows there is going to be an episode or three that doesn't appeal or seems to loose focus to the individual. However, overall I felt good about watching the show.",27 out of 31 found this helpful.,6.0,1 March 2012
1745,Sanctuary, Not Bad - Gothic X-Files meets Buffy?,"Interesting way to release this new series - webisodes every couple of weeks that are about 15 minutes long. Put them all together and you potentially have a pilot of just over two hours.<br/><br/>For Amanda Tapping, this is a good move - she's not Sam Carter anymore, playing the enigmatic and potentially very sexy Helen Magnus, aided by her slightly stereotypical teen-angst-ed daughter Ashley, some gentle-monster beast and a newly inducted fish out of water type, Will.<br/><br/>The concept is nice, 'Sanctuary for all' - being 'all' are non-humans, (but it does come across that they're all sort of imprisoned anyway). There's a sort of 'Gothic Buffy' feel about the scenario and the circumstances, but minus the classic Whedon Buffy humour.<br/><br/>The production values aren't superior and it's obviously CGI, there are some sub-par blue/green screens going on in places...but you can forgive this for a decent enough premise and storyline. Knowing that this hasn't been funded by a studio and Tapping herself is an executive producer, one should actually give the production some credit.<br/><br/>Tapping is fairly good in this role - we see her move out of the clever and cute Samantha Carter and flex her acting muscles somewhat in the portrayal of an 18th century English woman. Her accent isn't flawless, but you can forgive this - I'm sure it would be explained away that Magnus has been living in the USA for some time. There is no explanation as to why she's in the USA - or if she even is in the USA - the location is not revealed, but one assumes it's in North America.<br/><br/>Other actors put in decent enough performances, but there's nothing outstanding. Character wise the weak link here is the character of Ashley. Far too stereotypical, hard and cold. One supposes that she is in some way meant to contrast her mother, but we've seen characters like this far too many times before...she needs some depth.<br/><br/>This will be compared to Buffy - the characters aren't immediately associated with the former series - but it's there in the design of the monsters - the characters are also somewhat similar - the blonde fighting machine(Ashley/Buffy), the clever researcher (Magnus/Will/Giles) and monsters that work for the 'good guys'.<br/><br/>This 'pilot' doesn't go that far and we need a whole season of this to make a judgement call really. Based on this pilot though, I am intrigued and would like to see more.",68 out of 98 found this helpful.,8.0,1 September 2007
1746,Sanctuary, Strange blend of sci-fi/horror/fantasy entertainment,"Just to get this out of the way, ""Sanctuary"" is one of the best-looking shows on television; the strange, unique blend of science fiction, horror, and fantasy really add to the overall strangeness and beauty of the lush CGI, comic book-style visuals. In fact, ""Sanctuary"" does seem like a weird, live-action hybrid combining elements of horror and sci-fi comics, plus, as a few other viewers mentioned, ""The X-Files"" and ""Buffy, the Vampire Slayer"" and maybe even the ""Underworld"" films.<br/><br/>Of course, after watching the season premiere on the Sci-Fi Channel, I'm convinced that I might tune in next week for the second episode, just to see if my suspicions are correct in that the Sci-Fi Channel does have an ounce of credibility left when it comes to halfway decent entertainment.<br/><br/>""Sanctuary"" is set in some large, perpetually dark would-be Gotham City, where Dr. Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne) is a criminal profiler investigating a mysterious triple homicide in an apartment building. Using his skillful intuition, he suspects that something is amiss right away, that whatever killed these three people was not human. It turns out that his suspicions are correct: the killer, a 10-year-old Russian boy with a hideous snake-like appendage, had been adopted by the family and attacked them when he felt threatened.<br/><br/>Zimmerman is then recruited by Dr. Helen Magnus (Amanda Tapping) and her mercenary daughter Ashley (Emilie Ullerup) to come work with them at the ""Sanctuary,"" a place that houses all manner of ""ab-normals"" (people and creatures that are the stuff of folklore, nightmares, and stories that were made up to scare little kids). As it turns out, many of these creatures have lived alongside us for years, with much of the human population not even aware of their existence, and any data that can be mined from them can possibly hold the key to mankind's future evolution, or destruction. Most of the ab-normals are benign, but there are a few out there that would like to use their abilities for destructive purposes.<br/><br/>""Sanctuary"" does have the potential to be a rather entertaining piece of weekly viewing on the Sci-Fi Channel. I found it to be rather dark and gripping comic book-style entertainment, although I think the story and writing could use some polishing.<br/><br/>I'll just have to make sure that if I decide to turn in next week, that ""Sanctuary"" lives up to be the unique piece of strange Sci-Fi Channel programming it promises.<br/><br/>7/10",23 out of 31 found this helpful.,7.0,3 October 2008

1748,Sanctuary, Canadian TV is on a roll. Sanctuary is a breath of fresh air.,"Sanctuary is a fun show to watch. Amanda Tapping and crew do a fine job of telling interesting stories. Many of the story lines came straight from the webisodes. However, the topics were highly compelling, the acting wonderful; especially with all the green screens, and the production may be the wave of the future for most TV series.<br/><br/>I would not be surprised if several of the actors receive awards for their acting. In addition, I expect to see several technical awards for the production of the show.<br/><br/>Christopher Heyerdahl plays a couple of characters that are very different from each other. From the first episode of season one to the last, you get to see his incredible range as an actor.<br/><br/>Most of the time when an actor or actress plays a role for a very long time, the way Amanda Tapping played Samantha Carter, it is can be difficult to remove that image from the audiences mind. In Sanctuary, Amanda Tapping proves yet again what a fine actress she is as Helen Magnus. She created a new entertaining character for her public to care about and support.",35 out of 57 found this helpful.,8.0,12 April 2009

What this does is contradict the premise of the show - that these are a group of hotshot experts catching monsters and that they know how to deal with them. US obsession with the English accent also does this no favours as it makes it a little to much of a production island, when we in the UK for example just see it as bland US air-filler.<br/><br/>The annoying daughter character is hard to care about, some of the monsters are just silly and there are weak computer graphics throughout - especially on the mermaid.

1751,Sanctuary," Good characters, premise and atmosphere but BAD writing","I've just finished watching the 2 episode pilot for the TV series of Sanctuary. I really wanted to like Sanctuary. a good premise and a reliable actress well able to carry off the lead role. Even the supporting cast are good.. and the atmosphere was great. Yes I Had high hopes. As a fan of sci-fi and fantasy over many years I am familiar with the suspension of disbelief required to immerse one's self into a created universe. Unfortunately the writing left me wondering exactly how much disbelief I was expected to suspend. The show is marketed for all ages but is so simple in its execution that its prime audience must be young adults. <br/><br/>The situation, atmosphere and flaws are very similar to the English Torchwood TV show. ie clandestine organisation operating outside the law responsible for dealing with bizarre beings/artifacts/events. So what was wrong with the writing? This is where it went south for me..<br/><br/>Magnus knows of a severe security threat to Sanctuary, and has implemented a force shield around it for protection from this individual.. a John Druitt. not only has she kept Druitt a secret from all her staff so that they know nothing about him.. she has even lied about the shields purpose .. effectively making her staff cannon fodder should this threat materialise. As the pilot progresses, her warrior daughter, Ashley, is ordered to stay in Sanctuary following some unexplained power surges... and of course as Magnus is tight lipped about the whole ""huge threat thing"" which she suspects.. Ashley disobeys and goes out to make an arms purchase anyway. While out she is basically beaten in a fight by ""the threat"".. Druitt... to be saved by the skin of her teeth by a well placed ""taser like"" shot courtesy her local arms dealer. Not phased at all by this near death experience she leaves the ""very fast and strong"" Druitt in the safe hands of the office admin assistant before Druitt is even subdued properly so she can, amazingly, ""hit the showers"". Entry to Sanctuary is not via a quarantine system either... it is apparently OK to wheel any captured organism thru the main corridors on a trolley before any threat assessment is made. And they also don't have to inform the boss about admitted/captured organisms either... maybe the next morning over coffee is alright... as its a family affair. Predictably Druitt gets the drop on the admin guy and eventually holds Ashley hostage while Helen is taking a bead on him. Well... warrior maiden can't think to grab Druitt's weapon hand or even to slant her head a few degrees to the side to let mom get a clearer shot... which is a mystery in itself as Druitt is at least 6'6"" and towers by at least one head over Ashley anyway.. leaving Druitt's jubilant face completely in a clear line of fire. I really don't know how large a target would have to be for Magnus to take the shot. <br/><br/>Helen Magnus certainly has not learned a whole lot about managing Sanctuary in one hundred and something odd years.. and like Torchwood the staff are only barely prepared to follow orders. And like Torchwood there is no coherent explanation for how these incompetent people could have operated their organisation for so long in the manner shown. Its for younger folk or those with far greater skills than mine at suspending their disbelief.",18 out of 28 found this helpful.,4.0,1 November 2008
1752,Sanctuary," Nice concept, but technical aspects could be better","This show hearkens back to a few of the shows from the 90s like ""Poltergeist: The Legacy"" and even the first six seasons of ""The X-Files"".<br/><br/>The potential for future story lines is very good, and the acting is decent too, specifically by Amanda Tapping. While her Helen Magnus character retains a little bit of the scientist heart of her Stargate character, there's a much more mysterious and darker side to Magnus. In fact, Magnus is what Samantha Carter could have been in another time and place. It's a refreshing change. The other principles do an okay job. Emilie Ullerup's character starts out as a little too Buffy The Vampire Slayer-ish, with too much of a cautious-less teenage attitude at the beginning -- her character was established as being over 18, which doesn't jive with how she's portrayed -- but she showed a little more maturity at the end of the pilot. Having seen Ullerup in a bit part in Battlestar Galactica, she's more than capable of pushing her character to more grittier areas, which would provide a nice counterpoint to the other characters. Robin Dunne reminds me a little too much of Daniel Radcliffe. I'm half-expecting him to start reciting Hogwart incantations. At the end of the pilot, his character still seems to be a bit 2 dimensional.<br/><br/>The special effects were quite good for work that was done in front of a green screen. But ... I thought that the pilot episode suffered in one particular area: pacing. I'm not sure if it has to do with the editing or directing, or both, but the two hour premiere could have almost been cut down to an hour and a half. Some of the cuts were too slow, lingering on exposition scenes. Tighter pacing and quicker cuts would have made the pilot episode a lot better.<br/><br/>Minor nitpicking... There are two things I wish they would have taken care of. The first was the scene in the train tunnels where Ullerup's character was following the boy. Honestly, if I was wandering through a train tunnel, I'd immediately realize that someone was following me, especially someone with a flashlight. And also, it's kinda weird that two folks could just slip by a crime scene in the same tunnel without even being noticed. (Unless, of course, they used some Jedi mind tricks...) The second was the little side story regarding the police's prime suspect to the murders. For me, this was unresolved and I would have liked to have a resolution to it. I found it disappointing that the main characters would actually let an innocent man take the fall for something that was done by some of the ""monsters"". Perhaps this was part of the original script? I don't know, but it's unresolved. And considering the task that the main characters are facing, you'd think they'd at least have some sort of moral compass.<br/><br/>Overall, the show has a nice concept, but could benefit from better editing and directing. I'm going to keep watching the show for a few more episodes before I decide if I'm going to be watching this show after Stargate Atlantis.",27 out of 47 found this helpful.,6.0,11 October 2008
1753,Sanctuary," Good Actors, entertaining show","I found the first few episodes a bit silly, and watched them only for good ol' Amanda Tapping, because I wanted to see how she's doing after the deep hole of Stargate cancellation, after I saw her a few seconds in Stargate Universe.<br/><br/>Luckily she found a good new home. As she is involved as a producer, we can hope that she will do everything to prevent early cancellation.<br/><br/>The show itself, as I said, did not quite satisfy me in the beginning, but after say, four episodes, I got used to it. There are some enhancements, and some positive surprises. The biggest surprise is Christopher Heyerdahl, who plays the bad guy, turning into the good guy, and also the monster butler bigfoot. He is in all positions very convincing and obviously a good actor. We can see which potential he had as the Wraith Todd in Stargate Atlantis. Everyone who casted him here had a very good idea.<br/><br/>I must admit, that a big part of the show is simply childish, but it is made with much love and effort, and it is professional, fast and thrilling, given that the viewer will adapt to the completely impossible, not to say stupid, plot. It was interesting for me, seeing myself accepting all those monsters and vampires for watching a good ensemble. What I also felt is that here the people try to pass their enjoyment for doing their job to the audience. Production values seem not so high, but I never had any cheap impression. <br/><br/>Amanda Tapping is not that big Actor, but she has charisma, and she is holding the family together. Again, she is the good and honorable guy, here with some secrets behind, which aren't too ugly to blame her. I think, she could need a couple of real sins, maybe they will come up later in the show.<br/><br/>For now, I can recommend the show to everyone who likes solid acting, nice monsters and (mostly) sympathetic characters, all brought together with English manor atmosphere and sets, kindly broken by welcomed exceptions, like the humorous (but bloody) episode 10 of season two, where we meet one beautiful cylon from Battlestar Galactica. However, you must be generous, because the script writers aren't masters of quality control here.<br/><br/>After season two, ep. 07, and I had to lower my voting, because the spirit of the new is unfortunately gone. After the victory in the war against the Cabal, who attacked mostly ridiculous and silly, the authors and the characters have obviously a lack of ideas what to do. Routine has come to the team, and they became a little lazy. Tesla and John Druitt both disappeared with no further explanations, I don't like such unfilled holes, especially if they are essential. I hope they will do better in the future, otherwise they will not have one bright. Now, after ep. 10, there was finally the return of Tesla, which raised the fun immediately, esp. after a number of really boring and silly episodes. The episode with former SG-1 Tapping's Co-worker Michael Shanks was (for me) the worst.",10 out of 15 found this helpful.,7.0,23 November 2009

Unfortunately, step by step, ideas including Jack the Ripper, Merlin, immortality etc. got in and mess the show. Why choose old, reused for a hundred time stories, despite the show target - subspecies of humans ?

The good doctor and his daughter use bullets and guns as main weapons against enemies who attack one by one (?), except some scenes design to show their prowess in hand to hand combat. The scenery is a obviously hint to doctor Frankestein novel, but they put a lot of work in making the environment believable.

1756,Sanctuary, Sanctuary - Interesting Concept but with Poor Execution,"Being a long time fan of the Stargate Series, I was intrigued when I heard Amanda Tapping would be starring in a new sci fi show. The concept sounded interesting...A Sanctuary for all manners of creatures unknown to science, some based in myth, some just plain odd! A team that attempts to locate these creatures and in a way, rescue them and give them a chance to live in this Sanctuary.<br/><br/>As I said, this concept sounded interesting and I was actually pretty excited to see the show for the first time. Perhaps this is one of those situations where I should have had lower expectations or none at all because from the first episode, this show just doesn't seem to get better than marginal at best for me.<br/><br/>One big thing for me is the character played by Amanda Tapping. It's not her character per say but rather the accent someone decided would be a good thing for her to have. Now, I have heard people disagree in a few different ways on this subject but in my opinion, Amanda's English accent just doesn't cut it. There are clearly times when she slips in and out of the accent and it just takes away from the character and the show in general. Also, it's really annoying to hear the constant wavering. I know that may sound like nitpicking but that kind of thing can really wear down on you! <br/><br/>Aside from the accent issue, the two main parts of Sanctuary that really make it a 4 out of 10 as opposed to an 8 out of 10 are acting and presentation.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the acting when it came to guess spots from actors such as Christopher Heyerdahl who plays not only John Druitt on occasion but also is a regular character as well when he plays Bigfoot. Jonathon Young as Nikolas Tesla was another acting positive note in the few episodes he was in. Unfortunately, the acting that comes from the actors playing the main characters just doesn't really sell the show to me. The main character of Helen Druitt is an interesting one as not everyone can live for over 150 years but unfortunately, either Amanda Tapping just doesn't seem suited for the character or the character itself is just not written well. I'm not sure if she is having trouble keeping the accent and trying to act at the same time and if that's the issue but she just doesn't come off to me as being very believable.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is either a much more ""put you to sleep"" kind of character such as Dr. Zimmerman or an ""I'm appealing to the 13-17 year old demographic"" character such as Ashley Magnus. The buffy-esquire member of the troupe. Both of their characters are for a lack of a way to say it...boring and/or cliché.<br/><br/>Honestly...I think the main reason the acting isn't very believable is the fact almost all of Sanctuary is shot on a green screen! Having to not only constantly react to creatures and monsters who are supposedly trying to kill you who also happen to not be real, there are backgrounds and landscapes and buildings that you have to also remember to act as if they are also real.<br/><br/>It's like each episode is it's own, ""let's hunt the creatures"" and give them ""Sanctuary"" kind of thing where ironically, at times Dr Helen Magnus declares that all creatures deserve sanctuary, or something along those lines...then turns around and wastes a bunch of other ""creatures""! Then she proceeds to actually give one of them an autopsy or dissection depending on how you look at it! So...I guess that guy wasn't eligible for a room at the Sanctuary! One of the main things with this show is the CGI and digital effects. Given the fact that Sanctuary is almost entirely shot on a green screen, one would think there would be a little more polish in the execution. I found that the creatures especially have a tendency to look fake and there just seems to be an over all unpolished look to the way the effects appear on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, this show isn't a complete disaster as there is a somewhat decent foundation for a good show in there somewhere...Perhaps Sanctuary will actually learn from it's first season mistakes and become a better, more entertaining show depending on how many seasons it will ultimately last. That would please me greatly as we really need better sci fi shows and if this show improved I would gladly watch it on a regular basis. Until then, I'll just have to cross Sanctuary off my DVR record list.",13 out of 23 found this helpful.,4.0,5 June 2009
1757,Sanctuary, This show had so much promise...too bad.,"I am so disappointed in the direction this show has gone in with its second season. The first season of Sanctuary had so much promise. I loved the atmosphere of mystery and the mixture of supernatural and science fiction elements, and the virtual sets they used allowed them to create a world that closed in around those elements. The acting was excellent, and the characters well rounded. But alas, it seems that the producers have abandoned all of that for an amped up, action show with shoot-em-ups and monster attacks. They have abandoned much of the virtual sets concept and have gone to real-world settings, which totally ruins the atmosphere of the show. They have turned the Sanctuary itself from a secretive organization to a para-military organization that has its own Navy! COME ON! Gone is the mystery, and here comes the explosions! It really is sad because this series was so different and fresh in the beginning, as was Amanda Tapping's portrayal of Helen Magnus. But for her character as well, she has changed and not for the better. They have basically turned her into science genius with a gun, another Sam Carter but with dark hair and a Victorian accent. And I really do think she has a better acting range than that, because she showed it in the first season. And the new characters they have brought in (with the exception of Tesla) are irritating. I watched it through the season finale for Season 2, but I think I am going to drop the show from my viewing list. I have to say it again...too bad. This show had such promise. Now, I think it will end up more of a staple of Sci-Fi Saturday movies (bad monster flicks) because that is where the material is heading.",9 out of 15 found this helpful.,2.0,7 February 2010
1758,Sanctuary, Getting pretty good!,"This is a review of the first season on TV, which should really be known as season 1 on IMDb, and the webisodes season 0.<br/><br/>Essentially there are three main characters, all of which believable, even Tapping's accent, and I'm saying that as a Brit. She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.<br/><br/>Sanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.<br/><br/>For Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site.

1759,Sanctuary," Amanda Tapping playing a beautiful, kick-ass 157 year old English Doctor... What more could you ask for?","Full disclosure: I pretty much love everything about Amanda Tapping. So it's not a big surprise that I love this series so much.<br/><br/>Like her portrayal of Samantha Carter (Stargate SG1), to Helen Magnus she brings the perfect mix of strength, humour and vulnerability. But with Helen Magnus she takes it to a whole new level with a self confidence that you can't help but be drawn to. She's the coolest, smartest and most beautiful woman in the room and you desperately want to be her.<br/><br/>But it's not just Amanda that makes this series great. The supporting cast including Robin Dunne, Ryan Robbins, Christopher Heyerdahl and Jonathan Young all portray wonderfully relatable and flawed characters who all contribute to this dysfunctional but loving family dynamic.<br/><br/>Speaking of Jonathan Young, his performance as the sassy, irreverent, self-absorbed vampire Nikola Tesla (yeah THAT Nikola Tesla)is the highlight for me. Honestly if they had made a Season 5 of this series they should've put him in every episode.<br/><br/>The story structure, photography and directing is familiar for SG1 and SGA fans (with Martin Wood and Damian Kindler at the wheel).<br/><br/>Now I will say. Season 1 is a little hit and miss.

1762,Sanctuary, A poorly written hybrid of Buffy &amp; Torchwood,"A poorly written hybrid of Buffy &amp; Torchwood. The ""sets"" (which are apparently mostly green screen, so I should say, the digital imaging) &amp; costuming are lovely, this is a good looking show. The monster effects are TV show quality (ranging from decent to funny/awful). The action choreography is Buffy Standard Quality. The acting varies from tolerable to poor. The two lead females are tolerable, but the leading male Robin Dunne has no comedic timing, can't deliver lines &amp; just looks awkward and unnatural (more-so than some of the monsters on the show). As a result his character isn't funny, interesting or even very likable. Apparently they have guest stars that can act, but I didn't stick it out long enough to see them. The poor acting isn't helped by the fact that the writing is terrible. The worst part is that the writing isn't even consistently terrible. A normal conversation will be taking place and then someone will pop up with a ridiculous line that no one with any self respect would ever say. It's your standard 'freak of the week' show.

1763,Sanctuary," cheap, infantile dark-side SF with a weak plot","monsters? super powers? it's cheap comedy rather then dark-side SF. As a fan of the genre i saw many productions read a lot of SF book - so when I see the 'science-fiction' as the genre - I have some expectations.<br/><br/>There are two main kinds of SF - the one, where the plot, the idea and thus the dialogs plays the main part, and the second one - where you put some silly creatures, give lasers and/or superpowers, add some rain, maybe some super-weapons - and here you have the production like 'sanctuary'. <br/><br/>The acting is no more then average but considering tragic, predictable plot, and the scenery made from 'cheap SF template' - this production is a waste of time. I've expected some real sociological problems raised, some real discussion on unreal world, some effort put to create the idea convincing - and I was totally disappointed not finding any of those. that's the main reason I hate most of Marvell productions - by giving some super-powers which are totally in conflict with physics like f.ex. flying man, man-gum or man-stone or some other silly ideas driven from a children dream. It's not a SF - it's a fairy tale. <br/><br/>So if you like 'evening stories', which not necessarily brings any new idea and you don't like to really 'jump into' the world created - or telling shortly - if you are simply looking for a cheap amusement: this series is for you. But if you are looking for good story - don't waste your time.",24 out of 59 found this helpful.,2.0,18 October 2008
1764,Sanctuary, We look for further development,"This show is worth watching. However, it seems to struggle to locate itself and this is always due to the strength of script. The show badly needs good writers who can bring depth to it and lift it out of the B-film category. The best shows we've ever seen are memorable because they tell us something about life and about ourselves. At this juncture this show is like munching on popcorn...not really good enough to endure. Canadian production can do better. The best thing they've done thus far is introduce Agam Darshi to the cast. She picks up the show's energy by a good number of points. Still, we need to see better scripts. As for Nikola Tesla being a vampire...this is bizarre and not terribly bright. It makes as much sense as introducing Ghandi as a zombie. Tesla remains one of the great unsung heroes of modern technology. Please do some thinking before you commit a script to production.",7 out of 14 found this helpful.,6.0,16 January 2010
1765,Sanctuary, Very Entertaining!,"When this program was first released, I was put off in the previews by Amanda Tapping with a British accent, so I skipped watching it. She may have been born in the UK, but her American accent seems to pop out at times. However, I decided that after three seasons on the air, I would watch the program. I was not disappointed. The story is a very interesting look at the Sanctuary that Dr. Helen Magnus operates to protect ""Abnormal"" beings.<br/><br/>The program uses probably more CGI and green screen (CSO) than any I have seen in awhile. Some of it is very well done and in other places it looks like a scene from a PS3 game. However, the effects seem to add more than distract from the plots. Another bonus I liked was seeing SG-1 alumni pop up now and then like Michael Shanks (Dr. Jackson) or Gary Jones (Walter). My favorite line is when Gary Jones says. ""I knew that British accent was fake."" <br/><br/>Christopher Heyerdahl is brilliant in his roles as is Robin Dunne as Will. Another treat is seeing cast from Highlander such as Jim Byrnes and Peter Wingfield. Overall the casting is very good and believable.

As long as the show continues to get darker and the plots stay interesting we are looking at a great new series! The one character that hurts the show in my opinion is the daughter. She is a pretty face to look at but I find her acting is dull, and not interesting. If they were to replace her with someone more interesting...perhaps someone like a Kristen Kreuk we would be set! I also think that the protagonist does a great job of acting and I think that her transition from Stargate to this show was a good one. Her accent definitely needs some work.

1767,Sanctuary, Wow... this is just about one of the worst things I've watched in a while.....,"Wow.<br/><br/>I thought the first year of Torchwood was the worst thing. And this... wow. I figured, (or hoped, rather) being that it's from a few of the fellows who did Stargate, and with Amanda Tapping (who is adorable) that this might actually have some promise. Martin Wood is one of the best directors SG1 ever had.<br/><br/>So I've never seen this show.. the first episode they've sent over here to the UK is the 3rd episode of the second series, unless I've missed something. They're advertising this as ""first chance to see the sci-fi show..."" and I'm just gob-smacked trying to figure out how this show could have made more than one episode.<br/><br/>Like I said, I really like Amanda Tapping. She's so funny and so clever, I really do enjoy her. But... considering the fact that she was born in England and probably still has enough family she's got good access to an accent if necessary, her accent is quite terrible. Even if I'd never heard or seen Amanda with her Canadian accent, I'd know in an instant after a half a sentence that she was faking an accent.<br/><br/>I wish that were my only complaint.<br/><br/>What's more over, they have irritated me by continually referring to the 17 and 1800's as ""the Middle Ages."" That's kind of a bad start. I'm willing to overlook something like that provided that the rest of the show makes up for it.<br/><br/>I'm sad to say this is worse than Torchwood series 1. Now I watch Torchwood -- I don't understand why, myself -- but the first series was dreadful. The second series, whilst passable, still cannot delude me into thinking this is a quality show. We all have that one ridiculous show we watch and can't figure out why. It's like junk food TV. You don't expect much, so you can't be disappointed. So if this is worse then that it's very sad. What saves Torchwood is the camp smile of John Barrowman, and above all the ability to laugh at itself very occasionally. It's what saves Doctor Who, a series which is, regrettably, very often terrible in script, from being intolerable and making it delightful. It's like the main characters are laughing at how ridiculous the story is -- making it OK for you to do so as well and just sit back and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Without someone with the charisma of Barrowman to carry a show like this, this show just reminds me of how terrible sci-fi can be.<br/><br/>The premise is very clearly ripped off of Torchwood. The aliens are remarkably similar to the weevils on Torchwood. The acting is WORSE than Torchwood, and the writing, if possible, is even more elementary. The acting/writing/directing/special effects are about level in quality as those on the movie Idiocracy - without the intentional mediocrity and without the social statement.<br/><br/>I really like Amanda and was hoping this would be worth watching.<br/><br/>Unless something severe changes on this show?

1770,Troy: Fall of a City," Offending, at least","As a Greek and a thinking capable woman, this show offended me in the depths of my soul. First of all, what the heck was that story with Paris? Secondly, wtf was wrong with Cassandra? Cassandra was not a child when Paris was born and she couldn't foresee things as a child because she got that ""charisma"" 
AFTER Apollo cursed her for not sleeping with him. And I'm 100% sure Apollo was no paedo. Then, ok, as a Greek I can accept black Achilles or a black Zeus in the name of diversity but I can't accept Menelaos walking around with an umbrella (a bloody crinoline, not just a simple umbrella). And in Greece people didn't walk around with umbrellas because of the sun, generally. We don't take protection from the sun and we never did. Also wtf with the Indian king and silk room in Sparta? The known world for Greeks at this time was Minor Asia and perhaps black sea. It took us almost 7 centuries until Alexander the Great found out what was beyond the known world. A redhead Aphrodite, seriously people, a redhead? Red hair in ancient Greece was considered barbaric and they even made Scythian slaves to die their hair black (seriously, this was more offending than the black Zeus or Achilles). Naming spices from East? What East, which spices????? Cumin and turmeric and women paint their nails with ""liquid"" gold? We're talking about bronze age, ok maybe the most advanced bronze age in Europe, but still it's bronze age. The only thing I liked as a Greek was the depiction of Helen, finally no more blonde, blue eyed, Dinaric type actresses. But what was wrong with all of her dresses and hairstyles? She looked like she came out of Vogue magazine where the main theme was feathers and leather, how to wear them this season. Probably the costumes we had in highschool were more true to the originals and better sewn than those they wear in the show Literally, with 500 euros you could find better costumes and better scenery. Palaces are almost empty, people eat in floors (uhm, we didn't do that usually, that's an eastern habit). And finally the story. Ok, BBC look, you can't take Romeo and Juliet and make something OUT of it, you can adapt it, you can give it a certain ""color"" but you can't forge it. And you cannot do the same with Iliad. You cannot change the story and the events, you cannot kill people (poor Ifigenia never died and placed as a bloody mess on coals) and most certainly you cannot bring disgrace in one of the most important Epic Poems of humanity. This is blasphemy, this is hybris , this is by far the worst adaptation of Iliad I've ever seen. It hurt my eyes, my mind and my soul, as a human being and a Greek. I don't know who wasted money on that but if you ever read this, ask for your money back, it was a fiasco. And finally, what's wrong with the women on this show?? Uhm, hello, we used to be the victims back then, we didn't shout to our parents and most certainly we couldn't encounter our fiancé before wedding, we didn't had a tongue like Hermione because this would mean we wouldn't have tongues at all.

1771,Troy: Fall of a City, Are people in the BBC all mad ?,"I just couldn't believe what I was watching in Netflix. This series is so wrong, so outrageously disrespectful to Homer's immortal Illiad that I had to write this review. The directors-writers-producers-whatever and whoever they were (-like a gang-) seem to have deliberately chosen to disfigure the masterpiece - perhaps the highest work of literature ever created. A cultural murder was, apparently, perpetrated in this ""Troy-The Fall of a City"". Just about every actor is miscast, starting with Paris/Alexander himself who does not look any bit ""in love "" with Helen at all! As he prepares to go back to Troy I got a feeling that Helen hid herself in that coffin out of boredom, not really for love - neither she, nor he seems to have been taken by the turmoil of an intense passion. Paris is such a modern boy ! Does he like soccer? Videogames? And Helen, though quite pretty, could not possibly be ""...the most beautiful woman of the world"" promised by Aphrodite. Ah!... Aphrodite promised. But didn't deliver... A certain discomfort invades the viewer from the start as he is confronted with so much bad acting, bad casting, bad timing in the events. Sorry to say that - but it MUST be said - Achilles SHOULD be someone hairy and blond - like a lion, as Homer explicitly wrote in his story. Achilles was ""golden"" like a lion! Nestor, an important character in the Illiad looks just like a street dweller that I see everyday somewhere in Rio de Janeiro where I live. Why this ? BBC managed to offend Homer, the Greeks, and all of humanity who read this immortal tale of war and love.

You feel like that the two armies has maximum 200 soldiers with no big battles. <br/><br/>Apart from that there are many serious mistakes from the original poem.<br/><br/>1) Iphegenia never sacrificed. The last moment goddess Artemis replaced her with a deer and took her as her priestess.

Third, riders are seen using stirrups, invented in China in the first centuries AD and first known to have been used in Europe by the Normans.

They HAVE to fuck it up. Why? It is certainly not because it has already been done, because to my knowledge nobody has ever done it. It totally baffles me. Nobody ever just took the Ilias and put it on the screen. Is there a certain code, like not mentioning the name of a certain scottish king?<br/><br/>And then there's history -yeah booooring.

1794,The Guardian, A pure CBS classic!,"""THE GUARDIAN,"" in my opinion, is a pure CBS classic! I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. However, I think it was always touching when a mishap occurred. I always felt deeply moved. It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. It would probably have to be the pilot. Despite the fact that it was a short-lived series, it would have been nice if all the main characters had stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, I hope they bring it back on the air for fans of the show to see.",41 out of 44 found this helpful.,9.0,20 July 2006
1795,The Guardian, pretty good so far,"This series has potential as a legal drama.

1796,The Guardian, gr8,"this show is brilliant. it is so nice to watch something like that on TV. simon baker is a very good actor. it is too bad that he wasn't nominated for emmy at least once. he would really earn that. i haven't seen all seasons yet. today i've seen the first episode of the third season(is that the last season as well?). and the performance of all characters is just amazing. it is too bad, that they don't filming anymore. because the show was actually realistic. and it was nice too watch it every Sunday in the evening. i really thought that they would making it at least few years more. it is really bad and sad because they ended. our TV needs more things like this. that is why i hope that they will make something like that in the near future. the show is just... brilliant",26 out of 29 found this helpful.,,29 August 2004
1797,The Guardian, This show has a unique and refreshing feel and look,The pace of each episode is unusual giving lots of pregnant pauses after each clause  of very well written and realistic dialogue.  The characters are very flawed and real and I really enjoy the juggling of the legal aid clinic and big corperate law. They have 2 stories in one show that reflect sometimes on each other giving us more occasions to think about the world that the show is based on. The lack of phyisical contact with Nik and clients really increased the tension. You know he wants to hug those kids. Also Dabney Coleman gives a stellar performance of your chain smoking aging corperate lawyer who has many regrets in his life but also really enjoys his job. I could go on and on but Kudos to the producers of this show and keep up the good work.,18 out of 20 found this helpful.,,20 August 2002
1798,The Guardian, Best Drama Currently on Network Television,"The Guardian is hands down the best drama currently on television. It's amazing to me how Simon Baker has never won an Emmy for his portrayal of Nick Fallin - the ex cocaine addict who's forced to put in 1600 hours of community service as a child advocate for the legal aid services center in Pittsburgh. This is in addition to being a principal partner in his father's corporate law firm. Watching Nick run from the courtroom to the board room (and occasionally the bedroom) and back again with nary a moment to gather his thoughts can leave the viewer exhausted by the end of the show but this is also part of its appeal. We can feel Nick's stress and associate it with our own harried lives.<br/><br/>None of the central characters on this show are without their flaws - Nick is often aloof and emotionless - caring more about corporate mergers than whether or not he is best serving the interests of those he defends during his community service. He rarely gives his downtrodden, legal aid clients a second thought once he has finished representing them. His father, brilliantly played by the veteran character actor Dabney Coleman can also be abrasive, manipulative, callous and, as the second season finale graphically showed also violent and dangerously obsessed with a twelve year old girl he took in as a foster child. The interaction (or lack thereof) between the two, neither whom is able to really show their true feelings towards one another is often painful to watch.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast with the exception of Wendy Muniz are all expertly cast. Charles Malik Whitfield as James Mooney, the ex gang member who has escaped the ghetto to become a lawyer for the legal aid group is both menacing and heroic at the same time. One powerfull episode has him almost beating to death a young black man who he has been told caused the death of his troubled nephew. He later discovers that this person was innocent and must deal with how to come to terms with almost killing and disfiguring an innocent man. Raphael Sbarge as Jake Straka, another success driven lawyer at Nick's firm, makes us think of all the lawyers we have known who can barely give us the time of day unless the reward is large enough. Alan Rosenberg who plays Alvin Masterson, the director of the clinic, tries to keep the chaos controllable even while fighting his own demons which include an unhealthy weakness for some of his former female clients. Only Wendy Muniz fails to convince in her role as Lulu Archer, another one of the legal aid lawyers. The series' writers seem unable to decide whether she should be a foil to Nick or just another lovesick conquest. Their romantic scenes together lack passion or chemistry and often seem contrived.<br/><br/>
All in all though this is a thoughtful, powerful, and at times, emotionally brutal show. Enjoy it while you can - it's sure to be short lived.",37 out of 45 found this helpful.,,31 May 2003
1799,The Guardian, Understated but powerful,"I know I watched this when it was on air but somehow watching it streaming as a sort of marathon makes it more powerful. Others have commented and disagreed on the acting also speculated why the show didn't last. I wanted to add my couple of cents. Simon Baker basically does play the same role in the Mentalist, (savior) but smiles and wins more hence the show not being canceled. In the Guardian, the hero does not always win, the ending is not always happy and the characters are always flawed. This might be too much for network TV. The theme song and introduction are obnoxious when compared with cable shows such as Dexter, Oz. Lulu's character is not written with as much depth as the others so its hard to fault the acting. I think the viewer felt a bit manipulated by the drawn out back and forth with Nick. Its always hard for writers to get over the hump of what to do with all that sexual tension. Just look at what happened to House. Dabney Coleman is brilliant in his intensity. This show has many shades of gray and is very much worth watching.",11 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,22 December 2011

1802,The Guardian, The Fall Guy was The Standup Guy!,"I happened upon the Guardian and watched all three seasons over the past couple of weeks. I loved Simon Baker's character, Nick. He was the most honest of the bunch and my favorite, with Alan Rosenburg (Alvin) a close second. 
Nick had faults and displayed behavior consistent with issues realistic based on his upbringing. While he was continuously the one everyone else used as the convenient fall-guy, he was the one who developed most in spite of the people who influenced him. I found him to be the most honest - accepting fault when it was his and honoring the consequences and those belonging to others as well.
I enjoyed that the show dealt with real life issues and created an awareness around subject matter relatable to all.
Now, the character I enjoyed the least.... Lulu. At times, I really thought she was ""lulu."" She was way too inconsistent and was always finger pointing, neglecting to see any of her own issues - of which she had many. I just felt that she seized every opportunity to beat the hell out of Nick. I am so tired of seeing her type cast throughout TV series - condescending, negative, bitter, and mean. Every time she spoke it was with a scowl on her face, like her upper lip was stinking. While I'm all for women who are strong and smart and on top of their careers, I''m over the cold suited props who every time they open their mouths, it's to hurt someone. She punished and punished and punished. I almost wish there was another season and Hollander let Nick move on... What would that look like? She used everything against him and never considered him. 
Yes, he was wrong to sleep with that trashy chic in the office, and he knew that. At least he told her himself and took his punishment like a man. But it just went on and on with her. Alvin made great point that she was 50% of the relationship... but that didn't provoke any thought for her. 
Her demeanor was fake, cold... She didn't add any value to the other characters. I'm usually a sucker for a love story, but near the end, I wanted him to run as far as he could from her. She was toxic. 
Then, the pregnancy, proposal, and baby makes three (well, maybe one, because she, of course, was the only one that mattered). I couldn't understand why she worked in a humanitarian capacity, because her character was anything but... I was outdone! With all the miss-nose-up-in-the-air, she couldn't smell her own mess! She was messy, and tactless. She didn't want a man, she wanted a little boy and then was mad when that's what showed up. If the intent was to dislike her character... then it was a successful role. ARGH!!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast, played their roles well. Jake needed a good ole a-- whooping and Burton - no award recommendation for father of the year - but - he was consistent. <br/><br/>I loved the advocacy intention for ""The Guardian."" I was glad that Nick followed his heart in the end. I really wanted to see him become more self-accepting and develop further absent of the abusers around him, but Season 3... THE END!",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,23 February 2018

1804,The Guardian, How Different From The Mentalist,"I am left with much sadness after watching the entire series. Simon Baker has such a great smile, unfortunately I didn't get to see much of it here. Nick's casual drug use results in slow death for his high-profile law career as community service hours make it impossible to keep up. No human could keep up that pace. Although he is often called ""a great lawyer"" you almost never see any positive outcomes from his work at his father's firm. He is sullen, moody, non- communicative. Almost without exception his interactions are awkward. You just want to grab him and shake him up. Eventually he gets rejected by everyone. Is it his fault? In this way he is much like the rejected, abused, damaged children whom he represents in the courtroom. <br/><br/>Nick's interactions with women were often dreadful. I had such hopes for Lulu but she was never able to penetrate his walls. I also liked Nick's policewoman lover, but that promising storyline went nowhere. His final office dalliance did nothing but harm for all involved. <br/><br/>In the end, about the only positive thing about Nick was that he was sometimes able to help his young clients. Ultimately a very depressing series. Fortunately the Mentalist gave Simon's personality an opportunity to flash that smile and exhibit some warmth.",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,5.0,7 October 2015

Nick Fallen (Simon Baker) has been caught with coke and has been sentenced to 1,600 hours of community service. Using his lawyer abilities, Nick must help at the Pittsburg Legal services. Juggling a firm postion, clinets, and orphaned, beaten wives and children. Nick finds that the world he sees may not be real, like the 'Matrix'. Nick sees the more simple things in life, and soon puts some nice pick up lines to the test against the new girl, Lulu. She is a new legal service lawyer at Pittsburg Legal Services and Nick has found her, lets say, attractive. Nick goes to great lengths, from a normal, layed back rich kid. To a real world hard working love sick man. He opens up his buttoned up emotins sometimes, even once refered to as Teflon Man. Nothing touches him. But Love. He asks Lulu one day, ""My mom said one thing I will always do is treat women better then my dad did."" ""Was she right?"" (Lulu). ""I don't know, want to find out?"". Nick scrapes and shovels dirty work from murders, to felon boyfriends and lawyers. How far can a man be pushed to the edge?

I'm not sure what that is... but I popped on the TV and he immediately grabbed me.  I recognized him from ""L.A. Confidential"" (Christmas eve pot bust), and was sucked in by his performance.  He plays a rich kid lawyer/son of a lawyer recently busted for coke.  Sentenced to community service at children services, he enters a world he's never seen... nor wants to see.  All this while trying to play corporate hard-ball at his father's firm (and once in a while peeing in a cup for the probation officers).

1810,The Guardian," Intriguing, if a bit depressing","I have written here about this short-lived show in the past. Simon Baker is a perfect fit as the troubled son of a famous lawyer, played by Dabney Coleman of MARY HARTMAN fame. Because of some drug transgressions, the son, also a lawyer,must put in time at a child advocacy law firm. He also continues to work for his old man, and the two often do not see eye to eye. As time goes on in this show, things change: the father is up for a judgeship and the son starts his own law firm. Also, the son is hot for a lawyer at his father's firm, but alas, she loves another. The cases are usually intriguing, but the show is really about the father and son, and both actors pull off this thorny relationship with aplomb.There is an occasional soap opera aspect to the show, but it is kept to a minimum. Well worth watching, if a little depressing, as the son never seems to be able to stay out of trouble. It is not a lighthearted show and humor is basically nonexistent.

He just wants to get out of there, saying as little as possible - averages maybe 3 words per sentence. 9 out of 10 scenes end with him finally escaping the situation of having to put up with someone trying to talk to him about something...

1812,The Guardian, Inconsistent writing &amp; lots of darkness,"I just recently watched this series on Amazon Prime. I made it through 2 seasons and was going to stop, though a friend said the 3rd season was better so I finally watched it all. 
I agree with others that the focus on the community services situations were very interesting and well done. The best parts of the show.
And I did enjoy the development of the relationship between Nick and his dad, Burton. I liked the storyline with Burton and the girl he tries to adopt. Both Baker and Colemen did nice work.
But I often felt writing was subpar. Storylines often felt weak or unfinished. Major plot lines just stopped - characters just disappeared. What? That same unevenness also showed up in how key characters behaved at times, which I found unsatisfying. For me, this was a key downfall of the show.
As written, the Lulu character especially blew hot and cold - in an inexplicable way. By the end of season 3 I felt she appeared more uncaring, selfish, and manipulative than the Nick character ever was supposed to be. Very unsatisfying. 
OTOH, the way Nick's character was written, I often wondered if he had Aspergers or something - lacking social skills, an inability to properly communicate his emotions, and a consistently flat affect. To me, that explained his character's uneven behavior. Lulu's just made no sense to me, and made many episodes unsatisfying. Like discordant music.
The show also has few moments of joy or happiness. Even hard dramas, like this show, need moments that make you smile or at last feel hope for the characters. Didn't happen much in this show. No balance. I read someplace that Baker didn't really like working on this show. Considering his nickname as a kid was ""Smiley"", and he rarely gets to smile in this show, that makes sense.
However, after all that whining, I still think it was an interesting show to watch. There was some fine acting despite some of the writing.

I find the New Outer Limits WELL MORE than just a remake of old retread episodes, as some of the more adolescent commentators have suggested.<br/><br/>With seven (7) years of programs versus just the two (2) years of the original series, the producers and writers have certainly added considerable new original stories and philosophical lines to a much longer running and very well produced (cable) TV series. Plots are intelligent, scientifically accurate projections of the unknown possibilities of the sometimes frightening and imminent future.<br/><br/>While most producers and directors in Hollywood ignorantly view Sci-Fi as indistinguishable from Horror and Fantasy, this series returns to the origins of Science Fiction in the logical, moral and philosophical projections of current new technologies into their possibly fearful near term realizations. This series does this very well and remains unique in its avoidance of the ""shoot-em-up"" video game monster mentally of much of the current generation. It has brains, history, a message and good entertainment. It is an adult series without unbearable teenage know-it-all fantasies.

1820,The Outer Limits, Excellent series - for the most part,"I discovered The Outer Limits in mid-2001 while it was in syndication. Sadly, I didn't realize that they had just wrapped their final season. I've been trying to catch all of the episodes on Sci-Fi, which has an erratic schedule for this show, to say the least!<br/><br/>I must say that I disagree with most of the negative comments that I've read so far, regarding this program.  The series did indeed have some dud episodes -- especially the episodes which pieced together parts of other episodes to somehow make a ""new"" story.  However, for the most part, the show ran 7 seasons with some very original, creative, and fresh concepts that in most cases held my attention until the very end.  In fact, I felt sorry at the end of certain episodes that I wouldn't get to see more of the story, as each episode is a self-contained.  Unlike many shows than ran for 7 seasons, I did not find a degradation in quality as the show wore on. In fact, my second-favorite episode (""A New Life"") was from the final season.<br/><br/>While many writers were involved with the stories shown in The Outer Limits, a few were responsible for the majority of the episodes.  It's interesting to take a look at some of the ""themes"" behind the show in general.  The main (and stated) theme of The Outer Limits was to explore human nature and the consequence of human mistakes.  However, a viewing of all episodes also reveals a disdain that the writers seem to hold for both the American military and Christianity.  There were several episodes in which the military was either the villain, or the protagonist whose mistakes lead to the destruction of mankind.  Christianity was frequently shown as the vehicle used to brainwash unsuspecting earthlings into helping aliens accomplish their evil goals.  I am neither Christian nor involved with the military, but I found this apparent bias by the writers to be annoying, and sometimes ruined otherwise good episodes.<br/><br/>I liked how The Outer Limits mixed its endings between happy and catastrophic.  That made things a bit less predictable, unlike many movies of today where you know in advance that the hero will survive and triumph.<br/><br/>
If you're looking for a great episode, try ""The Refuge"".  I won't detail any of the plot for you, since it's best watched without knowing anything in advance.  It's from season 2, so I believe you can find it on the Season 2 DVD.",63 out of 72 found this helpful.,,10 October 2003

I loved the Afterlife episode with Clancy Brown and Barbara Gerrick and the Deprogrammers episode with the irresistible Brent Spiner as a Deprogrammer in a world where humans have become slaves to a lizard reptilian species. It's funny how the lizards and reptiles are our favorite evil aliens like V but anyway he has three days to program a man who is totally brainwashed in serving the alien species on earth. The stories are usually a little out there but very entertaining to watch.",19 out of 23 found this helpful.,8.0,14 January 2010
1825,The Outer Limits, some great episodes but hate the clip shows,It's a revival of the old series from 63 to 65. It's similar to The Twilight Zone except the stories are sci-fi based. It's mostly technology and aliens. It's not all an anthology show. Sometimes there are sequels to some episodes on a later date and some clip shows that tie some episodes together in the same world.<br/><br/>I don't like the clip shows. It feels like a waste of time. It's not good as a highlight show and it's unconvincing creating an unified world. And it's not a minor problem. There are quite a few of these shows and I have to downgrade the series from 7 to 6. I really like quite a few of these episodes. Some of them are not particularly compelling. It's also good to see some stars doing work when they're not as well known.,6 out of 6 found this helpful.,6.0,12 June 2015
1826,The Outer Limits, What a ride!!,"What can I say about the series dubbed the NEW OUTER LIMITS...Hmm.... Only that this was one of the best TV series ever assembled!! You have actors of all ages, The actors that are somewhat known and that time forgot. Everyone playing their part to exact perfection! These shows always have some type of moral story to them which most of the time (if not all the time) is very true! You can feel that the man whose voice is dubbed over the credits and in the beginning and ending believes what he is saying wholeheartedly! Not only do these shows have great story lines, they also throw you into them, get your mind racing, and your blood pumping. The original outer limits was a black and white in the 60's right, These shows made a triumphant comeback the likes of which I have never seen! The new twilight zone with Forest Whitaker was fun to watch, but the New OUTER LIMITS is where it's at! If you have not seen: I implore you to please check these episodes out, and you will see exactly what I mean!

1827,The Outer Limits, Wildly Varying in Quality,"I haven't seen all the Outer limits episodes, but when I have tuned in I've seen some quite good episodes almost like a one-hour movie with good (if lesser known) guest stars. Others have been embarrassing to watch or just plain average, it seems the way they did things was to have mostly low budget ""filler"" episodes and save up for a great, blockbuster episode every now and then. <br/><br/>The Outer Limits seems to offer both the best and worst of TV, I say overall it's not a bad effort but viewers like me may lose patience when it starts to seem like a long time between good episodes. I'm surprised the show ran as long as it did, with every science fiction-themed show outside of Star Trek and Stargate being cancelled at the first opportunity.",26 out of 37 found this helpful.,,12 December 2004

1830,The Outer Limits, Awesome Remake!,"The original The Outer Limits was an incredible science fiction series. A lot of people compare it unfavorably to The Twilight Zone (and I mean the original Twilight Zone from the same era as this show, not the movie or remake series that are quite honestly very inferior to the original). But this show is in my opinion as good (or at least almost as good, so much so that it's practically equally) to Rod Serling's classic. Definitely check this show out, it's on DVD now. And this, the remake of The Outer Limits is also fantastic (not as good as the original but much better than say the remake of Twilight Zone). Check them both out if you like dark TV sci-fi. There's a lot of great actors you will certainly recognize and this is a great example of Canadian sci-fi at its best.

However, ""Think like a Dinosaur"" stands in a league of its own. Never have I thought so much about an episode of a sci-fi series. The greatest aspect of this episode is its ability to elicit intense introspection; to imagine yourself in the protagonist's shoes and know you must make such a difficult decision. The clear, warming humanity of the ""unbalanced equation"" is overwhelming, which is why the choice is so painful. The ending still gives me chills. Imagine what the protagonist must be feeling when he sees her again. This episode is a brilliant depiction of morality and ethics clashing with science.

This show used some old ideas and some truly original ideas.<br/><br/>I still cannot believe Jonathan Glassner and brad wright did this. Those guys were producers on stargate sg-1. The show kept the audience entrenched in the story and set a truly scary atmosphere. This is what was not there in the new twilight zone. Rod serling coming in added to the scariness, forest coming in lightened the mood. <br/><br/>The ending whether good or bad made for a scary time. You could never predict what was going to happen.

1834,The Outer Limits, Stretching Imagination,"I can be a bit of a sucker sometimes for anthologies, I always love the fact that they have as many stories as you want, it's true that quantity doesn't always equal a great amount of quality, but sometimes quality really does help.<br/><br/>This is another sci-fi gem I think is under the radar. Yeah I know I lot of people say, this revival isn't as good as the original; but lets face it it's a tough act to follow. What I really like about this version of the anthology is isn't trying to one up it's predecessor, but it's trying to simply do it's own thing while staying true to the spirit at the same time, which I feel is what a good revival should do. I remember seeing this show when I was about 12 so in a way this show is one of the final relics of my childhood at it's end, also if it wasn't for this show I never would of known entirely about the original. It was also to me one of the last really good anthologies before they became a lost practice, not to say there aren't anymore but they've became few and far between.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things I feel this revival has going for it. I really like the theme song which I think is very good and memorable, it has a really eerie and spooky tone to it. The production value I thought was on par, it was done on a higher budget but it was used well. From the make up of the aliens/monsters, certain special visual effects which hold up, well may'be not all some CGI effects do look dated.<br/><br/>The pacing I personally thought was better, each of the stories like it's predecessor are an hour long but I hardly noticed the time. I really liked the into narrator, he has that storyteller tone which is both wise and kinda creepy.<br/><br/>Even liked the use of cast members, each of them were a mixed bag from unknowns, experienced actors/minor leaguers you might have seen here and there, and some familiar faces from TV shows or movie you might know about. Each of them are different ages and I like that they all look like regular people, which I like because it makes them more easier to emphasize or relate to, than anyone from the CW whom look ridiculously good.<br/><br/>And this show has a lot of good and memorable stories. It's true this show does have a lot of bad apples, but that's the same fundamental truth about most other anthologies out there, it's a matter of sorting out the bad ones in order to find the really good ones, and the good ones really are tasty. I really like how most of them are morality tales that really do deal with the fallibility's of man and science, the danger of uncontrolled progress, conflict between man and mechanization, fear of what is unknown or what we don't understand, and the importance of being human and humanity triumphing.<br/><br/>There are plenty of memorable stories, I'll let you make your own lists and be the judge of them. But then again that's the point of most of these anthologies anyway. A couple of them for me are one ""Stream of Conciness"" which was about an internet technology completely running the show and books and literacy have became almost obsolete. Another which is my favorite one ""Tribunal"" which is an emotional story on a lawyer (played well by Saul Yurik from TV's ""Warehouse 13"") traveling in time to gather sufficient evidence, to try and convict a wanted Nazi.<br/><br/>Overall this show was a solid sci-fi, I wouldn't mind another revival, or at least some other anthology based on sci-fi to form. Anthologies are something the sci-fi community needs more of right now. Like any story in an anthology this show is worth checking out.<br/><br/>Rating: 3 and a half stars",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,7 March 2014
1835,The Outer Limits, Watchable in part,"But the show has nothing on the original. While the original may have been low-budget and often hokey, it always held the attention. It also was notable for adapting several popular sci-fi stories of the era. The new show appears slightly higher in budget, but often the episodes run out of gas long before they should. The show sports some familiar faces (C. Thomas Howell is an example) but it is not presented with the intensity and passion of the original. At least there are a lot of episodes to sort through, as this version was on the air considerably longer than the original.

1836,The Outer Limits," Uneven, Doom and Gloom Series","One of the stand-out features of the original Outer Limits series was the consistency of good writing. Oh, there were some bad episodes like the one with the telepathic rocks, but overall it was an amazing achievement in science fiction.<br/><br/>The New Outer Limits saw just the reverse. Mainly, the episodes were formula and, where the endings in the original series brought hope, the new series primarily brought doom and destruction. The reason for this comes from a lack of writing skills. Science fiction writing is like writing mysteries. Of course, there are always the murder shows where the killer gets away with it, but then there is the clever side, as with Columbo or Agatha Christie, where the writer creates a difficult situation, but has figured out how to resolve it in the end. The endings in the New Outer Limits were, for the most part, unresolved and left the viewer with a sense of despair.<br/><br/>There were a few exceptions, though. One was entitled, ""Tribunal"" and told how a man used a time watch to go back to Nazi Germany to a concentration camp, to try and save his half sister from certain death. It is a four handkerchief ending.<br/><br/>In another brilliant episode entitled ""A Stitch in Time"", Amada Plummer uses a time machine to go back in time and eliminate serial killers before they ever killed. Each trip back to a rewritten present slams a lifetime of memories into her head, causing brain damage, a concept ""borrowed"" for the film, ""The Butterfly Effect"".<br/><br/>Finally, in an episode entitled, ""Think like a Dinosaur"", the concept of what happens to you when you are teleported is measured to the extreme. Perhaps inspired by the Star Trek Next Generation episode where Will Riker is split into two separate persons by a transporter beam, each of which go on to lead two distinct and separate lives, something goes wrong with the teleporter and the original is not destroyed but revived. So which one is actually real? While one of the doom and gloom episodes, this one still raises enough questions as to the nature of the human soul that it manages to transcend the poor resolution of circumstances at the end.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that the New OUter Limits more closely resembled the original Twilight Zone than the series whence it derived its name.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,,26 October 2005
1837,The Outer Limits, We Can Deluge You With A Thousand Channels,"In the mid-'90's, B.B.C.-2 screened 'The Outer Limits' in the slot vacated by the ratings-busting first season of 'The X-Files'. They gave it a 'Radio Times' cover and loads of publicity, but unfortunately shot themselves in the foot by opening with the execrable 'Blood Brothers' instead of the excellent pilot episode 'Sandkings'. Ratings plummeted, and the show eventually disappeared. It was a shame because 'Outer' had some good stories, special effects and performances to offer. By far the best episode was 'A Stitch In Time' in which Amanda Plummer played a time-travelling scientist who executes the men who will one day become serial killers. On the down side, the show featured gratuitous nudity and sex ( particularly 'Caught In The Act' ), something the original managed to do without. A number of episodes from the old show were remade; 'I, Robot' was passable, but the less said about 'The Inheritors' the better.

1839,The Outer Limits, A Sad Commentary On Our Times,"When I was growing up, the two great sources of what for me was ""real"" science fiction was the Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits. Some of those episodes just creeped me out, and years later, they still do. While the Twilight Zone occasionally had morals to its stories, the Outer Limits stories were more often an exercise in fear and terror, bereft of any moral.<br/><br/>This was because the stories created by the chief writer of the Outer Limits was going through psychological problems of his own, and the stories that he wrote came to him in his car as he drove along. Had his psychologist been more successful, the earlier Outer Limits would probably be like the dribble that is the new Outer Limits today.<br/><br/>Some how all the terror has been leached away and what we see are a series of predictable episodes that have ham-fisted morals that fit right in with the cynical '90s. There are only a few basic themes in the new version, and all the rest is just a predictable variation of ""virus destroys all but a few people,"" ""Mankind is bad and must be dealt with"" (by alien or androids-- it changes each week), ""Don't watch out or what you create may end up controlling you,"" and a few other limited themes. There was nothing really new here.<br/><br/>And to make the series all the more depressing was that nobody ever on. The good guy/hero thinks he does but no! -- he dies, everybody dies, and then there's the moral. It's '90s cynicism that's just there to hammer down dull, and downbeat episodes where almost nobody ever comes out alive and happy.<br/><br/>While 90 per cent of the episodes are a waste of time, there are a few good ones; you just have to sit and wade through all of the crappy ones to find a good one. For good science fiction, go and buy the videos or DVDs of the original series; those will either terrify you or give you things to think about. Unlike with the new series where you've seen a few, you pretty much have seen them all, with the originals they are all uniquely different from the others.",6 out of 13 found this helpful.,,10 October 2004

If you are a fan of SF The Outer Limits reincarnation in the 90's was a welcome treat, and provided a forum for some of the best writers in the industry. The pilot episode 'Sandkings' by George R.R. Martin was spectacular, as was 'Inconstant Moon' by Larry Niven and 'Think Like A Dinosaur' by James Patrick Kelly. My only complaint/criticism of the series was the overall editorial slant. Nearly all the stories were anti-technology/anti-science/anti-human. Not that they weren't entertaining, but overall they were very depressing and self-loathing. The 'party line' seemed to be Humans are Evil and they will be destroyed by their own arrogance and lack of humility. The original Outer Limits from the 60's had a few of these, but the vast majority of them were positive.

1841,The Outer Limits," ""Think like a Dinosaur""","""Think like a Dinosaur"" was an well-produced &amp; executed show of the -Outerlimits- series. The actor (Enrico Colantoni as Michael Burr) plays an impressively well and convincing protagonist-role. You can actually identify yourself with him and his 'introspective' feelings on what to do to the girl whom he has fallen for (because, he's been alone and disappointed for 2 years and feels hopeless until ""Kamala"" comes to his life with a timid fear of performing the task of being transported. He then consoles her and let's her know it's all going to be alright; which ends up being an deception to both of them. More so something bad occurs and she (prototype) comes back....and her (clone) is sent to the other inhabitant planet. Although, the -Dino- and ""Micheal"" have yet to find this out, when they do it's up to Michael to decide to either kill her or to let her live. Yet what happen to him prior upon meeting her (kamala) was very much related to what happen to his wife, his wife died similarly. This show professes irregularity and sorrow thru-out most of it. After the show you're left pondering...about what SHOULD have been done and you're stuck with the 50/50 of what's right from wrong.

1843,The Outer Limits, An Honest Review,"It was kind of all over the place wasn't it?<br/><br/>It wasn't the best show out there, but it had it's moments and when those moments came it was far better than the X-Files.<br/><br/>Unlike the Twilight Zone revivals that lost the moralistic bent, the 90s revival sort of brought it back in full swing and made it feel more like a Twilight Zone revival than an Outer Limits Revival, but let's be honest, the Outer Limits was kind of just a continuation under a different name with more of a lean towards science fiction.<br/><br/>It also does a good job of staying within the genre of science fiction which is something that you scarcely see in shows post Alien when it started to meld into horror as well. So what you get is less X-Files and more pure Sci-Fi, which, by the 90s was refreshing.<br/><br/>However the quality of the story telling was hit or miss. You can compare it to Tales From the Crypt, another Anthology from about the same time, or the Hitch Hiker, which were both solid for nearly every episode.<br/><br/>The 90s revival of the Outer Limits wasn't as solid. You had some episodes that would blow your hair back, some that would entertain and nothing else, and those were about equal to the ones that just kind of fell flat.<br/><br/>But, they didn't want to mix genres, they wanted to keep it more pure sci-fi, so it's hard to fault them for having so many misses in an Anthology series that tried so hard to stay true to the genre.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,12 October 2020

1845,Vinyl, Very sorry that HBO has killed this outstanding show. The negative reviews here are quite unfair.,"Some people here imply that good reviews on IMDb are paid critiques. Well I hope somebody paid me to write TV shows reviews, but it is not the case.<br/><br/>I liked this show a lot and I regret that HBO has decided to kill it after a great first season.<br/><br/>Many people complain of a clichéd depiction of the rock and roll 70s, with all the drugs, the sex, the deals and rising stars. Clichés come up in the first place because they represent an established perception or behavior, so if you set the action right at the time when those behaviors were taking shape, you can't really find fault at this. It is as if you watched a movie about the Belle Epoque and you complained that women look like flappers. It's simply not fair.<br/><br/>I also find negative reviews are quite contradictory. While some say they have been bored, others point that the frantic atmosphere is excessive or that there are many parallel plot lines.<br/><br/>I get the feeling that just because many people (myself included) lived through that period, they all consider they own the ""real truth"" about rock-and-roll and the 70s, and so they tend to measure up the show against their own memories or experiences, and they suppose the series should have reflected their subjective imprint about the time and the culture. This is also not fair.<br/><br/>I liked the show quite much. The talented and experienced people who set their hands on the show did a fantastic job, the music, story, characters and performances were above standard from every point of view.<br/><br/>Also, the cast was magnificent, particularly Bobby Cannavale whose performative skills I have come to appreciate, having seen him on Nurse Jackie and Boardwalk Empire. He is an extraordinary actor who filled the role and even offered more.<br/><br/>If you are open-minded and fair, if you trust on the great team involved in The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire and other outstanding shows, please give this a try. Yes, there are drugs, sex, rock and roll, and excess everywhere, and the embrionary stages of the recording label industry which, in later years, would destroy the music we loved.

1848,Vinyl, Haters Have Missed the Point,"Let's be clear. This show is NOT an attempt in social realism. Nor, is it trying to present the viewer with an accurately documented history of the biggest rock stars of the 70's or actual industry insiders. <br/><br/>What it does do, is take an interesting idea, create fictional characters and look at how they behave and react against each other, while referencing real performers from the period. Vinyl is no more of an attempt to convince its audience that what it portrays really happened than say House of Cards is in presenting a factually accurate representation of a US President or the American political system. Once you accept that, you can sit back and enjoy the real story. It is the story of a 'record man', Richie, and his conflicts, his demons, his dreams, his selfishness and his inability to seemingly make any good choices. The characters, like the clothes from the period are flamboyant and loud and colourful. Clichéd? Sometimes yes, and that is partly why it does work. This is not straight a rock 'n roll drama, how could it be with so many interwoven scenes where 'stream of consciousness' musical performances suddenly interrupt the plot? There is plenty of humour here too - perhaps a nod from the creators that they don't take it all too seriously. There is also some subtle and clever historical references (no spoilers), such as a throwaway comment about a food buffet while Mamma Cass is in a background scene, and a scene following a Vegas performance where a clearly unwell but pre-heart attack Elvis rubs at his left arm. <br/><br/>It does not really matter that the rock stars portrayed do not mirror their real life counterparts as some reviewers on here seem to get upset about. They are incidental to the overall story and if the creators of this show had focused on that then this would have been a story about the greats of the 1970's music scene. Instead, we have something better, a fictionalised story that is set amidst the 1970's music scene.

1851,Vinyl, Brilliant fusion of styles,"The dark, organized criminal setting of Martin Scorsese is infused with the gritty, rock and roll ambiance of Mick Jagger.<br/><br/>The editing, cinematography, and music in the show are all spectacular. While Vinyl does clearly rely heavily on this sense of style (which it excels in due to amazing production values), it also does feature a compelling story set around the diverse and evolving music industry in NYC during the 1970's.<br/><br/>Bobby Cannavale is fantastic as Richie Finesta, a record company executive who began his career in the music industry because of his love of music which in turn gave him a good ear for talent. However the greedy, dehumanizing elements of the corporate aspect of the industry have disenchanted Richie to the point where he now views musicians merely as products. <br/><br/>The trials he faces as a business man in the music industry are interesting to behold, from loudmouth rock stars to borderline crazy, drug- addicted radio personalities, to foreign business partners.<br/><br/>The corporate side of the industry is contrasted well with the artistic nature of the music itself. The powerful and inspirational effects of good music are demonstrated in a flawless fashion during a few distinct scenes. Crowds go wild to the revolutionary sound that was the epoch of punk rock. <br/><br/>The concept of being ""in it for the music"" vs ""selling out"" is also a reoccurring theme seen in Vinyl. The heart and soul of a good musician longing to sing the blues outweighs the temptation of selling out to a big record company. Richie's thrill of discovering new and exciting artists is at odds with his plan to sell his record company. <br/><br/>The themes depicted in the pilot episode of Vinyl are exciting and clearly come from an experienced eye (Jagger's). This makes the show all the more exciting to behold. Only time will tell if they are built upon in a manner as compelling as that seen in the premiere.",70 out of 113 found this helpful.,10.0,19 February 2016
1852,Vinyl, There is hope somewhere,"Vinyl, A New York music executive in the 1970s hustles to make a career out of the city's diverse music scene. Created by Rich Cohen, Mick Jagger and Martin Scorsese you wouldn't think it could go wrong. Ah, but it does. I can forgive the inaccuracies. This isn't a documentary even though real life musicians are depicted. It has that loose fast pace the Scorsese is know for, which I adore. The biggest problem is the budget. 30 mil on the first episode? The problem may be the use of so much copyrighted material and people. DJ Kool Herc is presently suing because they used his likeness without permission. ($10,000 just isn't enough, eh?) If you don't know who he is unfriend me now. How can they carry on with the average 7.5 per episode? To top it off Casey Bloys is the new head of programming at HBO and BOOM, Vinyl gets the boot. Coincidence? Maybe. Rarely do series succeed in the beginning (Seinfeld had terrible first season ratings). But this could have blossomed into something epic. Maybe it will get picked up by someone else with a big budget vision. A girl can dream.",21 out of 30 found this helpful.,8.0,26 July 2016

1855,Vinyl, Great Acting and Music!,I loved this show. I just subscribed to HBO because of this show and after bingeing on it discovered it is not renewed. I'm really disappointed. I loved the music and the acting. I grew up in the 70's and it really takes me back (to the music). Loved it!

1856,Vinyl, Inauthentic and disappointing,"I wanted to like Vinyl. It's my time period. I was 20 in 1973 and very involved with local music and musicians. But Vinyl is not really about the music of 1973. It is about out of touch record executives scheming to find the next person they can screw, both literally and figuratively. So much of it seems like a parody of 1973 rather than reality. The scenes with the German Polygram executives seemed straight out of Fawlty Towers (""Don't mention the war""). The treatment of the Lester Grimes character is pretty much criminal for a man who is supposed to be able to spot talent. Too much name dropping - e.g. constant references in the first episode to Led Zeppelin, and a painfully awkward scene backstage with a preening Robert Plant. The cocaine use seems like simply part of the required checklist - after all it is New York in the 70s. Have to include massive amounts of coke, right? The acting is uniformly good. The sets are great and costuming nearly perfect. Hairstyles are embarrassingly accurate. (Check out one guy's mutton-chop sideburns.) But for all the surface perfection, Vinyl feels hollow and inauthentic. Nothing but the anarchic punk club scene seemed anything like reality to me. And that seemed to come right out of Sid and Nancy. Beautifully done but ultimately empty and disappointing.",65 out of 124 found this helpful.,5.0,16 February 2016
1857,Vinyl," Clichéd, tired, rocksploitation","Simply put - it's clichéd, tired, nostalgia-porn. It's got a checklist for a screenplay, a long list of things that the pilot needed to have - basically a list of nostalgia/rock 'n roll checkboxes, some Scorsese ones and the obligatory HBO ones.<br/><br/>This is the checklist: 1. Drugs - lots of it. Adds nothing to the story. Peaky Blinders had drug use, Mad Men had it, Breaking Bad had it. Here, it's forced and given too much attention. Vinyl tries to be edgy with something that already gets tons of screen time and hasn't been taboo on the screen or off for a long time. Check.<br/><br/>2. Sex. HBO style sex. Sex for no purpose. It's bad. GoT's Littlefinger teaching his prostitutes how to fake an orgasm bad. Again, sex on TV is not new or taboo. It's not edgy. You wanna know how bad it is? The executives have a meeting in an orgy. They're all dressed, having drinks at a table in the middle of a 30+ person orgy. It's so fake and forced. Seeking controversy for controversy's sake. Check.<br/><br/>With both the sex and the drugs - a strong story doesn't care what people think. This one cares too much and tries to hard.<br/><br/>3. Trashing an apartment. A record executive smashes his guitar on the TV screen. For no reason. Check.<br/><br/>4. A building collapses during a concert. The protagonist just happens to be there. Check.<br/><br/>5. Backstage dealings. Check.<br/><br/>6. Private plane. Check.<br/><br/>7. Lavish party. Check.<br/><br/>8. Woodstock reference despite no connection to story. Check.<br/><br/>9. Mafia-style beating of an artist. Check.<br/><br/>10. A drug-induced, Wolf of Wall Street type slapstick fight. (Kitchen scene: ""Get off the phone"") 11. Mad Men's Peggy Olson trying to make her way up the corporate ladder from sandwich girl to A&amp;R. Check.<br/><br/>12. Marital problems with the protagonist over his substance abuse. Check.<br/><br/>13. Stage diving/band fights the audience. Check.<br/><br/>14. Record company screwing over an artist. Check.<br/><br/>15. Record company employee (sandwich girl) not only sleeping with new band frontman, but literally inventing the very ethos of punk during pillow talk.<br/><br/>16. People talking about music and nothing else. - ""When I was a kid, I used to pretend my mum's broom was a guitar."" No one talks about anything else but music, barely any politics, art scene, fashion, sports, club scene, etc. Don't people like anything else? I could keep going. These things are barely connected to each other. It's just a list of targets the screenplay needed to meet rather than a genuine story.<br/><br/>The problem is that these things I just mentioned are treated as themes rather than events with significance. So it's filled with themes and nostalgia, but little story. It's incredibly boring.<br/><br/>It misses the point of rock music entirely.<br/><br/>It shows rock as an insider club, one of VIP sections, private planes, money and lavish lifestyles. Yet rock is the music of outsiders, outcasts, people who have no where else to turn. Even successful rock artists, despite making it, still feel like successful outsiders.<br/><br/>They are outsiders and outcasts to their parents, authorities, church groups and so on. There were regular protests against rock concerts and albums, but this show treats rock as mainstream.<br/><br/>It conflates the counter-cultural art movement with the subverted, appropriated, mainstream idea of rock.<br/><br/>So many missed opportunities.<br/><br/>For a show filled with talented and artistic people, there is so little comedy.<br/><br/>The music performances on the show are too long and boring. I don't mind music segments in shows, but these moments are an opportunity to show a montage, to tell a story. One can use the lyrics to tell events that are happening (Breaking Bad: Negra y Azul: The Ballad of Heisenberg) or allude to themes and emotions indirectly (artist sings about his own lover, but it sounds as if film protagonist addressing his wife) But playing music and showing the artist playing the song is just boring. It does not move the story in any direction nor set the mood. This is done several times. It's just a waste of time.<br/><br/>The 4 stars I gave it are for its technical merits.<br/><br/>Data shows that after watching 3 episodes, one is supposed to be hooked on the show. I've watched the equivalent of 3 episodes (2 hours = 2.7 episodes of 44 minutes) and I sincerely don't care. I won't watch the rest.<br/><br/>It is a parody of the times, a parody of HBO and Scorsese's works, checklist and target driven rather than story, event and character driven.<br/><br/>It is the worst kind of rocksploitation. A must watch for anyone wanting to make something similar to avoid all the pitfalls.",96 out of 190 found this helpful.,4.0,17 February 2016
1858,Vinyl, Absolutely Love this!,I just had a look at the reviews and was surprised to see so many negatives. I think it's a great show and put it up there with GOT and Breaking Bad. I can't wait for the next episode each time and it never fails to disappoint. As for the main character's acting skills - I think they're great. Can't fault him. Someone suggested he was overacting but he's meant to be when he's high on cocaine. He's meant to be hyper and he plays it brilliantly. Each to his own though I guess - just glad that overall the ratings are high as it seriously deserves it. I like the nostalgia as well - you really feel as though you've stepped back into the 70's. The soundtrack throughout is great as well - there's a real diversity. The only thing I would say as a negative comment is the musical intro each time is horrendous. We scramble to the skip button - it's just a din. Bit of an opportunity missed there maybe. They could have had a good hit on their hands if they'd made a good intro track. Just saying! I heard that it might have a second series - hope so.,13 out of 20 found this helpful.,10.0,15 April 2016
1859,Vinyl, Convoluted Crap,"There were many teasing hints all through the show of fantastic music artists but I was left unsatisfied with obscure references and small bits of songs that I wished would play longer. The only thing that stood out for me was Led Zeppelin, Donny Osmond and Lester Grimes. I was never sure what, if any, artists were actually signed on with this guys label.<br/><br/>I had a hard time following the flashbacks and what was going on with sale of American Century to PolyGram. I felt the drug scenes were misrepresented and the whole atmosphere of the 70's music boom should have had more perspective from the audience of that era.<br/><br/>I was disgusted and irritated with the characters of Joe Corso and Frank ""Buck"" Rogers who weren't even fun to hate. Bobby Cannavale was good as Richie Finestra but he looked like he was staggering around getting ready for a big blow up that seemed to fall flat when it finally happened.<br/><br/>Loved the blues song performed by Ato Essandoh, but it was the only thing that gave me chills. Having grown up in the 70's, music was a huge part of my life and I was looking forward to more kick-ass hit songs that would have given me that awesome nostalgia that only music can offer. But it never came and I stopped watching in the middle of the scene when Buck Rogers gets his face bashed in. I find this type of graphic and gratuitous violence unnecessary and sadistic and does not lend itself to the entertainment value of film making. Too bad I was left with the image of it in my head this morning. Otherwise I might not have written this bad review and would have given ""Vinyl"" another chance.",61 out of 117 found this helpful.,4.0,15 February 2016
1860,Vinyl, Scorsese Cranks up the Volume,"The long anticipated return of the Scorsese/Winter collaboration that gave us the genius of ""Boardwalk Empire"" and culminated with a new motion picture classic ""The Wolf of Wall Street"". They both return to tell the story of the dawn of the Punk scene in NYC, and the one record producer who saw it all. This Pilot episode recounts his fall from grace, and the moment in which his journey to redemption begins. From the early days of managing a blues singer, to the worst Led Zepplin deal of the century. Everything goes to hell by the end, only until he discovers the New York Dolls in a dingy rocker club. Just think, do you remember the time when you discovered a song that you really loved? The euphoria you felt? How you danced to it? Times that by a thousand, and you'll know how Richie Finestra felt. <br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of a film.. but it's not a film, it's the pilot to a new HBO series. To say that I'm hooked would be a total understatement. It just doesn't get any better than this. Scorsese and Winter are the duo of the decade. Just as we last saw them on ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", the editing, dialogue and storytelling is fast and loose. It's total chaos. Instead of sex and drugs, this time, it's music and drugs. It's vulgar, and proud of it. Bobby Cannavale is a damn hero. He is acting his heart out, with every last drag of his cigarette. Olivia Wilde shines as Richie's very beautiful, and very battered wife of his. Ray Romano is hysterical as Zak Yankovich, Richie's obnoxious head of promotions at American Century. The shining star of this episode, however, is Andrew Dice Clay as ""Buck Rodgers"", renowned radio owner and coke-binging psychopath. A climactic scene at Buck's house, which appears near the 90 minute mark of the pilot, is perhaps the funniest, craziest, musically genius scene i've seen since Dirk Diggler's drug deal in ""Boogie Nights"". <br/><br/>My praise doesn't get much higher than that. I'm ready for whatever this show is about to throw at me. Bring it on. Vinyl Rocks.",35 out of 64 found this helpful.,10.0,20 February 2016
1861,Vinyl, Keeping the Beat,"Now here's a show that comes at you like a bullet being fired into your face by a Magnum 45. Scorsese, Jagger, and Winter are all tied up with this hard hitting drama about sex, violence, and rock n roll in that classically Scorsese way.<br/><br/>Richie Finestra (Bobby Cannavale) is a coked-out-of-his-mind Scorsese archetype, but this isn't your typical Scorsese outing. This is a story about the underbelly of the music industry, and the blood and guts it takes to get ahead. Jagger and Scorsese both lived in this world of 1970s fight-the-establishment-rock-n-roll-lifestyle, and ""Vinyl"" captures that vibe and beat from the moment the needle drops on the first episode, to the final song on the last playlist in the season finale. <br/><br/>""Vinyl"" follows a cocky records man named Richie Finestra, who chooses to not sell his company to a willing European conglomerate over plain prejudice, and blind rebellion. What ensues is a chaotic whirlwind of cause and effect, attributed to the faults of Finestra's deepest weakness: ego. But this isn't the story of the misunderstood monster, so much as its a story of bold entrepreneurship, and the dangers that come with artistic integrity and going at it on your own.<br/><br/>Bobby Cannavale has a raw acting quality that is perfect for a Scorsese lead, and reminds me of a young Marlon Brando; I mean the Brando of films like ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" and ""On the Waterfront."" There's some sort of star making quality there, and Cannavale sells the shows dramatic chops so effortlessly. By the end of the season, he really makes Richie Finestra into a great TV legend, like Walter White, or Sherlock Holmes (the Cumberbatch version), or Don Draper, or Frank Underwood. <br/><br/>This is definitely not a soap opera with lame characters. Often, ""Vinyl"" is insanely addictive to watch, and every episode pushes the story to unsuspecting arch's or twists. I am not shitting you when I say that I was enormously intrigued by how the characters talked and acted, and was still shocked to have the rug pulled out from underneath me when I least expected it.<br/><br/>""Vinyl"" has a lot to offer in its first season, but it also leaves a lot to be desired, which is a good thing, as I feel many shows often try to say what they have to within their first season out of fear of not getting another chance. But Scorsese, Jagger, and Winter are all veteran talents, and consistently prove that with their good handle on great writing, directing and overall showmanship.

1862,Vinyl," ""Let's list every 70's rock cliché you can think of and then weave a script around it.""","Record boss Richie Finestra (Bobby Cannavale) senses his company is on the brink of bankruptcy due to poor sales and failing acts, but salivation may be at hand via a buy out from a German record company. However that might be the least of his problems...<br/><br/>This is a mishmash of fact, fiction, fable and myth and not a documentary. For a start The New York Dolls seem to be very popular (as if!) and punk rock seems to have happened years before it did. Fine, but Peter Grant supported Led Zep and didn't take second best for them. He got loud when he needed to, but he wasn't the bull-in-a-china-shop shown here.<br/><br/>(Don't get me started on the guy playing Robert Plant's accent!)<br/><br/>How many times do we want to hear the same stories/clichés about rock and roll? While I love it, you have to say it is a bit pathetic in print. Alexander The Great conquered the most of the known world by the time he was thirty, Keith Richards - meanwhile - had written Satisfaction and stuck lots of needles in his arms.<br/><br/>To return to the plot. Between the clichés Cannavale chews a lot of curtains about what is going to happen to others. The man has a heart - or is it more of a heart than the other sharks and pimps?<br/><br/>The central problem with flashback is that when the actor is already middle-aged you have to think he would be a pensioner by the time the seventies rolled around. Is Cannavale the best casting they could do? Corruption and creative accounting are popular in the entertainment industry, but few people in it are actually morons. The Germans would look at the books and know what they are buying. They might not be as good with hookers, coke and making rock, but they can read an account book.<br/><br/>In all pilots various cans of worms are opened hoping that the money (HBO) will be intrigued and see millage. Few of them are anything to do with music or entertainment, because the behind-the-scenes industry isn't really that sexy or that interesting. The product is - but the people behind it are just people with computers sitting behind desks. They may like a bit of blow - but who really cares?",68 out of 135 found this helpful.,,16 February 2016
1863,Vinyl, A rocking' tale of one man's downward spiral during the heady days of the New York music scene during the early 1970s,"I have no real criticisms of this production. It's a tale of excessive cocaine use by a music executive and his downward spiral, which sports a beautiful array of gravitational incidents of both luck and ill luck, and very human fallibility that portrait the lead as basically a good enough fellow, though when he does something underhand the viewer is suitably and entertainingly dumbstruck by both his stupidity and his bravado. But his aim is not underhand, and a genuine love of music, and to save his company as a beacon of that music, always shines through sufficiently to help us want to watch the next episode.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is beautiful. I personally loved the raw power of both the blues-man and the punk rocker the lead takes under his belt. New and old, the soundtrack is sophisticated and, though a tad incongruent and perhaps not always the best choice for an overlay (though usually it is), it is refreshing and also entertaining.<br/><br/>I read some reviews that criticize the acting. The acting is brilliant. It's HBO. The characters are complicated and well-portrayed.<br/><br/>It's odd that a story of addiction and its consequences should rivet such interest, but, like other good movies such as Blow, Scarface and Goodfellas, it does. The production is also big budget quality.<br/><br/>My only small criticism is perhaps the cover of the DVD box, which radiates a certain serenity amid chaos and is misleading. There is no serenity and the chaos is the fun with this show. It's a tale about music and if one is a music lover you should really enjoy this.

I just voted 9/10 and i had to give some moments to the thought of this being a 10. Well, it's not. But it worth it thinking about it. This could be a 10, it still can. The plot is fresh and revival. There is a concern with the history, the characters, the choosing of actors, the music...and so on... Someone wrote here that Breaking Bad had already used the drugs theme, well... this is not about drugs, but it would be definitely inaccurate to tell this story without mentioning cocaine, and i mean lots of it! This show is about the Belle Époque of the music and the transition of the art scenario. Of course there is a leading figure, and of course he snorts, and he's on decadency, he's a loser! He has all in the beginning of the show and on the running of 6 episodes he finds himself with nothing. So the show is not only about the 70's music environment but also about a protagonist with features of the 70's characters. I think this deserves an applause!

1866,Vinyl, It's funny that a series about chart/sales rigging and payola uses IMDb rigging to get a high score,"After 1 episode, 30% of viewers gave it 10/10? And 30% gave it 9/10? Really? 60% of people think this is a 9/10 or 10/10 show? 1 episode in? I've been checking the ratings every week and it's incredibly suspicious. Reviewers are giving it bad reviews on blogs and newspapers, users are giving it low scores, but somehow this is an 8.2/10 show? Shows that get 8 stars and above don't have the distribution of stars that this show has. Any show or film that has a high rating would not have such a high distribution of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 star ratings. For example, Breaking Bad, rated 9.5 on this site, has in its 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 star ratings: 0.2%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.5% and 0.9%. Vinyl has 1.3%, 1.5%, 2%, 2.7%, 3.7%. Check any show on this site with high ratings and 100k+ votes. The 2 - 5 star buckets do not go above 1%. The 1 star bucket is always high because haters gotta hate and rate as low as they can go, but when a show is getting sincerely poor ratings of sensible people giving it 2 - 5 stars, that tells you something.<br/><br/>This show glorifies payola and chart and sales rigging. It would not be a surprise to me that they would employ similar methods on IMDb. Art becomes life.<br/><br/>Onto my review: The show is simply not good. There are many great reviews on the user review section explaining the pitfalls and failures of this show, but many of those were reviewing the first double-episode. It's sad to say that 4 episodes in, things only got worse. The first double-episode has a whole list of clichés, of a story not following events by a checklist of random scenes held together by almost nothing at all. The next few episodes did not improve the situation. While the first episode was explosive and rock 'n roll, clichéd as it may be, the next 3 episodes did not keep that level of intensity, but did not use the slow-down to tell a story, but became style without substance.<br/><br/>Episode 4 had these events - Richie schmoozing his clients for half the episode, his wife talking to a divorce lawyer, clients waiting in the waiting room then getting an agent, the newly-hired agent discussing terms with Richie and one of the guys running the sales scam. There's also a 5 minute Christmas song and another 5 minutes for a live funk song. Most of the episode has Richie lounging in his office, drinking and doing coke with different people.<br/><br/>We're 4 episodes in and we're already in filler territory.<br/><br/>This show is incredibly poor and there's no end in sight.",51 out of 104 found this helpful.,3.0,7 March 2016
1867,Vinyl, Excellent depiction of the music scene in the early seventies,"This series is set in the early seventies when music was going through a few changes. Lead man is Richie Finestra who is head of American Century – a record company with an impressive stable that includes a few names you may remember and includes some real greats and some others like Donny Osmond. He is a man with a taste for music but also the hedonistic lifestyle that can only be described as excess.<br/><br/>From the start though it is as fast paced as a thrash metal gig on amphetamines. The recreation of a New York Dolls gig was simply joyous and the actor playing Bowie totally convincing and there is also a treat for Led Zeppelin fans. The story deals with the main player's private lives, the financial woes and the double deals and shenanigans that helped to get their 'artists' into the charts and stay there. If there was a dearth of talent then they simply changed the rules until the real deal came along.<br/><br/>We also have the burgeoning of the Punk scene as well as disco and all the fabulous fashions. This is big hair, wide flairs. Collars that you could hang glide with and centre partings galore. The acting is all brilliant, the period detail is spot on and the plot is one of the most compelling I have ever seen. The pilot is two hours alone and I watched it and the next three episodes back to back and was absolutely buzzing at the end. There is going to be a second series and I am already looking forward to it like a five year old does Christmas. I just can't rave enough about this and guarantee it will move you.

It went nowhere. Things got slightly better about half way through the second hour. This story is so confusing and cliché ridden, I found it stupefying when it should have been exciting. The one-dimensional characters go about their business, but who cares? Scorsese found a way to make the early 70s drug-fueled music scene, dull. There is just one implausible scene after another. Even Richie Finestra's wife, played by the gorgeous Olivia Wilde, has nothing going on and speaks in clichéd sentences.

If anybody would talk to me like that, or being in my face all the time, I would just be in a fight every single episode. So to me it's all acting and I don't get why they chose that concept. The challenges are sometimes pretty stupid as well. I would rather watch them tattoo a lot more, with a lot lesser arguing. Some of the artists are also very arrogant and even if some are good I certainly never would go to any of those arrogant bastards. I have a lot of tattoo's and all of the artists I went to were friendly guys. Anyways, if you like tattoo's then the show is worth a watch. But don't watch it for the judges or the game itself because that's pretty boring. I don't even care who's winning, I just want to see nice tattoo's.",23 out of 25 found this helpful.,6.0,17 May 2016

1871,Ink Master, Gone from about tattoos to about drama,"The first season, I really liked this show. It was about a tattoo competition. Some of the ink was even good but even when it wasn't it was focused on the art.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, things began to go down hill in the second season. One of the judges, Chris Nunez, became snarkier and snarkier. He seemed to be trying to humiliate and put down the contestants who didn't measure up rather than pull them up to do even better.<br/><br/>Each season, there was a jerk added to the mix. They were someone who would try to ""play the game strategically"" to get ahead. It became very annoying to watch the petty politics and insults.<br/><br/>The show completely jumped the shark when they announced in the fourth season finale that everyone on the show would have a rival, someone brought in to fight with. Great, pre-made arguing. What a joke! That was the death moment of the show. As soon as they announced that contestants are going to be chosen not on the basis of their art work but on the quality of their enemies I knew the show was dead.",25 out of 33 found this helpful.,4.0,3 August 2014

It's just like watching some grown-up people acting like children in the kindergarten. Sometimes it is very hard to avoid the thinking that it is planned. It is just annoying and embarrassing to watch.<br/><br/>3. The judging is ridiculous. Needless to say, it is unacceptable for a competition show. Here, it is clear that it is not only the tattoo that is being judged. There's usually a favorite of the judges, and this person will magically stay among the best of the day repeatedly. It does not matter if the tattoo doesn't meet the criteria of the challenge or if it plainly sucks.<br/><br/>I always had complaints about this show, but kept on watching it for the tattoos...

1873,Ink Master, Predictable and Irritating,"This show definitely has the potential to be entertaining: a series of passionate tattoo artists competing in challenges that are relevant to their art form for a chance to win $10,000 and the title of Ink Master. However, instead of respecting their craft the producers(presumably) have chosen to go in a different direction. Create the same drama every episode over and over and over. It has become the most monotonous TV competition show. They not only show a lack of respect for the art form, they go a step further and display a lack of respect for the competition in general by deliberately breaking their own rules week to week. This is not done in a clever way to incite more tension in the competition. This is done in a way to incite more irritation from the viewers. The judges show extreme favoritism and go a step further to even sabotage other contestants. Bottom line: if you want to watch a show that's about great innovative tattoos this may not be the show for you. But, if you wanna watch a show where judges piggy back on a contestant and watch the others squirm than this is a show for you. I am not a tattoo artist, but I have too much respect for competition in general to be entertained by this garbage. I will not watch this show ever again.",18 out of 23 found this helpful.,3.0,21 May 2014

Unless they change the show to allow for blind judging, this show is completely pointless. In fact the three judges often admit that they are not basing their decisions on that week's tattoo, but a culmination of previous work. What is the point in competing? <br/><br/>...apparently my review won't post in IMDb unless I've written enough information, so let me just say, ""Ink Master"".

1875,Ink Master," Interesting Art, Fake Competition","I have watched every season, and it is down to enjoying the tattoo art process, which is about one third of the show. After the first couple of seasons, it was pretty clear that winning artists are pre-chosen for the final round, and they are going to win no matter how awful their tattoo is on any specific week.<br/><br/>The final episode used to be two hours of these characters just trash talking, and it was impossible to watch. Even at one hour, the final episode every season is the worst one. The giant back tattoos are usually not that good. Whoever made the best full back tattoo never wins. It is by far a rigged competition.<br/><br/>Every season, there are at least two men who are real jerks, and one or two women who are very arrogant and snotty. The rest of the artists in the competition spend their spare time either hating each other, or arguing. The fighting every week makes up about one third of every episode.<br/><br/>The Flash Challenge is some random contest where the competing artists do some totally useless activity, like making houses out of popsicle sticks. This big waste of time takes up the first one third of every episode. Most of the time, if you start watching after 30 minutes, you have not missed much. The best way to watch this show is to view it one week after every episode, and then you can fast forward through all the garbage time, like the flash challenges.<br/><br/>The three judges have very little personality. Dave Navarro used to be a guitarist on Jane's Addiction. He often does not give his opinion at all. He is not a tattoo artist, so the only reason he is on this show is because he is the closest thing to a ""celebrity"" that they could get.

The winner is already selected before the show starts filming. If you're an artist on this show, you have to have a gimmick. If you don't have one, they give you one. If you're a woman, you are going to be sexualized (Tatu Baby for example). They tell these people what to wear and who to start s*** with. If you don't like their games, they will let you know matter-of-factly, that you'll never get another chance to show 4 million people your tattoos...so suck it up. Self-respecting tattoo artist have caught on to this bull**** and are not doing the show. So you get bottom of the barrel type artist who are just trying to get their name out there. Ink Master is a disgrace to the tattoo industry. An already misunderstood industry. Every year all the artist in our shop get the 2-4 emails, asking if they would like to try out for the show. To that we say, kick rocks. I know people who have been on the show and people who have tried out for the show, if you're not loud, rude, cocky, or a woman, you won't make it. They don't give a **** that 90% of the ""human canvas"" participants are going home with crappy tattoos. They just want drama. Also, the fact that they have a spin-off show that allows previous contestants to fix their mistake should say something to you.

I can't stand the bit**ing and nasty contestants who came on this show to expose their awful characters rather than really tattoo. The worst season yet is the Fifth one. A bunch of mediocre 'tattoo artists' doing really poor tattoos and getting away with it. Perhaps better ones didn't want to participate in this weak show? I can see only a couple of OK artists: Erik and Josh, the rest is embarrassing themselves....And the judges...Where should I begin? First, they have little to say about the quality of tattoos and the critique panel in the end is a joke. I, as a laywoman, can say things like ""This tattoo has some good tones"", or ""This one lacks depth""...The judges are boring and unfit for the job. Not to mention that Nuniez and Peckh are being accused of harassment by a female crew member. Nasty, nasty, nasty...yawn...There are better shows than this one.

The focus on the actual act of tattoo and the results occupied less than half of the screen time. I will not be watching this show again. <br/><br/>One more note: the enlightened parts of America didn't appreciate your very highly sexualized female canvasses, nor the comment, from your host for gods sake, about wanting a 360 turn from the first woman.

The number of bleeps per episode is irritating; the talent sub par. Is the industry so tapped out that this is the best it has to offer? I also wonder about the psychological stability of the human canvases, many of whom are left with truly ugly, permanent ""artwork"" on their bodies. In the latest episode, these canvases wanted a anatomically-correct human heart morphing into either a lion, clock or hand grenade. Really?

I basically let Hubs put this on and ignore it until I get to see the finished tats, at which point I make up my own mind and then go back to my world, sometimes before they've ""decided"" on a winner and loser.

In one season it was obvious he ""liked"" a female contestant who should have gone home many times but because of Nunez thinking with his little head, she stayed in the competition! Navarro has a few tattoos which doesn't make anyone an expert on tattooing so his opinions are worthless! <br/><br/>Most viewers want to see tattoos but the majority of the show is based around drama and arguments which spoils the show!

1883,Ink Master, If you like watching adults bitch at each other.,"I've watched enough episodes over several seasons now to realise that the tattooing in Ink Master seems to play second fiddle to the bitching, backstabbing and outright bullying that constantly goes on within the show. This is a show about multiple tattoo artists from all over the U.S, competing for the grand prize of $100,000, a feature in Ink Magazine and ""title"" of Ink Master. We're reminded of this every single goddamn time the show airs, and the artists all have to react like they're hearing it for the first time. Also I'm not sure how official the title of ""master"" is, but it's a TV show so, reasons!<br/><br/>Basically artists compete in what they call a Flash Challenge, whereby they are given a set amount of time to show what they can do using their skills as an artist. This Challenge can be anything from painting a design on a helmet, carving, graffitiing a wall or specific use of black &amp; grey and the winner of this challenge not only gets first pick at their human canvas, but also gets to allocate the other guinea pigs to the remaining tattoo artists, deliberately trying making it harder for some in the hope that they'll fail and be eliminated. With the elimination tattoo, artists are given anywhere from 6 hours to 12 hours with which they come up with the best design within the parameters of the set theme, which may be a horror theme, traditional, pin-up girls etc. There's usually a top 2 and a bottom 2, until they get all whittled down to bare-bones and there's only a handful left.<br/><br/>If this were the show in its entirety then I could really get into this and enjoy it, as I like tattoos and the work involved. Some artists fail due to the pressure or lack of experience while others thrive, however some artists may not have the skills in all areas to qualify as an ""ink master"". Apparently for that you need to be perfect at ALL types of tattoos and not just the ones you specialise in, even if you happen to run your own parlour.<br/><br/>The biggest draw-back for me is the constant bullying and bitching that goes on between the artists when they all return to their apartment. They sit around and usually gang up on someone that they feel either doesn't belong there, or can't draw, is a one trick pony, is a ""jerk"" or one that really blew me away, doesn't have any visible tattoos themselves!<br/><br/>I can't help but feel like I'm watching a bunch of schoolyard bullies all making fun of the fat kid, the skinny kid, the kid with glasses, the nerd or the redhead and this is because the others either feel threatened by a particular artist, or they disagree with the judges critique of their recent work as somehow being better or worse than the artist they don't like or don't respect. It's this bitching and conniving that detracts from just wanting to see some great work. If I wanted to see a group of idiots with their panties in a bunch over largely nothing or simply because they don't like someone, I'd watch The View instead. I remember one artist actually said that this is a competition so why would he not do anything he can to win? The others just sat around and insulted him. Others go so far sometimes to actually threaten with violence. How is that even legal? Plus I happen to agree that if it's a competition and you win something, why wouldn't you do what you can to make it easy for yourself to progress further? There are no trophies for martyrdom, I don't see any point in falling on your sword just so you can look like a nice guy, so other artists should really learn to just shut their mouths, grow up and get on with it. <br/><br/>It's an OK show and if you can ignore the childishness and some of the obvious staged dramatics, you'll enjoy it as some of the finished work is quite good.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,4.0,6 May 2017

Tattooing against the clock as an element of drama. Everything about Oliver Peck. Dave Navarro always sounds like he's reading and never strays from the script.

The judges are brutally honest. If all the work sucks, then they all suck and they say so. Instead of an even top two and bottom two sometimes its a bottom 3 and top 1 or all bottoms. I think this show would have deserved a ten if it wasn't for the new addition of the canvas jury. I think the time management was spot on for the first two seasons. They actually let you watch the tattooing and also see the end result and discussed with each contestant what was wrong or good with it. The canvas jury seems like its going to take time to hear opinions of people who don't really know what they are talking about or the errors they are looking for.

1889,Ink Master, Review Through Season Eight,"Watched through season eight. Show has a lot of interesting and well executed tattoos and it was an enjoyable time to see most of the artists grow over the course of the season. It seemed to me to be a bit irresponsible the amount of unprepared or bad artists they let into the show in the beginning of each season, leaving many canvases with bad tattoos. The show felt a bit unfair and uneven in how tattoos were judged. The drama was hyped up way too much when the focus should have been on the tattoos, the challenges, and the techniques used. Even with an increase in changing up the formula from season to season, the show still became stale. Seemed to be a hint of sexism and elitism by both the contestants and the judges at times throughout the show. Worth watching for the tattoos if you enjoy that, and better than most highly watched reality TV shows, but it has a lot of drawbacks that keep the positivity and creativity of some tattoos and challenges from giving this show a better score.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,4.0,17 March 2021

1894,The Break, Season 1: Good; Season 2 RIVETING,"I was fortunate to stumble onto this gem via Canadian Netflix, and it was the intense acting talent of protagonist Yoann Peeters (Yoann Blanc) and the family drama subplots - with Yoann's daughter, Camille (Sophie Breyer)) and her immensely watchable friend Zoe Fischer (Sophie Marechal) - that kept me interested in the first season, but Season 2 was an entirely different ballgame. AMAZING. Episode upon episode, Season 2 was like a snake in the grass: I just couldn't predict which way it would turn, and I freaking loved that, of course. The diverse cast and high degree of potential perps ... the extraordinary acting ... the wild party scene Camille's much older artist girlfriend was involved in ... the forest landscapes ... Joann's disintegrating mental health ... contrasting social classes (great portrayal of Dany's trashy home life, with special kudos to Sophia Leboutte, who played his mother, and Noemie Schmidt, who played sister-in-law Sophie Bastin - I believed in these female characters 100%) ... and a main character with what appeared to be honest-to-goodness psoriasis! Great call, too, on using Balthazar songs for the openings. (You can be sure a lot of people ""Shazam"" those moody theme songs to find who who's behind them).<br/><br/>A few questions though. I'm not sure why there were so many comic(relief) characters; it's over the top (ie: the IT guy, and goofy Tino, and Yoann's hokey/spooky neighbours), and unnecessary. Yeah, I get it that the overall tone is dark, but audiences, methinks, can handle that. Also I got a little weary of Yoann's excessive cold-water-splashing on the face. Really? That often? And in Season 1, does rookie cop character Sebastian Drummer (Guillaume Kerbusch) really need to scowl that much? (After Season 1, all I could think of was how relieved I was I wouldn't have to see that scowl again ...)<br/><br/>Because this was the opposite of most of what I see out of the US, ie: predictable right down to the final words - oh god, Bird Box - and the cast was SO strong, I have to give it a 10.",42 out of 45 found this helpful.,10.0,18 February 2019
1895,The Break, A brooding and intense experience that crawls under your skin,"After trying several series on Netflix that didn't appeal to me, I decided to give the recently added La Trêve ('The Break') a try.<br/><br/>The first episode seemed like an exploration of the characters by the actors and creators, and it felt good. My curiosity was awakened and I looked forward to the next episode.<br/><br/>La Trêve turned out to get better with every episode. The brooding atmosphere and intriguing characters started to crawl under my skin. The main actor — Yoann Blanc — established an admirable performance. His character gets more and more intense as the series progresses. But just about every actor shines in La Trêve.<br/><br/>The story development is gripping, with several plot twists that leave the series relatively unpredictable until the end. I loved the aerial shots of the beautiful Ardennes scenery, adding a sense of mystery to the story. The atmospheric soundtrack really completes the dark, slightly surreal impression of La Trêve.<br/><br/>What I loved most is the dark, fatalistic tone that effectively surfaces more and more throughout the series, giving you an uncanny feeling of inevitable, impending doom as Yoann gets closer to solving the murder case, unveiling the hidden, twisted secrets of several village inhabitants.<br/><br/>If I'd have to say something negative about La Trêve, I'd reluctantly admit that some of the plot twists were a bit far-fetched. But the plot twists also kept the story thrilling.<br/><br/>La Trêve is a fine example of what is labeled as New Belgian Noir.

1896,The Break, An Excellent Melting Pot of a Detective Show,"Will ""The Break"" remind you of ""Twin Peaks""? Yep. How about ""Broadchurch"" and ""True Detective,"" or the French show ""Les Revenants""? Check, and check (and the show's creators have even admitted as much). Okay, now that we've gotten what a bunch of other reviews and interviews have already noted (mostly on French websites), let's get to the execution of the show, and why it's so darn good. And yes, it is really good - in spite of reminding you of Lots of Things That Have Come Before It.<br/><br/>The plot: as stated above, there is a soccer player who turns up dead. A brooding detective who is new to town (for reasons that become increasingly clear as the story unfolds) is the chief investigator on the case. That's all I can really say without spoiling anything - and you really have to know as little as possible about this show to enjoy it to the fullest extent. <br/><br/>The execution: This is an excellent sort of whodunit, complete with Log Lady-type characters, dark and creepy woods, and lots of other goings-on that are of a highly suspicious nature (David Lynch is chuckling somewhere, that's for sure). I was hooked after one episode - and I mean, hooked. As in, I binged all of these in two days. This surprised me, as I went in having read a couple of lukewarm reviews that implied it might be too similar to the above-referenced shows; it's not. Rest assured that the Belgians have taken some of the greatest elements of these shows and really mixed them into something altogether new and incredibly fun to watch.<br/><br/>The story will keep you guessing; the characters are definitely not entirely what they seem, and each episode does one of those super- fun cliffhangers that has you immediately pressing ""play the next episode."" It's definitely less ""produced-looking"" and the small townsfolk really look like - well, small townsfolk. Heiderfeld does seem like the kind of place where things are bubbling just underneath the surface. It's a heck of a fun ride and I can't wait for Season Two!<br/><br/>FYI for those who are parents, or those who might be squeamish - it's a bit gory (dead bodies up close; lots of blood; scary visions), and as it's a European show, there are a lot of nudity and sex.

A couple of times I have also come across Belgian related series and liked them rather lot.<br/><br/>True, they have all been Flemish ones. La trêve is the first one made in Wallonia, thus the basic language in French and the venues are so different from cities like Antwerp or Ghent...

The characters seemed realistic, I did not figure out the wrongdoer, the twists were there and not over-sophisticated; it is evident that a small community has its own secrets as well. <br/><br/>Well, the pace was not even as the last episodes started to sum up the events perhaps too hastily, after rather slow progression before, and the parallel psychiatrist interview revealed some moments too soon. Nevertheless, La trêve is a thrilling series, unless you like constant chases and cops having cute appearance and fancy cars...",29 out of 31 found this helpful.,8.0,4 December 2017
1898,The Break, Broadchurch in Belgium,"The similarities are unavoidable. A recently disgraced big-city cop moves to a small town just in time to lead an investigation in a rare murder. With a resentful less-experienced partner he uncovers a lot of uncomfortable secrets about a community in which anyone can be a suspect. But a show doesn't have to be wholly original to be good. Just look at the two separate high-quality adaptations of the Danish series ""The Bridge"". Besides all a mystery series has to deliver is: an identifiable victim, plenty of suspects, and multiple twists. On these three fronts ""La Treve"" fully succeeds. Not to mention it does plenty to distinguish itself from that similar BBC series. Surprisingly it has an even darker view of humanity. As the unstable detective pessimistically asserts to his underling ""Anyone is capable of murder"". A point that is driven home hauntingly by beginning nearly every episode with a different character's nightmare of how they might be involved. Not to mention the fact that the entire series is told in retrospective from a mental hospital, where the main character has found himself following the events of the story. Yoan Peeters was a detective on the rise in Brussels until he got four members of his squad killed when he ordered them into a drug den without waiting for back-up. Like everything else in this series it is much more complicated than it first appears. But with that cloud hanging over his head he returns to his childhood home of Heiderfeld, with his sullen daughter who missed the big city even before she left. He hasn't even reported to work yet when the overwhelmed young detective Sebastian Drummer conscripts him into helping with a just discovered dead body. Most of the force has never dealt with such a situation and they need help. This series makes a better case than most crime shows about how resources and finances dictate the level of police-work. When it looks like this was a suicide the Chief cancels an autopsy, not because he's trying to cover anything up, but because the town can't afford it. The unspoken villain of the series is poverty. Poor economics has forced many in this simple town to succumb to various forms of corruption. The only dependable income for some residents seems to come from strong-arming farmers to sell for the new electric dam or throwing a soccer match to benefit mob gamblers. The latter of which may have contributed to the murder of the preeminent defender of the local club. Seen only in video messages to his family and the aforementioned dream sequences his name was Driss Asani, a drafted prospect from Africa; and as you may have guessed his death doesn't stay ruled a suicide. Yoann's detective acumen finds more than enough evidence of homicide and even more possible suspects. For a quiet rural community it certainly has more than it's share of decidedly modern eccentrics. Peeling away the placid exterior of the community certainly reveals a lot of shady characters that are not eager to share their secrets with the police. But does having something to hide automatically make someone a murderer, as the amphetamine-fueled Yoann too often accuses. Or are they all guilty of feeding a growing monster of corruption that would eventually require a human sacrifice for their collective sins. Yoann's investigation creates much more damage than it ever does justice. It leaves no one unscathed, especially himself. But this unflinching look at the desperate people created by desperate times does prove that his cynical observation was correct. Anyone is capable of murder.",73 out of 83 found this helpful.,8.0,24 December 2016
1899,The Break, Disturbing,"I like crime/ drama/ thrillers very much. And I do love Europpean take on that area of tv, however, I didn't expect what I have experienced while watching that one.
It was deeply disturbing, with some graphic scenes and pretty much depicting human filth in all possible forms. It was very depressing in that extent.
And although I watched it awaiting the solution for the whole time - right until the very end, I wouldn't return to re-watch it because I felt exhausted, as if I was in that small town, at the time of those events. 
For those wo will think ""So it's not worth watching"" I say - that only proves how good the story is written and executed. Yoann Blanc's acting is a-ma-zing, he presented the rapid mental deterioration in a very beliavable way. His growing suspiciousness is shared by the viewers, although you do realize that he overdoses time and time again and that pills push him over the edge. But you still keep on watching to see whether he was right, what will happen with him...

1907,The Break, Quirky twists set it apart.,"I will begin by saying I was enthralled with this Belgian mystery series on Netflix. And I watch a lot of them. <br/><br/>Yoann Blanc as Peeters rivals any of the modern detectives in his interpretation of the functional mental illness of a sincere crusader. He is the definition of quixotic. He tilts at every possible windmill in his way. It is both painful to watch and also engrossing.<br/><br/>The small rural town in Belgium is no Miss Marple village. It is filled with demons and their hapless accomplices. This darkness amplifies the frustration and suspense. Guillaume Kerbush as Drummer plays a truly clueless Dr. Watson, who successfully takes his character from vacuous to potentially sinister. This was one of the twists I enjoyed most.<br/><br/>Peeter's daughter Camille, played by Sophie Breyer, is a broody lesbian who neutralizes the teenage aspect of the story. Her reactions to her peers are well played and subtle. The supportive cast is evenly talented. I have to mention Alexis Julemont as Timotee, the mad Swede. He added a surreal element to the story which helps to set it apart. <br/><br/>I would watch another season, despite some dissatisfaction with the ending of this season. The ending seemed a bit too artsy-French for a hard detective story. Perhaps it was meant as a teaser for a second season.",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,31 December 2016

I really liked season 1 for the most part, but season 2 has the same issues. Mainly no one talks to each other. Everyone seems to have a crucial bit of information that they've had opportunity since episode 1 to relate. But do they? Nope. Then we have Yoann's uncanny knack for getting people (indirectly) murdered (and this time, more than one body). Subplots are totally dropped. His daughter and the pot hippies disappear completely a little over halfway through. The comic relief couple, who murder two people, drive off in their new RV never to refered to again (neither are the people they murdered discussed).<br/><br/>Yoann is clearly over the edge again, and none of the cops even do the simple things of tossing him in a cell to make him sleep.<br/><br/>There's the Sixth Sense couple (utterly ridiculous) who also disappear. The art lady who cleans out dead lady's bank, is never referred to again. Marjo, who showed promise in season 1, is just as dumb or dumber in season 2. So many opportunities for her to blow this case wide open, yet keeps her trap shut because she's Inna relationship with a buffoon she obviously has no respect for as an officer of the law. I spent half the time yelling at my screen.<br/><br/>It's produced well, and acted well, but instead of stretching this out for 10 episodes, they should've made a tight 6 and cut out the ridiculous padding.",25 out of 35 found this helpful.,6.0,19 February 2019

And how many freakin times was Peeters going to go full on ballistic on a suspect? I think it happened 5 or 6 times that he ""had the guy"". There were just too many climaxes.

The ending was just awful. Characters were introduced then they disappeared, were killed off or just written out of the storyline e.g. the hippies, the daughter and her artist girlfriend, the crazy neighbours, the murdered woman's sister and her husband.

1918,The Break, Gripping but stupid.,"So I've read the reviews comparing it to Twin Peaks and any other show that popped into the reviewer's mind. No, no and thrice no. <br/><br/>The detective (Peeters) is inept and doesn't have the basic training which would have ruled out a lot of the red herrings which are metaphorically forced down our throat in this overextended series. As usual in these things then the writers take advantage of current technology when it fits the plot but the poor old detective has to ignore everything other than CCTV when it comes to ascertaining the killer's identity. <br/><br/>The final reveal is as stupid as it is unexpected (and also totally unbelievable). So if you're impressed by multi-layered story lines (as I am) then this is interesting, but the fact is that those story lines have to fit together somehow as they did in The Missing, Nobel and other series which are much more worthwhile watching than this. The sudden appearance of character X in place Y is rarely explained, as is the sheer incompetence of the lead detective. This is excusable if the plot takes place in a complete and utter vacuum, but not when it's in the modern day and a reference to Game of Thrones is thrown in. <br/><br/>If Peeters had watched half the number of detective shows that I have then he'd have been able to discover the killer's identity within a few hours using GPS data. So 6/10 from me since it was well acted and kept me hooked, but overall it was disappointing.",30 out of 50 found this helpful.,6.0,9 January 2017
1919,Limitless," Unique Show, Full of Joy","I'm not understanding the hate this show is getting. I get that the show probably didn't go where a lot of people thought it would, being a sort of continuation of the 2011 movie ""Limitless"" but honestly, the way people seem to think it should of gone is boring in my opinion. Every show out there seems to be full of heavy content and really dark, and this show, while still having some heavy themes, is like watching the show equivalent of a rainbow. And I love that! It's light, it's funny, it's well-cast (despite what people say about the lead, who, IMO, is the best part of the show) and it doesn't need to go in a darker, more intricate direction. I mean, also consider that as I write this, the season is only half done, and there's plenty time for more political intrigue or whatever people seem to think this show is lacking. But in my opinion it's a good show as it is now: it's refreshing. It's similar to a cop show, but it is unique because it's not about a cop, it's about a guy effectively functioning as a human Guinea pig for cops. It's a different perspective. It's about how his job, and the drug, affect his life.<br/><br/>It's not a Netflix show or an HBO show so don't go in expecting something like House of Cards... it's great for what it is, and that is a sometimes cheesy network show. I love this show and it's my favorite on TV right now, it makes me happy, and it's nice to watch after a long day. I don't know why people were expecting some sort of break out crime drama rated MA because if you recall the film that this show gets its premise from was mediocre at best. There's nothing wrong with this show that can't be summed up by saying that it's not your cup of tea.

They both live in the same universe in which a pill called NZT-48 unlocks the full potential of a subjects mind. This show manages to make interesting characters and plots, without losing the main idea of the show. The best part about this show, has to be the protagonist, Bryan Finch, played by Jake McDorman. The protagonist has a way of looking at things and portraying them to the audience that gives us some comedy relief that the movie didn't really have. That's also one of the strongest parts of the series, the comedy. I didn't really think this series was going to make me laugh or smile at how the character looks at things. And to make the series even better, they made an episode that was a total homage to Ferris Bueller's Day Off. <br/><br/>This is a truly remarkable series that will, if it continues this way, become a fan favorite over the years.

I've seen people criticize that type of genre, and because of that I don't think they should be commenting on this show at all. The ""gimmick"" of limitless has great potential. I look forward to seeing where they take it. This is not just a show about someone with genius observational skills like Elementary or Mentalist, it goes a step further. If you saw the movie you know what kind of effect NZT can have on a person, and it allows writers to take great creative liberties. I hope they really explore the limits of someone on NZT. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of this season. I'm voting the first episode a 10 out of 10, because I couldn't have possibly enjoyed a pilot episode any more than I enjoyed this one.

He's OK but nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>The first minutes of the pilot are filled with visual effects (including the liquid limitless zoom-in effect of the movie).<br/><br/>The plot seems ""too convenient"" though. Brian Sinclair (Jake McDorman) has all the evidents against him for 2 murders and he actually robs a bank later on, yet he walks free and he becomes a mentalist-like consultant for the FBI! I suspect, even afraid, that this might become a procedural police drama and the NZT is only an excuse to have some weird sherlock-ish deductions at the crime scenes. Don't forget other series like ""Forever"" where the immortality was also an excuse for a supreme deduction logic and not fully explored as a meaningful plot element.<br/><br/>Is it fun or entertaining?

1928,Limitless, The writers certainly weren't on NZT,"I've seen the first two episodes - with the second being an utter waste of time since it unfolded exactly the way you'd expect - and that's enough for me.<br/><br/>The major irony of this show is its narrow scope. To me, the core of what makes NZT an interesting concept is summed up in this quote from Bradley Cooper's character in the 2011 movie: ""I knew what I needed to do and how to do it."" Note that there's two parts in that statement, a what and a how.<br/><br/>The show's protagonist is entirely hung up on the how. Showing off the wacky stuff you can do while on NZT gets old really fast. In fact, it was old right from the start of the show since all of that was established in the movie. Yes, we get it, he can throw a mad guitar solo and become fluent in any language in a couple of hours. This basic premise is easy to grasp.<br/><br/>The truly interesting thing about a ridiculously powerful nootropic like NZT is the implications of such a drug's existence. While the movie had its flaws, it explored this theme in a way that kept you interested. It swiftly established the how and then put a heavier emphasis on the what, which quickly snowballed into an epic endeavor.<br/><br/>Granted, there is obviously the larger picture in the show, with Cooper's character and his mysterious motives, but that will no doubt be unraveled in an excruciatingly slow-paced fashion. What really bugs me is what the protagonist does with NZT. He's supposed to be virtually invincible and yet he is stuck with issues that should be relatively easy to handle whilst under the influence, namely that the FBI is onto him and that his family is worried. This is the what that the show is zeroing in on. He's already had plenty of time on NZT to figure things out, time that he's instead spent playing with papier-mâché dolls.<br/><br/>This show has trapped itself in the convenient and the mundane, precisely the things that NZT is supposed to liberate you from. Why is the show slow-rolling and teasing us with the big stuff? My answer: Because that material is challenging to write. Thinking it all the way through and imagining all the consequences of such a powerful psychoactive, especially on a global scale, and then executing it in a compelling way with good pacing, is really hard.

It's also fun with a likable protagonist.<br/><br/>Even though I would have loved to see a season two, I can understand why this show was cancelled.<br/><br/>-- The protagonist, Brian is laid back. I get it. He's showing that he's a regular guy the audience can identify with. But ultimately, it undercuts tension for him to be a party dude in a thriller. A show that played this well was Psych.<br/><br/>-- The show is laden with soap opera dramas that linger too much on emotion and don't ultimately change the big story. Whenever the father shows up, for example.<br/><br/>-- Although the show has a high-level story arc, it is fragmented. Without a strong sense of purpose, and momentum, the high-level story can't be gripping. I got the sense that there wasn't a well-mapped-out big idea driving the backstory and mystery, but rather guesswork by the writers.<br/><br/>-- Beyond the high-level story, the procedural nature of the show underserves its premise (an intelligence pill), and the smart cop thing has been done before. It's Sherlock Holmes all over again. It's so repetitive that the show has to keep coming up with unusual crimes and unusual crime-solving methods. But a TV show shouldn't be about the mechanics; it should be about the people. The premise naturally leads to more of a thriller / horror / drama like Breaking Bad or The Man in the High Castle.<br/><br/>-- Plot holes take us out of the show. I get it, a cop show isn't supposed to be realistic. But there are some sloppy twists and turns, choices that don't make sense for the characters or their organizations.<br/><br/>-- The show seemed caught between celebrating the intelligence drug and showcasing the horrors of addiction. You can't do both. It learned more towards the celebrating. I read online that the superpowers coming through a pill-based drug was a major factor in the show not being renewed. It's too close to the implication, ""taking cocaine is okay if it makes you productive"".<br/><br/>-- Finally, and most fatally, one of the show's heroes is under the thumb of (omitted), and gives in too much, seeming not to be bothered when crimes are committed. A protagonist with moral failures becomes less likable, less easy to root for. There should have been a giant struggle there instead of camaraderie, like in Daredevil and Luke Cage fighting the organized crime trying to blackmail them.<br/><br/>A lot of TV shows have a bumpy first season, for example Star Trek the Next Generation or Veep. I would love to have seen if they could have turned this into a miracle show. And I still love the premise. But I think structurally, there was too much wrong with this. So I can see why they cancelled it.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,14 February 2020
1930,Limitless," Please Don't Become Just Another 'Cop Show', Pleeeeaaase.....?","After watching the pilot:<br/><br/>I loved the original film and idea, Bradley Cooper nailed it (he has a cameo in the pilot as well). So I came to the TV pilot preying 'don't screw it up, don't screw it up....' and they didn't! Good start. It starts out as a 'who done it' and the main protagonist, Brian (Jake McDorman) has to work out A: How to get a supply of NZT? And B: Who killed his friend/supplier? Brian is similar to the original film character as in he has no future, is almost a bum and is going no where fast. Also similar is a chance encounter with an old friend with a little clear pill.<br/><br/>I liked it, although there seem to be some convenient 'allowances' on the part of the writers. But they're just lining up their ducks and laying the ground work for Brian's future with the FBI. There is an absolute avalanche of cop shows; and it doesn't look like there'll be any let up this Autumn. The amount of new cop shows cascading out of our TV sets in the next few weeks seems excessive. However I'm hoping that this one will be different? It has an original idea that could lead us to a thousand fascinating places - as long as it doesn't become 'just another cop show'. <br/><br/>Senator Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) will be back, he's said as much as he has plans for Brian. Brian will amaze and dazzle all of those around him, in fact he already has to some extent. As long as the writers can avoid the formula 'good guys vs bad guys and the good guys always win' which sucks and is far from true in the real world. Here's hoping Brian will be an insider in the FBI for Senator Eddie and spying/double cross and intrigue will prevail? <br/><br/>At the moment the probability of this taking off and giving us some original TV drama is 93% (yes, I have NZT) - But the moment that there is a single car chase/shoot out that prediction drops to 24%. If Brian falls for the female lead that drops to 12%; with her in peril and needing rescuing it becomes a paltry 2%.<br/><br/>Please don't do it, stick to the originality of the idea and do a cop show that's different. It's a big ask but I can't be the only one sick of 'the formula', can I?<br/><br/>After Episode 2;<br/><br/>A total change in 'tone' - far less serious, almost jocular, a little ridiculous and tongue in cheek (I howled at the 'gun and badge' joke). <br/><br/>Brian is a clown, naturally and is charming/disarming the highly trained, doubly serious FBI agents. He's amazed and bamboozled them in equal measure and has solved things in minutes that left them scratching their heads for years. All good. I was tempted to switch off at the start because of the total 180 it's done since the pilot (which was way more serious in tone). But I stuck with it, got used to the change in tempo and angle and was rewarded. I'm a little concerned by his new 'partner' FBI agent Rebecca (Jennifer Carpenter). She needs a good steak, or a good anything, I don't think she's eaten for a few months. Gotta pack away that protein if you're going to be chasing and wrestling bad guys, Reb'.<br/><br/>It probably is going to be 'just another cop show'; but it has redeeming features so I'm prepared to make allowances; like you would for your naughtiest but funniest kid (just don't tell your mother, Okay?!). The underlying plot of him working for Sen. Eddie Morra is still there, but it's a slow burner hidden away underneath weekly crime solving.<br/><br/>All in all this is light hearted relief with a sprinkling of drama so that's how I'm treating it. I was all stoked up for a serious thriller, maybe that will still come? Either way, I will continue to watch, and laugh, but this is down from 9/10 to 7.5/10.<br/><br/>After episode 3;<br/><br/>I was wrong, way wrong....... this is now a four, So I watch no more, Just find it a bore that makes me snore.........<br/><br/>Couldn't help that last bit.

1931,Limitless, Fine example of how TV show can evolve from average to excellent,"As title says, this show was off to your average TV show, with plain plot, an average cast and you know, all other things that we had seen by now. To plot was center around NZT drug and one propagandist, while efficiently ignored other characters, their side of story.<br/><br/>It was washed down crime TV show with main character who is on NZT and only real plot was around NZT for good half of show, with little side tracks, that consisted of solving crime cases and throw backs to Brain story. That was for first half of first round of this season, however from episode 7, show evolved considerably.<br/><br/>They learned that if they are going to pull, second season or at least get full season rundown (which happened and i am so glad they pulled out), they need to grow bigger, risk more, start thinking outside of box. Oh, boy they did all of that and last episode of first round - episode 11 is result of all that.<br/><br/>I didn't go into any specifics , I wrote this review in general perspective, because until the season ends, there can't really be any objective based review, it's simply too early for any final thoughts . That said I really urge anyone to give it a shot because it deserves it (being #2 most watched show on CBS should speak for it self).<br/><br/>Edit 1: With a show one episode away from season ending and having watched part one of finale, I have to say, hands down to a team, you had done incredibly job.<br/><br/>TV show had become everything I hoped for, when they order full seasons, I laughed, felt sad, confused and etc. They explored multiple characters, their agenda, motives, feelings, experimented with risky directions and so on.<br/><br/>However, ultimate thing that really shines is how every peace of story, every peace of puzzle has fallen into place and I don't have words to express how much I recommend this show, so stop reading,go ahead and watch.",51 out of 77 found this helpful.,10.0,17 December 2015

But the yet another lame writer/director thought of taking the easy way; turning it into another addition to list of hundreds of 'yet another lame-ass cop drama' and try to cash in from the original idea.

The first thing any thinking man does when granted three wishes, is to request endless wishes. Well, I would kinda assume this guy is supposed to be a thinking man, given that is what the ""special power"" is supposed to be. So the ""fatal flaw"" in this series is why the guy doesn't do the first 3 things anybody else would do in his situation - especially given the ""special power"".<br/><br/>1. Why doesn't he spend one pill to figure the biochemistry behind the pill, it's constituents, and then how to manufacture enough for himself to be consistently ""special"". <br/><br/>2. Why doesn't he figure out the antidote to the physical/mental breakdown that he has to continually take to prevent that from occurring, and stop the people holding him hostage from engaging in that exercise.<br/><br/>3. Finally, why doesn't he figure out a successful way to deal with his dad's issues to eliminate problem 2 completely.<br/><br/>These are the things even the simplest of 10 year old sit and scratch their heads about when they watch this stuff.

It's a crime of the week with an arc story hinting at something involving Bradley Cooper's character and the NZT side-effect neutralizer stuff. The real crime is wasting a really good premise - this show will be found guilty in the court of indifference in short order.. I guess I'm actually a bit upset because this show could be a solid 8 or 9 and I genuinely think its getting worse with each episode and even a 5 might be too generous. I didn't want a show about unlimited brain potential to be a much less interesting redux of Person of Interest, Medium, Bones, et.al. . Disappointed is an understatement. Jennifer Carpenter is slumming by the way. If these are the TV roles she's wasting her talent on the major networks. I think she needs to go for edgier Pay TV series or, maybe, big-screen movies?

1943,Limitless, This show could have been so so much more..,"I registered to IMDb purely to write this review.<br/><br/>Limitless is one of my favourite movies of all time. At least in the top 10. So when I seen that a TV series will be coming out based on the movie, I was super excited.<br/><br/>The first episode looked great, apart from a major blunder. Rebecca oddly knew that Brian was shot in the leg, without him telling her. This annoyed me greatly. From here my opinion of the show worsened.<br/><br/>From episode 2 onwards it just went downhill. For a guy on NZT he doesn't show much intelligence at all, apart from the 'burst' of smart maybe 2 or 3 times per episode. If he has an IQ in the 4 digit range (as per the movie), what the heck is he still doing with the FBI? Does anyone remember what Eddie Morra was able to do on NZT? He made millions of dollars in the first few days. This Brian character is pathetic.<br/><br/>I watched up to episode 5 with a hope that the plot would change from 'episode to episode crime solving' to something that relates to the movie. If I wanted to watch a cop show I would pick one of the dozens out there still running.<br/><br/>An unintelligent guy writes a script about a drug which boosts intelligence into the 4 digit range.

1944,Damien, the best show in a long time and they cancel it!!!?,"First, I'm really mad! Beside all the crappy shows on TV, that people find interesting and I can't figure it out why. They cancel one of the best in a long time!? Damien had a real potential and was much better then The omen and other movies in the omen franchise. It was much more complex, mysteries and row, and although it was based on the movie, it was original and unique. Of course the show wasn't perfect, but it also wasn't so bad as a lot of people said it was. Actors did a really great job, especially Bradley James and Barbara Hershey. Bradley James brought the new meaning on being the Antichrist, he wasn't just like I'm the Antichrist and that is it, but showed that even evil incarnated has a human in it and even Antichrist can suffer accepting his faith. And his American accent was amazing, I would never said he was British. And Barbara Hershey did a really good job making Ann Rutledge a real disciple totally dedicated to serve and protect Damien and it seems like she wants for her and Damien to be together forever and her believe that she is his mother, and nothing or nobody better cross her way protecting her little ˝angel˝. I think if the show centered more on the relationship between Damien and Ann Rutledge, It would be a lot more interesting kind of Norman Bates situation but reversed, here the ˝son˝ would call the shots. I don't know if anyone knows a real crime case of Stewart Northcott, but that case shows mother-son relationship that I mean.<br/><br/>Well long story short. It's a real shame that Damien was cancelled after one season and I'm sorry more people didn't find the show interesting.

1945,Damien, Thank you A&amp;E...; Really!,"As a particularly opinionated connoisseur of the horror genre, I fully recommend this version of dark prophesy and the emergence of the Anti-Christ. While far from perfect, many things are done extremely well at this early point (seven episodes) of the series.<br/><br/>I'm a fan of serious horror movies like Rosemary's Baby, Exorcist III, Jacob's Ladder, (the wildly underestimated 2005) Stay, and the Omen films from which this show draws inspiration. There are seeds of all of these films present in Damien - with minimal jump scares, frequent disorientation, and a wonderful atmosphere of growing terror.<br/><br/>Damien continues the legacy of the Omen movies, and does so utilizing footage directly from the first classic for story development. Anyone who has seen the Omen knows there are truly memorable moments that have earned a place in the lexicon of the horror genre. Damien lives up to the best parts of these films and is a fine example of the current era of great television. The brief synopsis is all one needs to know: Damien Thorn, a man who has been drawn to the darkness of humanity his whole life, but somehow is always protected from physical harm, must come to terms with the growing reality of his true identity, the Anti-Christ.<br/><br/>Production is solid, with top marks given to lighting. Darkness, strong shadows, and contrast are always present, at times unrealistically - but there is consistency to the look and feel that adds to the unsettling nature.<br/><br/>Casting is also excellent. Everyone is convincing, including the two leads, who were clearly cast for both ability and photogenic qualities. Damien's best friend may be the weakest link, but this speaks to the strength of the major players as a whole, because he's pretty good! Barbara Hershey and Scott Wilson have to be the real treat. Both are right at home, delivering top notch performances. Hershey emotes the love of a mother with truly sinister flair, and Wilson channels his best Donald Pleasence. Without this cast and their hard work, this show could easily be half as good. To this point, this show is certainly not for everyone. Some who can not suspend disbelief may find Damien tedious, even laughable. I too laugh aloud at moments, perhaps when I shouldn't - but I've always been like this with serious horror films, having a certain glee absorbing unspeakable content.<br/><br/>And what wonderful content! This show is not politically correct - throwing religious practice, emergency rooms, psychiatric wards, and military veterans hospitals all under the bus. Damien is not made to do any public service, but to entertain, and I applaud the unflinching approach. Meta scores be damned! Clearly this show is made for audience approval and not reviewers, who have become difficult to trust without first forming one's own opinion.<br/><br/>This is just the beginning too! With time to grow into multiple seasons Damien could really be special, and find a singular place. There is plenty of horror schlock, and murder saturated TV, but a serious supernatural thriller should have a place.

1947,Damien, Modern Re-Working Is A Solid Effort,"I have confidence in Glen Mazzara's creation of this series, even if the critics out there trashing it, do not. One critic went so far as to say he would never give this show another chance after viewing the pilot. What tripe and how close minded. I gave Hannibal a chance, a re-working of another well-known character, and was richly rewarded. I intend to give this series a shot, let it unfold and see how it hits me, as a big fan of the 1976 Richard Donner film from which it draws thematically and musically. What I like about the pilot episode: the modern updating, the acting, the music, and not making Damien good or bad but basically innocent until his 30th birthday (why, I will leave for you to discover), upon which he must start grappling with horrific memories of his long-past childhood. <br/><br/>It makes no sense for Damien to start out evil in this show, as that leaves his character nowhere to go. What I hope will be explored is if the nature of evil, whether you believe in Revelation/the Bible or not, is a growth, a given, a concept that can be overcome, or something you ultimately must submit to and revel in as your true nature. And that conflict, the gray area, is much more interesting to me. This series will sink or swim, based on its ability to draw out that narrative. And in just viewing the pilot, I think it has a lot of possibility.",68 out of 89 found this helpful.,8.0,8 March 2016
1948,Damien, Entertaining and beautifully dark,"Having watched all three Omens film during my youth, I was a bit reluctant at first whether or not it would be possible to take a classic like that and bring it into the TV-series era. I've watched 10 episodes so far, and I must admit, they've nailed it! Its a thrilling experience from episode 2 and on wards, and the suspense only rises per episode. The TV-Series does a really good job of providing a bit of feedback from the first film into season 1 so it sort of binds it together, and gains a plausible ""life"" of its own as a TV-series. If you love dark stories, and the everlasting story of good vs evil, where the boundaries are often erased as nothing is truly completely light nor dark, but can be either at any side, you should really take a good look at Damien, which has a lot of gloomy sides.",15 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,11 May 2016

I take it as a stand alone piece of art instead of a continuation of the Omen movies which I feel were unrealistic, a child giving someone evil looks and they die is somewhat a laughable connotation of what the Devil would be like on Earth which is what this series is about, it pertains to the human side of Damien, who is 29 or 30 years of age now. The narrative initiates in the main characters' journey of disbelieve of what he is which is plausible since this story is set in modern day, where science and reasoning exists and have somewhat overwritten Religion and Ancient Prophecies. This is a story of Fate/Faith in himself/Brutal Reality/Realisation/Strength/Failure/Disbelief, a mixed bag of emoticons and experiences. The audience that will appreciate this series are those that can relate to his journey or any journey of realization, it is for those who have struggled, have good and pure intentions but are in a pit of serpents. This show cleverly allows the audience to ponder upon if Damien is Good, Bad or Necessary if not all. I am on the sixth episode now and very excited to see what happens next!!!!! :D Some might say, ""How eerie 6th episode!"" LMAO!!!!",20 out of 26 found this helpful.,10.0,20 May 2016
1953,Damien, Great start and reboot after the original film,"Some people are giving this a low review, but once you get passed the first two episodes, it gets really interesting. I noticed that the low reviews are from people that want faithfulness from the books and the original movie, but most younger viewers have probably never watched the Gregory Peck film. <br/><br/>I watched the original 3 films (I skipped the 4th and the ""updated"" version) and this show does a good job as a sequel of the original film. It's on TV, so it will not be as creepy or as gruesome. <br/><br/>Barbara Hershey's acting is top notch. If anything, she is the creepiest character of them all. The guy playing Damien could use more experience, but give it some time. If the network allows the show to continue, it will be better.",20 out of 26 found this helpful.,8.0,31 March 2016
1954,Damien, Solid show that gets better with each episode,"Don't write too many reviews, but on this one had to - guess it's my way of putting out into the universe - please don't cancel! Don't know too many people who watch it, so I am concerned, but I really think it has something after 9 episodes in. Yep, it gets off to a slightly slow start (which wasn't a problem for me personally), and there are some serialized ""TV show moments"" in the beginning that don't quite work - the death of one main character in the first few episodes, as one reviewer wrote, did seem a little forced - it's forgivable, keep watching. If you were a fan of the original movie(s), you will appreciate the love the creators of this show have for them and how they tie everything in to a modern day story that still stays faithful to the original things to smile, laugh, and be creeped out about - the freakish deaths, the conspiracies, the cabals, the dramatic Gothic Damien 666 music, the killer Rottweilers, that feeling of dread cuz you know it's all going to hell from here. Actor playing Damien is good - does a good job of balancing his confusion and resistance about it all with the rising evil in him (lemme guess without looking, British, right?) And bonuses - Barbara Hershey blessing the show with her immense Jessica Lange-esque presence, and Scott Wilson. All in all, guys from Walking Dead produced this, and I trust their vision and direction so far. And please don't cancel lol",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,9.0,3 May 2016
1955,Damien, Damien is one of the best shows on TV this season,"Bradley James from BBC's Merlin, comes to us in the U.S. as Damien Thorn... the devil's son all grown up. Bradley's acting is amazing. His use of the American accent is not only believable, but done so well, that if I didn't know he was English...it would be difficult to tell.<br/><br/>Damien Thorn does not want to be the Anti-Christ. He is dead set on NOT causing deaths of others, and not following the people who want him to take his rightful role. He makes both friends and enemies along the way.<br/><br/>Many people who he loves, end up dead. This disturbs him to the point of desperation...wanting to find a way out of this madness.<br/><br/>The whole story revolves around Damien, his friends and Ann...played by Barbara Hershey. She is a woman who has devoted her entire life to Damien. He just recently meets her at the age of 30, and thinks she's nuts.<br/><br/>The entire season takes us on a glorious trip. We begin to not only love Damien, but we are hoping he can win his cause, and not follow the devil.

I always expect first episodes to be pretty bland but I found myself invested enough to watch it straight through (no stopping for reedit breaks or from losing interest for a bit). The main actor is solid, the tension felt good and not forced or fake, and pacing was nice for a pilot. Also, A&amp;E doesn't seem afraid of letting things get a bit graphic. It's not Hannibal levels, though it would be pretty cool if it got close to that point, but someone got messed up pretty good. It's nothing spectacular but it seems like its got a lot of promise.

1960,Damien, Not True to the Franchise,"Had the show not tried to include the original movie or at least tweaked it, it might not have been so bad. However, the used original footage suggesting that The Omen and Damien existed on the same timeline. If that is the case, Damien should have been 10 years older than what he was. I understand that he was supposed to find his true calling as the Antichrist at the same age that Jesus died on the Cross but it wasn't that important to the plot and just created a plot hole. Furthermore, it was evident from the very beginning of The Omen that Damien was well aware that he was less than human, yet they make it so Damien ""forgets"" everything that happened before his 5th birthday? No. Not working for me. Plus, they try to make Damien seem as though he has a moral dilemma. Damien is the Antichrist. Just as Jesus Christ could do no evil, the Antichrist (Damien) can do no good. Damien, especially as he grew older, should have become more and more evil. Damien was never intended to be a likable character. Perhaps extremely charming and cunning but not likable and much less moral. I feel like the original intentions of The Omen were lost in this sub-par television.adaptation.

The use of footage from the original film was well used and gave us just enough to jog the memory without having to watch it.<br/><br/>But if you have not seen the original film then get watching but don't watch any of the others ( just don't! its not pretty ).

1963,Damien, Well... it gets better!,"When i saw the first episode i was like: ""what am i watching... and WHY am i watching this?"" I didn't like it at all. It had terrible cuts, and tons of cliché (like music, and a mysterious lady appearing from nowhere, evil rottweilers??) BUT i liked the main actor so... yeah, lately all pilots from TV shows are really boring, even there's a list somewhere about ""in witch episode you get attached to the show""(in Daredevil, for example, it's the fifth or sixth episode). Anyway, i decided to keep watching. <br/><br/>The second episode was better, at least it was more credible, because deaths on the pilot were really disappointing, like that Kelly girl's death??? seriously??? it was really forced, in my opinion. But in this episode you start to understand Damien's mind and everything. I wasn't 100% convinced anyways, but it was better so i kept on.<br/><br/>From the third episode until now (the fifth) it was really interesting, yes. I was 100% convinced in the last episode though, besides the fact that they still using rottweillers... at least one of the characters escaped from an attack so... it was more realistic i guess, now it's creeper and confusing at the same time, and Damien's evolve is being great. I don't understand the point of some characters? and some things that came up from nothing (like that blond girl flirting with Damien's friend?), but i guess you should give it a try, i'm sure i'll figure it out some thing later because that's the point (and if those stuff has no explanation ever, it means it was a crappy show lol)<br/><br/>Oh, it's important to remind something: it's an adaptation, we're not in the 80's anymore, probably we will never watch anything as good as 80's movies or TV shows, they were masterpieces, now everything is used, everything has been told, and i don't know a single horror TV show, maybe Goosebumps??? but that's from the 90's and it was meant for kids, so don't expect anything like the original movie, ever. Watch this show with an outside view.

1964,Damien," This is bad, bad television","I have rated this show a 1 only to add some weight against the 7 star average this show currently has. <br/><br/>In truth it is perhaps a 2 or 3 as the lighting and camera work is of a professional standard. <br/><br/>I struggle to understand the glowing reviews as anything other than friends and family of those involved or viewers so desperate for the concept and premise to work that they are seeing what they want to see, as this is as bad as it gets TV wise these days. <br/><br/>The writing is laughable throughout the show, with motivations for characters never explained and all the depth of a puddle. Conversations are forced and unnatural, veering into religious pontificating without any relevant context simply to try and shoehorn them into the tone of the show in ways that never happen in real life. <br/><br/>The introduction of the detective is perhaps the most eye-rolling moment in the show, he is suspicious as the show needs him to be, there would be no reason for this immediate hostility towards the main character if the same events had occured in reality, before he has any other pieces of the puzzle. <br/><br/>Let's not even talk about the hilarious shrine to the original film... <br/><br/>The cancellation was in motion even as the opening credits rolled I'm sure, bad, bad television.

1965,Damien, Damien is well worth it if you're willing to make the time.,"Damien is a series that any self-respecting fan of psychological horror needs to be watching. While a bit light on the gratuitous violence and gore, it more than makes up for that with spine-tingling psychological suspense that keeps you riveted to your seat. Each episode gets more intense and sucks you in further, until you're not entirely sure which end is up. And you likely won't even care. Plus, there's the added bonus of flashbacks to Damien's childhood via clips from The Omen, something any avid fan will love.<br/><br/>The entire cast works in ways that may not seem apparent initially, but their combined chemistry gels with each interaction, particularly after the pilot, until you find yourself looking forward to the exchanges that result from any combination of the cast. Bradley James and Scott Wilson are brilliant in their respective roles as Damien Thorn and John Lyons respectively, and offer a nice undertone of familial connection in all of their scenes. Omid Abtahi (Amani Golkar) and Megalyn Echikunwoke (Simone Baptiste) offer a nice counterbalance in their chemistry with James. David Meunier brings an understated sense of balance and skepticism as the outsider cop, Detective Shay. Melanie Scrofano (Veronica Selvaggio) and Robin Weigert (Sister Greta Fraueva) round out what I consider to be the main cast, bringing their own elements of intrigue and chemistry to the mix. Even the guest and minor roles all have a part to play in the ultimate battle of good and evil. But the standout role goes to Barbara Hershey, without question or hesitation. Ann Rutledge is one of the most intricately layered characters I've ever seen, and weaves herself into every single thread of the tapestry that is this show.<br/><br/>Glen Mazzara and his creative team have brought the horror, the intrigue, and the humanity to this portrayal of the Antichrist in ways that I've never seen before. This show isn't a caricature or a comedy. This show doesn't rely on fantasy or sci-fi elements to convey the twists and turns of the storyline, nor does it utilize cheesy horror bits or comedic shtick. Sure, the deaths in the pilot could be easily figured out, but is it really a shock that a lot of deaths are going to happen around the Antichrist? The show is realistic and offers a fascinating ""What if?"" of the Antichrist happening in the world we live in currently. That they can so casually slip in the fact that there is an LGBT character in the universe of Damien, to the point that a lot of people may not even realize it, is one of the feathers Mazzara and his team can put in their collective hat.<br/><br/>The research that went into creating and maintaining this show points toward a level of intelligence that hopefully won't scare away potential viewers. Just as viewers don't need to have any knowledge of The Omen to watch this show; neither do they need any deep knowledge into the Book of Revelations or the early Christian Church. But for those of us who are interested in that sort of thing, this show brings the research and makes the tapestry of Damien that much richer and delicious.<br/><br/>I personally have been excited for this show since it was first announced over a year ago, and I have watched faithfully from the pilot, with multiple viewings each week as I try to find all of the breadcrumbs that I know Mazzara and team have left for us. It's renewed my interest in the religious subject matter, and it's certainly restored my faith in quality, intelligent television in an age of reality TV.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,23 April 2016
1966,Damien, Uninspiring.......,"The Omen film from 1976 and, to a slightly lesser degree, its sequels, represent some of the best of classic horror. <br/><br/>The films worked firstly because of fantastic storytelling and direction. There's a building sense of ice cold dread and malevolent menace infused in each film that really sets them apart. The other reason they work is excellent casting with top notch performances handed in by stellar actors such as Gregory Peck, Lee Remick and Sam Neil. <br/><br/>To produce a television series that supposedly follows on from these excellent films is either brave or foolhardy. In this case, lamentably, its the latter. Damien the series, suffers, in my opinion, from uninspired storytelling, ordinary direction and ho hum casting. The result is a mediocre affair, that offers up a shallow, rather flat sequel, to at least the first of the three original films.<br/><br/>The series cause is not helped by the unwelcome dash of US exceptional-ism on offer in the first episodes opening scenes, in the form of a rather simplistic take on the conflict in Syria. Something, I would have thought, was best left for the mainstream media political pundits, to squabble over. <br/><br/>If you have not seen the original films, my advice is watch them first and then see how you feel about Damien, the series.

Maybe he can be yourself.

1970,Coupling, OMFG -- Brilliant!!,"I'm a Yank who is only now catching the show on local PBS, courtesy of BBC America. I never saw the (aborted) NBC attempt and, having seen about a half dozen episodes, I'm glad I *didn't* As someone old enough to remember ""Monty Python"" from it's original run, I must agree with other posters that I feared that truly hysterical ""Brit wit"" was a thing of the past. I never really cared much for ""Fawlty Towers"" (as much as I love Mr. Cleese), and only the medieval episodes of Black Adder really tickled me fancy.<br/><br/>But ""Coupling"" -- hoo hah! Anyone who compares this to ""Friends"" has clearly never watched more than an episode. At the height of its mild amusement, ""Friends"" never equaled the least of this absolutely *brilliant* series. For all the stereotypes of Brits as dry, stuck-up and stodgy, I've found that, humour-wise, we across the pond can't hold a candle...<br/><br/>""Coupling"" is the height of ""cultured rudeness"" in the vein of ""Absolutely Fabulous"" -- one of the most adult Brit-coms I've ever seen. Every episode is consistently ROTFLMAO funny. I couldn't even begin to pick a fave character.<br/><br/>Patrick plays the ""stud"" character in an amusingly original manner: he has his way with the chicks, and yet is dim enough to not *totally* emasculate us lesser males. The episode where one of the gals has him bring out the ""big guns"" in the loo, to intimidate a bloke, is something you'd NEVER see on American TV.<br/><br/>Jeff is.... well, the most creatively addled loon since Seinfeld's Kramer, albeit *nothing* like him. Almost a child-man, he reminds me of the Frasier line in ""Cheers"" - ""What color is the sky in *your* world?"" Jane is so annoyingly self-absorbed and yet, like Jeff, also such a waif that you don't totally despise her. It amazes how the series' creators walk the edge, crafting characters that *ought* to pluck your last nerve but, unlike George and Kramer from Seinfeld, could actually be tolerable in real life.<br/><br/>The other three characters are brilliantly crafted as well, but these three stand out after the limited viewing I've been exposed to. I have never even considered purchasing a TV series on DVD but, in addition to wanting to see at least the entire first three seasons (I have read here that Jeff is not in the fourth season, and I don't think I could warm up to a substitute), I really must turn on many of my close friends to this marvelous show.<br/><br/>For those of you Yanks out there who only know of this show from NBC's feeble attempt to import it, you *must* catch this on your local PBS station if and when it airs, or pester them incessantly until it does. You'll not only understand why the attempt at translation failed, but you'll finally get to see what the fuss was all about.<br/><br/>If *anything* on the American telly was this consistently funny, we wouldn't have to suffer the endless rot of ""reality"" TV, and the ""dead in half a season"" warmed over '70s-era situation (non)comedies.

It was unlike anything I had ever seen before. This person seemed to be totally confused as to the origins of the show. First it is said to be a copy of an American show, then it is stated that it is unbelievable that America wants to make their own version. It is originally a British show. It will tell you that on the special features of the DVD. The special features also include a lovely story about how the concept of the show came about. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and mine is that ""Coupling"", while different, is brilliant and should be given a chance by all to form their own opinions of it. By the way, here's an example of the hilarity:<br/><br/>Sally: Mary Kelly thinks you're a complete idiot.<br/><br/>Patrick: Then why does she keep looking at my arse when we're talking?<br/><br/>Sally: She's lip-reading.",182 out of 203 found this helpful.,,26 June 2004

It's flawless in its execution. Jeff really steals the show for me. I'd give a list of suggested episodes, but that list would essentially be a list of the entire running.<br/><br/>My sides are still sore from laughing so hard.

Each person who has seen it has their favourite character whether it be statistical Sally, mad Jane, sensible Susan or paranoid Steve. It is virtually impossible not to like this show.

1974,Coupling, The UK trumps the Yanks in the sitcom dept.,"I'm an American who just saw Season 1 of ""Coupling"" on DVD for the first time. Based on those first six episodes, I think the BBC's ""Coupling"" -- along with a new US series over here called ""Arrested Development"" -- is possibly the sharpest, funniest, and best-written situation comedy since the golden days of Norman Lear and MJM Productions.<br/><br/>The cast chemistry is amazing. The archetypes are extremely identifiable, even over here, which is why the series translates so well. In comedies the subject of sex is often treated adolescently, and it's true that the characters in ""Coupling"" have some childish, ""American Pie"" reactions to sexual politics, but they're still, clearly, adults. As with ""American Pie,"" there's a big heart behind the hormones and phermones. But the gags in ""Coupling"" are brilliantly written and executed. The writers don't take the easy way out; the bawdiness of their humor is cut with intelligence and a really, REALLY great sense of left-field punch lines. Maybe naysayers have to wander through the bereft nature of many American sitcoms to understand why ""Coupling"" is so appreciated by a cult American audience, but it's the real deal.<br/><br/>Episode 4 of Season 1, called ""Inferno,"" contains an extended monologue in which an embarrassed male character attempts to outline the plot of a lesbian porn film. He is forced to defend his affection for the stuff by being asked to give a cogent plot summary. He's squirming under this challenge -- he's got to defend his proclivities, maintain a balance between self-defense and self-effacement, and STILL intellectualize the plot of the film enough to prove he's smart enough to rise above it. This whole sequence is, possibly, the best-written and funniest 5-minute quasi-monologue ever to be televised.<br/><br/>""Coupling"" takes a traditionally pubescent subject matter, the puerile male fascination with sex, opposes it with the progress of rational thought, and is extremely funny in the process. Lots of US sitcoms (and some UK ones) are lucky if they get one horse laugh from the viewer every three minutes. ""Coupling's"" ratio is more like one horselaugh every thirty seconds. It's that good.<br/><br/>(I never saw the NBC version of this show, incidentally, and have no interest -- apparently it sucked.  I can understand why someone would want to use the BBC version as source material, though.)",64 out of 74 found this helpful.,,24 February 2004
1975,Coupling," Hilarious, Mature, and Intelligent","A British show about six people ultimately connected by ""coupling"" (relationships) more than just friendship ... thus this is not really a ""British Friends,"" but is a sort of ""British Seinfeld.""  It is sharper than ""Friends"" and the characters are more complex than ""Seinfeld"" (which has one ""straight"" guy and three knuckleheads), a good combination. The ""Seinfeld"" influence is specifically shown by the Jeff character, who outrageously explains different relationship concepts in a Seinfeld-like way, a sort of invented language.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the characters are all more mature ... having real jobs, unlike say Kramer or the ne'er'do'well George. The show at times has mature humor, but it earns it by being a mature show ... these are not the twentysomethings (now in their mid-thirties and much more boring) of ""Friends"" or the largely childish ""Seinfeld"" gang, these are mature adults with serious concerns, even if they are portrayed in often amusing ways. And they don't submit to the lowest common denominater or do things quite in the meanspirited way at times seen in ""Seinfeld."" And the fact there are six interrelated individuals makes things more complicated ... but still, the ""friend"" aspects of it all aren't really emphasized as much.<br/><br/>The show also is often hilarious, much so than the often mildly amusing (and less so in recent years, but then again, there are so fewer episodes of this show) ""Friends."" A particular find is Jane ... the egotistical sexual focused nut ... her very voice is funny. Susan is the beauty that is levelheaded, but she is played by a gifted comic actress as well. The other roles are also well played.<br/><br/>I don't know if the US version will know how to translate all of these positives to our shores, but I hope so.

1976,Coupling, Fantastic!,"One of the best sitcoms for many years. Clever comedy that doesn't cross the pond well. Each episode is an absolute gem, written to tease and tantalise you towards its climax which usually isn't quite what you thought it was going to be. It's Friends with intelligent humour. Overblown as the characters are you can relate to each and every one of them and the two straight characters offset the other four so perfectly you're never quite sure which you'd rather be. Jeff who is so cringe-worthy but lands himself in the most incredible positions, Patrick with his suave naivety and ignorance but with the image, the job and the reputation. Then Steve the calm centre who is anything but calm, full of doubt and fear and so like you that it's uncanny. Facing off against these three we have the panic-ridden self-obsessive Sally, the utterly ditzy but so desireable Jane and the seemingly composed Susan with her devilish streak.<br/><br/>The episode about Jeff and the prosthetic leg without doubt made me laugh more than anything I have ever watched - except perhaps the first viewing of Del Boy keeling over in that Wine Bar in Fools 'n' Horses but where that was one moment this is half an hour of gut-aching laughter.",15 out of 16 found this helpful.,,23 March 2004

Six friends in the city living out their lives. But what Moffat has created is a comedy with multiple levels, superb plots and fantastic comedy. The performances from the six main actors are superb. Mention must be made of Richard Mylan (Oliver Morris Series 4 -)who had the difficult job of stepping into the shoes of Richard Coyle (Jeff Series 1-3), while Jeff is holidaying in Lesbos (cue many Lesbian jokes). Mylan does this successfully and , with the help of Moffat, has created a Jeff-like character but a character who is distinctly not Jeff. The Programme is quite simply the best sitcom on British TV.",42 out of 51 found this helpful.,,5 January 2005
1978,Coupling, The best comedy TV series I've ever watched!,"This is, by far, the best comedy with best lines I've ever watched, and maybe the best of all considering relationships between men and women. I simply couldn't stop laughing and it's hard to make some more describing comment for this big piece of comedy art. It's simply impressive how besides very open language and pretty open conversations about anything in this relationship and sex area, there is nothing offensive in the script, and how almost every sentence is hilariously funny. ALthough all main characters are really great, I am almost more impressed with female characters because in many series of this (or any) type, they tend to be cliché, plain boring or stupid, or just annoying, but not these girls. They are cool as much as male characters even though writer is a guy. And that's just wonderful! Total recommendation, a must see!",14 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,29 May 2008
1979,Coupling, hilarious,I don't like British shows (excluding Dr Who and Red Dwarf) and I find sex jokes vulgar. Coupling changed my mind and within a month of seeing one episode I bought the whole series. Yes there are many many sex jokes in this show but their delivery is not vulgar the way they are in American shows. I'm quite disappointed that there are only 4 seasons. Each show cracks me up totally. You cannot watch just one episode you must watch them all. The cast is perfectly suited to their roles and it is nice to see Jack Davenport dressed in something that is not comparable to a Mardi Gras float.<br/><br/>The Americans did try to make their own version and failed miserably as usual (see Dr Who and Red Dwarf US versions). Perhaps the Americans should stick to Pie and Scary movies and quit trying to copy the Brits.,12 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,1 June 2006
1980,Coupling," Perhaps, perhaps...definitely","This is, without question, the best situation comedy I have seen in a good many years. As a devout follower of the medium, an expert in its ways and a firm believer that it is NOT dead, but rather misunderstood, I can state unequivocally that ""Coupling"" is as good as it gets.<br/><br/>I will not belittle this show by comparing it (as everyone else seems so fond of doing) to ""Friends"" ""Seinfeld"" and ""Sex and the City"" three American comedy series to which it bears fleeting resemblances. There is nothing that p***es me off than taking an original and innovative show and trying to explain it by cramming together a handful of old shows. It is a show about single friends who discuss love, dating and sex but there the similarities end...<br/><br/>Except to ""Friends"" I guess, seeing as there are three girls and three boys...anyway...<br/><br/>The strength of the show comes from the same place that it does in all great shows, and that is in the characters. Compare ""Star Trek"" to the obviously superior ""Next Generation."" The difference? The former is concept-driven while the latter is character-driven. So ""Coupling"" may be a show about nothing, but unlike ""Seinfeld"" it is saved by seven wonderful characters.<br/><br/>Primarily ""Coupling"" is about Steve and Susan, who are quite clearly ideal for one another but keep splitting up because Steve is stupid and indecisive and Susan is strict and unrelenting. But they gravitate back together with alarming regularity. Joining these two are Patrick (Susan's Ex), a ridiculously well-endowed pursuer of S-E-X and little else, Jane (Steve's Ex), a self-obsessed, delusional, bisexual horror who, in her capacity as a traffic reporter, has caused several accidents, Jeff (Steve's best friend and a coworker of Susan's), who is like a twelve-year-old boy who just discovered sex and hasn't grown out of his obsession with boobies, and Sally (Susan's best friend) torn between her own obsessions, one with sleeping with Patrick and another with looking forever young. In the fourth series, a new character was introduced, a nervous, comic shop owner with what can only be described as ""verbal diarrhea,"" Oliver is a charming addition to this group of confused singles.<br/><br/>Here's the number one reason why British shows are better than American shows: After the opening titles of ""Coupling"" after all six of the cast members' names have been listed the ONLY credit that we see (apart from the actors) is ""By Steven Moffat."" Writing is the first and most important ingredient to a good show. ""Fawlty Towers,"" ""Absolutely Fabulous,"" ""The Office,"" ""Blackadder,"" and ""Father Ted"" were not created by a staff under pressure from network execs. Each was the vision of but one writer.<br/><br/>Okay, I guess that's everything. And since I can't think of a clever ending I shall simply stop right here.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,,19 August 2004
1981,Coupling, Excellent Show About Relationships,"The USA have made all my favourite TV dramas, but when it comes to humor, no one beats the UK. Every year I must watch one or two shows that make me think, ""Wow, this is the greatest comedy show I've ever seen!"" A couple of years ago it was The League of Gentlemen, then The Mighty Boosh, then The IT Crowd. Last year it was The Thick of It, and indeed it's very, very hard to top Malcolm Tucker's foul-mouthed tirades and the government's screw ups he has to solve. But for now I'll go with Coupling as the best comedy show ever.<br/><br/>Coupling is a deceptively simple show about relationships - between sexes, between friends, between husband and wife, between rivals - but it's made with quirkiness, a great cast and some of the most intelligent dialogue ever to grace TV. Steven Moffat, the writer, loads the dialogues with insightful and original observations about language, human behaviour, the different way men and women think about certain topics like sex, faithfulness, marriage, etc., that makes this show one of the sharpest modern treatises on human relationships of our times. I think male and female viewers, watching this show, will frequently nod, ""He's absolutely right!,"" even when he's saying something very insolent about men and women.<br/><br/>He's also helped by an excellent cast - Jack Davenport, Richard Coyle (the real star of the show, who sadly left after season 3), Ben Miles, Kate Isitt, Gina Bellman, Sarah Alexander, and the under-appreciated Richard Mylan (who has the unenviable task of replacing Coyle as the crazy, wacky character); they worked well together and their friendship and occasional spats were convincing and emotional. Richard Coyle stole the show as the socially awkward, sex-crazy Jeff - any scene with him is unforgettable, as are the weird situations he gets himself into. He sadly left the show after three seasons. Although I missed him, I disagree with some who think the show took a nosedive in the last series - Mylan was quite good as the comic book store owner Oliver, an insecure but lovable geek.<br/><br/>In fact the last season has many of my favourite episodes. One of the things that made Coupling so good was that it also played with timelines and parallel stories, and sometimes told stories out of order. In episode 4.1 we have the same story told from three perspectives, and 4.2 has one of the highlights of the show, a phone conversation that starts with two people and ends with the five characters all getting in it. Moffat's scripts are brilliant at a sense of crescendo - they start small and turn into epic situations that completely distort the everyday world. And what of 4.5, when Jane visits Oliver's porn-filled apartment? As far as hilariously embarrassing moments, only Jeff stripping naked in front of his co-workers tops it.<br/><br/>Coupling is one of the few TV shows I'd call perfect. The writing, the acting, the jokes, the timing, everything is just right about it. It's a pity it didn't go on for more seasons, but then probably it wouldn't have been so good. Excellence can only be sustained for so long. So thanks to Moffat and the cast for four amazing seasons!",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,26 June 2012
1982,Coupling," Possibly the best ""sitcom"" ever","Every episode of Coupling (22 to date) has been a brilliant gem showing just what is possible when you start with the assumption that your audience has an IQ higher than paste and is comprised of adults.  The show is wickedly funny, occasionally profane, and smartly written the writers (and their cast) never back down.<br/><br/>One can only hope that the intelligence of the show is not totally destroyed by NBC's remake, although home seems faint.",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,15 May 2003
1983,Coupling, apples and oranges,"First, this show is nothing like Friends. Comparing Coupling to Friends is comparing apples and oranges. They've both got three male and three female leads, and that's about the only similarity. To those who think that that's enough to call the two shows variations on the same theme I would like to say: congratulations, you can count to six. You are slightly smarter than a rabbit.<br/><br/>Friends is about friendship. You could develop an allergy to hugging by just watching one episode. Coupling is about sexual attractiveness; how we exploit it and how we deal with getting stung by it. The jokes may be cheap at times, but the telling is never crude; nakedness is suggested, rather than shown.<br/><br/>Coupling could have been, say, five gay guys and a straight one. The jokes would have worked as well (different jokes, of course), but then the series probably would have been compared to Kids in the Hall. Sigh. I guess I should just be glad that Coupling does not (yet) play in New York, because then we would be in a comparitivational quagmire.<br/><br/>Also, the Jeff character is not all that brilliant. Sure, he's the crackpot, the clown. They had them in circuses, you know? Where Seinfeld's Kramer is off the map, Jeff is just normal abnormal. The true funniness of this show--and it is funny, let me assure you of that!--stems from the sharp observations, and these are made by all the cast, including but not limited to Jeff.<br/><br/>I liked Rob Belcher's review. He wrote: ""this show will speak to anyone who's ever dated, been in a relationship, or just noticed that men and women are different creatures."" But if you really want to get a taste of the show, don't rely on these reviews, but visit the official web site, which has clips and quotes (including the 'breasts with brains' and 'sock gap' bits). Judge for yourself.<br/><br/>If you want to see similar British humour, I recommend ""Game On!""<br/><br/>(P.S. I like Friends too, but for totally different reasons, which is just as well, as it is a totally different show.)",65 out of 100 found this helpful.,,17 July 2003
1984,Coupling, I've seen it all ..,"Having seen all the Brit version on DVD I can assure anyone that it is the best Brit comedy since Monty Python .. funnier than Fawlty Towers. <br/><br/>It isn't above adolescents, but it is aimed at thirty somethings. If I were to criticize it, I would complain that there were not enough episodes, as Brit seasons have shorter runs than the US. <br/><br/>The six characters are well balanced, three guys and three girls. They are in various stages of being couples. One couple are cohabiting, another are getting along and another are learning to see eye to eye.<br/><br/>The structure of the episodes involve great comic timing, occasionally a single act is played from six different perspectives to great effect.<br/><br/>This is a series that is not just about love, it is made with love. Detail is observed in the smallest. Things change, characters that lose a limb one week don't have it grown back the next. It wouldn't surprise me if you found yourself in these characters.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,,24 January 2005
1985,Coupling, Steven Moffat is a genius !,"Steven Moffat has created the best TV show in history of television.

1986,Coupling, It is fantastic.,"I comment in response to the first comment listed which was very negative. Coupling is a very quick paced, intelligent comedy. It could go over the heads of some people. Granted, it will be more funny to those who have been in the dating game for a little while. While some of the scenarios might not specifically remind you of yourself, there is enough truth to remind you that the world really is a small place. It will be hard to follow at times, also if you cannot relate to United Kingdom current events. However, the references to British popular culture can be worked through with the context clues they provide.

1987,Coupling, Coupling - A classic Brisitsh Comedy,"Coupling goes to the heart of male-female relationships. Confusion, misunderstanding, and a complete inability of one gender to understand the emotional space occupied by the other. And it is hilariously funny. For me the character, Jeff, steals the show. His bizarre, off beat, surreal interpretation of what it means to be a man is classic. This could only be done by British TV. It is too subtle, to nuanced, to be tackled by US sitcoms, where the characters look at the audience and wait for the laughs to come. But perhaps the writer and director should be acknowledged for their light handedness and their wisdom to allow the characters to 'speak for themselves'. It does not get any better than this.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,1 July 2006
1988,Coupling, The Best Romantic Sitcom I've watched,"Steven Moffat - the writer/creator of this show - is a genius. He wrote this entire show of 28 episodes all by himself.

To compare with American sitcoms (e.g. Friends), in the show Coupling, as a British show, the comedy materials are more closely packed. When talk about and joke about sex, the Brits are more straightforward.<br/><br/>What I like most about the show, is that there's intellectual sharpness in the dialogue (occasionally with a shade of dark humour). That's something you can hardly find in any other romantic sitcom.<br/><br/>Watching this show, it once again confirmed my impression that British writers invest more of their brain and heart than writers of other countries do.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,7 May 2019
1989,Coupling, Hilarious Britcom,"When a friend of mine told me that Coupling was the ""British version of Friends"", I was ready to give it a pass since I find Friends banal, stupid, and unfunny.  I told him I would watch one show and make up my mind from there.  Was I glad I did.<br/><br/>This show has me in stitches every week, and by the end, my ribs are hurting from laughing so hard.  I never got that from any episode of Friends.<br/><br/>
The characters of Steve, Jeff, Patrick, Susan, and Jane are funny.  The other female character, Sally, is annoying since she spends most of her time whining because she is in love with Patrick, and Patrick doesn't love her. If she's not whining about Patrick, she's usually whining that she has her mother's neck, and that seems to be a fate worse than death.<br/><br/>
Steve breaks out into long monologues that have you practically rolling on the floor by the time he's finished.  One such monologue consisted of a diatribe about not having a lock on the bathroom door, and how the bathroom is the last room of privacy for men.  This also included a rant about how men don't understand potpourri (""Looks like breakfast, smells like your Auntie"").<br/><br/>Jeff is a true space cadet, and one never knows what is going to come out of his mouth next.  Jeff runs a close second in making the show next to Steve's monologues.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best British comedy to come along since the classic Are You Being Served?",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,20 April 2003

1991,Coupling," Should be on anyone's list of 20 TV Shows To See Before You Die. ""Coupling"" is simply one of the funniest and most inventive sitcoms ever.","Network: BBC America; Genre: Sitcom; Content Rating: TV-MA (for profanity and pervasive innuendo and sexual content); Available: DVD; Perspective: Classic (star range: 1 - 5); <br/><br/>Seasons Reviewed: Complete Series (4 seasons) <br/><br/>Don't let the rancid after-taste of NBC's feeble attempt at a remake back in 2003 frighten you off (as it almost did me) from the original British creation that is ""Coupling"". But the remake was a scene-for-scene remake, how could the original possibly be that much better? Are the performances really that much better as to overcome such potentially stale material? Well, simply, yes. Because while NBC's bastardized version had the words on the page, it didn't have the spirit, the heart and it didn't have Jack Davenport, Richard Coyle and Gina Bellows. Now let's forget this and flash back 3 years prior.<br/><br/>When Steve (Jack Davenport) breaks up with his ex (Gina Bellows), he falls for Susan (Jane Alexander), the ex or his friend, Patrick (Ben Miles),. As Steve and Susan enter into the tumultuous winding road of a relationship, this brings all of their friends together, including caustic, self-loathing Sally (Kate Isitt) and sexual man-child Jeff (Richard Coyle).<br/><br/>With it's 3 guys/3 girls cast, ""Coupling"" has most often been compared to a British version of ""Friends"". Except that ""Coupling"" is smart, creative, insightful, howlingly funny and generally better in every imaginable way. I'd prefer to compare it to an American product that is worthy of this comparison. Different than ""Sex and the City"" in that it focuses on the progression of a single relationship, and sharing ""Seinfeld's"" fanatical obsession with picking apart the minutia of social mores - ""Coupling"" works so brilliantly because it narrows its sights on one thing and smokes it into the ground. That one thing: the sex joke.<br/><br/>The sex joke. A time honored crutch by hack comedians and writers everywhere. The sitcom landscape is riddled with them, most of them tacky, 90% of them unfunny. But in ""Coupling"", creator Stephen Moffet elevates the sex joke to a witty art form with an unparalleled wit and imagination. Every single episode of the show's 4 season run deals with pulling apart and critiquing some aspect of sex and relationships from a fresh point of view.<br/><br/>Going down the list of all the things that can annoy me about a sitcom, I find that ""Coupling"" lacks or directly contradicts all of them. Canned laugh track? Not here. The nagging know-it-all woman paired with a spineless man cliché? Nope, the show is too well written for that. Behold as Jack Davenport grabs a page-long monologue from the script and tears the through scene with a feverish rant, usually standing up for the male perspective that is usually just marginalized to a corner in an American sitcom. The bathroom is a man's sanctuary, men like looking at breasts and they don't know what the hell a couch cushion is for. Davenports' rant at the end of ""Inferno"" (a modern classic episode all around) is worth the price of a DVD purchase alone.<br/><br/>Equally well written are the women, who strike back at the guy's long-standing befuddlement over sex and their bodies with clever clarity. ""What's so difficult about Front and Center"", a line spoken by Jane while critiquing her lover had me wondering why I'd never heard this before on TV. Susan, Sally and Jane know the power of their own sexuality and wield it like a weapon against any ""half-man half-erection"" in their path.<br/><br/>The way Moffett tells his stories never flags in it's invention. He can't just give us a comedy of errors, he constructs just about every episode through a complex series of flashbacks, metaphorical dream sequences, time shifts and multiple character points of view. Holding back on just the right bits of information and weaving it all together to maximize the delivery of every joke. Season 3's remarkable ""Split"" is literally told entirely in split-screen. Season 4's ""Night Lines"" finds everyone crossing phone lines with hilarious complication. ""Remember This"" takes the cake for intertwining the male/female perspective on a single event brilliantly.<br/><br/>Like any great sitcom, the strength and cohesion of this cast cannot be understated. Richard Coyle makes Jeff Murdoch one of the best spastic side-kicks in TV history. Which is why his departure from the series leaves a huge hole in the final season. A hastily conceived replacement in Oliver (Richard Mylan in an uphill battle) along with a pregnancy story makes season 4 in every way feel like a series that is winding down. It also starts straining reliability. Moffett had me at The Naked Window, The Giggle Loop and even The H-Word, but when he starts relating childbirth to The John Hurt Moment in ""Alien"" - I just can't go there.<br/><br/>While the show is crammed with more ""Seinfeldian"" catch-phrases than you can fight off with a torch, there is such warmth and intelligence behind the show. Under the clothes ""Coupling"" finds it's biggest laughs in the differences between men and women, depicting us as worlds apart, attempting to overcome ludicrous communication and perception hurdles in order to simply cohabiting under the same roof in relative peace.<br/><br/>""Coupling"" is simply one of the all-around best studio-audience sitcoms ever. Trust me when I tell you that if nothing else the laughs this show has to offer are huge.<br/><br/>* * * * * / 5",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,,22 March 2008
1992,Coupling, More Than Sparks of Brilliance,"Of the English comedies I've seen, this is my favorite. The name and tag line are perhaps a bit misleading; the shows' humor is often insightful and goes beyond the amusing display of mating rituals, it exposes the differences between men and women and here and there provokes philosophical questions. Of course, at the same time, it's completely hilarious and technically brilliant, to a degree that you can't wait to watch an episode again right when you're still seeing it the first time. Actually, I've watched most episodes at least 5 times and only occasionally got tired of certain scenes. This is largely because many of the jokes derive both from the situation and from the characters, so that you need to get to know the individuals' peculiarities first to ""get"" certain lines' full hilarity. The show also uses a lot of modern techniques like split screen or anachronical narration which really make the scenes dynamic and effective. The humor comes along incredibly well-timed this way, especially when switching between different perspectives of one situation. Actually, this change between viewpoints (usually male and female) is done so well and with such almost unmatched routine that it seriously restored my faith in the TV series as an art form in general. It's also remarkable that the characters work very well within this concept, and work well together. The original cast was perhaps some kind of once-in-a-lifetime chance, especially the chemistry between Kate Isitt and Ben Miles is amazing. Many viewers may say that Richard Coyle as Jeff steals the show, but I don't feel like he's even the most amusing character, Gina Bellman impresses as the naively mad Jane, and Ben Miles as Patrick, the (on the surface) self-assured macho, those two pretty much naturally utter one incredible line after another. The roles however also lead me to the negative points. Steve and Susan, although performed well, don't have the built-in hilarity Jeff or Jane have, perhaps because they're based on real-life figures and therefore the most ""normal"" characters. Sally Harper's role gets repetitive as she continuously rants about her fear of getting old and the impact of that process on her body. And obviously, it was completely impossible for Oliver Morris to ""replace"" Jeff. Even with all prejudice aside, Richard Coyle just doesn't convince, which may not only be his fault. The Oliver character is just flat and is doomed to annoy rather than amuse, because his clumsiness is pretty much the only feat he has. Also, here and there the characters seem to get sold for a plot twist, and certain joke formulas are repeated too often, prime example the cases when one of the male characters refers to a woman's looks and gets in a muddle by making absurd comparisons. Still, those are rarely occurring faults of an almost perfect series that, even in dramatic or romantic moments, always manages to come up with a laugh, and which may stun you with its well-pointed plots.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,31 August 2007

I haven't been so excited about a new show in years, and I love the way they blend the dramatic, the humorous, the mystical and the mundane. This show takes all the appeal of myth and legend and flawlessly applies it to modern life, allowing us to connect to the characters on a human level while still giving us a well-done version of the occult. No other show on the air today delivers so many forms of entertainment at once.",86 out of 108 found this helpful.,10.0,26 February 2009
1999,Being Human," ""A ghost, a werewolf and a vampire walk into a..."" sounds like a bad joke, but it's all good!!","""A ghost, a vampire and a werewolf walk into a..."" Okay, I'm sure you've heard it a hundred times and it sounds like the beginning of a really bad joke but it really is the beginning to some of the best spec-fic TV you'll probably ever see. George the werewolf, Annie the ghost and Mitchell the vampire are roommates in an apartment in Bristol where they try to live a ""normal"" life. But they find that life after life is complex and unforgiving. And the ""normal"" people can be as frightening as the monsters. Dealt with allegorically in the show are addictions, clinical behavioral problems and mental illness to name a few. Well-rounded characters and oddly familiar situations tinged with the supernatural keep us eager to walk the road with the series' three protagonists. Be advised...this is not Twilight. This is grown-up TV with all the blood, sex and blue language that keeps it interesting for the post-pubescent set. The writing and acting are top-notch and each ensuing episode makes you ravenous for the next. Season II can't come soon enough.",36 out of 43 found this helpful.,10.0,20 September 2009
2000,Being Human, Good old fashioned comedy/drama with some horror on the side,"I am very pleased with Being Human.<br/><br/>I believe that the US have lost sight of what's really important in film/TV, particularly depth of character. All I see in American film and TV these days are a bunch of clichéd characters who speak in one-liners and catch-phrases.<br/><br/>Not the case with British film and TV - apart from Guy Ritchie films, tic.<br/><br/>Like ""Dog Soldiers"", Being Human relies on old technology to make their Werewolf work. So what, the wolf looks fake. You can look beyond it as the rest of the show is excellent.<br/><br/>Being Human has stayed true to the crux of Horror, which is the Supernatural element. Nowadays too often we see ""genetically mutated"" monsters, which takes the fear factor out of it all. If it bleeds, we can kill it (and easier than we thought).<br/><br/>Being Human is beautifully written, superbly cast and has its own feel; one you can immerse yourself in. It's simple viewing without being too predictable or too tame.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I would be happy to watch further installments of this show for the next 5 years and not be bored with it, provided the writing remains as refreshing as it is at the moment.<br/><br/>For me, Being Human is about the relationships between the characters and the anticipation of something ""big"" happening in each episode.

2001,Being Human," Despise it's premise it is really, really good BUT","Once again, a thing they often manage only in British TV-Shows. When you read the premise you will eventually scratch your head. A ghost, a werewolf and a vampire sharing a flat - sounds like goofy comedy plot line. But the the show turns out to be one of the best things i've seen within the last years of TV-series. It's surprisingly heartwarming, quirky and sometimes damn dark.<br/><br/>At the beginning, in the first couple of episodes the plot takes some time to finds its way, but I was so involved with main characters it did not bother me.<br/><br/>Through the time the plot gets more and more grim and even with the shows limited resources they manage to deliver you to the end of season 3 an almost apocalyptic scenario.<br/><br/>The writer and the cast are doing a really good job here, thanks again for British Television Shows! <br/><br/>BUT one thing is left to say - therefore the spoiler warning - Best thing would be, if you stop watching the show after Season 3. If the show had stopped there, if I could rate the first 3 Seasons only, I would rate it with a 9. Yes I am maybe a bit of a Fanboy here. But the story arc is so well completed, and you leave the show (maybe a bit sad) at its height. After Season 3 the show really stumbles and sadly cannot live up to it's own high stakes anymore.

2003,Being Human, Excellent....until season 3,"This was a 10/10 until I just watched season 3. I must say what a disappointment. Its taking a show that started with a comical perspective on some of the darker things in our minds...and ends season 3 with all the class of a cheap soap opera? The final episode was just awful! Obviously constructed off-the-cuff with no thought whatsoever. It was as if they made it up as they went. The best part was....killing an attacking werewolf with a kitchen knife?...come on...it wasn't even silver! I think reducing Mitchell to babbling fool was another mistake, he was the pivotal character in the whole series, with a depth and dimension unmatched by any other character in the story. His conflicted personality is a great touch, but to reduce a 100+ year old vampire to that level over love is to be quite honest, ridiculous. This is supposed to be a supernatural thriller, not a 'Days of Our Lives' competitor. Annie adds to the program with her illogical and irritating behavior, George and Ninas characters however just show a lack of any common sense or perspective. I can see what the writers are trying to achieve with 'monsters' trying to maintain morality, but they fail dismally as their opinions and actions lack any kind of connection with reality.",19 out of 25 found this helpful.,4.0,31 May 2011

2005,Being Human, Incredibly good acting.,"The premise: a vampire, werewolf and ghost live together is about as silly as you could imagine. However the acting is so spectacularly good, you are instantly sucked in. There is some humour, (such as ageless vampire cutie moon-eyeing an aged past girlfriend), but they play it with a straight face. Russell Tovey as George the reluctant werewolf is perhaps the best actor I have ever seen in a TV series. He plays with his appearance to change from a Matt Damon clone to a complete dork to Truman Capote. He plays with his voice, ranging over every possible emotion. He is always surprising you with a new angle to his character. His screams of pain as he transforms into a werewolf are unbearable. He is completely convincing. I fell madly in love with with his character. He was just so open, with such heart, complex yet easy to understand.<br/><br/>Annabel Scholey made me hate her so intensely the instant she came on screen. She projects such a strongly nauseating personality with just some fine control of her facial muscles. She has that knack like nobody else. She was also able to make her character gradually more sympathetic, all through body language. Other actors should study how she does this.<br/><br/>The other actors too are done in Kodachrome, a bit more out there, trying something unusual. This does not feel like TV or a movie for that matter, perhaps more like a play.<br/><br/>The episodes are quite long, and it feels like the writers could not come up with enough minor plot elements to fill them. So they pad with meandering dialogue, that feels much like real life, but left me itching for them to get on with the show. The ground rules of how reality works in this strange universe are just incidentally explained. You often see some strenuous conflict without knowing what fuels it. The major plot elements are full of big surprises, however -- very clever.<br/><br/>There are not many special effects. The ghost just appears without any fade-in. Most of the transformation to a wolf occurs off camera. The main thing you see are a series of bumps appear long George's back. Sometimes you watch people's reaction to what would be a special effect rather than the special effect itself. This works surprisingly well.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,3 August 2012
2006,Being Human, The best thing I've seen since The Dresden Files,"I am in love with a new TV show. I don't know if it will air here in America but if it did it would likely be cut to shreds. Each episode is fifty seven or so minutes long so that's like fifteen minutes that would need to be cut from each episode to fit in an American time slot, not to mention there's a lot of gore that they wouldn't get away with showing here and a scene of someone giving the finger.<br/><br/>Background: Being Human was a British special that aired last year in an hour time slot. Now one year later it's an actual on going series on BBC 3 (Since I am American I have been I having to rely on British friends to watch the show). I absolutely love it. I love it nearly as much as I loved Dresden files when it was new. It's serious but has some great moments of wit.<br/><br/>The plot is about a ghost, a werewolf and a vampire living together and despite that it's actually very serious. They each are trying to function in the real world. The ghost (Annie) is agoraphobic and when she gets emotional normal people might not see her. The werewolf (George) has typical werewolf angst after being turned ala the same sort of scenario as An American werewolf in London. The vampire (Mitchell) is reminiscent if Nick Knight from Forever Knight in that he tries to avoid vampirism temptation while other vampires try to persuade him to embrace his vampire nature.<br/><br/>The TV series continues where the original TV special left off. In episode 1 it continues after the events of the pilot / special in which Mitchell had just turned his girlfriend into a vampire without really meaning to and now she resents him for abandoning her and not embracing his vampire nature. Like with most modern stories with vampires and werewolves the vampires view themselves to be superior to werewolves and poor George is subjected to insults like dog, etc...<br/><br/>There's serious drama and moments of fun comedy and they pick great well known songs to set the moods of the scenes. The actress who played Annie in the film is not the actress here and it's not the same Mitchell either but I like these actors, possibly even more than the originals from last year's special. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this show to anyone who likes modern urban fantasy of strange beings living among us and trying to pass for ordinary.<br/><br/>I don't know if BBC America will ever get it but I think BBC America or the Scifi channel here in the USA need to buy this up NOW. It's great. I'm addicted.",17 out of 24 found this helpful.,10.0,30 January 2009

2008,Being Human, Finally human?,"Last ever episode of BEING HUMAN last night and it was a stonker. That's a Brit term for a huge bombardment (from the First World War, IMDb spell-checker, but now it means it was a genius episode).<br/><br/>Beautifully written and acted, this series just got better and better, surviving even the total replacement of its cast with an even better cast. How many times does that happen? Not a perfect ending but satisfying, depending on which version of reality you prefer. Don't read on if you don't want spoilers but I applauded the final ambiguity even though I wanted to believe that BEING HUMAN finally delivered on its inherent promise.<br/><br/>That said, BEING HUMAN was never afraid to step into the melodrama ring with the big American champions like SUPERNATURAL and swing way above its weight with a fraction of their budgets. It did it with wit and charm and a genuine love of its characters and was never afraid to put its characters through hell to pull out those brilliant comic moments.<br/><br/>Last night it was the return of the Potter's Wheel at just the right moment. I can't explain that any further.

2009,Being Human, They'll have to cut this to bits for the US remake.,"It's not just the swearing, the blood and the nudity. It's the unaffected emotion at its core. Annie's abusive relationship with Owen continues after death, George emits pitiful shrieks of agony and terror as he transforms, and Mitchell's attempts to shake off his bad-boy persona lead him to make a terrible mistake. Watch the final scene with Bernie and Fleur in Ep 4 and tell me you slept well. Watch the clumsy but affectionate sex between George and Nina and tell me you didn't laugh like a drain. Mitchell's last goodbye to his old girlfriend is a real tear jerker. Watching the hospital chaplain vomit with fright, you realise that's how real people behave. And in between, they bicker just lie real flatmates. I've lived in houses where every flat surface contained a dirty cup.<br/><br/>OK, the werewolf is ridiculous. The hair's wrong, the posture's wrong, everything's wrong. An accurate wolf would have been worse. George turns in to a skinny grey Alsatian and knocks over dustbins? Pffft.<br/><br/>I also think that at least some of the vampires could have worn pastels or tweed; the Reservoir Dogs/emo/gypsy look has been done to death.

2010,Being Human, Being Human Season 1,"Let me make this review short and simple. First of all, I like British television, some of them are even better than US mediocre, oh and don't forget those accents, I can watch anything based on that accent only. So, when I heard about Being Human produced by BBC, I was ecstatic! The first season have 6 episodes only, with an hour long each. The first few episodes was fulfilling, the great story lines, actors and emotions were amazing! But I got irritated when the same pattern is repeated till the end of the series. I like long hours movie, I like drama and emotions, but Being Human tells story about supernatural creatures who 'try' to fit in and be as human as possible. Vampire that doesn't want to kill, a ghost that is too scared and the worst, a werewolf that whines all the time, it's unbearable. The character development is so poor and slow, and that's a shame. I promised myself I won't watch the second season, but hey! who knows things might change.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,6.0,24 October 2011
2011,Being Human, The original (and the best) version of Being Human...,"Everyone's already commented on how a werewolf, a vampire and a ghost trying to live ""normal"" lives together sounds like the start of a bad joke...but it actually makes for great viewing. The cast helps. Unlike a lot of other shows, this show has a small regular cast. I like every one of the main characters and the close 'family' vibe that they've got going on. All 3 of the main actors are perfectly cast in their roles. I LOVE Lenora Crichlow as Annie, in large part due to Lenora's portrayal. Oftentimes, I find perky/cheery characters grate/annoying, but not so with Annie. Her upbeat personality is very endearing and she contrasts nicely against the two guys. She's funny, emotional and kicks major butt on occasion.<br/><br/>Russell Tovey is also great as George. He's the least likely guy you'd expect to be a werewolf, but works SO much better than the typical angst-ridden, brooding 'dark' traditionally ""handsome"" model werewolf guys. Kind of tired of those. Like Annie, George is oftentimes hilarious. Though, unlike her, he can also be a jerk sometimes (the Season 2 premiere springs to mind).<br/><br/>Aidan Turner's Mitchell has a personality so unlike traditional vampires. He actually has a fun/human side to him, which makes him so likable...at least until the end of Season 2, when he becomes quite dark. In a way, Turner being cast in The Hobbit benefited the show in the long run, as not only was it really the only proper end for his character, but it also kick-started the gradual addition of our new regular cast members. <br/><br/>Not many shows could survive losing all their original main leads, and even harder was making the new characters as likable as the original three who we'd grown to love/care about. But they succeeded here. Instead of just being a carbon copy replacement for Mitchell, Damien Molony's Hal had his own distinct look/personality and brought a freshness to the show, along with Kate Bracken's ghostly Alex. She provided quite a bit of humour, and was very different to Annie, yet still worked. I wasn't invested in the Tom character or his plot in Season 3 (my least favourite season of the show), but the new trio of Hal, Alex &amp; Tom worked well. It was a shame we only got one season with them. Then again, it was probably better that the show finished while it was still good, instead of wearing out its welcome like so many shows do. <br/><br/>Sinead Keenan's Nina, who started off as a recurring love interest for George, but later got more involved in events and finally promoted to regular was good for the series. Sure, she started off bitchy and sometimes didn't get along with the others (mainly Mitchell), but she provided a different perspective on things. The way Nina was written out really did a disservice to both the character and actress. In comparison, George's wasn't THAT bad, plus it was emotional. Annie's was quite fitting &amp; she got to kick arse. <br/><br/>Of all the villains on the show, Jason Watkins as Herrick was the best. He brought just the right amount of menace (combined with a wicked sense of humour) to his character. Speaking of, the show's humour is one of its strongest aspects. There are some very funny moments throughout the series which helps lighten the mood, and best of all it's *unexpected*. You're not expecting to laugh, they don't telegraph it with obvious/silly jokes, but when it happens it'll make you laugh out loud. There were just so many memorable funny moments. The show balanced this well with the 'horror' elements. There were some genuinely freaky moments throughout the series. They went to great lengths to create a creepy atmosphere and some actual genuine horror in the show (not to mention some truly gory moments, like in the Season 2 premiere &amp; Season 4 final).<br/><br/>What's also great is seeing an actual *attempt* at having a proper werewolf transformation on TV. Most take the easy way out and either don't show the changing, have bad CGI (like the US remake) or simply have people with bad teeth and in need of manicures instead of actual proper-looking werewolves. Okay, so the finished wolf in the first episode was a bit dodgy, but it got better as time went on. The transformations were what really stood out, though, thanks to their excellent use of prosthetics, animatronics &amp; Tovey's performance. The music used in the show is also excellent. Many a moment is made just that much better due to the choice of songs used, as well as the show's score. Really, the only negatives of the show was some annoying/pointless side characters who were introduced (mainly in Seasons 3 &amp; 5. Season 4's Cutler was pretty good, but Allison was far too irritating). The early seasons actually had some decent side characters (like Ivan &amp; Daisy), but had some horrible ones too (Cara). <br/><br/>We're kind of over-saturated with supernatural-related TV shows, and there's only so many ways they can put a new spin on the stories before they start being retreads of the same thing, but this Being Human went for something different &amp; fresh, which certainly paid off. Seasons 1 &amp; 2 were excellent, 3 was by far the weakest, then the show started coming good again with Season 4 (I actually didn't mind the War Child plot. At least they tried to make an effort with the apocalypse, unlike some other supernatural related shows. Gina Bramhill as Eve also helped. She and Annie had some good moments together). The final season, while not the best, was still a pretty good season to end on. Summing up, this show has great characters, acting, storytelling (for the most part), directing and originality...so why aren't you watching it? Forget the crappy US remake, I gave it a go and it paled in comparison to this amazing series.",13 out of 20 found this helpful.,9.0,25 July 2009
2012,Being Human," Fangs, friendship &amp; fun.","When I saw the pilot, I saw the potential for this series. Three very human ""monsters"", humour, horror. It was good, but not brilliant yet. The cast didn't have the right chemistry. Russell (George) was perfect, but I couldn't stand Mitchell and Annie was okay. I hoped for a sequel, but with certain changes. Then the wait was over - it had been recast &amp; brushed up to perfection. I love the domestic elements and how these three misfits learn not only to trust, but to depend on each other. While I've never been a vampire fan, these vampires smile and joke. They are entertaining. The only character I don't like is Nina, who frustratingly becomes George's girlfriend. Far from being ""angel of mercy"", she's rude and controlling. George deserves so much better. The plot grows and grows with each episode building nicely on the last. By far the best is Episode 5, the finale not managing to do it justice, but good enough. The old fashioned effects with puppetry and contacts are far more impressive than CGI could be. Overall, Series 1 is a howling success. 9/10<br/><br/>Series 2, while having some strong points, is disappointing in that there's less humour and more horror. The balance has been lost. I also lost sympathy for Mitchell and decided Annie was my favourite. And there's too much concentration on the vampires. 6/10",14 out of 25 found this helpful.,8.0,31 January 2010

2016,Being Human, Decidedly underwhelming,"I have to admit that I am completely underwhelmed by this series. Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer my vampires, werewolves and ghosts to have some sort of scare factor going for them. Being Human reduces their existence to a particularly irritating episode of Thirtysomething. The supernatural elements seem like extraneous flourishes to a show that is basically just about a trio of whiners trying to make the best of the crappy hand that life has dealt them. I have endured five episodes of the first season and so far they are pretty much uniform in that the three leads basically spend the episode moping and whining about the unfairness of the universe. Rather than anything especially seductive or magical about any of this, they remind one of a psychotically depressed person who entered a party and then tries to bring the entire room down to their level of hopelessness. There are some fairly impressive werewolf transformation effects, but they are usually followed by the subsequently human werewolf kvetching about his sorry lot in life and how hard he has it. The acting is fairly solid, with both Aidan Turner (the vampire) and Russell Tovey (the werewolf) offering hints that they are better than the material they are handed. Some unintentionally comic elements emerge if you catch this on BBC America where the often naked Tovey has his bits blurred to protect us poor prudish Americans from being corrupted. This could have been an interesting concept if the makers offered some degree of levity, imagination or good old-fashioned entertainment value, but the final result comes off as little more than a yammering reunion of the worst relatives in the Debbie Downer family.",20 out of 57 found this helpful.,2.0,14 July 2010

Basically werewolf George (Doctor Who's Russell Tovey, the only person from the original pilot), ghost Annie (Sugar Rush's Lenora Crichlow) and vampire Mitchell (Aidan Turner) live together and try to be like normal humans, but all have setbacks with their conditions. George is panicky (and really funny in being so) because of his transformation once a month, Annie is wanting to talk to and be seen by certain people but is invisible, and Mitchell is fighting his lust for blood as it is what has kept him alive for decades.

2018,Being Human, What Makes a Monster and What Makes a Man?,"This is a question asked by so many, and answered so brilliantly by the BBC Three version of Being Human. I have seen both versions, and the original has it all in my opinion. It breaks my heart that not enough people have seen it.<br/><br/>I am a sucker for a good supernatural drama, and Being Human is the best one that I have ever seen. At the heart of it all are two trios of a vampire, a werewolf, and a ghost. In the first three series it's Annie, George, and Mitchell. In the last one it's Hal, Tom, and Alex. I know some people recommend only watching the first three series, but I couldn't disagree more. Series four is probably my favorite, and Hal and Tom's chemistry is amazing. Don't do yourself a disservice. Watch all five.<br/><br/>I think a lot of vampire/supernatural dramas make the whole story about sex and gore and teenage drama. My favorite thing about Being Human is it really doesn't question what it takes to make a monster, but instead challenges the audience to think about what makes a man. Every internal problem our characters face is an allegory for a very common issue. Annie is agoraphobic, George has anger management issues, and Mitchell is a sex addict.The characters face relate able problems and interact with each other in a very relate able way.<br/><br/>The show is gory, has some nudity, there's some language, and it's definitely not for young viewers and the faint of heart. But the comedy is golden and perfectly timed, the drama is believable and enjoyable, and at the heart of it all are three people with their own issues who are just trying to make sense of the world around them, something anyone can understand.<br/><br/>Does it have flaws? of course, any show does. There are some weaker episodes, and the effects are a little lackluster, but it all gives it a sort of b-movie feel that one can't help but enjoy.<br/><br/>So give this little show a chance.

GET SMART is a 60's time-capsule, a reminder of a life style that has so long disappeared it hurts to remember!<br/><br/>
No matter how many times you see it - its still funny..it will ALWAYS be funny - it even transcends humor. It is something so comfortable and embraceable you can temporarily forget every day to day hassle that may be niggling at you. For those with even longer memories, Maxwell Smart had his embryonic exposure as the store detective ""Glick"" in the Bill Dana show...almost exactly the same character. No matter, the combination of Don Adams, Barbara Feldon and the long suffering (and late) Ed Platt were arguably the most charismatic acting trilogy ever screened. Dear old Bernie Kopell as Siegfried, Max's nemesis in CHAOS and David Ketchum as the insanely hidden Agent 13 combined to raise GET SMART to heights will never again be assailed. Probably the only show ever came close to being as fondly remembered is the Adam West/Burt Ward BATMAN series of the same period.<br/><br/>Think about it!  How many people in the Western World of most any age have never heard of Max's shoe-phone, the cone of silence? or the phrase ""Would you believe?""   THAT is a measure of the penetration of GET SMART in current society. Along with THE FLINSTONES, our lives have all been enriched by this most enduring of legends!",76 out of 82 found this helpful.,,28 March 2002
2020,Get Smart, The funniest TV show EVER!!,"'Get Smart' holds a special place in the hearts of Australian kids growing up in the 1970s. Throughout that decade it was on almost continuous repeat, and at least two generations of couch potatoes almost had the whole series memorized by the time they graduated high school. But you know what? Watch it today and it's STILL the funniest TV show EVER!<br/><br/>Nobody but Don Adams could have played Maxwell Smart. He IS Maxwell Smart! Adams comic timing and expressions are superb. It's a pity he hasn't gotten the recognition he deserves. Surrounded by the first rate Barbara Feldon ('99') and Edward Platt ('The Chief'), supported by a fabulous group of comic actors (particularly Bernie Kopell as Siegfried), and some talented guest stars (most unforgettable - Larry Storch as 'The Groovy Guru'!), and with consistently funny scripts, this show set a standard in comedy that is as good as, if not better than, much more ""respected"" shows like 'M.A.S.H.', 'Taxi' and 'Cheers'.<br/><br/>Forget the reunions, movies and attempts to revive 'Get Smart'. Just stick with the original and best ""grooovy baby"" Super Spy! There's nothing as hilarious as this show at its best! One of the greatest TV shows of all time.",57 out of 62 found this helpful.,,9 November 2001
2021,Get Smart, Sheer comedy brilliance,"Get Smart stands as the single most brilliant television comedy EVER. Before Hot Shots!, before Frank Drebin, before Airplane!, before Kentucky Fried Movie, before Young Frankenstein, and before Blazing Saddles, there was Get Smart, the creation of Mel Brooks and Buck Henry.  This show, which would go on to inspire Police Squad!, arguably the second most brilliant television comedy ever, presented in Maxwell Smart the most completely asanine leading man thus far in television history, and as a result provided for more stupid jokes than ever before.  Perhaps the first moment in television where comedy did not require a laugh track (though it did USE one, it would have flown fine without one), this show would inspire nearly every film by Mel Brooks and Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker.  Can we really imagine Hedley Lamaar from Blazing Saddles without Maxwell Smart having preceded him?  Can we really imagine Frank Drebin without Maxwell Smart having preceded him?  The answer to these questions MUST be ""no.""  Get Smart was a rare moment in television comedy history, and it has given us a truly rich comedic tradition ever since.

No one's mentioned the ""Coughing Code"" - when the cone of silence breaks down - always ending with Max's line - ""you should do something about that cold Chief"" The casting of the show was perfect. What made the show so great was that the creative plots were intertwined with crazy little sidebars - it's been years but I still remember one episode where 99 was doing a commercial in a tub, and was called away - and the producer/director of the commercial tries to coax his elderly mother in the tub - hilarious...<br/><br/>I wish these episodes were available on DVD...",25 out of 27 found this helpful.,,23 August 2004

It's obvious that the actors are thoroughly enjoying themselves in this show, and this enthusiasm was infectious. I was a very little girl in 1965, and I used to sit up with my father to watch TV after dinner and the nightly installment of whatever book he was reading to us. We sat together and watched Get Smart, Hogan's Heroes, McHale's Navy, among others, all of which are now considered classics. Why? Because, while the shows themselves were very topical (Get Smart was about the Cold War - as is Bullwinkle -- and Hogan and McHale fought in WWII which had ended barely 20 years earlier), the humor itself did not rely on specific current events. They were just out-and-out funny.<br/><br/>They still are.",34 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,24 May 2005
2024,Get Smart, Who says that espionage is slimy?,"""Get Smart"" is one those 1960's sitcoms that was all about really crazy predicaments and blowing peoples' minds (think ""Bewitched"", ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""I Dream of Jeannie""). It follows Maxwell Smart (Don Adams), an inept spy with the organization CONTROL who always has to foil the plans of the dastardly rival organization KAOS. With him are Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon) and The Chief (Edward Platt). Even if you know nothing about espionage or such things, the whole show is still a laugh riot. Whether it's the Cone of Silence (which always proves to be a Cone of Destruction) or Max's shoe-telephone, things always go completely wacky, forcing Max to say ""Sorry about that, Chief."" It's too bad that currently, no channel is rerunning ""Get Smart"", but hopefully, it will soon come out on DVD. You'll love it! <br/><br/>I can safely say that in my eyes, there are only four true supers pies: James Bond, Derek Flynt, Harry Palmer and Maxwell Smart.

2026,Get Smart, Gotta love it!,"Forget ""The Producers"", which was lame anyway.  If you want to see Mel Brooks's earliest work, then watch an episode of Get Smart on TV Land!  Don Adams plays an inept and bumbling spy named Maxwell Smart who has his share of brilliance once in a while.  He works for an origanization called Control.  He teams up with the competent Agent 99 who he falls in love with and eventually get married to in later episodes.  Together they take orders from the chief to take down an evil syndicate called ""Kaos"".  I also liked the hi-tec equipment they used, very innovative for it's time.  I enjoy all those 'tricks' the Max and 99 pull to outwit the Kaos agents!<br/><br/>    Get Smart is a comedic send off of those James Bond and other super-spy movies that were popular in the 1960's.  Another reason why I enjoy Get Smart is how they sometimes use references from The Three Stooges, Charlie Chaplin, and Laurel and Hardy.  From what I've heard, Mel Brooks was a fan of those old comedians from the past!  I thought the best episodes were that two-parter involving the wax museum!  It was called ""House of Max"".  So, don't delay!  Watch Get Smart on TV Land and you won't by disapointed!  It will keep you laughing from beginning to end!

The role of idiot savant Agent 86 Maxwell Smart almost could have gone to Johnny Carson or any one of a thousand other actors of the time, but Don Adams made it his own by creating many of the world's most recognized catch phrases. It's hard to figure out how one man can be the best American secret agent in the world when he'll ask for the annoying cone of silence one minute, then save the day the next. He is either a brillant idiot or a lucky nut. What saves him the most and constantly stands by him is alluringly mysterious and captivating Agent 99 Susan Hilton (according to series creator Buck Henry) played by the talented Barbera Feldon. Edward Platt was their harried and frustrated Chief Harold Clark. Supported by a fine cast of character actors including Bernie Kopell, King Moody, Dick Gautier, David Ketcham and Robert Karvelas, this incredible series spawned two movies and several accomadations for series creators Mel Brooks and Buck Henry.

The plots weren't the point really, the gags were, and the excellent comic characterizations. Check out Bernie Kopell pre Love Boat as KAOS agent Siegfried or Dick Gautier as Hymie.

The story was set in the time which the show aired but it is still adored by many people today for it's witty lines, slap-stick humor, and the collection of humorous expressions that lead actor Don Adams could adorn.  This well-written, well-directed, well-acted t.v. show deserves another run.  I was born 10 years after the sitcom ended, yet I think it is the most imaginative show ever created. I want others born ten years from now to have the same experiences that I did: to fall hopelessly in love with Max, to cheer when 99 finally nabbed You-Know-Who, to wait somewhat impatiently for the outcome in part II of ""And Baby makes Four,"" and to laugh unCONTROLlably when you first hear ""Sorry about that, Chief,"" and all the times afterward.

Here you have Maxwell Smart, a spy for Control and his partner (and later wife), Agent 99, fighting the evil forces of Kaos.  Sent on their missions by the Chief, Max usually managed to make a mess of things, not because he was dumb, but because he was always trying too hard to do it right.  99 would feed Max ideas and make them seem like they were his (and.. .loving it.

""not Craw craw"" thats Mel Brooks humour at its funniest(which also says something). Another good aspect of shows is that Agent 86 is the only incompetent main character so it makes him stand out even more as everyone else while being aware of his clumsiness and stupidity but never mentions anything. One thing that is really good about Get Smart is that it has stood the test of time which so little shows would be able to manage to do nowadays.

But - a little puzzled that some seem surprised by the graphic (and witty!) vulgarity - ""prurient""? yep, definitely! anyone who had seen a promo, or looked at the first 2 minutes - would know that this was not going to be Downton Abbey or The Good Wife. South Florida is a strange &amp; wonderful place - and Claws is worthy of that milieu. <br/><br/>The cast: Niecy Nash has been a particular favorite since the wonderful Reno 911 - happy to see that she has found a perfect showcase. Carrie Preston, sometimes a bit too twee in her Good Wife stint. is letter-perfect,often raunchy funny but also deeply moving in her fragile gentility. Judy Reyes is always a welcome sight - a world away from her Carla on Scrubs. Great secondary characters -eg, the brilliant Dale Dickey, with her face for the ages. Dean Norris and the other males are all good, but the women rule here.<br/><br/>Nash's clothes, like her attitude, are magnificent, the stripper biker funeral in Episode 2 has to be seen to be believed, and Florida looks great.<br/><br/>A last note: ""Tailored to a very specific audience"" as the last line of a rather hateful 1-star review - really?

2045,Claws, A Fun Mix of Breaking Bad and Beauty Shop,"So everyone is going on about the sex and yes maybe it is a little graphic, but it was originally intended for HBO so that's to be expected. It's nothing worse than the sex scenes in Game of Thrones, maybe even a little better because the actual genitals are not flopped in your face, and that's an Emmy winning show with lots of critical acclaim so I fail to see why one show deserves a low rating while the other continues to be praised. Now onto the things I think are good.<br/><br/>The diverse casting is a pleasant surprise and the inclusion of LGBT characters is great! But what I really appreciate is the character of Dean Simms, played by Harold Perrineau. Dean is an autistic man and so far the characterization of him has been pretty accurate. His mannerisms and behaviours are well portrayed and the character certainly isn't a joke character. It's nice to see adults with aneurotypical brains being treated seriously on TV. <br/><br/>The wardrobe is out of this world almost. I can't decide whether or not everything is artfully tacky or if it looks good. Most of Niecy Nash's outfits hit and Judy Reyes looks hella sharp in her suits! AND THE NAILS! You know a show about a nail salon has to have awesome nails and they do. Overall I dig it.<br/><br/>The humor is dark, but that's not a bad thing. In the second episode Nash and Karrueche Tran are loading a body into a boat to dispose of it and they discover another body! ""Who is that?!"" screams Tran only for Nash to go ""I don't know!"" I laughed out loud. And the funeral strippers had me in tears. <br/><br/>On the not so well done side of things, the repeated racial attacks on Tran's character by some of the other characters is getting questionable and Dean Norris' accent is BAD. Like BAD BAD. Plus some of the writing isn't as polished as it could be and they seem to be having a hard time finding things for some of the characters to do that are related to the plot so there is some time spent there that could be better directed elsewhere. Still it's early in the show and everyone is finding their feet right now. I find more I like than more I don't.<br/><br/>Overall this is a fun criminal romp in the playground of a Florida nail salon. I expect good things from it.

2049,Claws, Oh Yeah baby! 💞Crazy and campy and these ladies loyalty and comradery are hilarious!,"Mrs. Shullivan and I have not missed a single episode of this sleeper series and I must say...we just love the many great surprises this newest campy kind of television series that has brought much joy each week to our household. If anyone does not appreciate camp/dramedy/crime and a bit of risky language and sexy innuendo then just stick to your hospital themed life threatening weekly series or the many predictable Law and Order spin offs.<br/><br/>This series has an over abundance of great character regulars. My favorite character though is the recently released from prison Polly, played exquisitely by Carrie Preston. She brings an unrelenting POP to the show Claws with her quirky but menacing weekly performance that just shouts out loud and proud ""I can be very nice to you, but if you screw with any of my lady friends there will be hell to pay!""<br/><br/>The story lines are so varied and they hold our full attention. We just love each episode and how all the ladies who work in the CLAWS salon interact and deliver their unique characters. Of course each lady has at least one man sharing in their lives, and/or in the case of the butchy Quiet Ann character played by former Devious Maids actress Judy Reyes, she has an endless stream of lovers of the female persuasion.<br/><br/>I have no other television series to compare Claws to, as this series is uniquely creative in a category all to themselves, it is so unique, and simply just a breath of comedic fresh air. I hope this dark horse camp/dramedy/crime series wins at least 4 Emmy's during the awards season as not only are the female lead characters terrific the supporting male actors also add a lot of character depth and diversity such as Roller Husser (Jack Kesy), Bryce Husser (Kevin Rankin), Uncle Daddy (Dean Norris) and I simply cannot forget the over the top mentally challenged performance of Dean Simms (Harold Perrineau).

2052,Claws, If Jackie Brown met Pulp Fiction.,"A very underrated series, that honestly deserves a higher rating.
The plot is super entertaining, I never found myself bored watching this show.
There is a lot of sex, but it also makes a lot of witty subtle references.
The setting is unique taking place in central Florida instead of typical Miami.
All of the sub plots are entertaining as well, the first episode is gripping.
Niecey Nash does a great job being the protagonist of the story, while all other co stars do we as well. Even Karruche Tran surprised me with her acting ability, while I must admit is beautifu eye candy.
Dean Norris is a polarizing villain, who can be super entertaining or super scary.
I think people who enjoyed will definitely enjoy this show.
If you don't like sexual content, drug references and usage, and occasional bloody violence you will enjoy this.
Reminds me of an Elmore Leonard novel with a modern Breaking Bad twist.

When you find yourself being sympathetic for even the villains, you know you're on to something good.<br/><br/>Other than Sheryl Lee Ralph's accent and Harold Perrineau's delivery, the casting is spot-on perfect. Niecy Nash, Carrie Preston, an unrecognizable Judy Reyes, Dean Norris, Jack Kesy, et al., will have you completely immersed.

Claws is funny, clever &amp; original with the right amount of quirky thrown in the mix which all goes to accessible entertainment. Well done to the writers.

This top rated cast top build by characters played by nisi Nash, Jean Norris of breaking bad, and Carrie Preston among other very talented actors and actresses.
""Claws"" takes you on a wild ride of drug dealing Dixie Mafia that launders money through a nail salon. And, there's always a backstory that remains intriguing.
Niecy Nash play is the nail salon owner who just so happened to get caught up in laundering money for the mafia's legal pill mill. Each of the characters have their own storylines running parallel to the main storyline regarding the drugs and laundering. There's so much going on at this same time, but the writers and directors are incredibly talented when it comes to making everything run smoothly enough whereas the viewer never gets ""lost.""

Nothing new (except the nail designs) to this tired old druggie series plot. We have bad boy drug daddy w/muscle to provide the action of which there isn't much. A couple of deaths; not believable sex &amp; no nudity to speak of; basically lots of salon level talk &amp; posturing. Finally, of course, competing drug syndicates, in this case Russian, but could be any of the popular ones. Typical twists as control is wrestled away, and then re-wrestled back, and so on.

2063,Claws, Painfully bad writing,"The other bad reviews almost scared me off from watching this, but I had some doubts due to several criticisms being based on fat-shaming, prudishness, and homophobia.<br/><br/>The only good thing about this show is the acting. Unfortunately the script is so bad that even the acting is impossible to enjoy. The characters all seem to be one-dimensional stereotypes, and the lead character is especially annoying due to her apparent lack of any personality.<br/><br/>A major problem seems to be the lack of any consistent atmosphere or genre. The lead is trying to play the serious (bordering on depressing) nail salon/drug business mastermind, while flipping back and forth to nearly surreal scenes of the party scene and the lives of the other salon employees. It's like one character is in a crime drama while the rest are imitating the worst aspects of semi-scripted reality TV. Maybe that would work with the right writers, but this show doesn't have them.<br/><br/>I don't have a problem with the sexual content - except that it's about half of the first episode, and substantially distracts from the story line (assuming there is one) instead of furthering it. Also some of the acting involved in those scenes is poor bordering on ridiculous, and again gets into some pointless weirdness that's disorienting rather than entertaining.<br/><br/>My general impression is that ""Claws"" is attempting to follow in the footsteps of ""Weeds"", a comedy crime drama also featuring a female lead getting involved in the drug business. But it is failing miserably. If the premise of ""Claws"" sounds interesting, but you want quality, I'd highly recommending watching ""Weeds"" instead.",20 out of 56 found this helpful.,2.0,19 June 2017

She wants to move to a more upscale salon but doesn't have the cash. She made a deal with the local mob to launder money for a clinic that will give prescriptions to any addict that walks in the door. Russian men are always in the clinic. They appear to be observing, not partaking in the festivities....yet. I liked the pilot, but I don't have to see explicit sex scenes. Couldn't they just leave that to the imagination? I don't feel it moves the story forward to see someone getting their carpet munched! I love all the characters, except Roller and Uncle Daddy. They are SO one-dimensional. They should practically have BAD GUY stamped on their foreheads. I love Ms. Nash. She was fantastic in ""Getting On"". She's great here too. Very sympathetic character.

There's more of Nash than you want to see, and you'd think she'd turn it around for comedic effect but it doesn't work, so yes you'll see Nash getting busy with some high school janitor. It's not the least bit subtle, or funny, or entertaining, it's just smelly and trashy and uncomfortable. There is zero chemistry among the characters.

2071,The Repair Shop, Thoroughly heartwarming and a pleasure to watch,"Daytime programming can be shunned, mocked and pilloried, but just occasionally it conjures up original, educational and outstanding television.
The Repair Shop is a terrific example of this.
The format is simple. Members of the public bring in artefacts, antiques and heirlooms, which over the course of time have broken or faded into disrepair (the backstories are often fascinating). The items are received at The Repair Shop and mended or restored by a member of a team of experts in various fields (clocks, upholstery, toys etc.).
Every aspect of the show is a delight.
Watching the process of how the repairs are carried out, is a wonder to behold. The skills and crafts used are those acquired over many years of learning. Not a computer in sight.
Those bringing in the artefacts care so deeply about their wares, and often possess cherished memories of other family members who once owned them.
The craftspeople who repair the treasures, are the stars of the show. Unassuming, patient, skilful and dedicated. They clearly take delight and pride in their work, and most of all sheer pleasure in helping others.
The culmination of each programme is when the restored items are returned to their owners. Such joyful moments and I don't mind saying it brings a tear to the eye.
No, there is no 'action', nobody gets voted off and it is quite slow. But when so many programmes focus on the worst side of humanity, let's celebrate people behaving wonderfully. A pleasure to watch and long may it continue!",19 out of 20 found this helpful.,9.0,16 April 2019

Also, he seems to ask rather naive questions of the experts when he is supposed to be one himself.

I'm a huge fan of Two and a Half Men and dearly wished that Kutcher would hold the show, but it transpires that Alan's character is the only thing keeping the show remotely amusing anymore. At least with Anger Management I actually laugh more then once during an entire episode. I never watched Two and Half Men for Oscar performances or for the story line, I just wanted the show to make me laugh and that's exactly what Anger Management does. It's a shame that Sheen and Chuck parted ways like they did, they both made a loss. Some have commented that Charlie is the only one with talent in this show, I strongly disagree, Charlies dysfunctional therapy group has a couple of great actors and the supporting cast, his daughter and ex-wife are great too. <br/><br/>If your just after something that fills the void that the new Two and Half Men has left then you'll enjoy this show, it has plenty of good laughs, just like the good old days of Two and Half Men...'queer jar' LMFAO!!!",122 out of 168 found this helpful.,9.0,8 July 2012

Otherwise then that it's pretty much the same. I mean Charlie sheen still plays a guy named Charlie, he's still a womanizer, he still drinks, and other then a few plot changes here and there it's proof that Charlie Sheen really was two and a half men. <br/><br/>So in this show Charlie is an anger management shrink who obviously had serious anger issues before which more then likely lead to the demise of his marriage out of which he yielded a daughter.

The only criticism I have, is in regards to Charlies' ex-wife, Jennifer. Her acting leaves a lot to be desired and I find the character does nothing to contribute to the show. In future I would like the show to delve a little into Ed's life. The show has slowly let us peek into the lives of the others in the group, except Ed. Love the show, keep up the good work!",21 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,18 July 2013
2101,Anger Management, Top quality humor,"We all have different taste and it's a subjective matter, but to give this one less than 8 is just not fair. <br/><br/>The story of each episode is typically simple and of minor significance, but all of them are stuffed with beautifully composed jokes and appealing people. The series depict a wide spectrum of different characters, each having their own stereotypical peculiarity, some of them are even quite distasteful - but yet presented in a funny 'we all have our problems'-kind of way.<br/><br/>It is also great fun to see Charlie and his dad, which make an excellent combo together!<br/><br/>I highly recommend Anger Management to everybody old enough to watch.",15 out of 20 found this helpful.,10.0,15 February 2014
2102,Anger Management, So sorry this was canceled,"I have been watching Anger Management in reruns and enjoy it very much. I hated Two and a Half Men, so I didn't try watching until I stumbled upon it one night and found the writing intelligent and original, and the characters very entertaining.<br/><br/>Charlie Sheen's character is similar to the one he played on Two and a Half Men, but the ensemble cast is stronger and funnier. The fact that Charlie plays a loser who runs group therapy sessions in an attempt to help other losers is especially funny because it has a ring of truth. I had a mental health professional in my family, and everyone I met through her in that field had something emotionally or socially wrong with them. This show reveals the truth about those who set themselves up to tell everyone else how to live.<br/><br/>I especially like the encounters he has with dangerous criminals, who belong to the group he leads at a local prison. They would be frightening and dangerous in another context, but the way their lines are delivered are so deadpan, I can't help but laugh. I wish the producers would consider bringing this back.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,,18 June 2015
2103,Anger Management, Anger Management,"I don't understand why this show has such a low review. I find it hilarious but maybe its just my type of humor. I know there have been movies and shows that other people find funny that I didn't even crack a smile at. I love Raising Hope but was surprised that this show has a lower rating than Raising Hope as Anger Management makes me laugh until my eyes water. Being chronically ill, its important for me to laugh so I hope this show manages to keep its head above water. I guess I always have Nurse Jackie, another one of my favorites. I hope that it keeps going at least. I have never been a fan of Charlie Sheen but I think he does a great job on this show and I have changed my mind about him, he is very funny! Its also nice to see his real Dad, Martin, playing his Dad on the show. They are great together.

The anger management group he counsels in his home has some really great zingers. There is the slut, the old man, the gay guy and the dofus who is in love with the slut. Charlie also counsels a prison group that is chained to their chairs because they are all psycho's. The entire show is well written and acted, His daughter is OCD so is really organized and intense, Shawnee Smith is the ex and gets some good shots in on Charlie. Selma Blair is Charlie's therapist and they also have a no strings, totally open sexual relation ship, supposedly. Martin Sheen plays the father on occasion and he has his own anger issues between he and Charlie. All in all I find this to be an extremely well done show.",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,8.0,10 May 2013
2105,Anger Management, Old-looking chick magnet routine doesn't fly.,"This show doesn't sit well. When Charlie Sheen started 2 1/2 Men as the philandering rake, he looked the part and it was somewhat believable. Years later, and Sheen is playing he same character in another series. But it's pathetic to watch, as Charlie Sheen is now too thin and old- looking; he hasn't aged well. It has the same problem the show, Frazier had - unattractive old-looking guy as chick magnet scoring with women half his age.<br/><br/>The episode I watched was disturbing - Sheen is seen bedding a beautiful rival therapist.Wearing a skimpy black bra and panties, she demands that he take off her underwear with his teeth and then we see Charlie slipping under the sheets. Next, he asks a girl working at the coffee shop for a date. It seems that this twenty-something stunner is also a PhD. After a brief verbal sparring, she is impressed by Charlie's wit and agrees to have dinner with him. At the restaurant, they are seated at a table. It's not in a discreet corner of the restaurant nor is it dimly lit...she wastes no time in proceeding to slip her hand under the table. ""Zipper, not buttons"", Charlie informs her. A minute later, they're headed for the restroom together to have sex. They haven't even ordered yet. How romantic - having sex in the stall of a public restroom.....what a gas...this passes for comedy these days???",60 out of 108 found this helpful.,1.0,10 August 2012

As long as they keep challenging his character with other personalities, the show will do well. Make fun of his character, call him down, tease him, people love it. Gawd, whatever you do, don't make him a goody goody.<br/><br/>Sometimes the best best actors are not those acting but those that play exactly who are the characters they portray.

If you had any expectations prior to the show they will be greatly dismissed. Interesting enough the show is a typical sitcom with a very average cast and extremely average writing. To my astonishment the show could run on any major network, not inappropriate words, no inappropriate behavior. That can be good or bad, make up your own mind about that.<br/><br/>The show is explained in one sentence, Charlie is a therapist and is trying to help a group of people to get over their anger issues. While this could be hilarious but it is not.<br/><br/>They have caught themselves in a net of professional terms that nobody can follow and Charlie Sheen is now the one people react to, he used to be the one who reacts in short sentences towards others. He talks too fast his voice is too dark and the laugh track in the background is making no sense.<br/><br/>I give this 5 Stars for the many funny hours i had watching Charlie Sheen, this show is a complete failure in writing and casting.

2110,Anger Management, Not what I was expecting,"Though I love Charlie Sheen, this is not a one man show, and the supporting actors/actress are either not funny, or may be the writing was not up to their talent. From what I have seen in the first two episodes, this show has no future unless something dramatically changed. In Two and half men every character had its momentum, and the jokes came out naturally unlike in anger management, where they force the joke on you though it is not really a funny one.On the other hand, I don't understand why the show runner insisting in repeating the role of Charlie as a sex addicted playboy, played in Two and a half men, which already have exhausted during the nine seasons run of the show, although he is capable of doing much better than that. The bottom line, I gave the show 5 point for Charlie Sheen overcoming his problems and returning to the T.V. screen, and not for the show itself.",53 out of 108 found this helpful.,5.0,30 June 2012

2113,Anger Management, Good luck with the show but it sucks.,"Charlie Sheen, you are so versatile as an actor that you play yet another role where your character's name is Charlie and has an obsession with sex. Does it confuse you when people refer to you by a different name? You know what I thought of of the first episode of Anger Management. Rehash/reboot/poor man's attempt/rip off of Two and a Half Men. No, original thought here at all. He pretty much plays the same character he's been playing for over twenty years (identical to the one in Two and a Half Men) and pretty much ripped off the movie Anger Management. I'd rather listen to Rebecca Black's music than watch your lame ass attempt to get even. Not to mention the worst casting decisions I have ever seen made in a TV show, awful acting, unbearable dialog and completely unfunny. This show feels like Charlie Sheen is desperate to prove to people that he's a good person and just troubled(Yes a trouble fifty year old? That's nice.). The only real reason to watch this show is if you are a Charlie Sheen fan but for anybody else there is nothing to see but a divorced aging Charlie Sheen complaining 20 minutes every week. And for the record I would forward to this show but all I got was another Charlie Sheen disaster.",36 out of 78 found this helpful.,1.0,18 July 2012
2114,Anger Management, Great show...,"I really like this show. I've seen better, but I've also seen, probably a hundred shows, that are worse. Charlie Goodson is a retired baseball player, who now works as an anger management therapist. The show is just so funny. The four people from his anger management therapy sessions are just so funny. Lacey is stuck-up and bratty, Nolan is a stoner, who loves Lacey, Patrick is a gay guy, and Ed is a racist, homophobic guy who always busts Patrick's balls. Charlie's ex-wife, Jennifer or more commonly known as Jen, was in it for the first season and part of the second second. She just seemed to disappear, as with their daughter, Sam. Charlie's best friend, boink buddy and fellow therapist, Kate was in it for the first season and part of the second season as well, but left because of issues between the actor, Selma Blair and Charlie Sheen. Eventually, Charlie gets a new co-star type person, Dr. Jordan Denby, who is so adorable. But my favorite character has to be Sean. He dated Charlie's ex-wife and now lives next door. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this show an 8 out of 10.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,27 September 2014

The dialogue the acting the directing everything about this production screams low class desperation and utter garbage. <br/><br/>In no way shape or form would I ever recommend this show for anyone. I hope it gets cancelled real fast so other much much better shows can take it's place in the TV guides. The only thing I enjoyed about this show was Selma Blair.

Unsupervised kicked ass regardless of what people say about it, but this show is just plain distasteful. I'm surprised that Charlie Sheen even got on this show after getting sh*t-canned from Two and a Half Men. Charlie Sheen is an idiot for getting paid $300,000 (later $1,800,000) an episode of 2.5 men and then pissing it all away because he just had to get spastic. To make things worse, this show has a fu*king laugh track!!! FX has poured it's heart and soul into many shows like It's Alway's Sunny in Philadelphia, Archer, The League, Unsupervised, and many more shows.

If it is not about the era, the times, the cast, or writing...It is what is next! I am a definite movie buff with hundreds of thousands of shows watched. Not to say anyone is qualified to say what is good or bad but The Paradise is just simply VERY good in many ways. This series was a refreshing step away from the overdone crime dramas and did not need or require nudity nor profanity to make is superb. Some here criticize the last episode(s) however they may not understand this - the writers knew the show would be canceled well before it ended, sadly, and were required to conjure up a somewhat appealing ending.

2121,The Paradise, A nice replacement for Lark Rise to Candleford,"When they cancelled Lark Rise to Candleford, the BBC promised us that it was to ""make room for other dramas"". So far, I haven't seen anything worth watching, until The Paradise came on. It has the same gentle feel that Lark Rise did, and the same idea of having pride in the work you do. It is really nice to have a TV show which is not obsessed with having nude scenes in it, or using swear words at every turn, but rather concentrating on a good script, and a storyline that makes you want to know what is going to happen next. Some of the characters do feel like they need to find themselves a little bit, but since this is the first series, I think that they can easily be forgiven for that!

2122,The Paradise, Period Drama with modern Flair,"Sometimes I think I know where this story is going and it suddenly takes a turn not expected.<br/><br/>At first glance many of the situations and characters seem so common or typical. As the story goes along the characters develop rich persona's and quirks of their own. Some of them need work but it's small criticism. Despite it's period setting, the feel is very contemporary and the writing style, sharp for period pieces. Still it's good for young and old. I don't often warm to these period pieces with women in long dresses and lace and the class differences being used as reason for conflict. Paradise seems to give equal standing to all its characters, regardless of class, and invents interesting back stories for so many of them.

I found the Paradise to be so light, sweet, and feel-good in comparison to DA. It was also very romantic (with some delicious delayed gratification, even!) and best of all... no controversy!!

2124,The Paradise, The big store,"I normally avoid what I call ""modern"" costume-dramas like the plague, no ""Downtons"" or ""Candlefords"" in our house, but having read the source novel by Emile Zola (one of the rare novels my wife and I both enjoyed reading) and believing then that it had continued relevance in today's shopping mall, hypermarket, bigger-is-better consumer society, I was persuaded to tune in.<br/><br/>I'm rather glad I did, as, while I can easily see the soap suds gathering around the fringes, still Zola's story-telling skills shine through. I can't remember enough about the novel to place the appropriate episodes depicted here, although some of course were of modern invention, still I felt as a whole, the series maintained consistency, continuity and credibility throughout.<br/><br/>It's well acted with, in the lead roles, Emun Elliot as the charismatic retail supremo Moray (Mouret, in the original French) and Joanna Vanderham as the initially demure but fast developing shop-girl-in-a-hurry Denise, while the rest of cast support well, with the possible exception of Sarah Lancashire, who overplays the starchy department manageress, Miss Audrey.<br/><br/>I would carp at the sets which seem to be have been done on the cheap, you hardly get the impression that the store is large at all and as for the exteriors, it appears the BBC could only be bothered to dress up one section of the street outside the shop, giving an air of budget-cuts to proceedings.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this was easy-to-watch family entertainment, which I'm pleased to see has been commissioned for a second series.

Denise is suitably innocent and pure, Moray is single-minded and lecherous, and the introduced character of Jonas is malevolent.

No it's not great; yes, the acting isn't always spot on; no the writing leaves a lot to be desired, but the series stuck like glue. But with the last episode on the screen, I found out what I really had been watching all that time: the prelude to a terrible accident. What a disaster that last episode was ! Did the original screenplay writer collide with the number 12 bus, and did the producers then decide to employ the Sun's editor? Did the screenwriter say: I still have material for five episodes, to which the producer said: put it all in the last one? Did everyone just improvise on camera? We will never know. What I do know though is that it was about nothing; it looked like nothing and it sounded like nothing. Characters changed overnight; Evil Tom Weston got hit by a magic stick and started loving his wife and daughter; Jonas Franks got it suddenly all wrong in his desire to serve and protect; Moray lost his last braincells and started gambling for the store; and Denise became a makeup inventor and ....

2129,The Paradise, Plank alert,"I have now watched 5 episodes of The Paradise and find myself hooked in, and irritated, in equal measure. Love the pantomime villain, Mr. Jonas and the smooth but threatening Lord Glendenning. Katherine Glendenning, quick-witted, manipulative, but never quite decisive enough to stick to her choices, is also proving to be an interesting character. But oh dear - Mr. Moray seems to have studied at the Gordon Ramsay school of acting, with ** every other ** word studded ** with pregnant ** pauses ... This, coupled with an apparent inability to look at anyone he is speaking to, makes his performance so wooden and laughable he is reduced to a good-looking plank dressed in nice clothes. How he ever managed to find the shop each morning is a mystery, let alone make a success of running it. His right-hand man is a younger, right-on version of Gordon Brown, concerned more with equal opportunities for the staff than turning a profit. Most of the characters are fairly ludicrous, although the toffs are making a better job of believability than the staff. A special mention to Sarah Lancashire as Miss Audrey, a crude caricature in the first episode that has now settled nicely into a cross between Hyacinth Bucket and Lady Grantham. The few good performances only serve to highlight the more numerous bad ones, and among them I include Joanna Vanderham as Denise, who plays every scene with either a trembling lip, smug conceit or a jolly hockeysticks grin.

I almost did not watch this show on Netflix because of the comments. One poster said it had a horrible ending that made no sense, etc. Another poster has made very unkind comments about some of the actor's abilities. I did not want to take the time to get into two full seasons of a show that had mediocre acting and a poorly written ending. I watched the first episode anyway, then the second. They were very good but I still didn't want to take the plunge. Therefore, a couple of months went by before I watched another episode, then another and another until I said ""oh what the heck!"" It was pulling me back night after night until I came to the last episode quite expecting to be disappointed in the ending (due to posted comments). I can tell you honestly, and in my humble opinion, that I don't know what those other two posters were watching. The Paradise produced wonderful acting in all parts (remember, these folks are being directed) and there wasn't a thing wrong with the ending.

It appears she has been at The Paradise for more than a year as she knows Jonas, and I am sure neither Moray, the very upright Dudley, or Jonas would have hired such a slovenly, grubby, and for the mid 19th century, foul mouthed slut to associate with their well-behaved shop girls let alone cook for them.

At one point, Moray is so disheveled and obviously in a state of personal crisis, that it's a wonder he's still running the STORE. Oh...and then we get to see an unbelievable interracial affair begin to unfold - as in Downton Abbey. The whole thing has gone to hell in a hand basket.

2133,The Paradise, The Paradise (BBC1) - Review,"The Paradise is a fictional version of Britain's first ever department store. The place feels like a cross between Liberty and Selfridges, except that it's up north – just outside Sunderland by the sound of it, and all of the staff get to live upstairs above the shop – a staff perk that workers at M&amp;S are very unlikely to ever enjoy.<br/><br/>On the opposite side of a distinctly cardboard-looking Victorian Street, peopled with uncomfortable-looking extras, is Edmund Lovett's sweet little drapery shop – clearly in urgent need of a paint job, having recently been so meticulously distressed by a stand-by chippy. Not surprisingly, poor Edmund is being put out of business by The Paradise, and he's far from happy about it.<br/><br/>When Edmund's niece Denise (Joanna Vanderham) arrives on the scene she immediately faces us with a major challenge – that of trying to work out where exactly she is from. She begins with an Irish accent, quickly switches to Scottish in the next speech, then for a while settles on good old-fashioned English R.P. Then she veers back into Irish for a while, finally settling, via a brief stab at West Country, on Scottish. And she achieves all of this linguistic wizardry while pouting at the camera and glancing seductively over one shoulder.<br/><br/>The Paradise is owned by the smooth skinned, deeply sexy John Moray (played by Emun Elliott). This character, while looking beautiful and managing to successfully wrangle a single accent, insists, however, on playing every single line with exactly the same intonation, as if having a stab at the script for the first time at a table read.<br/><br/>Much to the horror of her uncle, Moray offers Denise a job, and soon her heaving breast becomes very much a part of the furniture in ladieswear &amp; haberdashery on the first floor. My favourite scene was when Moray stroked Denise's face and told her to have just one hair askew, as nothing in life has any business being perfect. This sensual piece of dialogue has been a favourite of mine ever since I heard it spoken almost word for word the first time, by Peter O'Toole in James Goldman's masterpiece The Lion in Winter.<br/><br/>Enter rich and evil pantomime villain Lord Glendenning (deliciously overplayed by Patrick Malahide). As the audience hiss and boo he places his mouth close to Moray's ear and whispers, ""If you break her heart, I shall make it my business to ruin you!"" It is probably also worth mentioning craggy skinned Jonas Franks (played by David Hayman) who appears to be in the series for no reason other than to slowly peer around doors. His is a face I'm sure I will see in my nightmares for many weeks to come. Hopefully his character will be fleshed out in future episodes.<br/><br/>This series has the same chief writer as Lark Rise to Candleford, Bill Gallagher. Like millions of others I am a fan of Lark Rise, which appears, at first sight, to be infinitely better constructed, better written, better acted and better directed.<br/><br/>Read daily TV reviews at Mouthbox.co.uk",43 out of 95 found this helpful.,5.0,28 September 2012
2134,The Paradise, Disappointed,"First episode - exciting stuff. The next are okay, until the central woman suddenly says something that spoils the whole show for me. I would have liked another plot altogether, not a 'classical' love story as I see it. The central characters feel very stiff and fade in favor of the other characters. Still I watched the whole thing. Maybe it was the wavering rich woman that I felt sorry for, which kept me on my toes. Maybe some backdrop as to why the leading male character was so attractive would make him more attractive to me. I also want to like him. The one armed guy, I both like and dislike. He feels extremely misplaced, but at least he speak in tongues.",8 out of 13 found this helpful.,4.0,4 May 2014
2135,The Paradise, I loved this series,"I might be slightly prejudiced due to my costuming background and love of period pieces by BBC... you are forewarned :-) This was a thoroughly delightful series to watch and I was hooked after the first 15 minutes of the first episode. Costuming is absolutely gorgeous and true to the period and class structure of the times (1875-188?). The setting, scenery and sets are near perfection. All works together to draw you into the place that is the Paradise, England's first department store, Tollgate Street and its many merchants and the surrounding countryside where the gentry reside.<br/><br/>This TV series drops us into Victorian England and shows us a variety of class members through stories of their lives. We are invited into their homes, shops, places of work and places they play and relax. The Paradise department store is the fulcrum around which all these stories revolve. Businesses and business dealings, the under belly of English society, working class girls, shop owners and their worries, the complexities of love and the consequences of hate. The relationships and back stories of each character are drawn out a bit at a time and the story lines keep moving along episode after episode so the audience is never bored.<br/><br/>The Paradise is full of love and hate, rivalries and partnerships, betrayals and reconciliations, intrigue and secrecy, a touch of sex and a little violence. Everything to make it a fun and interesting show to watch.<br/><br/>In the second series the beginnings, the catalyst to, the rise of the women's movement is touched upon a little more with each episode. Through the main character, Denise, we get to see the reactions of the men around her, who claim to love her, to her entrepreneurial spirit and her desire to be more... to be a career minded business woman.<br/><br/>Many other political and class-based issues are touched upon including the plight of soldiers who have returned from brutal wars and the scars, both physical and mental, they bear. The severe inequalities of the class structure are also showcased. I strongly recommend this series to all who love great Historic Fiction... and fabulous costuming and sets.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,27 January 2015
2136,The Paradise, Like watching a train wreck. One can not look away.,"The Paradise characters are all lacking depth and they are stiff. I don't like or dislike any of them. Plus there are too many characters that seem to have no place really in the story. The casting department did not pick the right actors. The costumes are really badly thought out. Who in the world dresses like Miss Glendenning with little ribbons around her neck the same color as the many ruffles in her dress? What exactly is the story line? We now know that Moray's wife died under suspicious circumstances, yet even that plot line does not cause any tension in the story. Are we supposed to feel that Moray will eventually fall into the arms of Denise? In spite of all this, I keep watching.",13 out of 24 found this helpful.,5.0,29 October 2013
2137,The Paradise, ONLY THE BEST GET CANCELLED,"Loved it!! This was a thoroughly delightful series to watch. Stunning costumes. Outstanding performances. Based around Paradise, England's first department store, Tollgate Street, its many merchants and surrounding countryside. The Paradise has it all: love, hate, greed, rivalries, betrayals, intrigue, secrecy, control, manipulation and redemption. Moray, who owns and operates the Paradise is tormented by his past,which direction to follow and being true to his heart/soul. He's torn between Katherine, a rich arrogant aristocrat vs Denise, love interest, pretty country girl. Denise and Moray, both have mixed emotions of jealously and career ambition. A cast of interesting characters reveals their own struggles...Jonas, store detective, Mr. Westin, cruel sociopath, Sam, fun loving sales person. A very well written story with many twists &amp; turns. Disappointed the story doesn't continue.

2138,The Paradise, too many typical TV tropes,"I like a lot of the ""old school"" BBC/ITV series, but I've noticed that their more recent period dramas are trying to cater too hard to the US crowd. This is disappointing, because I always enjoyed shows from the UK because the characters always seemed more realistic and relatable, from the aristocrats to the scullery maids. Some of the stereotypes portrayed in this series are the exact reason I disliked Downton Abbey-- They seem to have too many goofy Hallmark-character traits... the dark brooding alpha male who strays with the hired help yet is always forgiven, the blue eyed blond virgin sexpot ubergirl, the spinster, the fallen whore woman with child... Denise seems like an OK innocent character at first, but then I realize that she's unwittingly and unforgivably throwing all of her female co-workers under the bus at one point or the other with a big smile on her face. Blondie gets coddled like the favorite daughter of the store, whole the stereotypical brunette ""whore"" gets slighted, and the elderly matron manager is made to look like a fool, and it makes me cringe. Morey seems downright unlikable, although I get the impression that he's supposed to be one of the ""good guys"". I want to tell the monied heiress who chased him, ""Run AWAY! He just wants your money while he bonks the shop girls!"" I can't give it no stars, since I usually enjoy watching anything based on historical events.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,3.0,12 November 2016
2139,The Paradise," ""I'm turning into a vegetable"",but not in a good way","We don't need an invasion of the body - snatchers in 2012 Britain,we have mainstream television to turn us into vegetables.Soporific,banal, derivative,what happened to Lord Reith's promise? As good an example as can be found(along with the grossly over - rated ""Downton Abbey"") is ""The Paradise"",which is really TV- by- numbers same old same old stuff the the BBC bosses obviously believe will be bread and cicuses to their audiences as they wait glumly for the country to collapse around them into some sort of a black hole. Set in a posh store deep in Catherine Cookson country (when will they ever learn that the Geordie accent is the most difficult to master?),it centres round the Millinery Department run by Miss Sara Lancashire who had clearly gone through her repertoire of silly voices and settled on middle - period Maggie Smith. Her various ""gels"",some familiar,some not,have a shot at depicting their great-great grandmamas but are only too clearly products of their own time. As corny as Kansas in August,the various totally predictable plot lines develop inexorably until the viewer either bursts into tears or gives up and opens a box of chocolates.I chose the latter which cheered me up immensely and quite soon I was laughing in all the wrong places.Come to think of it,I doubt if there was a right place to laugh,""The Paradise"" entirely lacks Miss Cookson's wry eye and takes itself v. seriously indeed.

2140,The Paradise, Total mundane story line with unattractive characters played by uncharismatic actors,"A better produced period day time soap opera, with total mundane story lines and scripts that only concern one block of neighborhood + one rich household (saved a lot on locations sets) and absolutely no higher, bigger, deeper or whatsoever meanings behind, constituted with unattractive characters played by even more uncharismatic actors and actresses. I found myself google/wikipedia it to see who are the main characters (I thought they haven't shown up yet ...) after watching 3 episodes with 85% of the lines starting with Mr. Moray, Sir. I normally like most of the English shows, especially the period ones, but this is a total ""don't waste your time"". The 1 star is totally for the production team, although it should not be hard considering the very limited locations/sets they used. All other parts are zero star. If you want to watch something similar, I'd recommend ""North and South"". Any British period drama is better than this perhaps.",4 out of 8 found this helpful.,1.0,9 October 2016

The setting, time frame and romance draws you in leaving you wanting for more after each episode. The elegant gowns worn back in the day are beautiful and vibrant, leaving a women imagining herself back in time. The wardrobe crew should be commended. The acting was wonderful; from the mischief of desire to succeed, right down to the sparkle and glimpse in Denise's eyes when an idea is transpired. To my dismay, I have found, I am on the last episode only to find my future in The Paradise will be only in my dreams; they canceled after only two seasons - what a pity and loss of great talent in a most wonderful portrayal of the entrepreneurial drive for success and love which so often determines our path and ability to succeed.",4 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,19 March 2015
2142,The Paradise," Great sets, costumes, story lines, but strange casting.","There's a lot to like in this fluffy show if you enjoy costume dramas - the show takes viewers back to England in the 1870s with style and flair. The scripts are good enough (although too often the plot depends on coincidence and constantly overheard conversations), the direction acceptable (but fraught with too many overly emotional reactions shots), and the pacing brisk. But the actors! The secondary players are all exactly what you'd expect from such a production (especially Miss Audrey, who brings a little much needed humor to the show), but the leading man looks like a gay clone from 1970s San Francisco with his weird facial hair and wildly overdramatic expressions (and although he's supposed to be dashing, he seems to be about a foot shorter than the leading ladies). The aristocratic Katherine is played by a woman who more resembles a dazed graduate student than a Victorian beauty. And the leading lady is bland, although it's a tough role to carry off, being the least interesting character. All in all, it's just kind of weird watching these lost thespians wander about while everyone else in the cast looks and acts the part.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,7.0,9 January 2020

The show will leave you coming back for more and more. <br/><br/>I wish they had continued to produce the show, I would have watched and am wishing for more. It is a little reminiscent of Downton, but not enough that it seems as though it is the same. The costumes and scenery are beautiful.

For example:<br/><br/>1) We don't get the cliche stories of doctors sleeping around. 
2) The medical cases are interesting almost all the time.
3) The main cast is great.
4) The directing is awesome. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to direct a show with such a chaotic environment.
5) This one builds of #4 - I love the environment that this show is try to depict.

2149,Code Black, There's No Faith Like that of a Recent Convert!,"My favorite medical series of all time was NYMed--all real life medical, no soap opera from the writers' room. That should tell you why I like this show and am regretting I just discovered it.<br/><br/>Was casting around--pun intended--for a series whose season begins about now to fill a hole in my viewing schedule left by cancellations. Stumbled into ""Code Black"". Had ignored it when it premiered a couple of years ago on the premise that, like so many other medical dramas, the soap opera predominated over the medical. Quite the opposite, it turns out. Watched its Season 3's 2nd episode on a lark, watched the season premiere on demand, and then set my DVR for the series. Decided I needed to catch up on the previous two seasons and ordered the DVDs. I then figured I'd use a rainy weekend alone with the dogs to binge watch through as much of the two years as time allowed. Note to self: Do NOT try this at home. The medical and related emotional issues are way too high octane for binge watching, and I had to stop for some processing time. The other choice was turning whichever dog was on my lap into a crying towel. Having learned my lesson, will be enjoying the past seasons at a slower pace while I follow the current season at the usual weekly pace. Ratings have been drifting down, so I may be setting myself up for another teeth clenching reaction to a cancellation announcement, but can't let that stop me now even if deciding I like a series is a kiss of eventual death about half the time. Watch it while you can, stat! <br/><br/>BTW, the opening scene of the ""Better Angels"" was about as innovative as any TV scene I can remember. It was an amazing way both to portray the patient's medical condition (visions) and to make the very real point that the profound professionalism and intense training of ER professionals makes for a genuine and intricate choreography inside the chaos that the uninformed eye sees. On top of this, it was complete fun seeing the cast perform in ways that are highly unusual in this genre. You could sort of tell by body language and facial expressions which ones were enjoying it and which were, shall we say, more challenged by the novelty of it. But they pulled it off, and it was fun to see. Have watched that scene close to ten times and am still not tired of it.",80 out of 81 found this helpful.,,14 May 2018

Well established characters died, when scripts called for it. <br/><br/>This show didn't disappoint. CBS did disappoint. This show was poorly supported, under promoted, and was given limited numbers of episodes. Finding this show was tough. There was a long time between show runs.

Shortly after making it's long awaited premiere CBS announced it was cancelled. By June 2018 plot synopses were already listed in IMDB.<br/><br/>While it was on we met medical staff of Angels Memorial Hospital, a teaching hospital. We met newly minted doctors and a barrage of patients. Rapid changes in staffing, politics, power and money kept things off keel. Like life, people came and went, brining their needs and talents both with them. Constants were grizzled Nurse Jesse, the man called mama, and fiercely compassionate Dr. LeAnn Rorish, who by default was known as daddy.

2164,Code Black," Code Black: High-intensity, emotional, realistic medical show. #1 fan!","""CODE BLACK"" has been one of my favorite shows since day #1. This show is very well-written and has some great actors, not to mention the great writers they have utilized for the show. The series goes from strength to strength with every single episode. <br/><br/>I would 10/10 recommend this show to anyone who loves to get in a good cry, an occasional giggle, and experience a show that will have you on the edge of your seat for a mere 42 minutes. This show has outranked many other medical dramas, especially including ""The Night Shift,"" ""Chicago Med,"" and ""Private Practice."" I would even say this show is better than ""Grey's Anatomy"" compared to it's latest seasons. <br/><br/>This show has the worthy comparison to the long-running medical drama ""E.R."", and rightfully so. Another characteristic that distinguishes ""CODE BLACK"" from any other medical drama is the fact that it is rather realistic. Although there are a few errors apparent, it is still far more accurate than any other medical drama and the set looks REAL. <br/><br/>Additionally, this series is based on the documentary of the same name and does a great job of filling its shoes. If you are considering watching this series even in the slightest, be sure to watch the documentary first. It will help you understand what this series is attempting to depict. <br/><br/>All in all, ""CODE BLACK"" is no doubt a strong series. It is one of the best medical shows out there. As I said, if you are up for a good cry and some edge-of-your-seat drama, ""CODE BLACK"" might be right for you. ;)<br/><br/>""CODE BLACK"" is a superior show that I absolutely love.

2169,The Pretender, an enjoyable action series,"There's been many shows over the years featuring a nomadic character who helps people as he goes about his journey, but THE PRETENDER is probably my favorite of the bunch. Whereas in other shows the character was always the same, this series added a twist: he was a genius with the ability to assume any profession he chose, from park ranger to FBI special agent. I'm surprised he never posed as an astronaut and went into space. Michael T. Weiss was terrific as the title character, Jarod, who helps right wrongs as he attempts to find the parents he was taken from as a child and continually eludes those chasing him from the mysterious organization from where he's escaped. Because of his ability, each episode was like an individual little movie, because he was someone different each week. And one of the things I liked was the way he would get revenge. Rather than just go for the person, he would slowly toy with them, taking his plan one step at a time. It was really fun to watch him play around with the person.<br/><br/>Sexy Andrea Parker played Miss. Parker (an amusing coincidence that she herself said was one main reasons she took the role), who was filled with utter determination to capture Jarod and return him to the Centre, despite the times he helped save her own life and was someone she knew as a child growing up in the Centre. He even got her to start questioning the mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of her mother, whose killer has remained a mystery through four seasons and two TV movies. Patrick Bauchau was Sydney, one of the few people Jarod ever felt that he could trust, and a father figure to him. Sydney often seemed happy for Jarod that he was free of the Centre and able to experience life, and their phone conversations (when Jarod would call for advice or just to talk) were always very nice. The good supporting cast included Richard Marcus (appropriately evil as the nefarious Mr. Raines), Jon Gries as scardy cat computer whiz Broots, Jamie Denton as Parker's brother, Harve Presnell as Parker's father (though that later became debatable following events in the first TV movie), and one-time James Bond himself George Lazenby as Jarod's father, who disappeared from the show as mysteriously as he had appeared.<br/><br/>For three seasons, THE PRETENDER maintained a high quality of entertaining adventures and stories, with a good balance between the Jarod ""pretending"" stories and the Centre mythology sub-plots. But with the forth season, the show made the same mistake THE X-FILES made: it got too involved with itself. There was more and more focus on the internal conspiracies of the Centre instead of a focus on Jarod and his exploits. The show's mythology began to take over, and it seemed each week there was a new revelation about someone, like the writers couldn't make up their minds as to what they wanted to do. Thanks to this and a heavy dose of pre-emps, PRETENDER began to sag and was cancelled at the end of the season (just so NBC could carry XFL, and look how well that paid off).<br/><br/>But thankfully, some loose ends were tied up by TNT, who picked up the show for reruns and gave us two movies. The first three seasons were the best, and I hope some day the show is made available on DVD.",61 out of 65 found this helpful.,,12 April 2002
2170,The Pretender, Extremely Enjoyable,"I did not catch this series when it first aired.  My brother constantly spoke its praises, but I believed it would be the usual boring weekly drama.<br/><br/>
I was wrong.<br/><br/>On my brother's recommendation, I taped every episode of the show when it ran in syndication on various channels.  I have been slowly watching them during the Year 2002 (and now 2003), and after the first 40 or so episodes, I am here to tell you that this show is nothing short of amazing.  The characters are interesting, the premise is, if not unique, at least enjoyable, and the subplots make you yearn for more.  Just when you think it can't get any better, it does.  It's difficult to believe that this show debuted in 1996.  Not only has it stood the test of time, but it is better than most of the fare that has been aired in 2000 and beyond.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to the next 40 episodes and the TV Movies, which I hope will be equally engaging.

2171,The Pretender, There are re-runs among us...,"I somehow missed this show in its original run in the mid/late 90's. But as luck would have it, I've recently discovered this show in re-runs and was so interested by it that I even bought the Season 1 DVD set. The show consists of a hero (Jarod) who is a genius capable of insinuating himself into any profession or situation. Kidnapped as a child and exploited by ""The Centre"", Jarod escapes and sets out to find his long-lost parents. During his search, Jarod uses his abilities to seek justice for strangers he reads about in newspaper articles. Part of what makes this series great is the relationship between Jarod and Centre psychologist/instructor Sydney who has raised Jarod from childhood and become the closest thing Jarod has ever known to a father. Additionally, Centre Hench-woman ""Miss Parker"" tracks Jarod relentlessly, while discovering more and more that the Centre has manipulated her own life almost as much as they have Jarod's. The only negative thing I have to say about this show is that it was canceled prior to its conclusion. An attempt at a TV Movie ""Pretender 2001"" was made to give us the answers about Jarod's family but I have yet to find a copy to see how it ends.

That's the really cool thing about this show, it always keeps you guessing.<br/><br/>Taking all this into account, it makes me wonder why NBC canceled it.

2178,The Pretender," In spite of its flaws, I wish I could have seen the rest of the episodes.","""I'm chasing the Pretender,"" Andrea Parker assured us the viewers in an advertisement for Sky's new shows some years ago. ""I'm going to catch him on Sky One.""<br/><br/>Unfortunately for fans of ""The Pretender,"" she never did - Sky ended up dropping it before the fourth and final season (and forget the TV movies), and it's unlikely some other station will get it a la ""Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit,"" ""Late Night With David Letterman"" or other shows binned in favour of ""Kirsty's Home Videos"" or ""Fear Factor."" Curses.<br/><br/>
Anyway, though this series could be formulaic - this show used to be run back-to-back with ""Early Edition,"" and it always amazed me that the latter could get more inventive plotlines out of its own equally constrictive premise - the show avoided being dire because of its characters and performers. As Jarod, Michael T. Weiss projected a smugness that was off-putting but appropriate for someone who could pretend to be anybody (the air of self-satisfation was in tune with someone who knew he was brighter than just about everyone else), and his mentor Sydney and chief pursuer Miss Parker - what WAS her first name? - were refreshingly free of black-and-white characterisations; this made the show more interesting than it otherwise might have been, though the writing was decent all round.<br/><br/>Thanks to other comments for filling in a few of the blanks (they'll do until I manage to see the final season and the movies).

2180,The Pretender, Suspend disbelief,"Yeah, the confessions Jarod extracts would never be accepted in a court of law.  There are so many things that can cause one to say ""That could/would never happen!"".  You can't tell yourself that when watching.  The stories aren't about realism.  They are about the people.  They are about justice. Not justice in the Law &amp; Order sense.  Justice in that you get to see the bad guys get exactly what they deserve if you the viewer can't dispense it yourself.<br/><br/>Personally, I particularly enjoy Sydney's dignity.  He carries himself very well.  He's very polite.  I would do very well to emulate his composure and civility.<br/><br/>Broots personifies my social ineptitude in authoritarian environments. He's a geek. That's me. The guy's like a jittery squirrel when he's around people that can fire him or kill him.<br/><br/>Miss Parker... I love her.  She's such a ... you know, but I mean it as praise!<br/><br/>Jarod.  I loved this show before the first episode premiered.  I couldn't wait till the first episode because I felt it was about people like me. The character of Jarod, however, as he's written, does set the bar a little high, of course; I can't solve a Rubic's Cube during a brief conversation, but I taught myself to read at 4 by the next year I was reading at the 6th grade level before entering kindergarten.  This show is about me, and others like me.  We weren't isolated by evil corporations, but by a society that doesn't know what to people like us. Jarod was taught to use his gifts by people who understood his gifts. I've met none who could have ever done the same for me but myself.  In one sense, it's too late as certain pathways have already set, but THIS SERIES has inspired me to set out and probe the boundaries of my own intellect ...

My question is why are all the horrible series on TV forever, and the good ones canceled? Do the TV stations hate ratings? I would recommend watching the series but the story line is never finished only left with a million questions to linger.This series reminded me of a mix of quantum leap, and macgyver rolled into a modern day version with a flair of Dark Angel.

2182,The Pretender, Pretender-the best show I have ever seen,"By far The Pretender is my favorite television show. Others have come close to it but not quite. One thing I love about this series is its originality. I have never seen a show quite like this one. Jarred is the focus on the show. He is a Pretender "" A genius who can become anyone he wants to be"" One day he might be a doctor, the next a lawyer. While he was a boy he was raised by a place called the Center and helped projects and went through simulations where he could feel exactly what the person felt and why they would do what they are doing. When he learned that his simulations were given to evil hands-as long as they payed the price-he escaped and began a journey of finding out who he really his and where his family is. While he searches for the truth he helps other people by becoming a doctor or a lawyer. People who were as defenseless as he once was. And while he is helping and searching he is being chased by the center which focuses around three people mainly-Miss. Parker who while searching for Jarred she keeps on digging up her own skeletons as well as the centers skeletons and finding out that she is more connected to Jarred then she realizes. Even though she plays ice queen so well you see different sides to her and realize that she is also human with a harsh path. A human people might even be able to relate to. Then there's Sydney who is Jarreds mentor/teacher. The one who raises Jarred. He cares for Jarred and is protective of him but at the same time he wants him back at the center so he is torn sometimes between his moral feelings and what is the center wants. Then last but not least there's Broots, the ordinary average Joe who gets sucked into the crazy plot after he helps not only track Jarred but dig up dirt from that center that helps Miss. Parker as well as Jarred and Sydney. Through these series there are heartbreaking stories and lines that you just burst out laughing. Each character gets a chance to grow and develop as you learn more about who they are. There are not only those three thats in the show but very important characters like Angelo the impath and Centers ""gerbel"" who has more depth and more of a story then one might think when first seeing him. Then there's Mr. Parker the weasel that can lie very convincingly, Mr. Raines-my favorite bad guy for both TV and movie. I love his voice and his oxygen tank just adds to the charm. Last but not least there's Mr. Lyles who is also a perfect bad guy- a person you love to hate, and then there is Bridget who sucks one to many lollypops :) overall I love the plot line and the characters development is awesome. I'm only sorry it had to leave so early. There hasn't been another show quite like that one and I don't think there ever well be.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,20 March 2006

2189,The Pretender, The Pretender: Mythology on the Small Screen,"Who is Jarod? This is the fundamental question that viewers of this show must continue to ask themselves as Jarod goes off into the world searching for his family and attempting to dissect the past and understand what it was that was done to him. Jarod is a genius of incredible abilities. He wanders about from place to place, the chameleon who can take on any identity, becoming anything he desires or needs to be for his ends; a pilot, a doctor, a federal agent. He constructs these identities for himself as a cover while he searches for his family, averts his one-time captors still looking to retrieve him, and helps people find redemption (while dispensing justice) in a cold, indifferent and troubled world. Jarod is the Pretender and this is a television show with perhaps the most intriguing and fantastic premise ever .<br/><br/>Ruled by the unseen and unheard Triumvirate, the Center is a shadowy and nefarious institution. Peopled by figures (sinners) with unclean hands who are eternally compromised for it, vying for power or some remainder of dignity of one kind or another, mutual suspicions abound providing the Center workplace with the worst case of office politics you are ever likely to know. The storyline identifies it as a research corporation that sells it's findings to the highest bidder. It kidnapped Jarod as a child, harnessing his genius for its sims' (sins?); simulations which construe scenarios and develop contingencies to deal with them. The figures of the Center (as does Jarod) reach into our world from their own to settle their affairs and inflict their designs upon us and they are ever searching for their once prized possession: Jarod.<br/><br/>That Jarod's looks are Mediterranean; tall and dark with chiseled features and innocence in his eyes, is no accident of casting. Neither is Miss Parker's cold, sexualized feline corpus, brilliantly played, strangely enough, by the actress named Andrea Parker. That Jarod, Broots, Miss Parker, Sidney, Mr. Parker, Mr. Lyle, Angelo, Mr. Raines are know simply by such single names is, again, done so for a reason. These are mythological figures, each with their own history, their own paths of destiny to follow. One of the things that makes this show so enjoyable to watch is that they are refreshingly free of both the classic and contemporary stereotypes that currently dominate both on television and in film. Of these, of course, Jarod is the most readily recognizable and the most fascinating of all.<br/><br/>Jarod is a Christ figure (Jarod/Jesus). A man born of a beautiful woman whose picture he carries around as a sacred object in his search for her. (The character Argyle laminates this photo for Jarod, just as he had laminated one of the Pope for his father.) He does not know who his father is and although he finds a man who may be him, and Sidney acts like a surrogate at times, Jarod never knows the true nature of his origin (some suggestions of a genetic project arise).<br/><br/>Jarod is then, like Christ, one part man, one part god and not entirely at ease with his calling. He is plagued by doubts, but he is also the only virtuous one, the only one without sin. He most often wears a leather jacket but he is a distinctly non-sexual and celibate figure. He cannot succumb to those temptations (as Christ was forced to reject) until he has fulfilled his destiny. In contrast, all other characters in The Pretender are sinners to one degree or another, they have made compromises, serve an evil institution even though the more conscientious ones sometimes try to derail the more fiendish of the plots and plotters. Miss Parker is the most prominent of the Center figures and she is the main counterpart of Jarod's. Where Jarod has no last name, she has no first. She mourns the death of her angelic mother (also played by Andrea Parker) and Jarod cannot seem to come to the truth about his father. There is much duality in this show. Sidney has a twin brother, Lyle is Miss Parker's twin brother, etc.<br/><br/>These are characters outside of the world that we know, the world where Jarod now roams looking for redemption and providing comfort and solace to people. But they enter this world, just like the ancient gods of Greek mythology did. That the Pretender as a television show can successfully fictionalize an alternative reality cozily within a setting reflective of ours is another one of it's great achievements. It creates it's own believable universe, through mood established by music, cinematography, intelligent writing and penetrating dialogue. This current world that we live in, the one that Jarod roams, is one utterly free of the past, or so it believes itself to be. But here are characters possessed by the past. It brings to mind the James Joyce story The Dead, and the show creates a history and odyssey for it's characters to follow that is so uncharacteristic of the times. In this sense, this series stands out amongst all the others (X-files, Millenium, etc.). The Pretender's world does not come across as feigned, nor does it wallow in cynicism and irony. The show is free of such post-post-modern (not sure where we are exactly these days) conceits and maintains an elevated humanity that prevents Jarod's good deeds and morality from descending into pasticcio sentimentality.  The characters are not black and white. Even the darkest ones have mitigating circumstances surrounding their actions and moments of sympathy and redemption. Again, this is most evident in Miss Parker's continued self-discoveries.  The Pretender is a show that any writer would relish a chance to give her/his rendition of the myths from which it derives and the myths which it creates and perpetuates. This is a show which demonstrates how Hollywood's best work remains on the small screen.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,,25 October 2001

2194,Thirtysomething, One of the best televison series of the 80s,"I just read a comment by a guy who said he couldn't feel sorry for characters who had great cars and houses etc as if these characters were rich. I'm not sure what show he watched but 30something was one of the few shows on television where its characters lived in homes that actually reflected their middle class incomes. Hope &amp; Michael lived in an old (albeit big) fixer-upper and Nancy &amp; Elliot's house was a typical suburban tract ranch house while the single characters, Melissa, Gary &amp; Ellen all had apartments that reflected their varying income levels. Michael drove an old faded car that maybe 15 years earlier had been a higher priced foreign sports job. This same person's comments go on to say that no real guy ever watched the show except for one wimp that he knew. I think we can all read between the lines of what this reviewer is all about and we don't need my adding any personal reaction to those comments. On to more, grown-up, shall we say, observations about 30something.....<br/><br/>30something deserves its repuation as one of the best written dramatic shows that aired in the 80s. Storylines were original whether addressing traditional issues of career and homelife or veering off into sidelines as when the character Hope finds an old trunk in her attic and the show revolves around letters she finds in the attic. The show blended humor and drama and allowed it's characters flaws and strengths and showed relationships struggling, falling apart and enduring. <br/><br/>There were many favorite shows and storylines for me. The entire sequence of shows where Michael &amp; Elliot plot to takeover their advertising firm from the evil boss, Miles. The aforementioned WWII memory show. Who could forget the couple of shows that dealt with Gary's unexpected death in a car crash? And what about the shows detailing Gary's finally finding a woman to marry, Susannah and how everyone disliked her! Seeing Melissa find happiness in the arms of a younger man, Lee. And one of my favorite episodes, the marriage show between forever neurotic Ellen and her cartoonist boyfriend Billy?<br/><br/>The show was great and  my wife &amp; I still talk about the characters. I always jokingly said that ""Hope was perfect"" because of all the characters she was probably the most disciplined and level headed of the group. Even the character of Nancy, who in less competenant actor's hands could have come off as whiny was brought to the screen as a woman who had her hands full with an emotionally immature husband but was just trying to improve her marriage and her lot. <br/><br/>Another thing that is important to note about this show is that the drama had lots of humor running through it. Not over the top, comedy show humor, but humor nonetheless. For me, it will always be the perfect hour long dramatic show, because it was a show where I REALLY felt I could know these people. It wasn't some turgid, life threatening hospital show or some backstabbing cold blooded lawyer show or some cops and robbers show that my life will never be about. It was about, people like me, who had some creative impulses and who were married with kids, or before they were married struggling to establish a real adult life and get over the fact that college was long gone, etc. Time to grow up and deal maturely with your own self and those around you. Time to do it with discipline and humor and caring for others. <br/><br/>This was a great show with perfect casting. Now when will some cable channel start broadcasting these shows again so I can watch em all over again?",73 out of 90 found this helpful.,,4 May 2004
2195,Thirtysomething, Much Missed,"Finest ensemble drama series I have ever seen. It's 13 years since it finished yet it's still keenly missed by it's many devotees. Ths is made worse because it's not available on video or DVD, unlike other series' made by it's creators.<br/><br/>It suffered from the label of being 'yuppie' &amp; 'whiney', probably because the first series took a little time to settle into a rhythm. Yet it was anything but, being both serious and funny about the issues which affect everyone. Yet it never descended into a soap opera and the acting, writing and staging was of a consistently high standard.

2197,Thirtysomething," Love it or hate it, personally, I love it","I loved this show so much when it was on and never stopped. It may be my favorite TV show ever, definitely top 5. The negative reviews still get me irate, but it isn't for everyone, obviously. One irk was in the very first show, as everyone was telling Michael not to worry, Hope will lose the baby weight. Hope was as slim as anyone would ever want to be. So yeah, there were some contrived conversations for a brief bit, then they hit their stride and absolutely nailed it show after show.<br/><br/>I'm coming to the conclusion that a lot of people actively hate signs of intelligence. The characters weren't whiny, but they did discuss, a lot. If smart people having real conversations about life is boring or annoying, go watch Cagney and Lacey or Home Improvement. They weren't rich yuppies, the two main families were striving to have a nice home and work life, like most people were then, me included. The other characters chose more alternate lifestyles.<br/><br/>They were the first TV show to have two gay men in bed, even though they just talking. That really made  upset people off and I always assumed that the negative reaction hastened the end of the show, Too bad, I would have happily followed the characters along much longer and I wish there had been follow ups later.

2198,Thirtysomething, Given episodes often too painful for multiple viewings,"Spoilers may be here, if you haven't seen the series all the way through.<br/><br/>I recall the criticisms of this show at the time of its original broadcast: It was called a wine and brie look at self-absorbed, privileged babyboomers that every self-respecting lumpenprol should be insulted to be expected by the network to care about. (This was the time that saw the launch of Rosanne and Married With Children, after all, as well as the escalation of trash TV/talk TV into a national phenomenon.) I never watched thirtysomething until it reran for years on a popular cable network. Then I stumbled on a single episode one day while scanning, and I was immediately hooked. It hit me hard: How could I have missed this gem the first time? Had I been turned off to it by the universal invocation of yuppie imagery used to condemn it in its time? Probably so.<br/><br/>I taped the entire series in its eventual reincarnation in a matter of weeks. I never missed an episode, and watched each development voraciously, as one imagines an earlier generation may have a serialized novel by Dickens. But ya know what? Aside from certain episodes I have shown to friends, to turn them on to the show, I have seldom re-watched any of these shows. The tapes wait in the hangar for a time when a desperate nostalgia drives me to check this series out again. I do mean that one line summary, the title of this note, in the best possible way. But there is something here, in this decade+ old series, that is totally lacking in most TV and film today. That something would be a sense of what I will call emotional verisimilitude. Whether it was nudging your funnybone or tugging your heartstrings or mordantly evoking the battle of the sexes, thirtysomething rang true for anybody who has ever been there. --And for anybody with a brain and empathy and imagination who hasn't been there.<br/><br/>I believe it is the truth, as in The Truth, that makes it painful to look at a lot of times. Far from coddling a bunch of self-absorbed adults who refused to grow up, it put a mirror up to a good part of the generational demographic, forcing us to relive scenes from our life that we'd rather forget, or reminding us that there are hard days ahead. The quintessential episode goes like this: Michael's father comes to visit the family at holiday wearing an obvious and somewhat ill-fitting hairpiece. After general whispering within the family (they think he's getting vain in his old age, too) and a bit of hard ribbing by Melissa, he makes a nearly inaudible statement. ""It's the chemo."" That's how the episode in which Michael loses his father begins. And it ends with Michael Steadman crouched on the floor of a dark room, crying. Strong stuff. Throughout the run of the show marriages failed; more people got cancer; a major character gets killed on the bike ride to and from work; people are mistreated with impunity at work and then fired; some of the characters' ambitions, their hope that they might be somehow talented or special, are trashed. Just like real life. If TV wasn't a low common denominator vehicle for commercials, I think we might be tempted to call thirtysomething high drama, or art, or something that really mattered. Despite the vehicle, I think it was all those things, anyway.<br/><br/>Ten Big Stars.",18 out of 27 found this helpful.,,30 November 2002
2199,Thirtysomething, Why no DVD?,"I look back with a degree of nostalgia to the 1980's when my own kids were born and the work/life balance was a constant juggling act. Yes it was a 'yuppie' show as some have said but it was true to life for many, hitting a nerve for those of us struggling with young children and a slightly off-beat boss.<br/><br/>The acting and script writing was first rate and each of the characters utterly believable. I guess an airing now many reveal a show that is a little dated but it was true to its era. For all of us who really were in their thirties when the show was on prime time TV, please will someone out there consider releasing it on DVD!",13 out of 21 found this helpful.,8.0,8 July 2006
2200,Thirtysomething," ""The show that's just like life, only with better writers.""","The line above was how Lifetime plugged this show about yuppies when they repeated the four series; Fascinating Aida chose to describe the likes of Michael, Eliot et al as ""Yawningly Uninteresting People Paid Irritatingly Excessive Salaries."" Many non-fans of ""thirtysomething"" tended to agree, but despite not turning thirtysomething myself until well after I'd seen Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz's compelling series, I begged and beg to differ.<br/><br/>Focusing on Michael and Hope Seligman and their daughter Janey, Eliot and Nancy Weston and their children (Ethan and the other one), and their single friends - professor and Bjorn Borg-lookalike Gary, husky-voiced businesswoman Ellyn and photographer Melissa - they exhibited an Alfie-like tendency to wonder ""What's it all about?"" but it was done with sensitivity and more humour than you would expect considering the misery they went through, from Michael and Eliot's advertising company closing down to Nancy's battle with cancer. They were prone to indulging in fantasies throughout (the episode ""Whose Forest Is This?"" was virtually all fantasy, revolving as it did around the children's book Nancy and Ethan wrote together), but unlike a certain Boston lawyer, no dancing babies were involved and the only singing was on the soundtrack (Carly Simon notwithstanding).<br/><br/>""thirtysomething"" was essentially the soap for people who hated soaps, but better than that; the creative team proved that it wasn't a fluke when most of them came up with the marvellous ""My So-Called Life."" But I still think they shouldn't have killed off Gary.<br/><br/>Footnote: Miles Drentell, the slimy rival advertising man who Michael was compelled to work for, returned (again played by David Clennon) in Zwick and Herskovitz's later series ""Once and Again,"" in one of those  crossovers you almost never see in the hermetically sealed world of British television, which is one reason I always liked this show and was not happy when Sky One dropped it.

2202,Thirtysomething, ThirtySomething was a great show,"I miss watching this show. It was entertaining and thoughtful in some cases such as when Nancy had cancer.

I looked forward to my weekly time with them. I was only in my early to late 20's when it was on, but I can say that some of the angst that they went through, I also went through, so in some of the episodes I could relate.

2203,Thirtysomething," Don't thank me, just pass it forward","What you're thanking me for is saving you from the humiliation, revulsion and possible projectile vomiting that will ensue upon watching this offensive, dreadful series.<br/><br/>""Be afraid... be very afraid..."" A famous movie line which serves as apt advice for anyone foolish enough to consider viewing ""ThirtySomething."" Why such harsh words, you may ask? Answer: The ""show"" (for want of a better word) is a collection of glimpses into lives of people you will either hate or (hopefully) not care the least bit about; it is self-absorbed, pretentious in the extreme; it is childishly melodramatic. It is lacking in even an iota of cleverness, intelligence, or artfulness; it is offensive, really, in what it pretends to be, but never delivers. Worse than being an accurate portrayal of life among useless yuppies, it is a BORING portrayal of life among useless, narcissistic yuppies.<br/><br/>So, if you like your TV humorless, your drama vapid, and your characters hateful but bland, then by all means, run out and purchase the DVD (but don't pay more than eleven cents for it) right away.

Men without balls. Everyone was emotionally awkward. Ken Olin was having an emotional crisis every show because they were out of peanut butter and Tim Bushfield was a child with a wife he kept forcing to act like his mother.

Whew, how was that for a run-on sentence? But it was hard to care about these characters. It seemed to me that the writers secretly agreed with me, because the dilemmas these yuppies and their larvae faced brought into sharp relief the shallowness of their lives and their lack of empathy for others.",24 out of 54 found this helpful.,,22 September 2006
2206,Thirtysomething, Campy Yuppie soap opera.,"Thirtysomething isn't a show, that anyone can really take seriously. It revolves around a group of 80s Yuppies in their thirties, who spend too much time obsessing about their own angst. The show tried too hard to be 'deep and meaningful', and wound-up becoming a parody of itself. <br/><br/>Virtually all of the male characters on this show, suffer from arrested emotional development. They never seemed to come to terms, with the fact that they couldn't have everything their own way, all of the time. The thing is, they got their way ALMOST all of the time, which is more than most people do. Still, that wasn't good enough for these guys. They just didn't appreciate the fact, that they were better off than 90% of the general population.<br/><br/>Like the male characters, the women on Thirtysomething also seemed to concentrate too much on navel-gazing, so to speak. Most of these women are intelligent, capable, and pursued interesting careers. Yet they were still consumed with insecurity about themselves, and their lives in general. Worst of all, they were too willing to be excessively accommodating, towards the often immature men in their lives.<br/><br/>The fact that the females on this show were frequently demeaned, was a reflection of the 80s backlash against feminism. In her book entitled ""Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women"", Susan Faludi eloquently pointed-out that Thirtysomething was guilty, of negative portrayals of the females characters. Especially compared to the male characters, who were much less evolved, than the female characters. So for those hoping to see a show that gave women adequate respect, Thirtysomething definitely disappoints in that regard.<br/><br/>Thirtysomething's only real entertainment value, is it's campy quality. After all, a show that tried so diligently, to convince viewers that over-privileged Yuppies are so riveting, has GOT to be camp of the highest order. I'd like to see a quality TV drama created about the poor, and/or minorities, who have truly harsh realities to deal with in life.

2207,Thirtysomething," ThirtySomething the ""reality"" before Reality TV","While watching Children Of The Corn with my youngest daughter (I'm that kind of mom) I couldn't help but reflect on Peter Horton.

I was fully invested in Michael &amp; Hope, Eliot &amp; Nancy, and Melissa &amp; Gary. I didn't really care foie Polly Draper's character Ellen. But I was in love Gary;just like everyone else tuning in. The handsome, unattached college professor of English lit was a well developed character that obviously was the inspiration for Mark Sloan on Grey' Anatomy several years later. Horton produced GA in 2005- 207. ThirtySomething was the predecessor to all the dramas we're all watching now. For the first time, a drama was based around nothing more than the ordinary lives of normal people. Opening the door for shows today. The reality was honest and spun truthfully;portraying the 80s lifestyle perfectly. Each character has their moment but none as significant as Gary's.

2209,Thirtysomething," Brilliantly written and acted, ahead of its time","This is one of those shows I miss and could have watched forever. I'd also love to see the characters revisited in fortysomething or fiftysomething, but the creators are having considerable success making movies (most notably Glory) so I'm not holding my breath.<br/><br/>This show was ground-breaking in the depth and honesty of its portrayal of many aspects of modern life that had either never been dealt with on the big or small screen, or which had been treated superficially, including: * becoming a parent (e.g. there's an entire episode about the first time you leave your baby alone all night) * infidelity (one of the two central couples goes through a painful divorce, involving children, shared friends, etc.) * cancer (one of central characters has a long battle with cancer) * infertility * AIDS * unemployment * loneliness (at one point two of the characters get into a video-dating service together) * academic politics And probably a bunch of other things I haven't thought of.<br/><br/>Despite being about ""ordinary lives"" in a way that only sitcoms such as Seinfeld even approach, it managed to be compelling, funny, and memorable. I was actually hooked sometime in the second season when I was channel surfing and listened to a snippet of conversation where one character referred to someone's behavior as being controlled by their ""reptile brain"" and realizing it was actually a show pitched at an intelligent audience.<br/><br/>Almost uniquely among American television shows, there were no doctors, lawyers, or policemen. The two central characters (Michael and Elliot) run a small ad agency which goes under. The central idea of the show, according to the two creators in an interview with Playboy (1989, I think) was that it would be about two friends who go into business together and the business fails. This is, perhaps, one of the central experiences of middle class life in the United States, and I don't think it's ever been dealt with in a TV series before or since.<br/><br/>And finally, Miles Drentel (David Clennon) is plays one of the most magnetically evil (insofar as anyone in this show was evil) characters in TV history.<br/><br/>Correction to the data on display: Gary (played by Peter Horton) died towards the end of the final season.

Subtract apologies between these characters the day after they find miniature ways to offend each other, and you've hardly got a plot.  <br/><br/>My favorite bit was when Timothy B-something, I think his name was (the red-headed actor) got his big chance to direct a commercial, and showed a black guy how he wanted a 'hood walk performed. <br/><br/>Worst moment was when a most annoying woman character went ballistic because on a date the guy (the boss at the ad agency) tried to kiss her!

Doctors), and their relationships:  as a couple, family, friends, at work, and at their place of worship.  A series about the relationships of people in their home, school, and society as a whole. The best television series of my adulthood! Television can be a wonderful media if people with brains like this group can get hold of it and do great work.. My husband and I watched it, his boss and his wife watched. It was a great show even for book worms like us! We who were thirty something and could identify with the characters. The show had very good role models. If  you take the time to read about it, you can see that they had directors such as Timothy Busfield, Mel Harris, Marshall Herskovitz,  Peter Horton,  Melanie Mayron,   Ken Olin, and brilliant Oscar winner actor Gary Sinise (Forest Gump). What an ingenious group of people. Then the series was just taken off the air by someone obviously not  brilliant, which made us all really mad! <br/><br/>There had not been a drama series so well written since then. Thanks to Paul Reiser (The Story of Us)  and Helen Hunt (As Good as it Gets) we had the privilege of watching some similar relationships on TV in their comedy Mad About You.   Good series like those are hard to come by.  I would love to tell more about the rest of the cast, but there are no time and space here. Perhaps one day it will run in syndication in reasonable hours and please do yourself a favor: Watch It!  I would record  the entire series and watch it over and over! Favorite Episodes: Thanksgiving Dinner; Melissa getting her work in a art show. Less liked  episodes:  Gary Shepherd played by Peter Horton, dying  in a car accident. The series' most shocking scenes! I can still remember when Michael goes to the morgue to identify him.  I remember it so vividly after all those years. Those last episodes of the show when Elliot Weston, Timothy Busfield (Quiz Show ) was finally beginning to be a responsible husband because his wife, Nancy Weston,  Patricia Wettig (L.A.

It was the mid 70s and we didn't even have a space shuttle yet. The ships, clothes and hardware of this show looked like something I could possibly experience in my lifetime. I figured that by 1999, I would be living and working in space as an adult. Well none of that really panned out but all these years later, this show is still great fun to watch. It has a style and mood that is so unique. I hope they never try to do a remake. Part of it's charm is how 70s it is. The bell bottom uniforms, the sketchy science, the sideburns. It's all so perfect. As a child, this show made me excited for the future like nothing else.",106 out of 120 found this helpful.,,18 June 2004
2220,Space: 1999, An excellent series! One of the Sci - fi greats!,"Space: 1999 to me is a truly excellent series. Produced and created by the great Gerry Anderson, it was the most expensive science fiction series of it's time and looks it!! The first Season provided us with some excellent episodes, and some excellent performances from the series leads - Martin Landau, Barbara Bain and Barry Morse. Some of the best episodes of Season One include the wonderfully dark and menacing 'Dragon's Domain', 'The Alpha Child', 'Voyagers Return', 'The Last Enemy', 'Breakaway', 'The War Games', 'Space Brain' and many others. The series writing was, despite the bad press it has often received since, pretty exceptional, although there are a few let downs. Despite the series brilliance occasionally in the Season you will see episodes that suffer from poor pacing - 'The Troubled Spirit' for example, but these episodes are few in number only about 2 or 3 really, so they are easy to overlook, and all series will usually slip up somewhere!!! It is entirely forgivable. I mention this because I am trying to be a reasonable critic to the series, and not just include all the qualities I love about it!! Unfortunately the first season didn't really take off, but a surprisingly generous I.T.C backing allowed a Second Season to be made. I say this because I.T.C's usual concern about how British programmes appealed to the American audience led certain series to have a very short life. Many Gerry Anderson series have been affected by this, The Secret Service seems to be the best example. Due to the marital breakup of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, Gerry had to hire a new producer. He chose Fred Freiberger, ex- producer of the final series of Star Trek. He changed the series already shaky continuity completely and made the show more Action orientated. This idea appealed to some, but Martin Landau has gone on record for saying that although Freiberger may have helped the show in some aspects, his ideas were (in the opinion of Landau) very boring compared to the way that Season One had been produced. Johnny Byrne the series regular script editor has gone on record in saying (in his words) that Season 2 was 'complete rubbish'!, even basing the story 'The Dorcons' on his dislike to the way that Season 2 was produced. Whatever your views on the Second Season (I personally like it very much, although it takes time to adjust to Season 2 compared to Season 1) some classic stories were produced during it's time. 'The Metamorph' introducing Maya a wonderful character that can change into most forms of living matter, played superbly by Catherine Schell, 'The Rules of Luton', 'The Dorcons', 'The Immunity Syndrome', 'The Lambda Factor', 'The Exiles', 'New Adam New Eve' and many others. The second season was arguably though, the most exciting, with upbeat music and lots of action, the flaw being that some of the scripts were pretty poor. Although 'The Beta Cloud' is a good episode in many aspects, the script is admittedly lousy. As he had done in the First Season, excellent Sci-fi writer Johnny Byrne provides some of the best scripts in Season 2, usually much more serious than other stories, obviously refusing to bow down to Freiberger's 'Scooby Doo action' idea as Freiberger himself described it, lots of action with lots of often silly humour. 'The Bringers of Wonder' despite being very exciting is a ludicrous story in places, and 'The Taybor' despite having some good qualities also suffers from this weakness. However overall I feel Season 2 was a good Season, and it is deeply sad that a third season never got past the drawing board stages. However we must be grateful for what we have got. All the episodes are now provided on shiny DVD's for the enjoyment of all who remember or have come to like the series over it's 30 years existence. Season 1 provided us with lavish and menacing stories, often with hidden morales and examples of the failings of human nature and it's fight to survive in a frequently hostile environment. Season 2 provided us with upbeat and exciting stories, exploring often the most bizarre and intriguing aspects of Science fiction 'The Rules of Luton' for example - highly evolved plants!!! Overall an excellent series, one which belongs with all of the Science fiction greats.",44 out of 49 found this helpful.,9.0,22 June 2006
2221,Space: 1999, You don't feel at home in deep space.,"The first science fiction work I ever saw was Space:1999, and i was six. Italian Tv had co-produced the stuff so it was aired around 6pm, not a very appropriate slot to broadcast scenes of people burned alive by their commander's lasergun... I probably had nightmares about it, but  missing a single episode was out of the question. I got to see some first season episodes some twenty years later and I appreciated the show even more. I don't recall much of the second season apart Maya and Tony, so let me concentrate on the first one.<br/><br/>The electronic soundtrack and the opening credits (a kind of ""Pulp Fiction"" style guitar alternated with an orchestral version of the same theme) were very original, as it was the look of the Eagles: they are solid transport spacecrafts  but at the same time one can see their pilots from the outside, so that Eagles seem vulnerable... well, they are, most of the time. Base Alpha is a large, well lit and comfortable place (some stylish seventies furniture, too) which is home and prison at the same time.<br/><br/>Anyway the most peculiar aspect is the atmosphere in Moonbase Alpha: The crew is shocked for what happened to them, unprepared to deal with the future, they don't agree with each other, they make mistakes, they often prefer not to show much emotion. No ""Space as the last frontier"" rhetoric, here. Space is cold and mistakes are lethal. That increases the realism even if 1999 is well past. Action progresses like a slowly unfolding bad dream.<br/><br/>Don't believe people complaining about bad acting. They just expect things that Space:1999 wasn't going to offer. The actors performed well. For example, Commander Koenig (the symbolism in the name is evident) is waiting for the ""black sun"" to swallow the base, he's talking with Prof. Bergman. He's about to break into tears but manages to restrain himself so that his eyes show only a little trace of what he's feeling underneath: A very good performance from Martin Landau, nearly impossible to find in better rated SF series/movies.",69 out of 79 found this helpful.,,20 January 2004
2222,Space: 1999, One of those shows that gets better with time.,"OK, after reading a few posts, I had to include one as well. I too was a charter watcher of space 1999, back when the 20th century was but just 3/4 through. I was excited because the Moonbase Alpha was obviously inspired by the Moonbase in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Of course Space 1999 was no 2001, so my expectations were met with disappointment. Early in the first Season my dad came in while ""Dragon's Domain"" was airing. We both frowned when the tentacled monster came in, seemed every bit as childish as one of those ""Lost in Space"" episodes with a monster on the prowl, and my dad asked to change the channel, arguing that that show could have been made by any idiot! As much as I hated agreeing with with him I felt the same way, and changed the channel to a nature program. Neither one of us were aware that episode was directed by Charles Crichton (who died in 1999) the man behind the British classic ""The Lavender Hill Mob"" in 1951 and later ""A Fish called Wanda"" in 1987! <br/><br/>I continued to watch this show and few weeks later my dad plopped down on the couch for ""The Black Sun"". This time we were both deeply moved with the same awe and wonder of Kubrick's 2001. To me this type of stuff is science fiction at it's best (Everything Disney's ""The Black Hole"" should have been). Space 1999 was a mixed bag for me; some of the shows like the one where they became prehistoric cavemen, really sucked, while others were highly imaginative. Several episodes later my dad sat in on another viewing and after awhile, exclaimed that ""it's a much more beautifully made show than that one by Desilu!"" (referring to ""Star Trek"").<br/><br/>Space 1999 came out at a time when television was in an interesting era. 1975 yielded a record worst season; the most embarrassing new TV shows to premier and disappear in a single season. Many dreadful sitcoms including one set in a prison (On the Rocks) clearly revealed the desperate state of affairs the entertainment industry was in at the time. Meanwhile an offbeat show featuring never-before-imagined live comedy sketches premiered one late Saturday night and television would never be the same again! <br/><br/>Space 1999 was another attempt to give the audiences something new and I'm glad it lasted as long as it did. Shortly after it's American premier, Barbra Bain appeared on ""The Tonight Show"" and explained to Johnny Carson why this series was syndicated for broadcast on local channels rather than network television. Producer Gerry Anderson had offered it to the networks who guaranteed only 13 air dates with more to follow...........if the Nielsen ratings were high enough. With 26 episodes already in the can, the only package Gerry would consider was a full season, which the networks balked at. So the big budget show ended up on KHJ channel 9 here in Los Angeles, and after a full season, lasted another round. Some new changes included women in skirts instead the the pantsuits And lovely transmute alien Catherine Schell added some eye candy to the show. Also more humorous overtones were introduced.<br/><br/>Some of these episodes remain with me today, including one where they retrieve an early unmanned Earth spacecraft with the help of a scientist who had engineered the propulsion system; the notorious Quella drive, which was responsible for massive destruction and loss of life including aliens which dispatched scouts to follow and exact revenge upon the planet of origin (Earth).<br/><br/>Really powerful stuff this show could sometimes be! Like Saturday Night Live, and ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman (another syndicated series that came a couple months later which creator Norman Lear said ""The show the networks couldn't handle""), Space 1999 was part of a golden era when television was experimenting with new ideas. SNL live took the crown for television and a couple years later ""Star Wars"" got it for the silver screen, redefining to most what science fiction should be (in that case a western!) But Space 1999 aimed much higher IMHO, seeking out what science fiction can be! <br/><br/>Prior to this show I was a sometimes watcher a previous Gerry Anderson show: ""U.F.O."" and I really liked his feature ""Journey to the Far Side of the Sun"" It's too bad creatively in science fiction today is in itself a science.............of just how much money the dam thing is going to make!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",26 out of 28 found this helpful.,,18 November 2007
2223,Space: 1999, A life-long fan,"Very interesting to read many of the comments regarding the show. The best way to summarize is that either you ""get"" what Space: 1999 is all about or you don't.<br/><br/>Year One (Series One) was sci-fi fantasy of the highest order and was an incredible blend of mood, music, amazing sets, props and model work along with fantastic, even metaphysical/mystical stories that didn't merely take you there but actually PUT you in the action amongst the wonder and horror that the Alphans were facing. Admittedly, this is much heavier fare than what most tv viewers are looking for... simple, escapist, campy sci-fi this was definitely not. Year Two took that approach and while it had some successful moments (I'd say 1/2 of the 24 shows are fairly good, the other rather sub-par) it is pretty much a different and almost unrelated show and I leave that for others to comment on.<br/><br/>Up until that time, the only tv sci-fi/fantasy shows that had been so daring in their approach to tackle stories and situations that could be so dire for the characters involved were The Twilight Zone and the original Outer Limits. However, those shows involved a rotating set of stories with new actors and actresses. Thus, each episode presented a fresh set of characters and circumstances with a different set of problems and history to learn but without the psychological guilt and weight that resulted from the mistakes of previous episodes.<br/><br/>This of course made 1999 unique outside of perhaps MASH and All in the Family where viewers would continually recall tragedies or failures from previous episodes that would hang like a cloud over all future  episodes giving the show itself a darker more pessimistic outlook. However, those shows relied on heavy doses of comedy to lighten the mood, something that 1999 rarely ever had.<br/><br/>Yes, Year One of 1999 is rather heavy viewing but in spite of this in 1975, as a 10 year old, I became an instant and life-long fan of the show while watching premiere of the first episode Breakaway. The 23 episodes that were to follow were a magnificent journey into the unknown that has never been replicated by any other tv show I have seen before or since. The show is certainly not perfect as one becomes quickly familiar with many faux-paus such as certain sets not corresponding with the model work but the show has aged remarkably well and the dvd's, with their generally excellent picture quality, reveal a quality of production nearing that of full-feature movies.<br/><br/>
And complaints about poor science don't diminish its impact. I've always taken the mind-set approach of imagine if this could happen... the kind of leap of faith that we do with accepting all the abilities of Superman. Thus, if the moon was blasted from earth orbit and transported into another part of our universe where our known laws of science and physics don't always apply then these are the stories of what could happen to these men and women of Alpha and that we don't always learn the answer of what really happened or why.<br/><br/>I find this a better, even more realistic approach than that of so many Trek episodes where they technobabble the viewer to death every episode coming up with unbelievable solutions to every problem under the sun in a matter of hours every episode. Even in today's world we often don't know exactly what happened such as the exact reason why the latest shuttle burned up in re-entry... we have a good idea but will likely never know the complete answer.<br/><br/>Thus, for me Year One is like having 24 mini-movies and when one looks past its flaws you see a show that was unbelievably brave in its presentation. I find the acting to be reserved but quite intense at the same time... definitely not wooden. Also, the show abounds in caring character moments but they are very subtle such as a touch of the arm or holding of a hand, slap on the back or a subtle glance and smile. And significantly, it showed some of the most shocking scenes of any tv show in history such as the trapped Commissioner at the end of Earthbound, the laser-fried Alphan in Force of Life, the unfortunate scientist who lost his immortality in Death's Other Dominion or the life-sucking tentacle monster in Dragon's Domain.<br/><br/>
Nearly every episode has an ""always remember that"" moment and that ultimately is the legacy of Space: 1999. It was incredibly memorable and set new standards for what could be achieved and if many deem that that it failed at least it had the guts to try.<br/><br/>On that note I say to the uninitiated ""GIVE THE SHOW A TRY!"" If you approach it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is instead of what it isn't you'll probably be pleasantly surprised. Often there is a great deal more going on under the surface that you don't always pick up on until repeated viewings and the show really starts to hit its stride after the first ten episodes or so.<br/><br/>Some of my favourites are: Dragon's Domain Voyager's Return The Testament of Arkadia Black Sun Earthbound Mission of the Darians Another Time, Another Place Breakaway The Last Sunset End of Eternity War Games The Troubled Spirit The Infernal Machine",86 out of 101 found this helpful.,10.0,27 August 2003
2224,Space: 1999, Memories..............,"When I think of Space 1999 I think of South Side Elem School, Schwinn Sting-Ray 5 Speed Bikes, My dad's Navy Blue 1974 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme &amp; my parents big 25in cabniet model Zenith TV.  When this show was on the air it was the hottest thing to hit TV since the original Star Trek. I remember all the toys, the big plastic EAGLES and the walkie talkie communicators and battery powered laser guns. Catherine Schell as MAYA still holds the  Sexiest Alien girl ever Trophy in my opinion. I was very sad to learn from this site that Tony Anholt passed away of a brain tumor in July 2002. To this day I am at a loss as to why this series had such a short life. I suspect production costs in the UK sank it.  To any of the former cast &amp; crew who may read this, Martin, Barbara, Nick, Catherine, &amp; so many others thanks so much for the memories and for an outstanding job.

2225,Space: 1999, My childhood SF hero,"A long time has passed since I last time saw my favourite SciFi programme. Still, with no disrespect, it is the best SciFi I have ever seen. Special effects is not the only thing that makes a SciFi (as well as any other sort of movies) attractive, good and memorable. It is a good script, fine cast and the atmosphere of the time when it has been broadcast. In case of the Space 1999, there is also a strong context of reality. Compared with the other similar programmes and movies, the Space 1999 deals with familiar objects (like Moon), provides usually the imaginable situations. All these make people watching the show more capable to identify themselves with characters and situations. Certainly, the Space 1999 had caught me in front of my TV every Saturday night.

2226,Space: 1999, Best Sci-Fi series ever (1st season),"I have been a huge fan of Space:1999 since I was about 5 years old (yes, really) But whereas at that age it was mostly the special effects, and the Eagles that grabbed my attention, as  time went by; I started to realize that most of the first season episodes were imbued with a metaphysical element that had totally escaped me before. I think this is by far the most well-conceived science-fiction series ever, and that the cast was not only diverse and representative but also acted very well. In some important ways Space; 1999 (having caught me at a most impressionable age) helped shape many of my thoughts on the future of humanity - and on the relevancy of Science-Fiction to our increasingly globalized culture - an absolute novelty back in 1975.

2227,Space: 1999, Loved it and still do!,"I saw the show when I was a teenager and loved it instantly. And I still do, as I observed when I saw it again more than 20 years later. Sure, the environment and the tricks are looking a little cheap today, so what. Every show is aging. There isn't much action as in Star Trek, which at one point only seemed to discover planets with beautiful but strange women. Much of the action is between the characters, how to deal with fear,their situation and the loneliness... Love it or hate it, the show had something special. Till today I saved a huge crush on Martin Landau as an actor, I watch everything, even his weakest movies. And I saved a huge crush on Captain Alan Carter as a character of the show, I'd love to be an Eagle-Pilot! Forget that it's a 70s show and enjoy it.",15 out of 17 found this helpful.,8.0,8 April 2007
2228,Space: 1999, Groundbreaking science fiction series that was in a league within itself. Commemorating Space:1999 on its 40th anniversary,"On commemorating the 40th anniversary of this show this was at its time science fiction television of the highest order and it was an incredible blend of spectacular special effects,amazing sets along with some of the most fantastic,even metaphysical/mystical stories that put you in with the action amongst the wonders and horrors the Alphas were facing in the far reaches of outer space. The short-lived award winning science fiction series ""SPACE:1999"" was created and produced by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson who also served as executive producers of the series. The series was the last production by the partnership of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson and when it premiered in 1975 was the most expensive science fiction series produced for British television at the time it was made at a cost of $300,000 per episode. The first season was co-produced by the British television company ITC Productions and the Italian production company RAI Productions. The second season was produced only by ITC Productions. Before this series was made the partnership of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson were known for their children's action-adventure programs including ""Fireball XL-5"", ""Stingray"", ""Thunderbirds!"",and ""Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons"",and for there live-action produced shows that included the science-fiction drama ""UFO"",and their only live- action espionage/crime-drama series ""The Protectors"". ""SPACE:1999"" was originally pitched in the United States to all three major television networks(ABC,NBC,&amp; CBS) with NBC expressing interest in the series as a mid-season replacement. As a result,all three major television networks rejected the offer. The series ended up in the United States shown in first-run national syndication for two seasons producing 48 episodes in color from September 4,1975 until November 12,1977. Out of the 48 episodes that this series produced, a total of 24 episodes were made from September 4,1975 until February 12,1976. Season 2 also produced 24 episodes in it's final season airing from September 4,1976 until November 12,1977. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson were executive producers throughout it's entire run. Former ""Star Trek"" producer Fred Freiburger was the producer for all of Season 2 and for all 24 episodes in it's final season.<br/><br/>The British produced series starred Martin Landau and Barbara Bain(of ""Mission:Impossible"" fame),and Canadian actor Barry Morse(of Quinn Martin's ""The Fugitive"") along with co-stars Nick Tate and Zienia Merton. Throughout the series entire run only actors Martin Landau and Barbara Bain along with Nick Tate and Zienia Merton remained with the exception of Barry Morse who appeared in all 24 episodes of Season 1. In the series second and final season actor Barry Morse was replaced by Catherine Schell. Also added to the cast for Season 2 were actors Tony Anholt, John Hug, and Jeffrey Kissoon. ""SPACE:1999"" drew a great deal of visual inspiration and technical expertise from Stanley Kubrick's 1968 theatrical film ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" along with the show's special effects director Brian Johnson who had previously worked on the ""Thunderbirds!"" television series and on Kubrick's theatrical film. <br/><br/>To basically get the idea of what ""SPACE:1999"" was about requires heavy viewing in spite of this was out of the ordinary when it came out in 1975. Season 1 of the series is highly recommended and I would highly recommend seeing the pilot episode ""Breakaway"" which sets the tone for what was to come. The original 24 episodes from Season 1 that were to follow were into a magnificent journey into the unknown reaches of space that gave viewers a retrospective that no other television series of this period has seen before or since. It was Britian's answer to ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost In Space"". An grand astounding achievement when it came out during the mid-1970's. The other episodes that stood out from Season 1 of the series were ""A Matter of Life and Death"", ""Dragon's Domain"", ""End of Eternity"", ""Earthbound"", ""The Testament of Arkadia"", ""The Last Sunset"", ""Mission of the Darians"", ""Space Brain"", and ""The Alpha Child"" just to name a few. The second and final season of the series also had some good episodes ranging from the two-part ""The Bringers of Wonder"", to other Season 2 episodes that followed included ""Dorzak"", ""The Journey to Where"", ""The Immunity Syndrome"", ""The Metamorph"", ""The Seed of Destruction"", ""The Dorcons"",and ""The AB Chrysalis"" and even ""The Rules of Luton"" were just a few of the good episodes in its second and final season. The rest of the episodes from Season 2 did not hold their own as the series basically stoop to the level of a Saturday Morning cartoon show. The guest stars ranged from some of the best British actors in the business ranging from Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, Joan Collins, Sarah Douglas, Jeremy Kemp and Peter Bowles. When it was canceled in the fall of 1977 the series continued in syndicated repeats for some United States network affilate stations(where it was shown on late nights and weekends) until March of 1978.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,18 April 2016
2229,Space: 1999, 2001 A Space Odyssey: The TV Series!,"What a prophetic show. Although it sorta missed the mark on 1999 being the year the moon blows out, it did predict that teeny bikinis &amp; bellbottoms would come back in style.<br/><br/>This is probably the most conservative scifi show that ever made it to prime time. By ""conservative"" I mean ""realistic"". There aren't a lot of 3-headed aliens, space wars &amp; planet-deafening laser guns like we may see in other scifi shows of the time. Instead, we get a much more realistic (yet every bit as dramatic) portrayal of the near future.<br/><br/>In the 40s, 50s and 60s, scifi was synonymous with campy cheese. Then in 1969, Stanley Kubrick hit us with the masterpiece ""2001"" whose minimalistic, sterile &amp; psychological approach made us suddenly take the future seriously.<br/><br/>Here we have a TV series that followed Kubrick's lead admirably. Visuals are very 2001-ish: bright white, somewhat cold and clinical. Themes are equally provocative, touching on mindbending concepts of physics (like the Unified Field Theory, summarized as ""Everything is everything else"") and momentary glimpses into theology &amp; the question of whether there is a greater intelligence guiding us. Like ""2001"", therein lies the power of this show. It touches on the most unanswerable questions of existence, presenting certain possibilities without being too sure about itself.<br/><br/>By not-knowing, it makes everything seem plausible. The characters aren't a bunch of hotshots who always save the day with the right answers. Rather, they often make catastrophic mistakes as they stumble through uncharted territory with no control over their situation. It's a very humble approach to scifi.<br/><br/>The star, Martin Landau said it best in a recent interview: ""I like the idea of (the moon) going off into space and not being able to control the trajectory. Star Trek is years in the future; they can run around and do what they want. But the moon has 300 people onboard, and we can't procreate, we can just support ... and we can't steer this thing. We're not emotionally and/or technologically able to do that if we wanted to ... It's an accident and we're not ready for it.""<br/><br/>Again, going back to 2001 (which, if you haven't guessed, is one of my fave movies), it establishes the same Kubrickian philosophy that we are stumbling through space, awkwardly trying to find our footing, making mistakes but trying to learn and evolve while surviving. Isn't that that the whole point of life?<br/><br/>Enough pseudo-philosophy. This show is just plain freaking cool. Created by miniature-model-experts Gerry &amp; Syliva Anderson, the spaceships, moonbase and moon scenery are extremely impressive. Sure, there may be a cheesy 70s effect here or there, but for the most part everything is convincing enough to maintain your suspension of disbelief. Music is really cool, too, and I'm not just talking about the awesome 1st season themesong. For example, the episode ""Dragon's Domain"" is notable for its use of the haunting classical piece Albinoni's Adagio in G minor (used also in the 1976 scifi masterpiece ""Rollerball"").<br/><br/>Be forewarned, when Space:1999 switched from season 1 to season 2, there were some major changes. Overall it became much less cerebral, much more action-oriented (that's a nice way of saying ""cheesy""). While most die-hard fans cling to season 1 as the definitive Space:1999, I think season 2 had some really cool episodes too. But I think it's best to start with season 1. If your time is limited, check out the episodes ""Breakaway"", ""Black Sun"", ""Earthbound"", ""The Infernal Machine"". And if you want a really trippy Dali-esque surreal experience, try ""The Missing Link"".<br/><br/>Love it or hate it, you'll have to agree it's like no other scifi TV series you've ever seen!",15 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,23 August 2012
2230,Space: 1999, The greatest thing on tv.... when you were eight years old....,"I have intensely fond memories of this show.  I always seemed to associate it with some of the best memories of my childhood, although sometimes I wonder if those memories were so good because I had a show I was so fond of to relate to in my memory.<br/><br/>As such, my expectations of this show were abnormally high.  Years later, when I finally got my hands on the box sets of both series, I was destined to be.... disappointed?  Not really.  After all those years I'd come to understand that nothing my child's mind had interpreted as ""great"" was ever going to meet the standards of my adult point of view.<br/><br/>As with everyone who has commented on this show, it is almost impossible to watch S99 as a combined 48 episode tv show.  The differences between the seasons are far too great.  Season 1 is marvellously primal and epic in its intentions, earnest in its realisation and grim and depressing in its reflection.  It was also class ham, far more 1960's than were most shows made in 1974.  The characters were all a pretty grim lot, but after 24 episodes you start to warm to them, feeling for their predicament.  The individual episodes really stood out, especially Dragon's Domain, The Infernal Machine, Black Sun, Force of Life, The Last Sunset, Earthbound, Mission of the Darians, The Last Enemy, Space Brain and End of Eternity. Season 2 was a necessitated shift away from this grimness, because without it there wouldn't have been a season 2, for better or worse.  It doesn't have the same epic feel or the sense that things are quite as desperate for the crew of Moonbase Alpha, and carries with it a greater sense of character, without the sense of depth.  It was too far in the other direction, in my opinion, which was why we didn't see a season 3.  The producers just never managed to settle the show down into something that would both be dramatic and acceptable to the casual viewer.<br/><br/>But this was the first show I ever followed, in my memory, week after week without fail, and so I love it to bits, even with all of its faults.  If made today, I wouldn't be anywhere near as forgiving for those faults. Times have changed, for everyone, I suppose.",36 out of 50 found this helpful.,9.0,31 July 2004

When combined with model work far superior to UFO or Thunderbirds, the alien vistas were, for wont of a better word, painterly.<br/><br/>Some of it is campy. The acting is inconsistent. Sometimes the science is bad &amp; there are too many 'psychic' episodes, but I have the entire series and it's one of my favorite possessions.<br/><br/>Slightly related, incredibly obscure reference that won't help anyone: Once a friend of mine met a fellow who was a big Peter Hammill fan, who had never heard the VDGG album 'Still Life' but had just bought it and was carrying it around. When he gleaned this from the gentlemen, he told him, ""My god man, why are you just standing there--go home and listen to that CD!"" If you are a fan of (as these things go) smart, complicated, visually striking vintage SF TV &amp; you haven't seen Space 1999--go and buy it &amp; watch it--you're in for a treat--and there are enough episodes you can spend pretty much 48 hours straight with it before you run out of content...

The memory cheats sometimes. You remember things better than they were. With Space:1999 it committed grand larceny. The science is horrible. The moon is somehow traveling faster than light. In the episode Dragon's Domain, Dr. Russell informs us that they are currently BETWEEN GALAXIES. Did the writer confuse solar systems with galaxies? That would be very bad. I don't think the writer did. That is also very bad. Season two is better. In the second season our heroes discovered colors other than white and beige. They also have a big screen which they call the big screen. I'm currently watching it (and enjoying it) for what it is. Fun. It's not Star Trek. It's not even Star Trek the Animated Series.

2234,Space: 1999, A Series Of Great Bits Rather Than Great Episodes,"A five-star opening episode, Barbara Bain, Barry Morse, Bill Fraser, some striking eagle miniature effects, some haunting year one Barry Gray music, some in-your-face action music in year two, disaster plot lines in year one, monsters in year two, The Beta Cloud...this series is not too bad at all. Granted, I can think of about ten sci-fic TV shows I like more than Space 1999, but then, I can think of about 100 sci-fic shows that are less pleasing.<br/><br/>Here are some highlights of the series...<br/><br/>EPISODE ONE: BREAKAWAY: This was the only episode that was a total winner from the first frame to the last frame. Shades of Star Trek: The Motion Picture with a new commander taking over things, shades of a disaster movie, shades of 1960s Lost In Space, tiny moments of Australia with Alan Carter getting a few short bits, but best of all, the Barry Gray score is so hauntingly good you will shake your head wondering why current sci-fic is missing such good music. Best episode of the series.<br/><br/>EPISODE TWO: MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH: A small drop in quality is present even in these early stages. This episode has a highly touching scene where the music steals the scene. Barbara Bain glares out of a moonbase window at a distant planet, the commander walks up to her, note the music playing here...a simply outstanding work of art!<br/><br/>BLACK SUN: Good, Barry Morse is fine, don't know about the ending???<br/><br/>COLLISION COURSE: This plays like a disaster movie and for that reason it is well worth a look. Some great moments here.<br/><br/>WAR GAMES: The teaser and act one are outstanding but you can have the rest! Great battle scenes in space filmed with great music playing over it.<br/><br/>SPACE BRAIN: It begins so well, it ends so well, but forget about act one, act two, act three! Someone let the washing machine go for too long and this also happened in Land Of The Giants episode Brainwash. Great music and disaster...again!<br/><br/>YEAR TWO OPENER: THE METAMORPH: What a start! What a teaser! I was at the edge of my seat in the 1970s! However, after a shocked Bill Fraser (new cast member) struggles to fly his eagle away from a strange ball in space, the problems start as early as act one. But the action music and drama of the teaser make The Metamorph well worth a look. Also, you must hang around for the end, Landau gets a great closing line...his best line of the series in fact. THE MARK OF ARCHANON: Attention Australian fans! Alan Carter lets out a few Aussie terms and ideas that make this one a Down Under treat! SEEDS OF DESTRUCTION: Landau goes nuts, which bring back memories of 1960s Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea when the leads went nuts in Voyage year three/year four.<br/><br/>THE BETA CLOUD: This episode is reviewed by me in detail on this site...the second best episode of the whole series! SPACE WARP: Great space warp start, great monster, great eagle action. A MATTER OF BALANCE: Quality outdoor filming, nice to see Bill Fraser again, but... THE BRINGERS OF WONDER PART ONE: Out-of-control Landau in out-of-control eagle in teaser. THE SEANCE SPECTRE: Dust planet eagle effects coated with action music.

2235,Space: 1999, A Classic Sci- Fi Series,"The bottom line for me is that I enjoyed ""Space:1999""  It's interesting reading the reviews here ranging from condemnation to adulation.  Any movie or TV series will inspire as many opinions as there are viewers.<br/><br/>
I thought that the series was well thought-out and the premise was sound. The crew of Moonbase Alpha had to face many perils and surprises after the moon has been knocked out of its orbit by mis-calculated nuclear explosions and wanders through the reaches of space.  I thought the special effects, the acting, and the scripts added up to a great sci-fi series.  Unlike some other reviewers I do not believe it was a knock-off of ""Star Trek.""  No, ""Space:1999"" was oriiginal and many episodes had plots with subtleties and deeper meanings.<br/><br/>Of the characters, I especially liked the brave Alan Carter (Nick Tate) and Dr. Victor Bergman (Barry Morse), the scientist and philosopher.  Some other reviewers have criticized Martin Landau, but he did a faithful job of playing Commander Koenig, a very reserved and serious man who carried the responsibility for the entire colony.  I think Mr. Landau is an excellent actor, but he has been typecast to playing characters with a very serious personality, and sometimes the villians.  You couldn't possibly like James Mason's henchman in ""North by Northwest"" for example.<br/><br/>
Several shows stand out in my memory.  In one episode, a superior civilization sends thousands of small cylindrical devices to the Moon which suddenly gush out air.  The Moon has an atmosphere and gravity just like Earth, and the Alphans rejoice in the opportunity to enjoy a land like their long-lost home.  Like all good things, however, it is a double-edged sword. With atmosphere comes weather including storms.  Their Eagles encounter trouble flying and they soon are reminded of the effects of weather on radio signals.  After the Moon has passed out of the range in which the Eagle spacecraft could reach the donor planet, the cylinders suddenly inhale their air back in and blast off from the again-sterile Moon.   A message from the ""generous"" planet reveals that they feared the violence of Earthlings and created a diversion until the Moon had passed.<br/><br/>What about the second season?  In 1976 I happened to be attending the ""August Party"" at the University of Maryland, an annual Star Trek convention organized solely by the fans.  By coincidence they managed to get Nick Tate to appear.  Mr. Tate was very well received, and the fans enjoyed seeing the advance copy of the second season opener.  Maya (Maria Schell) added another dimension to ""Space:1999.""  Her ability to change into any other animal life form came in handy, and it pre-dated the short-lived ""Manimal"" series.  And Ms. Schell is an excellent actress.<br/><br/>Reading all these comments in IMDB has renewed my interest in this show. Overall, ""Space 1999"" is a GREAT show!!!!",16 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,6 May 2001
2236,Space: 1999, Exciting Adventures For Moonbase Alpha,"I personally think that Space:1999 was equal to Star Trek in my opinion. The two shows may have been different but they were both exciting in their own ways.<br/><br/>Of course, Space:1999 was different to Star Trek. The crew of Moonbase Alpha were reluctant explorers and it was a very pessimistic show but it always featured entertaining stories and crazy aliens and if anybody is going to criticize it for being wacky then they would need to criticize Star Trek as well.<br/><br/>Martin Landau is an underrated actor who played the moody Commander Koenig. He was my favourite character in the show and he was joined by talent such as Barbara Bain, Barry Morse, Nick Tate, Zienie Morton, Tony Anholt and Catherine Schell.<br/><br/>Season 1 was very exciting. There were some dark stories in it as well. My personal favourite was the unnerving ""End of Eternity"" where the great Peter Bowles plays a mysterious and immortal killer on board Moonbase Alpha. This story-like other stories-featured Moonbase Alpha in a seemingly hopeless predicament and it was a great episode.<br/><br/>Season 2 was very different. Several characters had disappeared without explanation (a crime committed by countless TV shows) and new characters had mysteriously appeared (maybe Moonbase Alpha had been keeping people in suspended animation to save on food and drink)but the stories were even better than season 1.<br/><br/>All in all, Space:1999 comes highly recommended. And I did quite like the theme tune from season 1.",15 out of 21 found this helpful.,,1 June 2002
2237,Space: 1999, characters shortcomings,"The actor usually receives the blame for being unlikable by the audience when the blame lies with the script. On Space 1999, this was a serious problem. The show had nice sets, stylish Uniforms &amp; memorable actors. But terrible scripts with bad character roles &amp; interaction.<br/><br/>By comparison, Roddenberry recognized the key element for a successful series. It is the interrelationships between the characters on the show &amp; good stories. Not the sets or special effects. We would have been happy with cardboard sets &amp; fireworks for effects as long as we were emotionally invested in the ST characters. Nor should these post Xgen neophytes be judging the quality of sets &amp; effects. Those show developers in decades past had to operate on shoestring budgets just to bring us their sci-fi series. With the intransigent networks who only cared for sitcoms &amp; westerns &amp; fraudulent Neilson ratings, we were lucky to see any sci-fi at all. We appreciated their efforts despite the primitive sets &amp; effects. ST gave us quality actors, quality scripts &amp; wonderful stories.<br/><br/>Sci-fi producers were forced to become beggars &amp; produced these shows with less budget than JR was paid for a single episode. This paltry budget had to pay for everything; sets, crews, actors, effects &amp; total production costs on less than $100K each episode. They actually had to dig into trash bins to find materials to use on sets. They used every scrap. Ice Cube trays &amp; Christmas lights but it gave us Kirk, Spock &amp; Bones in return. Space 1999 was missing this type of character camaraderie.<br/><br/>Commander Koenig was intransigent &amp; dismissive toward his crew &amp; toward any info they endeavored to provide. He did not develop a relationship with his officers &amp; allowed them to argue, talk back &amp; ignore instructions. He made bad, rash decisions. Ordered preemptive strikes &amp; belligerent actions where no hostile actions had been made. His character behaved recklessly, dismissive, endangered others, did not engender trust or camaraderie among his crew, met other races with hostility &amp; preemptive attacks, was willing to sacrifice the welfare of the entire community for the welfare of one person &amp; constantly started battles &amp; placed his people in harms way without any rhyme or reason. Shooting an alien guest without warning just to see if their stun gun worked on him. Or demanding the hyper drive of a trader as if he was entitled to it. This type of asinine behavior alienates the audience. Even if the alien proved to be bad in the end, it does not justify preemptive attacks or hostility in the eyes of the audience.<br/><br/>Dr Helena Russell was a total waste as a medical practitioner. She didn't even bother to scan patients &amp; merely shook her head without attempting to provide care. Nearly every episode began with a needless death. She wrote off the living &amp; tried to pull the plug more than once with her arrogance. She incompetently killed one of Christopher Lee's sleepers insisting they were dead when it was obvious they were in sleep chambers. Or the multitude of times they failed to detect lifesigns in victims or on planets insisting they were absolutely correct. Or opening a bomb like device &amp; blatantly freezing the occupant. She never failed to restrain &amp; countermand the commander whenever her high horse ideals did not conform with his.<br/><br/>Victor was flippant in his attitude which was mirrored by the actors attitude about the show. He considered sci-fi to be juvenile. He inappropriately laughed when delivering serious lines &amp; his character always gave bad advice, never agreed with the commander &amp; never could provide info or advice despite being the science officer and just laughed sarcastically &amp; declined when Koenig asked.<br/><br/>Kano argued about everything. Never could follow orders or requests without arguing. Always an argument &amp; bad attitude. Even when he had no lines the actor was scowling during the scenes. Good riddance. Why did they write him this way? Paul &amp; Allen were constantly arguing with the commands of Koenig in nearly every situation &amp; tried to punch him out on multiple occasions. Never following orders without an argument. Good riddance to Paul as well. Allen was barely salvageable with his constant arguing &amp; fistfights. WHY did the producers allow this type of character aggression &amp; hostility in the episodes? This was the core problem with the show. Without emotional investment they cannot garner fan loyalty.<br/><br/>It is my endeavor to point out why the series failed &amp; how they could avoid this on future shows by creating a better interaction between the characters. It was also a mistake to use older actors like Morris who are not sci-fi fans themselves who regard their roles in a flippant manner &amp; spoil it.<br/><br/>However, it was not the sets or effects which caused the downfall of this series. It was the scripts &amp; poor character interaction which was the downfall of Space 1999.<br/><br/>Also, consider the shallow mentality of these neophytes who Schlub in their parents basements deriving fodder for their self concentric egos by bashing every nuance of a show produced before they were born. Mostly striking back at their parents by trashing what they held dear. It is their attacks on these shows which is the reason so many good sci-fi producers have given up. We are all paying for their attacks. So consider the source when you read these commentaries from those who are not qualified or mature enough to make fair judgments based on the conditions of this timeframe.<br/><br/>Space 1999 could have been a great series with the sets &amp; actors if they had replaced the writers &amp; corrected the character roles &amp; interactions. The question is WHY did they fail to see this problem even when they revamped the second season.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,6.0,21 August 2015
2238,Space: 1999, Classic Sci-Fi TV of the 70s,"Many episodes are filmed in a neo-surrealistic style akin to Luis Bunel and Hitchcock. This mega set is the way to go, since it has year 1 and 2 episodes in order and bonus material. In a long run it will be cheaper to buy this set than the individual sets.<br/><br/>The art direction and production design was fantastic for the era. It was truly original science fiction where not all the stories resolve themselves into nice neat little endings -- a preferences for me.<br/><br/>I remember long ago when this show first aired. It was about the moon leaving orbit due to a nuke explosion. You see in the future it looks like we store all our waste on the moon. Well folks, after the moon leaves orbit the earth is laid to waste by bad weather and destroys itself.<br/><br/>The show is essentially Star Trek aboard a moonbase. Only the moon travels from planet to planet instead of a starship. The characters like Myia are a welcome addition. The character played by Barry Morse (who looks like Patrick Stewart very much) is gone by year two. With no explanation the moonbase starts to look like a seventies version of Star Trek and pulls it off quite well.<br/><br/>I do remember the action in most of the episodes went to a character played by Nick Tate. The actor did show up in an episode of ST: TNG ( the Wesley Crusher farewell episode) and in Deep Space Nine he played a smuggler.<br/><br/>The lead character, Martin Landau ( who was asked to play Mr. Spock) was never in another series since then. I only wish this show took off like Battlestar Galactica did. I never see Landau or Nick Tate in any TV shows or movies anymore.

2239,Space: 1999, 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Star Trek: Voyager - only 20 years too early,"I missed the first episode of this series when it first aired on television. I still fell in love with the atmosphere of this series as I pieced together what had actually happened in that first episode to force the Earth's moon out of orbit and out of our solar system.  It was actually many years before I managed to catch that first episode (only around eight years ago, in fact) and I reverted instantly back to my childhood for the duration!<br/><br/>I've always been what I would call a fan of this series (yes, particularly the first season), but it was only recently that I discovered there are many others like me out there.  Via the internet, I've seen the criticisms and comparisons that were levelled at the show in the seventies when it was released and I've been baffled by most of them.  The single thing that probably irks me most though are the constant comparisons (both positive and negative) with Star Trek.  This is no Star Trek - in my opinion it's a lot better.  I can't imagine what the world will be like in 200 years time - nothing like Star Trek's federation, I'll bet.  But back in 1975 it seemed quite feasible that we could have a moonbase up there by the 90s.  And I could always relate to the realism of this show - space ships and equipment that looked... well... industrial... and a sterile, artificial environment that looks and feels just like a... sterile, artificial environment.<br/><br/>I've seen the show attacked by Trekkie fans for having artificial gravity inside the base, while there is minimal gravity outside.  Yet when I see ""First Contact"", I see gravity inside the ship and magnetic boots being worn outside.  I hear complaints about terminology such as ""black sun"" in place of ""black hole"", yet our knowledge of physics and the terminology that goes with it changes all the time - is it so unacceptable that in '75 someone thought they might be called ""suns"" rather than ""holes"" in '99??<br/><br/>I've heard it said that the Eagle Transporter craft aren't aerodynamic and therefore couldn't fly through an atmosphere as they have done in Space: 1999.  Yet I saw an episode of Space: 1999 where they modified an invisible shield on board one of the craft (presumably they were all equipped with them), which formed an aerodynamic cone over the exposed part of the vehicle (rather like what researchers are currently working on, here on Earth).<br/><br/>And the most disturbing of all - the ""dark side of the moon"" argument, which states that there is no dark side of the moon there is only a ""far"" side of the moon.  It concerns me greatly that this observation was made in a scathing attack of the series by Sir Isaac Asimov.  I believe ""dark"" in this sense refers to ""least accessible"" (from Earth, eg. communications), much as in days gone by parts of Africa that were least accessible were referred to as ""darkest Africa"".  We still refer to the far side of the moon as the dark side - when a space craft from earth orbits the moon, we lose contact with it once it disappears behind the moon.  This is not an error of terminology and never was.  Waste disposal area one/navigation beacon delta is not the only way to navigate on the far side, but being one of the few man-made structures it is much easier to recognise and navigate by.  I have also read comments that since the waste disposal area two was on the dark (far) side of the moon, then the explosion should have forced the moon to collide with the Earth, not move it away.  Well, the dark (far) side of the moon is pretty big - it covers around *half* the moon, forming a hemisphere, and waste disposal area two could be anywhere in that hemisphere.  It is not located near area one on the dark side - when Simmonds asks what are the chances that area two might burn itself out just like area one, Koenig actually responds that  they ""are sitting right on top of it; there is no chance!"".  It is quite likely that the area sits right near the edge of the ""dark hemisphere"" and hence would generate force in a direction that would propel the moon tangentially from its own orbit.  Add to this the momentum of the moon already revolving rapidly around the earth and you will see that there is no reason whatsoever to assume the moon should collide with the earth as a result of the explosion.<br/><br/>If there is a comparison to be made against Space: 1999, then it would have to be the Star Trek: Voyager series, which it preceded by some twenty years! In fact, in some ways, Voyager seems almost to have copied the storyline of Space: 1999, replacing the moonbase with a space ship and sending it on a reverse journey back toward Earth rather than away from it.  Other than that, the premises underlying the two series' share a lot in common.<br/><br/>At over 1/4 million dollars per episode back in 1975, a time when science fiction still wasn't regarded as a saleable commodity, I think we got our money's worth.  The techniques used in Space: 1999 paved the way for others such as Star Wars, Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, etc for years to come and would almost certainly have run over several series if it hadn't been ""sabotaged"" between the first and second series (if you don't know what I mean, read up about what actually took place).<br/><br/>The musical score (of the first series) is excellent and subtly establishes the mood for each episode before we even find out what the episode is about. Some of the acting I've seen (in the first series) is superior to any I have seen anywhere else in science fiction.  And then some of it (in particular, Barbara Bain - both series) really isn't.  Martin Landau really acts throughout.  Perhaps they came as a package - they were married, after all.<br/><br/>My recommendation to anyone who has never seen this series:  Watch it!  But watch it with an open mind.  Don't prejudge and don't compare - just enjoy.",17 out of 25 found this helpful.,,8 April 2000
2240,Space: 1999," Or, ""Flares 1999"", as my brother calls it!","""Space 1999"" could not really be considered a classic.  It's premise seems too close to ""Star Trek"" to be original, and some of the acting and many of the episodes are, quite simply, terrible.<br/><br/>That said, it does have a certain charm to it.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the sound-track is nicely done (love that theme song) and the sets are excellent, as are the model shots.  The Eagle scout ship design is probably one of the most sensible and realistic designs of any spaceship on a sci-fi show.  And some of the shows were very enjoyable, even if the writers did have a fondness for leaving us wondering what the !!!! was going on!<br/><br/>Women seemed to have better roles than were given to them on ""Star Trek"", which is appropriate for a show made several years later.  Gerry Anderson made a conscious effort to give black actors intelligent roles, which is far more than could be said of most other directors of the time.  And, not being American, I also appreciate the fact that, for once, Earth is not represented as just being America.  It's nice to hear English, European, Caribbean accents amongst others, coming from actors that aren't Americans putting on bad accents.<br/><br/>Spooky:  I'm writing this on ""the"" day - yes, September 13th, 1999...I wondered why the moon looked so strange tonight!",36 out of 60 found this helpful.,,14 September 1999
2241,Space: 1999, Stylistically diverse and uniformly spectacular!,"I cannot agree that only the first season is worth mention of any kind.<br/><br/>Season 2 featured special effects that were as impressive and in some cases more so than those in Season 1. The crew of Moonbase Alpha were endowed with more dynamic characterization in the second season and resumed their humane approach to encountering forms of alien life, providing a place on their Moonbase for the survivor of a dead planet. There were commentaries on human nature, the wisdom or lack thereof in a return to Earth, the abuse of telekinetic or quasi-divine power, dream versus reality as mode of living, the psychological problems of prolonged ""confinement"" in the Moonbase's sterile environment, the close connection between the emotions of love and hate, the rights of the prisoner on a penal colony, etc..<br/><br/>While the second season adopted a rather more standard and sensational approach to drama than that employed in Season 1, it is by no means an unworthy set of episodes. The differences between the seasons, while noted, ought not to give proponents of one sufficient cause to totally reject the other.<br/><br/>Catherine Schell as Maya (Season 2) won the German Bravo! award for her portrayal of the biologically transforming resident alien of Moonbase Alpha.<br/><br/>The series (both seasons) was transmitted nation-wide in Canada from 1976 to 1978 and proved to be so popular (both seasons), that it was returned for regional broadcasts through the 1980s.

2242,Space: 1999, The Star Trek of the 70's,"Space: 1999 will be remembered mostly for it's ubiquitous Eagle spacecraft. Like squatting crocodiles they took off and landed as often as time would allow during the shows three years on the air. This was one of many elements which made this series a stand-out for Science Fiction TV lovers. And besides, the crew of Moonbase Alpha lacked the Enterprise's beaming console so sometimes it was Eagle or nothing.<br/><br/>The design and style of Space: 1999 was nearly as important to its youthful fanbase than the stories or the characters. Moonbase Alpha was an inviting place for children, despite the dangers. It was a candy colored, spacious labyrinth of ""what does it do?"" buttons and tubes, ultra contemporary furniture, and its own subway system. It was always clean and efficient and while you often felt a rush of relief that you were not roaming aimlessly across the Universe doomed to battle lifeform after lifeform year after year not knowing if you were going to be brought back for the next series (they changed the cast a few times) you did secretly yearn to be one this intellectual community that seemed to lack the pettiness of back home.<br/><br/>Truth is this series made no earthly sense. And for those who are stopped by that, good luck to you. You can stay but don't think you're getting a membership certificate. Only aficianados of the genre will know that while physics is important sometimes, great sci-fi demands going over the line a little. For instance where is all that sunlight coming from on Alpha? Whatever. How do they have regular gravity. Ever heard of a gravity machine. Hello?<br/><br/>Acts like Trek, looks like Star Wars with a bit of Dr. Who for good measure.

2245,Outsiders, It's a very entertaining show so enjoy,"I'm not sure what other reviewers are taking this show as. It's not a documentary so stop trying to wrap your head around every little detail. There are some plot holes that could be filled in but I don't think every small nuance needs to be addressed. It's a TV show. It's fictional. Every movie or film has movie mistakes, deal with it. Many of these reviewers probably live in urban or suburban areas and couldn't figure out how to get things done without their iphones and credit cards. Think about the situation and you can probably fill the holes yourself, even if you don't see it on screen. Examples below.<br/><br/><ul><li>Power. Generators. probably bartered or stolen. - ATVs. A welder, hand tools, and junk parts can make it work. I've seen many Frankenstein vehicles that were operational. How do you think Cuba kept cars from the 1950/1960s running so long. They probably modified junk ATVs. Speaking of welder, they must have had one to make the cage. - Tools/instruments. Stolen/bartered. - The language. Small pocket dialect. Look up PA Dutch for example. - Fuel. Moonshine is ethanol. Ethanol is moonshine.

2246,Outsiders," WGN, never again","There is only one major thing to remember about Outsiders. And that is that it got canceled after two seasons. So don't waste your time watching it because they just stop in the middle of the story without any explanation or a decent ending. Why they do that is a mystery to me because the series wasn't that bad. I didn't know the channel WGN before watching this but now I will remember. I will remember never watching anything again from their channel because I can't afford to waste my time again. But if you do decide watching the two seasons expect to have a story that isn't bad but that isn't all good either. There are some turns in the story that will make your eyes raise.

2251,Outsiders, I Love Outsiders!,"Outsiders is the best TV series out there, period. It has a story line that pulls you in from the very beginning. The characters ARE believable, as is the plot. It is fantasy. It is reality. It IS America today. Just look at the news. There is the central story, ripped from today's headlines. There is the story of the the clan, the Farrells. Then there are the stories of individual characters, both clan and townie. Love and hatred, triumph and failure, hope and despair. And Shay Mountain. The heart of it all. The magic and power of the Myr. The interaction between the townies and the Farrells fascinates me the most and is becoming the most interesting and appealing aspect of Outsiders. I am rooting for each and every one to find the answers to their questions and fulfillment in their relationships. I cannot get enough of this show. The hour flies by so quickly.

It's also interesting to note the story so far is not over-extending in terms of realism, but makes it quite believable. I hope it continues this way and we get 5 seasons at least. Keep an open mind and wait for more episodes before judging to harshly. For those that didn't recognize its Opie !! Ryan Hurst will make the show !! Has elements of other shows such as Justified in terms of the realism of the town and the people. I'm waiting to see more episodes before I can really judge how accurate they represent the mountain people, because I would expect them to be more ragged, using more basic tools, and stealing or killing whatever they can find.

So many shows take place in LA or somewhere that looks similar to LA and seeing a show Appalachia is refreshing, and the show uses its setting very well. There's not a single moment where you forget where you are as a viewer.

Some of the acting is first class, especially Thomas Wright (the Sheriff), and the rest of the cast does a good job as well. The photography is really good and I enjoy the ways in which the various lives intertwine.

The townsfolk make it clear they don't ever press charges because 'it's not worth it'.<br/><br/>The casting choices are spot on as far as I'm concerned and the scenery is as beautiful as you'd expect. They leave you with a number of questions after the first episode that draws you into the series enough to stay with it just to learn the secrets of the crazy hill-folk.<br/><br/>All in all, it was an interesting start to the series, and the dynamic between the Farrell clan and the rest of the town looks promising.",23 out of 36 found this helpful.,8.0,27 January 2016

They live in their own world. Not surprisingly, they are sitting on one of the largest coal mines and so people want them out of their living place. I had a lot of questions while watching the show like where do they get electricity from, where did they get all ATVs's, wine distillery equipment from?

2261,Outsiders, Season 2 lacks direction; premise not sustainable,"Season 2 is an ongoing disappointment that somehow manages to become sillier and more outrageous each week. Not surprising; the premise is not sustainable. This series makes sense (if at all) for one or two seasons. The standoff, by its very nature, cannot go on indefinitely. Therefore, the longer it takes to reach a conclusion, the more filler needs to be added to keep it going.<br/><br/>Is there really a place in Appalachia or anywhere in the US for that matter, where clans of mountain folk mosey down into town on a whim for a ""run"" for purposes of resupplying by driving ATVs through stores with impunity? <br/><br/>Season 1 was a lot tighter and appeared to be leading to a conclusion. But season 2 is a mess, filled with inexplicable developments. Consider everything surrounding Asa. He was one of the few Farrells who had a moral compass and seemed like a potential bridge between the clan and the Town. He did G'win's bidding, only to be betrayed by her and locked up. She begged him to kill Big F and then immediately after he did so, she locked him up. Then - he dies - out of nowhere, and we learn that Big F is alive. Not only is he alive, but now he is a good guy - what?? <br/><br/>G'win is no better than Big F. The only difference between them is that he succeeded in killing the person ahead of him in the pecking order (his mom) where she failed to kill the person ahead of her (Big F). How does G'win remain as the clan leader after Big F openly admitted to killing his mother, when she tried to do the same thing?<br/><br/>I don't even know where to start with the Kinnah Tribe. They come out of nowhere and G'win accepts them and brings their leader into the fold immediately. I understand hospitality, but the way the Kinnah are practically leading the clan in the course of a few episodes is a bit much.<br/><br/>More on the Kinnah - a few inked, half bald and mostly naked woman appear out of nowhere and sweep the guards off their feet (and then promptly kill them). As if the guards would not have suspected something was amiss - because inked, half bald and mostly naked woman appearing out of the woods for sex must be a regular thing in the fantasy land where this show takes place. I mean - could the creators of this show possibly portray the townsfolk as any dumber? And could they possibly be any weaker? Lil F (who admittedly is a big strong man) is portrayed as beating a half dozen or so townies at a time, while 8-fingered Hasil, who has a slight build, at best, fights like a ninja warrior.<br/><br/>There is so so so much more. But, the biggest disappointment of season 2 thus far may actually be: what is going on with the coal company and its billion dollar plan to take the mountain? Its course of action, which is what drives the show and will ultimately lead to its occlusion, has been lost amid the goofiness. But I guess that is to be expected where, as here, an original premise that begs for a conclusion is overly delayed by goofy filler.",11 out of 17 found this helpful.,3.0,14 February 2017

2266,Outsiders," Absolutely silly in some ways, yet the first season has held my attention well.","I have only watched a few episodes from the 1st season, but I like the show on the surface. It has a lot of good elements-- Good actors you actually recognize, rugged mountain people, violence, creepy old matriarchs/patriarchs, a vague suspicion of ancient magic or ritual stuff going on, funny hillbillies, romance, and old world folks colliding with modernity. It is very different and unique in some ways, and has done just enough to keep me watching so far.<br/><br/>However, I fear that the plot and the fantasy world of it all may start to lose traction in coming seasons. <br/><br/>If the coal companies or a town want people off some land, they aren't going to be deterred in 2018 by 50 viking dudes with ATVs and a few weapons. Especially when you look back at what happened with people at Ruby Ridge, Waco, etc. and especially if the families in this show had killed police(as mentioned several times referring to an older fiasco). The law is going to go in there with heavy firepower and SWAT teams or any other means and start killing everything that moves. They even shot a woman holding a baby at Ruby Ridge, a teen boy, and his dog. They got lots of people killed in Waco and other tense situations, so I find this totally unbelievable for more than a few episodes. <br/><br/>They also seem like a poor representation of Southern people or rugged self-reliant mountain people, because they talk about codes and survival, but then rob people and loot stores like a bunch of ghetto teenagers in WalMart looting videos. What kind of rugged mountain people come to cities and drive four-wheelers inside and steal everything without consequences??? Absolute nonsense.<br/><br/>The jousting on ATVs? Hilarious. Reminds me of stuff we used to do in the country as teenagers trying to film our own Jackass video. However, it seems a bit contrived and ridiculous for adults in a serious community.<br/><br/>Everyone is afraid of them, but they barely have enough guns or ammo to go around in one episode. So, unless the plot includes them actually having magical Celtic powers or something, I doubt they would have much firearms training or capability. which seems funny for Southern mountain people. <br/><br/>I don't see how this can run for more than a season or two with this coal mine in the balance. The law is either going to drive them out or they are going to have to make concessions.<br/><br/>The dude who wants to date the black girl just seems very random. Not that rednecks are all racists who don't like blacks(I am sort of a redneck who married a black woman), but these people are so remote that it seemed odd he would pursue this one random girl(who is totally different) with such vigor. However, it could happen, and the girl seems sweet, so maybe it will develop into an interesting romance. The boy getting his fingers chopped off for stealing shine just seemed stupid and overboard. There is a good chance he would get infected or be less effective as a fighter and worker in a tough terrain, where every man helps their cause.<br/><br/>The drug dealer dating a crossdresser or transgendered dude was just weird. I feel this is overly presented in every show today, because it is a hot button issue for some reason. <br/><br/>Anyway, I really like the show, and it has potential, but you will have to suspend your disbelief quite a bit, and after a season or two, I really don't know how long they can stretch the premise out without bombing the whole thing.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,19 August 2018

2270,The Romanoffs, Exactly what it's supposed to be: entertaining ))),"First, let's get the basics out of the way. Regarding the production values of this series (disclaimer, folks; I've only seen episode one, ""The Violet Hour""), everything is at a very high level, so your senses won't be disappointed. It is a feast for the eyes, particularly as Paris and the amazing apartment in which most of the story is set shine beautifully. The storyline is compelling, if a little unrealistic at times (the ease with which an apparently devout young Muslim woman finds herself having a one-night stand comes to mind...not to say it's impossible, just that it's a bit of a stretch). However, as with most films, too much reality would get in the way of being able to tell the story properly in the first place. Remember, this is a TV movie, not a documentary. We are supposed to be carried away; in that sense, I think this episode accomplishes its job admirably. The acting is first rate, making the characters believable and interesting (all the cast are wonderful, especially Marthe Keller as Anushka and Inès Melab as Hajar). Despite what a few lemon-sucking nay-sayers write here, you won't be disappointed with The Romanoffs. It's definitely worth seeing.",90 out of 109 found this helpful.,10.0,14 October 2018

2274,The Romanoffs, Short comments on every stand-alone episode.,"First, you have to remember that the episodes and not connected and can be watched in any order. Second, the Romanoffs have nothing to do with the show, usually they're just the main character's ancestors, that's it. Third, these are mostly just 'slice of life' stories and, well, they're not all good.<br/><br/>Episode 1: 8/10 - This starts well enough. Takes place in France where a couple has trouble dealing with the man's aunt, they're waiting for her to die to inherit, but she won't die. I thought the episode was gutsy enough to show us a Muslim woman remove her hijab and sleep with a man out of wedlock, which is not something you often see to be honest. Obviously, though, that actress doesn't usually wear a hijab, or else she would never have done it. Anyway, entertaining.<br/><br/>Episode 2: 7/10 - Not as good as the first one, but still entertaining. A couple with marital problem deals with meeting other people while away from each other and where their loyalties lie. The man and the woman are clearly not on the same page and one wants out more than the other. A more comedic episode.<br/><br/>Episode 3: 9/10 - The best episode of the series. If you have to watch one, watch this one. It's almost horror-like, and coincidentally, has the most to do with the Romanoffs out of all the episodes. An American actress goes to the Netherlands (? - i think it was) to shoot a TV show about the Romanoffs and all sorts of weird stuff start happening, the characters around her also start to get progressively stranger. The end is slightly predictable but otherwise this was a great episode.<br/><br/>Episode 4: 5/10 - Blah! A woman with a secret fights with her daughter and wonders about her life and the weight of her secret. Nothing too interesting.<br/><br/>Episode 5: 2/10 - Moralizing! A true push-down-your-throat moral episode. It started with a ""wait are they really going there?"" premise which would have made it interesting. But nah, this is just typical PC stuff that's trying to pass a message forcefully. Also, no father in the 70s would ever speak to their kid that way just because they asked somebody if they were a boy or a girl. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>Episode 6: 5/10 - A woman travels the world with her son to try to find a cure for him. A journalist tries to expose a clinic for their shady practices. I didn't like the acting from the journalist in this one, felt wooden. The journalist and the woman meet in Mexico, obviously. I don't know, it was average. Nothing much happens.<br/><br/>Episode 7: 8/10 - A very strong episode about a couple going to Russia to adopt. What does it mean to adopt? Can you pick and choose what you get? How is it different than a biological kid? Very good conversations in this episode, although it really doesn't make you want to go to Russia.<br/><br/>Episode 8: 1/10 - Moralizing! Terrible! Cheer for the bad guy kind of episode, because ""innocents deserve what they get for not being a minority"". At one point in the episode the guy has a conversation with a transexual and says, ""They call us trannies, poofs, queers, but we're stronger than all of them! Look at what we've gone through!"" Yadda yadda yadda! Has nothing to do with the episode! Poor, poor, oppressed minority. How tough life must be as perfect people that are rejected by the majority! Ugh. I wish Matthew Weiner didn't shove his politics down our throats with his screenplays. Also, isn't Matthew Weiner a straight white male? Doesn't that automatically make his opinion 100% worthless?

2281,The Romanoffs, A Fine Production,"This review is based on the 1st episode. I hope the rest of the series maintains the standard. That said, as the series is an anthology, each episode should be viewed individually.<br/><br/>If you like a witty, charming, well acted, beautifully shot drama produced with a style rarely found on TV then this is for you.<br/><br/>The characters are fully three dimensional and yet, due to the superb screenplay, the story moves along at a good pace.<br/><br/>I'd best describe Episode 1 as a classic French romantic contemporary drama with plenty of wonderful dialogue.<br/><br/>Anushka, the matriarch, played superbly by Marthe Keller, has some wonderful lines and indeed the whole episode revolves around her presence. Even when she's not in a scene her personality is hovering in the background.<br/><br/>I've found a few of Amazon's TV shows falling a bit short of the mark but this is right on the money. Of course, if you don't like light comedy dramas you probably won't like this. They often fall short of expectations. Either they have no drama or are too weak, comedically.

There's no other way to say it. It goes completely flat. Painfully so. History? You think you're gonna watch an actual cohesive story (and that never happens) that might at minimum tie into history, but from a character point of view, FEW if any in the three episodes I've watched, even acknowledge the context (leaving some things unsaid here so I don't add spoilers). While watching (in part because these are boring enough one's mind wanders), I find myself frequently distracted by the thought ""the guy who gave us Mad Men wrote this crap""? And the cast, some great people are in this and I can't figure out if they are doing a good job or a terrible job because it's all just so... painful to watch. It's just awful. I feel like I'm being extremely generous giving four stars, but I'm doing so with a tiny bit of hpoe in my heart that after watching the first three episodes, maybe something amazing will happen with future episodes that will actually earn those stars. This show at this point certainly can't earn more stars from this viewer (who RARELY writes reviews). I think I feel sad for it.",36 out of 57 found this helpful.,4.0,22 October 2018

2290,The Romanoffs, Missed Potential,"So far I have watched the first 2 episodes and attempted to watch the 3rd. The 1st episode has been the only one worth watching in my opinion, but I have to admit some bias as to why. I am a French-American, whose roots are in France. Therefore, I found the use of French and all the Parisian scenes in the 1st episode delightful. I also enjoyed Marthe Keller portrayal of Anushka. Anushka is a lovely, proud and strong woman and not just a spoiled, arrogant and aged aristocrat as one might assume if they fail to pay attention to key parts of the storyline as it plays out.<br/><br/>Anushka may be of privileged class, but she has also endured hardship as she experienced Nazi occupation of not only her beloved Paris, but also acted as a servant to the Nazis and quite likely suffered other atrocities at the hands of the Nazis. Anushka is proud of her heritage, maybe too much so, but this is all she really has as she suffers through loneliness in her latter years. That is at least until she meets Hajar, played by Inès Melab. Hajar has been hired by her nephew Greg and his girlfriend Sophie to work as a caretaker for the aging Anushka.<br/><br/>At first Anushka treats Hajar with utter contempt because of Hajar's differences. Hajar is a Muslim woman with dark olive skin and unfortunately Anushka falls into that human weakness of attacking and marginalizing that which they don't understand or is alien to them.<br/><br/>Hajar appears immune to Anushka's sharpe and insulting tongue and instead of reacting to Anushka's behavior treats Anushka with dignity and understanding of where Anushka's behavior is coming from which is a product of her generation, her loneliness and insecurities as well as being marginalized by her nephew and his girlfriend.<br/><br/>Over time Anushka slowly let's go of her prejudices and insecurities and comes to see Hajar as a lovely and caring human being resulting in Anushka changing her will and leaving her Parisian home to Hajar instead of her nephew. This infuriates Sopie who is already very much antagonistic to Anushka.<br/><br/>Greg, played by Aaron Eckhart, is Anushka's last living relative based on what is revealed in the episode is a lost man-child who seems somewhat of a shallow, parasitic character waiting on Anushka to die so that he can claim his inheritance. At times, his feelings for Anushka seems somewhat sincere, but these moments are fleeting as he abdicates his own independence and allows Sophie, who plays a entitled and parasitic woman-child, to manipulate him.<br/><br/>The story takes an interesting twist as Greg and Sophie learn of the change of inheritance upon returning from holiday. Greg meets Hajar in an attempt to coerce her to reject Anushka's inheritance and that it is rightfully his. As the evening wears on Hajar and Greg wind up in bed which seems a bit perplexing. I am sure that there are many personal opinions on why Hajar ended up in bed with Greg having sex, although I suspect it had more to do with the writer/director allowing testosterone to dictate his creativity.<br/><br/>The story pretty much closes with the writer/director trying to save the storyline by closing it out with Greg discovering that Hajar is pregnant by him and he leaves Shopie for Hajar and ending with the appearance of Hajar, Greg and Anushka living happily ever after. Somewhat of a shallow ending, but typical.<br/><br/>I watched the 2nd episode, which had a few nice moments of Shelly on the cruise. However Michael was a completely despicable character. The story, if there was one, pretty much ends with Michael attempting to kill Shelly due to his own cowardliness to be his own person. Why not just divorce the woman? Why attempt to kill her? Again, seems to be a storyline produced by the writer/director allowing his testosterone to dictate the storyline.<br/><br/>I attempted to watch the 3rd episode, thinking this has to be better than the 2nd episode. However, after 20 minutes invested in watching the episode I finally turned it off. I decided not to waste any further time watching this episode.<br/><br/>Given the track record of this series thus far, it's unlikely that I will watch any further episodes. However, this is just my personal view and others may actually find further enjoyment in the series. Hopefully it will improve given it's budget.",23 out of 39 found this helpful.,3.0,20 October 2018

They switched from telling haunting stories to the Hollywood playbook of silence interrupted by loud noises and a lot of overly dramatic fake blood and gore scenes to attract viewers. But most Lore fans aren't necessarily GORE or HORROR fans. There are a million horror/gore films for fans of that genre. What attracts so many of us to Lore is that for US, the IDEA of madness, fear, loneliness, disease, etc. We don't need to see rotting corpses, we want to hear stories of how humans have failed each other, betrayed each other, lost each other.

It didn't bother me at first, but there's a LOT of narration in the show and the way he speaks really started to take away rather than add to the show. The voice in general doesn't seem to complement the content.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this show, as this kind of subject material has always interested me, but I think the way they try to mix entertainment and information doesn't quite work.<br/><br/>The facts are presented as such and are informative and interesting for the most part, kind of like the old ""In Search of"" shows.<br/><br/>The dramatic segments that are acted out are supposed to be based on true events, but I think they go a little overboard in an attempt to entertain.

Especially when interrupted by narration that abruptly switches gears.<br/><br/>I was especially interested in Unboxed, the story of Robert the Doll, but even I knew more about it than they presented in the 40 minutes of run time and I found the whole episode confusing and irritating without giving me anything new.

He may not be real, but he is how senior Detectives should be. Hard drinking, perhaps a bit uncouth/crude, but also clever and someone who really does care. He is also a bit of a comedian, who has an habit of calling his staff by well known Nicknames. DC Harris is Bomber, DS Milligan is Spike, DC Novello is Ivor and WPC Jackson is Janet. The programme is set is Yorshire but because it is produced by the Birmingham studios a lot a scenes are shot in the West Midlands. There are now over 30 episodes and the early episodes also chronicle the progress of DS Pascoe's ( Later Detectective Inspector) family.

Here the characters and environments are more realistic, the plots are more complex and interesting, and the endings are not alway crystal clear, which, for the thriller-interested viewer, is quite satisfying. The ongoing Dalziel-Pascoe relationship is probably the best in its genre, and Dalziel's one-liners sometimes make you laugh your head off! I hope they will continue to show Dalziel and Pascoe in Sweden, although I don't think it's well known here. It's as good as Frost, and much better than the latest seasons of Midsomer Murders.

2320,Dalziel and Pascoe, A truly classic detective drama,"'Dalziel and Pascoe' is one of the greatest television programmes of all time. Based on the books by Reginald Hill, the show follows the work of Superintendent Andy Dalziel (Warren Clarke) and DI Peter Pascoe(Colin Buchanan), as they investigate and solve murders. Despite their obvious differences in personality and outlook, Dalziel and Pascoe soon become an effective partnership, and good friends. The show has certainly evolved over the many years it's been on our screens, with most of the early episodes being close adaptations of the books, whereas recently the writers have thought up original, and often superior story lines for the show. What really sets this series apart from other modern detective dramas is its gritty realism and complex plotting.

2321,Dalziel and Pascoe," Not Quite Like the Novels, But Worth Watching","I love Reginald Hill's novels upon which these shows were based and having read the lot, I have to agree with others in saying that the cast is less than accurate, though Warren Clarke and David Royle come closer in spirit to their book counterparts, if not physically. Colin Buchanan is too insubstantial to make Pascoe as strong as he is in the books and Susannah Corbett, while getting Ellie's smug self-satisfied know-it-allness down pat, looks and acts too hard - she fails to relay the bits of vulnerable sweetness of the book Ellie that makes it clear why Pascoe adores her. That being said, the stories remain fairly true to the novels, if far less bawdy and they retain much of the dark Northern humor that makes the books so enjoyable. With Clarke lacking the sheer bulk and crudity of the book Fat Andy, the scenes demonstrating his brilliance as a detective and perspicacity about the human condition are far less surprising than when they emerge in the novels. Even after you've read several of the stories, Hill makes Dalziel so obnoxious and primitive, you can visualize the scrapes on his knuckles from dragging them on the ground, when his genius and sensitivity lead to the truth - and that is what Dalziel is all about, getting to the truth - it still startles. However, judging the TV versions without considering the novel versions, the series is a cut above the standard fare in the UK, let alone the US, and is literate, funny, intriguing and thoroughly enjoyable. The acting, direction, pacing and scenery are completely credible and it is a treat to suspend reality to watch this - and the other UK coppers like Barnaby, Frost, Morse, et al.",15 out of 16 found this helpful.,,19 May 2010
2322,Dalziel and Pascoe, Solid stories with great actors,"A great series. Warren Clarke is great as DS Andy Dalziel (literally DL);his character is tough, hard as nails, earthy, and brilliant. He is the show. Obviously a self-made detective who without an ""education"" has been promoted up the ranks to superintendent and somehow missed the refinements he might have been expected to pick up. He is paired with Colin Buchanan as DI Peter Pascoe, a well educated college man who I find a bit of a prat and a snob who believes he is better than his boss. He is paired with a wife, Susannah Corbett, who really dislikes Dalziel.

2323,Dalziel and Pascoe," Adore! *In My Top 5 Crime Series (New Tricks is First, this 2nd.)","RIP Warren Clarke November 2014. I am finishing watching this series this Holiday Season in a tribute to Warren's recent passing. Warren Clarke is absolutely BRILLIANT in this series. I first found it via Masterpiece Mysteries on my US PBS channel back in the 90's. After that, it was hard to find, until nice folkes uploaded episodes. I have watched Series 1-11 at least once a year for the past 5 years. I have waited for it to be available in the US and now you can order via Walmart.com...wonderful site. Will be purchasing for my birthday in January 2015. This, New Tricks and my other favourite UK Series will be added as $ allows. Back to Dalziel &amp; Pascoe. I am 62, a film/TV buff since a wee child. Soupy Sales comes to mind when thinking of Andy Dalziel. Out of thousands of TV Characters seen over the years. Andy is truly in my Top 10. His thick Gaelic Brogue and his ""true-to-reality"" male behaviour are EPIC. You must watch a few episodes to realize Andy's HEART...some may be appalled with his ""nose-picking"", ball-scratching, lip-smacking"" humouristic, characteristics. This is perhaps THE MOST REAL CHARACTER ever seen on TV. He is not your typical ""Lovable Barnaby"" DI, and not for fans of ""Nicely Nice"" DIs, calmly moving toward the obvious suspects. Dalziel will venture wild accusations, then apologize if he's wrong, and ""gloat"" as Peter Pascoe chides him, when he is found to be right. Dalziel is not a Politically Correct PC, he is unapologetically irreverent and brash. However, if you watch long enough, you will see Dalziel CRY soft sobbing tears in the face of loss and tragedy. I have never seen Barnaby cry. I guess the best way to put it, is...(Midsomer Murders which I love, finds an Adorable 1 Dimensional Barnaby) ANDY DALZIEL, is a MULTI-faceted character, a 3F man with flaws, failures &amp; foibles. I have found him to be an admirable character. He is WISE, LOYAL, ""A Dog With A Bone (me too)"" and KIND with consideration. The Dalziel &amp; Pascoe Series teaches that some crimes are resolved with ""FATE"" and lives lived with melancholy, instead of ""booty"". I love the supporting characters as well, although I hated ""Ellie"", Peter's wife...She was stunning to watch, beautiful and acted well, however, sad to watch her belittle Peter. Wieldy, the big silent softy, is a joy to watch and he provides a great supporting character to the mix. The female supporting cast members were fairly great as well...currently watching Posh Spicer, and she is good in her part and plays in 20 episodes. I haven't said much about Peter, sometimes I love Peter and sometimes, I simply want to smack him...His character is much more flawed than Andy's...While Andy loyalty is constant, Peter vasillates and has periods of doubt and suspicions. He is a brooding character, quite melancholy, but no Dalziel &amp; Pascoe without Pascoe. There have been several characters that I have hated they killed off. Well enough...A QUITE WORTHY WELCOME Series and again, Andy stands alone with Alum Armstrong as Brian Lane in New Tricks as the MOST OUTSTANDING UK characters EVER! and to the person dissing this for A Touch Of Frost...I love that show as well...and the character FROST...he might be my 3rd., 4th or 5th. favourite DI..

2325,Dalziel and Pascoe," Edgy, well acted and well written show","I love detective shows and have done for as long as I can remember. Dalziel and Pascoe is no exception. I agree to some extent it is not quite as good as it was, with the introduction with the somewhat bland Kim Spicer, but on the whole it is well acted and well written, and while it has lost its edge a bit it is quite intense still. The photography and locations are excellent and the music is haunting(courtesy of genius Barrington Pheloung), while the writing is both humorous and intelligent and the stories and episode ideas gritty, edgy, complex and incredibly engrossing. The characters in general are likable and interesting, with Dalziel unorthodox but clever and quite funny sometimes and Pascoe loyal but sticks to the book. The acting is great, with Warren Clarke easily stealing the show, then again I don't know about you but Dalziel is for me the better character of the two but they're both great. Overall, great show. 9/10 Bethany Cox",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,7 September 2010

It held up extremely well, and I was reminded what a fine series it was, featuring intriguing plots, witty dialogue, and interesting characters.<br/><br/>I became interested in finding it among the dozens of BBC series that are sold in the U.S., but to no avail. It simply wasn't available, and even more surprisingly, it wasn't even out on DVD in the UK.<br/><br/>By now, the first two series have been released on DVD in the UK and the third in continental Europe. In either case, you need a region-free DVD player, after which you can order from anywhere in the world.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what's holding things up, seeing that practically every other TV series ever made has been released on DVD, but at least those of us who have region-free players and can order from Amazon UK are in good shape.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,8.0,9 December 2008

Regular viewers will know what I'm talking about: when they changed the excellent original theme music (moody saxophone solo from the pen of Barrington Pheloung) and that accompanied a change in line-up. Out went the brilliantly under-played character of DS Edgar 'Wieldy' Wield (played by the excellent David Royle) and in came the 'I can't act for toffee and I've even got an annoyingly grating accent' Jennifer James in the role of WPC Kim Spicer and the inconsequential Wayne Perrey as DC Parvez Lateef. The show started out broodingly edgy and is now a faint shadow of its former self with the team now seeming more like the Scooby Gang than the hard-bitten original version. So come on BBC - less of the Kim Scrappy-Doo Spicer and let's get back to the original idea I used to love.

My only complaint was to do with the editing, which seemed to stick scenes together in an unrelated manner that was very confusing at times. The endings of a few of the episodes were also not very defined as there did not seem to be a proper explanation given throughout each episode as how it all fitted together!

BBC video has released the entire series, all twelve seasons, on US DVDs, available from the usual places. <br/><br/>The episodes are nicely remastered and include good English subtitles, which I recommend turning on to help you follow the rather twisty plots and hopefully make sense of some of the thick Yorkshire accents. The first few seasons are in 4:3 ratio, but the rest are in widescreen. <br/><br/>Having seen only a handful of the early episodes when I was living in Europe, I am now working my way through the series. I can confirm that this is one of the very best British police series, well on a par with Inspector Morse, A Touch of Frost, Prime Suspect, and the original Taggart.

The show grips you and keeps you in suspense, and each of the storylines are intriguing and exillerating. Each episode is completely different from the previous one, and the supporting cast are always great too. Pascoes' character is one of a friend as well as a partner, and they both work well together, even though Dalziel is the 'Boss unquestionably 😄 If you get the chance to watch this Classic Drama...Please Do So, as you Will become hooked.!!!

Clues are handed to Dalziel and his team without any proper investigation and usual by people who get scoffed at by Dalziel. Not a word of thanks will ever pass his lips. What Dalziel actually does for a living is unknown because he just follows the trail of corpses to find the perpetrator. Not very difficult because with each death the circle of suspects diminishes. Lucky for D and his team the baddie get's whacked off at the end or confesses his guilt because none of the evidence or methods used to acquire them would stand up in court. The investigation general sees D and his trusty sidekick Pascoe talk to various people who talk and talk and then say something that doesn't fit the story of others. ""Aha"" they will say!

2338,Dalziel and Pascoe, An uneven series eventually winds up trudging the mud of formulaic-procedural cliches,"Reginald Hill is one of the most inventive, original, and unusual crime-writers that have ever lived. In fact, he's so good he's managed to twist the genre he's operating in around so much that I hesitate to even call him a crime-writer at all. Most of his novels are actually clever exercises in genre-twisting and metatextuality with tons of references to obscure classic literature, self-parody, and real, well-developed, three-dimensional characters. It's crime-writing for people who don't like crime-writing or mystery fans with philosophy diplomas. He's a genius.
This is why it was so surprising to hear that BBC were planning to mount an adaptation of his works. Yes, he's successful and his novels sold well but could his style be carried over to television? How can something so genre-bending, rule busting, and metatextual be carried over to a format whose audience demands a level of cosines not provided by an author of Hill's standing?
Well, the answer is unpredictably but decidedly odd as watching the first four series of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" is like listening to someone retell the plots of the novels after having skimmed them some years back. Sure, the plots are there, and so are the characters, but they have been sanitised beyond recognition so there's barely any traces left of Hill's unique style at all. Oh sure, the show WAS good. It had engaging mysteries, good humour, and the characters were still three-dimensional and likeable, but what made the novels so unique and so beloved was their originality which was now gone. Thus the first series proceeds quite by-the-book, in a manner interchangeable with some of those bland ITV crime dramas of the time (with the sole exception of ""Morse"" which was always and will always be singularly and unexpectedly brilliant). I enjoyed all three episodes for their humour, I played along with the mysteries, but as I type this I have trouble remembering them very well. I do know that out of all three I enjoyed ""An Advancement of Learning"" the most as it had a little of that Reginald Hill sparkle left somewhere in it.
The second series, however, was a huge surprise as among the other three rather bland and forgettable episodes comes ""Deadheads"". The only episode of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" that nails the feel of a Reginald Hill novel exactly. Hilarious, uncomprosing, and genre busting it must have done the author very proud as it stands head-and-shoulders (and any other extremity you can think of) above the other episodes. This is probably because it was written by Alan Plater, a genius in his own right and the author of the equally bendy ""The Beiderbecke Affair"". Sadly, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" never reclaims the glory of ""Deadheads"".
Series three is slightly better than the other three episodes of series two but after ""Deadheads"" seems curiously bland. ""Child's Play"" is a very fine mystery episode and it could even rank with some of the better ""Morses"" and ""Bones and Silence"" is a good adaptation coming close to but not quite achieving the greatness of ""Deadheads"".
Then something telling happened. Halfway through series four the producers abandoned Reginald Hill's novels in favour of writing original scripts which brought about the show's failure. Up until this point it sort of hung on a thin thread as its terrific characters at least had interesting plots to work through. From series five onwards, however, all this would be gone and everything from that point on is pure, plodding procedural stuff without wit or imagination. Oh sure, a good episode would sneak in from time to time, but even those (like Glenn Chandler's ""Guardian Angel"") are merely formulaic stuff with a little glimmer of unusual wit (for this show at least) thrown in. The show eventually winds up trudging the mud of formulaic-procedural cliches to such an extent I can't really remember even the episodes I watched recently. I tend to get them mixed up with other dull procedurals such as ""Silent Witness"", later seasons of ""Vera"", or ""Waking the Dead"". And, to think that, had the BBC played their cards right, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" could have been their ""Midsomer Murders"" only with a philosophical edge to it.
Funnily enough, series four contains an episode that comes the closest to a Reginald Hill novel besides ""Deadheads"". It's called ""The British Grenadier"" and it's an involving and unusual story of a hostage situation in a pub brilliantly directed by Maurice Phillips , a TV great gone too soon. What's so funny about it is that it is an original script. It's the only ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" original to reach any sort of greatness.
A few years down the line, another Hill adaptation would be attempted in the form of ""Dialogues of the Dead"", but the result was a stodgy, hopelessly boring, and plodding procedural with such an appalling lack of wit and imagination I'm sure Mr Hill would have rather had his name off it. Penultimate series' episode ""Houdini's Ghost"" was likewise adapted from a Hill novel but so loosly and badly that the less said of it the better.
The real tragedy of ""Dalziel and Pascoe"", however, is the fact that it had the perfect cast. The always brilliant Warren Clarke was spot on as the vulgar, grumpy, overweigth Andy Dalziel and Colin Buchanan provided a worthy foil in the form of the wiry. politically correct DI Pascoe. Also wonderful was David Royle as DS Wield, easily one of the most interesting characters ever to show up on a procedural. Susannah Corbett was an excellent Ellie too, treading that fine line between annoying and likeable with staggering ease.
Overall, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" proves that old adage about producers having no balls. Its a saddening mainstream-isation of a series of enchantingly oddball books that had wit, smarts, and originality, three things to be avoided on consumerist television
Still, ""Dalziel and Pascoe"" is fine entertainment for a rainy day if you can stomach heavily formulaic procedurals. If your into more edgier stuff (and if you like Reginald Hill) you probably are. Go watch ""Deadheads"" and then transition to ""The Beiderbecke Affair"". You'll find it to be more of your cup of tea.",1 out of 5 found this helpful.,5.0,11 June 2018
2339,The King: Eternal Monarch, Beautiful and awesome drama!,"Mind-blowing plot, superb acting, stunning visuals, heart-tugging soundtrack - this drama has it all and more. Lee Min Ho's depiction of a handsome, elegant, benevolent and scientific king is perfect, as is Kim Go Eun as a dedicated, no-nonsense, taekwondo-master detective who decided to be brave because not everyone can be.

It is filled with delightful nuggets, the humor of which I missed on my first viewing, such as when she told him to ""park your horse on the side road to the right"" or when she carelessly tossed away his watch after he told her to take good care of it or when she sneakily took his DNA sample while he was explaining the parallel universe theory or when she told him his eyes look like those of a criminal and he stopped his explanation about quantum mechanics to say, ""I don't know about other things, but I know my eyes are charming.

2340,The King: Eternal Monarch," Fascinating, elegant, smart, funny and thrilling","I have not reviewed a movie before but felt compelled to share how much I love this masterpiece. It has been nitpicked to pieces making one wonder whether it has indeed been sabotaged. It is too beautiful to be left to suffer such an injustice. For example, it was lambasted because a temple that was onscreen for, like, a second, did not look Korean. The nitpickers had totally ignored the fact that this is a FANTASY drama, hitting the show below the belt by taking advantage of Korean viewers' patriotism thereby pushing them away. Nevertheless, it became an international hit, having been #1 most streamed TV show on Netflix in at least 11 countries and in the top 10 in at least 19 other countries.<br/><br/>The story centers around King Lee Gon, played to perfection by Lee Min Ho, who found a portal to a parallel universe where he met gutsy detective Jeong Tae Eul played by Kim Go Eun. Dedicated to her job, Tae Eul doubts Lee Gon's fantastic tale of being a king in a parallel world and tries to discover his identity. She is not one to go gaga for a gorgeous stranger at first sight no matter how openly he expresses his interest in her. But her unfavorable first impression of him is a source of amusing repartee so I didn't mind at all that she took her time to fall for him. How she finally believes him is one of the most thrilling and satisfying developments of the series.<br/><br/>The story is rather complicated, but the pace gives viewers enough time to understand what is going on. Scenes and dialogues that might seem irrelevant turn out to be important, so viewers need to be observant, including of those relating to the romance between the leads as they tend to express their feelings more with their eyes and facial expressions than cheesy lines. Viewers who prefer simple plots might not appreciate the complications and mysteries, but those who go along with the ride would be rewarded with a beautiful and fascinating adventure.<br/><br/>(Netflix stats added on 7/6/2020)",96 out of 105 found this helpful.,10.0,27 April 2020

I actually check the time while watching only to be ""sad"" that the end of the episode is WAY TOO CLOSE NOW. This begins at the five minute mark. Heh.<br/><br/>I love kdramas, but whoa, this one steps it up. The richness of possible plots allures when two whole dimensions are to be explored.

The ""BABE"" is just perfect. Not a ""doll face"" sweetie pie, but a mature AND BEAUTIFUL WOMAN worthy of a King. She snarks at the King and melts our heart with her innocence.

To help me suffer less I've watched all the episodes twice. But it wasn't enough. Am now on a two day binge -- doing the whole series from scratch to today, and HOO WEE did I learn a lot more. I see now I should have BEEN EVEN MORE APPRECIATIVE. This thing's got great writing . . . and everything else. Most kdramas have about four to ten relationships that need to be resolved to a higher clarity, and this makes for some hard slogging to ""keep all subplots fresh so that the viewer always knows who thinks what about whom,"" but The King's writing effortlessly keep us updated -- we don't have to ""study."" And the writer has to keep us hep about each character TWICE! It's quite a mastery of juggling. At this point in the series, I have zero idea of how it will end. So many possibilities! And THEY GOTTA JUST GOTTA START RIGHT NOW ON NEXT SEASON. This is a winner.

She got me started with this drama. :) her ability to control her emotions, her acting voice, facial expressions are just superb; very natural. Oh and her crying scenes!

2345,The King: Eternal Monarch," Stellar, thriller, romantic &amp; out of this world!","Kim Go eun is my absolute favorite thing about this show along with the script, other supporting cast and Lee Min Ho King character. Go Eun adds the much needed emotions to Kdramas. She is such a breathe of fresh air! Simply cannot take my eyes of her. She is natural and couldnt imagine anyone else for this strong role. Quote, Thankfully she isn't just another damsel in distress looking to be saved. In line with her character, she is everything a police detective should be: observant and skeptical, in relentless pursuit of the truth, unquote. The show in itself is fairly unchattered concept which is another breathe of fresh air. I had to rewatch all episodes because they are THAT good and each has a bit of easter egg in it.

That's one thing I've noticed about Korean dramas - they have EXCELLENT bad guys that just make the viewer seethe with hatred, and you can't wait till they get their comeuppance. I don't feel quite that strongly about this jerk yet, as it's early on in the series, but he's certainly already bad enough to deserve a cold serve of justice.<br/><br/>Can't wait to see where the series goes.

2353,The King: Eternal Monarch, Best Korean Series of the Year,"It's not your ordinary kdrama and I guess that's the reason why some people are skeptical on watching this. But I kid you not, this has to been of the best shows this year. Every episode with their cliffhangers leaves you wanting for more. It has almost everything: romance, action, comedy, history and math. Quantum physics? Theory of relativity? Damn right they got it. The only downside is that they only have 16 freakin episodes.<br/><br/>I'm quite bothered though by the amount of hate some korean entertainment sites are giving it when in fact it's a huge global hit. They claim it has low ratings yet it's always top trending on their social media sites. But then I realized the ratings that they're showing only includes tv ratings from Korea only and it doesn't include Netflix which is where TKEM is currently streamed locally and internationally. In my opinion, tv ratings aren't that credible anymore now that people would rather watch shows on Netflix and other social media sites.",25 out of 29 found this helpful.,10.0,27 May 2020

They have done a great job building out the characters backstories and side stories along the way. This is my first kdrama and I love the cinematography and some of the transitions. There are some cultural things implied here...context about the history of Korea and some local cultural things (celebrities, food, etc) but even when I don't exactly get the joke or reference, I can still tell that it what is going on.

2357,The King: Eternal Monarch, Breathtaking masterpiece,"Screenwriter Kim Eun-Sook has once again delivered an intricate storyline that captures the minds and hearts of audiences. In The King: Eternal Monarch, she has succeeded in crafting a world so complex and beautiful that we are left week on week figuring out where this will go. The plot is not predictable, and those who love some intellectual challenge in a show will especially enjoy this.
Especially after Episode 4, the pace picks up and there are juicy pieces in each episode to lap up as clues on how exactly the parallel worlds function and what 'beautiful solution' main character Lee Gon could come up with to solve the current troubles. The sets are intricate and some scenes are truly like a cinematic experience.
The choice of Kim Go Eun to play Detective Jung Tae Eul was perfect. She has the sass to pull of this no-nonsense character who is courageous, direct and utterly charming. Her strength and independence is a breath of fresh air, and she delivers emotional scenes flawlessly. She leaves me in awe.
Lee Min Ho's character, Lee Gon, becomes more multifaceted as the episodes flow on, allowing the actor to portray a large range. He plays the role with a lot of charisma and credibility, and his chemistry with Kim Go Eun is electrifying.

2364,Love Alarm, Disaster!!,"One of the worst dramas! It is very strange that the authors did not put a single positive character in the drama. Sure, it was supposed to be the main female character, but that person does evil to others to protect himself, hurts others out of unwarranted fear, she doesn't stick to her principles, first she said she doesn't want to be with someone so that someone wouldn't hurt her (that's an incredible amount of nonsense) and then she gets in a relationship with her ex-boyfriend's best friend, she's a very negative character! Male characters... what a friendship it is when they stab each other in the back. Supposedly a positive male character, a poor man ... there is not a shred of love in his eyes, total impersonality, at times psychedelia erupts (eyes like a serial killer), evil, without emotions ... as if he is not a man, I do not understand how a woman a person can fall in love with such a person, regardless of the fact that he acts like a good person and in fact he is not. The man who created the app is a story unto himself, disappointed that his love has not been returned, whether out of malice or out of I don't know what else convinces Jojo that she will be hurt, horror! He kills himself, and he is alive, and he reads minds on distance, wtf!!

2381,Love Alarm, Disappointing second season,"While I wasn't fully captivated by the first season, it was still a nice watch and I enjoyed the relationship between Sun-oh and Kim-Jojo which was still developing before it ended abruptly.
At the end of season 1, Kim-Jojo ends the relationship without giving a reason as to why she did it and that became the cliffhanger, main question on everyones mind, that needed to be resolved in season 2 but it didn't.
I saw comments mentioning that in webtoon Kim-Jojo ends up with Hye-Yeong so I wasn't expecting Kim-Jojo getting back together with Sun-Oh, but the relationship between her and Hye-Yeong felt subpar and unnatural compared to the one with Sun-Oh. If we were given a reason to no longer root for Sun-Oh, then it would have been fine, but I can't simply jump to the next relationship when the first one still feels to be the most desired one.
It also felt like we were left with unresolved side plots concerning Kim-Jojo's relationship with her aunt, who by the looks of it treated her poorly ever since she became her guardian. In the end aunt began acting warmer towards Kim-Jojo but it was for a brief moment and thus didn't feel like a conclusion to that arc. Her annoying, selfish and petty cousin also didn't get to redeem herself or get what she deserved for her constant nagging, she instead got rewarded for it which is absolutely absurd. She always wanted to be a part of the badge club and was offered a chance if she got at least a 300 Love Alarm rings, which forced her to behave more nicely towards others in order to get them. I imagined that would develop her character by her finally realizing how troublesome she has been and that being nice to others in return makes people be nice to her.
I'm unaware how closely this show follows the webtoon, but it feels like they should have taken the story elsewhere and capitalized on what people enjoyed the most in season 1 - relationship between Kim-Jojo and Sun-Oh and friendship between Sun-Oh and Hye-Yeong.
Ultimately, the perfect ending to this story for me would have been Kim-Jojo getting back together with Sun-Oh, Sun-Oh rekindling his friendship with Hye-Yeong and Hye-Yeong finding himself a different girl. Aunt finally realizing that Kim-Jojo is not at fault for becoming a financial burden to her due Jojo's parents actions and behaving more nicely and understanding towards her, becoming a real mother figure. Cousin realizing that the reason she's not liked is due to her poor behavior and attitude towards others and through her journey of getting into the badge club, becoming a nicer person and apologizing about how she treated the Love Alarm's developer in high school and also Kim-Jojo.
All in all I have no complaints against the actors, they all did great, it's just the story that left a bitter taste in my mouth.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,5.0,13 March 2021
2382,Love Alarm," There will be a second season, relax","I can't believe how many reviews are only basing it off the cliffhanger. From what I could see, the webtoon goes way past where the first season ended, so just sit back and wait for season 2 and stop your bellyaching about the cliffhanger, they're super common in Asian dramas.<br/><br/>That being said, the story is fascinating. It has a big tech-fiction edge to it that is relatable to all of us that are so addicted to our phones and apps. The main characters are all great and very well cast. The feels are there, so much feels and the chemistry between the 2 main characters is like a fire that burns inside you! If you're a fan of k-dramas you'll love this one for sure, and if you aren't maybe wait until it's completed before you watch it or you'll just whine about the cliffhanger, or you know just go into it knowing you'll have a juicy cliffhanger that will get you excited for season 2.",16 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,1 September 2019

At the beginning, you are introduced to how love alarms works and a girl in the love triangle, the love between between the male lead and the girl, its sweet, pure and elements of the typical k-dramas are there, the unexplained hate from her aunt and cousin, her mood swings all in the name of self protection and for the love, the harrowing scenes where her classmates make fun of her, you know the usual.<br/><br/>What got me in those few episodes is how sweet it is, how easily they fell in love leaving all else behind. It was also good to see the male lead being vulnerable giving the girl an upper hand for most of their relationship which is nice.<br/><br/>That is until it went downhill, the second half seems to 'flashback' to literally scenes that we just watched 5 mins ago, it made the whole thing haphazard at best. i found myself fastforwarding a great part of it. It almost felt as if they had suddenly finished all they had to say and nothing new came of it.

2388,Love Alarm," You might enjoy, If you're brain dead...","First off: the first season was outstanding because of a few things that worked. Although script and dialogues were weak, the concept of love alarm was new and interesting. After a few episodes in, you can feel how the story takes a few not so well executed turns, but is it okay because our main lead Song Kang is charismatic and conveys the trope of a beautifully lost teenager who falls for the blank girl. Now speaking of Kim JoJo, do not expect any thing from this character. She's an empty bottle and has probably less character traits than a wet cabbage. Nevertheless, their on screen chemistry is, what makes season 1 watchable. Now, in season two, the writers basically got rid of the only thing that worked out in season one: our main leads relationship. They did not only destroy what they have built in season one, they also disregarded the second lead completely. Why make him get the girl in the end, when you show us - many many many times - that Kim Jojo still holds on to her first love? What was the purpose of all this?

I would tune in an hour before my bedtime, and literally laugh my ass off. I really don't think my parents had a clue what I was watching, and thank God. This show was a huge part of my childhood, and shaped my entire view of comedy, and what is truly funny. I was never a Monty Python person. Prime time TV sucked, and made me sick to my stomach most of the time. Later on, The State and Mr. Show came close, but never achieved the absolute comedic excellence of these 5 guys.<br/><br/>Besides giving me hours of enjoyment, I really feel this show shaped me to be a better person in so many ways. Growing up in the burbs I had very little exposure to the true stuff of life: alternative lifestyles, class warfare, and the complete ridiculousness of pop culture. If not for this show, I may have become yet another brick in the wall of socially accepted behavior. The Kids taught me it was OK to be weird - that I didn't need to like what everyone else liked. When I first met a gay person, I didn't blink. When I got my first office job, all I could see were the businessman sketches. This show gave me a very unique perspective with which to frame reality, and I'll be forever grateful.<br/><br/>I guess this is a pretty serious review about a comedy show, but what the hell.

2393,The Kids in the Hall, I STILL miss this show!,"I've probably seen every episode of this show's six year run,could probably recite most of the sketches and I keep track of what each of the five from Canada is up to. And I still wish this show were back with new programs. Alas,that would be folly,as they all have moved on and gotten much older,thus making them not really ""Kids"" at all.<br/><br/>I've often wondered which of the five was my favorite. Long story very short:I can't really decide. They're ALL very funny and talented! (I suppose if pressed,I'd say I tilt slightly more toward Dave or Mark) Their ability to mimic people's foibles and quirks,male OR female,and the writing's ability to capture the raw humor in absurdity and behavior made this show quite the stand-out of sketch comedy programs. This show had the rare distinction of claiming three(count'em,three!)networks as its home before each member decided to mutually end the show in late 1994/early,early 1995. It's kind of a shame that their careers didn't really take off(Dave and Scott had reasonable amounts of success since.Kevin works very steadily.Bruce directs and Mark...well,other than touring with the boys on their reunions,I'm not sure exactly how much this guy's working!),but they will always be remembered as the natural successor/Canadian cousin to ""Monty Python""IMHO.

2394,The Kids in the Hall, The most original sketch comedy program on TV.,"Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, you have to admit that there's never been anything like the KIDS IN THE HALL.  Sure, sketch comedy shows are a dime a dozen, but these guys set themselves apart from all the rest with their unmatchable brand of bizarre, surreal, and often gender-defiant skits.  The show is usually downright hilarious, although some of the jokes do miss their mark on occasion.  But even the most unfunny sketches are entertaining, simply because of how insane they are.<br/><br/>The humor in KIDS IN THE HALL is, for the most part, purely unexplainable, and sometimes it's actually subtly disturbing--an experimental sort of comedy that best fits in the ""either you get it or you don't"" category. When watching KITH with a group, the viewer response will invariably be split: one half will be teary-eyed from laughter while the rest of the gang will be hopelessly confused or frustrated, making condescending statements like ""I don't see how you think this is funny!""<br/><br/>It's clear that these lovable Canucks decided from the get-go that they were going to do exactly what they wanted, without too much concern for genre standards, formulas, or even success.  And that, I think, is the secret to their success.  Whether they intended to or not, these five KIDS succeeded in carving themselves a very distinct niche in the world of sketch comedy, towering above even SNL because of their fresh style and consistent hilarity.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,,5 January 2004
2395,The Kids in the Hall, Insanely inspired sketch comedy,"Too bad people have to constantly compare KITH to Monty Python's Flying Circus. Aside from the fact that they were both unlike anything else before or since, the all-male core cast filling most of both gender roles, the ability to come up with totally fresh &amp; insanely novel sketch ideas, and the ability to show self-absorbed American audiences that humor transcends culture... these 2 comic troupes have absolutely nothing in common! It's not for everyone, but if you're tired of the same old McComedy that clogs your cable like kudzu, find KITH &amp; fire up the VCR!

2396,The Kids in the Hall, IMHO The Great Show Ever.,"Oh yes I did. Yeah, yeah I know some people will complain that Kids in the Hall are ""too weird"" or that their sketches are ""confusing"" or just plain ""strange."" Well, those people are entitled to their opinions, but don't let that stop you from at least giving the Kids a try. If you are like me, the Kids will become your daily dose of needed humor.<br/><br/>I was too young to understand the humor of KITH during their original run on CBC/HBO/CBS/whereverthef***. Like many other people I first got into the Kids by watching Comedy Central. I was hooked from the very first episode. The bizarre sketches, monologues, and songs perfectly suited my often dark sense of humor. Those five guys made me laugh harder than any other show or movie ever has. And I'd like to point out that unlike most shows(coughSNLcough), all the Kids pulled their own weight. There was no stand-out member, and just as importantly their was no member who didn't carry his own weight. Dave, Bruce, Kevin, Mark, and Scott are each enormously talented. Each brought something to the mix. Mark can play any character, do any voice. Dave had all the brilliant one-liners and a wonderful sense of comedic timing. Kevin had this great energy and enthusiasm during each sketch. As he himself said [paraphrased] ""I don't say funny lines, I say lines funny."" Scott showed an uncanny ability to touch on topics of sexuality, making you both think and laugh. And then there's Bruce. I must confess that Bruce is my favorite Kid. His oddball and often dark sense of humor struck a cord with me. Bruce brought the music to the Kids. And I'll never forget his monologues.<br/><br/>They've all gone their separate ways now to work on various projects. But they left a lasting impression on sketch comedy. The Season DVDs(and hopefully, seasons 2-5 in the future) and reruns on CC ensure that they will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>So go forth and watch.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,,24 March 2004

Then running across the screen will be two other characters (one of them Dave) carrying axes and swinging them also lack-lusterly.

2409,The Kids in the Hall, The best comedy show America has ever seen,"The Kids in the Hall, though originally from Canada, are widely appreciated in America. Kith is the best comedy show to ever hit American television, and also one of the most underrated. However, more people watch the show now than did before it was canceled. This is because, I think, that people watch the former Kids in their movies and realize what wonderful performers they are, and then begin watching the show, realizing to an even greater degree what wonderful performers they are. With the Kids, you can really get into their characters, and really understand their show. I have never seen a better sketch comedy show, though Saturday Night Live, also produced by Lorne Michaels, does come close. But even SNL can't scratch the ground that this show stands on. America and Canada both lost a wonderful thing when the last episode was shown. However, because of wonderful channels like Comedy Central, fans can still watch the show, and that is how new fans can learn about the wonders of the Kids in the Hall every day. Each of the Kids, Dave, Bruce, Kev, Mark, and Scott, have taken their new careers by the tail.

2412,The Kids in the Hall, Best Old Show on Comedy Central,"Warning!

""Kids in the Hall,"" while actually originally airing on another station, was Comedy Central's best program. It's a shame that the network has elected not to rerun any more episodes.<br/><br/>""Kids in the Hall"" can best be described as a twisted, bizarre sketch comedy that really stretched the limits of good taste and simple logic. Most of the sketches were weird commentaries on everyday moments in peoples' lives, such as sex, work in the office, and marital problems. Others involved extremely weird characters, such as a half-human, half-chicken character hopelessly looking for love; a flying pig; and a guy with an Eastern European accent whose main hobby involved squeezing his thumb and forefinger in front of people's faces in attempt to ""crush their heads."" A small cast of five players performed most of the skits, and put in a tremendous amount of effort to make sure they were funny. The limited cast also meant the men played women's as well as men's roles. In spite of the small cast, the show was incredibly funny, proving that sometimes in skit comedy, less is more. Marathons of ""Kids in the Hall"" ensured that I'd watch Comedy Central for hours on a particular day.

2417,The Bletchley Circle, a thriller set in post-war England,"""The Bletchley Circle"" from 2012 is about women who worked on cracking German military codes during the World War II. They are described as ""Alan's girls,"" meaning Alan Turing, whose tragic life will be the subject of a film starring Benedict Cumberbatch later this year. After the war, though they were all very smart, they settled in everyday life that sometimes was less than satisfying.<br/><br/>When young women start disappearing and wind up dead in 1952, one of the code-breakers, Susan (Anna Maxwell Martin) becomes interested in the case, sees a pattern emerging, and asks her husband to use a connection to get her in to see the Deputy Commissioner. Unfortunately, her idea -- the location of the currently missing girl's body -- is incorrect.<br/><br/>Discouraged, Susan is sure that she and her old code-breaker friends can find the killer using their code-breaking skills. She gets the old group together: Jean (Julie Graham), Millie (Rachel Stirling), and Lucy (Sophie Rundle) who are resistant at first, then agree. It means using information supplied by other code-breakers. It also means putting themselves in danger.<br/><br/>I thought this was a suspenseful, intriguing, and interesting story, with the '50s atmosphere, clothing, and hairstyles intact, with strong acting from the actresses. Because it's a feminist story, meant to show that post-World War II, England didn't need its women any longer, the men in it are annoyed, angry, suspicious, and in one case, violent. I would say the Deputy Commissioner, despite finding Susan a bit of a nuisance, does follow up on what she says, knowing the job she had during the war and her intelligence; and Susan's husband, though not particularly happy, knows she's a good woman and in the end, has patience with her long hours away from the house.<br/><br/>My only question is, where is season 2?

The action then jumps forward a few years to the early fifties when Susan thinks she has spotted a pattern in a series of murders that have recently been reported. She informs the police of her theory but when they check up on it they find nothing. Rather than giving up she turns to her wartime friends hoping they will see the mistake she made. Their analysis of the evidence leads them to the body of another victim and soon they have an idea about how the killer is finding his victims. As they form theories some are proved wrong others initially lead the wrong way but eventually they learn who the killer is; the problem is by then he is aware that they are after him!<br/><br/>This is a solid mystery with a plethora of false leads, suspects who turn out to be innocent and as is often the case a police force who isn't convinced by the evidence presented by the protagonists. The four main characters are interesting and varied despite their similar wartime background. Anna Maxwell Martin does a great job as chief protagonist Susan and is ably supported by Rachael Stirling, Julie Graham and Sophie Rundle as Millie, Jean and Lucy respectively. The series doesn't concentrate on the mystery to the exclusion of all else; we see enough of their family lives to see how attitudes towards women were different back then; there are also subtle reminders to the period such as a newspaper sign mentioning rationing. Viewers hoping to solve the crime before our amateur sleuths may be a little disappointed that we don't see the killer for some time and when we do attention is drawn to him in a way that makes it fairly obvious that he is the killer I don't think that spoils the story though; there is still plenty of tension as the story approaches its conclusion.

2420,The Bletchley Circle, Brilliant post-war thriller,"The British really do period drama well. Often they choose strangely identifiable characters, which are played by highly competent actors. This show was much better than I expected. I really wondered how they were going to tie in code-breakers to a post-war world, and assumed it would be something to do with Russia. What a pleasant surprise to find these extraordinary women on the hunt for a serial killer. The science behind their quest was also extraordinary, and believe me, never suffers from the antiquated or mundane in terms of mind boggling genius in terms of their analytics. It's all very original indeed. The background is authentic 1950s and worth a look just for that. The social commentary was brilliant, though some may find it a little too extracurricular to the suspense of the main plot. The villain is good and evil, and I would have liked to have seen more of that, which is where my extra point disappeared. It would have given the story an extra kick to the suspense, which it needed, because a lot of the suspense was how husbands and other chaps would react to such aggressive role-breaking.

But I will make an exception here. The first episode hooked me like a flounder. It was brilliant and it was original and it was flawlessly executed. The idea that, during WW2, a group of ordinary women (some of whom may or may not have special abilities -- that's a wee spoiler) could be so instrumental, so pivotal, in the war effort, and yet so ignored afterwards. Wonderful notion. Followed by the idea that at least one member of this former squad, in the modern era, would eschew her life as an ordinary housewife to help the police catch a ripper -- and, in the process, re-unite her former team...? Brilliant. So brilliant that, as they say in America, the show was theirs to lose. Because only internal sabotage, only dropping the proverbial ball, would derail such a strong opening. And by George that's just what the writers did. Somewhere mid-story, the writers went barking mad. It is almost as though Guy Burt and his team didn't realize the bird they already had in hand, and went for the two in the bush. Suddenly the viewer is watching a UK version of Charlie's Angels. Suddenly the ladies are in the field actually playing cat and mouse with a serial killer.

2430,The Bletchley Circle, Exceptional in every way,"Many things come together to make a show good, and more are needed to make it great. But to elevate a show to near-perfection requires far more than just great scripts, direction, settings, and acting, all of which TBC possesses in abundance. It needs attention to the smallest details, some of which are painfully, and obviously absent from many shows across the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Obvious details like selecting actors who actually look like offspring of a parent are often ignored in many US shows. The period sets look realistic enough to make me nostalgic for the land of my birth. Careful watching of shows like Mad Men, sees props that have had a hard life when they're supposed to be new, harming the overall effect of an historical setting.<br/><br/>On the topic of Mad Men, the gentleness of the sexism in TBC is a welcome subtlety, unlike the former show, where it is not just blatant, but at times brutal.<br/><br/>Also absent (thankfully) is the mix of races that - along with sexual orientation - is increasingly common (if not mandatory) in many US shows. So too is the boyfriend/lover that provides little or no value to a script. There are four central characters, each with their own lives, and in some cases, husbands, but the males are of only superficial value to the scripts and have accordingly minor roles, only providing opportunities for the leads to develop their roles.<br/><br/>The actors also bring to life the characters with superb conviction and credibility; the pace is just right, and so too is the idea of them taking a bus to get to a location. Not many had cars, early post-war.<br/><br/>When expressed, emotions are conveyed with realism, and in sufficient quantity to move the viewer. At no stage have I felt like I was watching actors, it was more like being given a glimpse into the lives of real people. Again, this is something only the best of teams can achieve.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful show and might well be a treatise on how to create entertainment that is endearing and bound to be enduring.

They decided to investigate a serial murderer because they found the murderer left behind patterns that they can decode, just like breaking codes during the war.<br/><br/>It was an OK movie. Part of the story is over the top. Like when one woman pull out a math book to help figure out the killer's pattern, I thought that was kind of ridiculous. Fortunately she did not pull out a calculus book or used differential equations.<br/><br/>I was able to predict one murder in the movie just by thinking, if she goes to this person for help, wouldn't the serial killer also have guessed it? It is disappointing these supposedly smart women never thought about the possibility.<br/><br/>What is worse, the main character seems to enjoy putting herself in harm's way without thinking. Most people know when you are getting close to catching the killer, the killer may not sit still and may strike back. This thought never occurred to the main character.<br/><br/>It is also stupid these women set a trap to lure the killer and then lost track of the bait.<br/><br/>It is obvious the movie was written by not so intelligent writers.

The youngest of the circle had a more solid background written in the script, but I'm not sure if I could even distinguish the two remaining women from each other, they were bystanders at best.<br/><br/>And even tho one of the ladies had a more solid background written in the script, I'm not sure if it was relevant really.

It's unbelievable how much fun, irony, satire, surreal humour and great characters can come out of so little. And if you are of Catholic extraction, the fun is even greater (we all have met a Dougal, a Ted or a Jack at some stage...)<br/><br/>It's even too hard for me to pick a favourite episode: Ted and Dougal entering the ""EuroVision Song Contest"" with the excellent pop hit (and video clip) ""My lovely horse""? Ted is believed a racist by the islanders and organises a great multi-cultural event? Dougal becomes a milkman only to discover that his life is in danger at Speed 3? Father Stone comes for a visit and for playing a bit of mini-golf? ""The Passion of St. Tibulus"" is being shown at the local cinema? Cigarettes, drink and rollerblades are given up for Lent? Bishop Len Brennan is kicked up the arse? Impossible to decide. <br/><br/>I would recommend to anyone buying the complete series 1, 2 and 3 as they come out in DVD. You can watch ""Father Ted"" over and over and still laugh your head off.<br/><br/>One of my favourite quotes:<br/><br/>Dougal: ""Ted, was Jack really dead?

2445,Father Ted, Amazing. One of the greats.,"'Father Ted' came out during a period when I seldom watched TV, so it was purely by accident that I happened to catch an episode whilst at my parent's place. At first I thought it was going to be a fairly typical middle-of-the-road British sitcom, but it soon became evident that this veneer of normalcy was a Trojan horse, allowing in the show's pointed satire of The Catholic Church, and its wonderful, off-the-wall surrealism, mostly supplied by the young Father Dougal, some of whose utterances had me almost literally in tears.<br/><br/>Take this dialog, when the islanders are convinced that some kind of monster is prowling 'the moors', taking sheep.<br/><br/>""They say it's as big as four cats, and it's got a retractable leg so as it can leap up at you better and you know what Ted, it lights up at night, and it's got four ears. Two of them are for listening and the other two are kind of back-up ears, and it's claws are as big as cups and for some reason it's got a tremendous fear of stamps and Mrs. Doyle was tellin' me that it's got magnets on it's tail so as if you're made out of metal it can attach itself to you, and instead of a mouth it's got four arses. ""<br/><br/>Needless to say, after that, as a fan of the British surrealist tradition, I was hooked, and soon learned to love the other characters and the show as a whole.<br/><br/>Perhaps what makes it so great is that it managed to combine satire and surrealism with other more conventional comic styles which appealed to my parent's generation (my mother is 71 and loved the show).<br/><br/>If there was a finer sitcom to come out of the UK in the 90's, I don't know what it is.

2446,Father Ted," Three priests, two writers, one heavenly masterpiece","When the sitcom idea to portray the adventures of three priests in Ireland - a drunk, a dimwit and the main character in between - was pitched to TV executives, the reaction was lukewarm at best. Religion, a joking matter? Impossible! But well, ""The Vicar of Dibley"" with comedy heavyweight Dawn French worked, so the OK was given, all doubts aside. And thus it so happened that Arthur Mathews and Graham Linehan, writers with an edge, set out to delve into the rural conservative catholic setting and run the gamut, starting from the custom sitcom weirdness to out and out absurdity in the parochial house somewhere on Craggy Island. Not with the intention to ridicule the catholic church, but to follow through with everything it has developed into, to satirize its reality and at the same time humanize its unbalanced shepherds. Interestingly, it works.<br/><br/>""Father Ted"" gets off with a slow start, but once the characters and writers have hit their stride comedy-wise, the series delivers like no other. The Fathers Ted (Dermot Morgan), Dougal (Ardal O'Hanlon), Hackett (Frank Kelly) and Mrs. Doyle (Pauline McLynn) stumble from one farcical situation into another and the punch lines get sharper and wittier the longer the journey lasts. There's slapstick, well timed cartoonish back and forth, strong language and directness thanks to the naivety of the characters, yes, there's even cursing among priests and still it's entirely inconspicuous thanks to the changing of a vowel. And we get subversive social commentary served the fun way and it's, pardon the pun, a hell of a ride. If you book your trip to Craggy island you'll witness priests struggling through lent, have a crush on a lady visitor, go on a disastrous unholy holiday, turn into racists by trying to demonstrate the exact opposite and help to heal a depressed sheep. You can learn from priests how to get people to watch a raunchy movie thanks to their campaign against it, or how to kick a bishop up the arse - just pretend it never happened. Intrigued?

Then, it may have gotten a little too offensive for a New York Catholic audience. But despite everything, it is a classic comedic series. You'll laugh more than be offended. Maybe a few people in the television audience might answer their true callings of priesthood and sisterhood. We need more religious people. Maybe in a way, Father Ted shows a fun side of priest life without the stuffiness associated with it. Priests can and do have fun. They're even hysterical to watch over and over again.

2450,Father Ted, Consistently hilarious and imaginative comedy series that stands at its peak,"On the small parish of Craggy Island lives a group of three priests. The head of these is the ambitious but frustrated Father Ted Crilly, a man who feels, nay, knows that he is better than his lot. His young support is Father Dougal McGuire, a man who feels confused by anything and everything; and finally the old guard Father Jack Hackett, a man who feels rage, lust or sleepy depending on how much alcohol he has managed to get down him that day. They are looked after by the persistent and serving Mrs Doyle as they try to deal with the daily problems of their parish and being a Catholic priest in general.<br/><br/>Although about seven years have now gone passed, Father Ted still stands up as a hilariously surreal and inventive sitcom based around the live of three priests living together. The plots range from the strange to the completely weird but generally they all work because the humour consistently comes off. It is hard to describe because it is filled with touches of genius, references that are not obvious, plots that are clever and silly and characters that are very well observed. It is certainly not the sort of sitcom that I'm used to seeing  although it does conform to a sitcom standard if you condense it right down to its base. As it is rather off the wall, it will not appeal to everybody but for those that get it the comedy is amazing consistent and I do struggle to think of an episode that I was class as ""bad"" across the whole run.<br/><br/>Although his death was very unexpected, the loss of Morgan has allowed the series to simply stop and stand up as one of those programmes that went out on a high, rather than slowly fading away (like so many do  a true class act knows when to leave). With his death the show had no choice but to end completely (as opposed to the everlasting ""specials"" hell suffered by things like Only Fools &amp; Horses) as such was the reliance on the cast that nobody could really replace him. He is excellent as Ted, the more ""together"" character who is still all over the place and has a great sense of comic timing. He so completely gets the humour that he makes for a great lead. O'Hanlon will forever be Dougal and his career has suffered as a result  his next project (the horrible ""My Hero"") essentially made him a Dougal-lite to significantly less effect. Here the writing is strong though and he really works well, contrasting nicely with Ted and often being a driver for the plot. Kelly has much more of a one-note performance but is still very enjoyable as such, while McLynn was always funny despite occasionally overworking her catchphrase. The support is roundly good from the other ""priests"" etc brought in as the plots require.<br/><br/>Overall a manically imaginative comedy that conforms to the basic sitcom standards but vastly exceeds them in regards what it then does. The plots are rarely logical or sensible but within them the humour is sharp and rarely less than funny. Working with Catholic priests as its characters, the show could have just gone for easy targets but it doesn't and, although hardly respectful to the church, it is certainly not holding it up to ridicule in the same some think it is.

I don't believe anything will ever be made that is as perfect as this.<br/><br/>Unlike most other comedy series, the jokes get better the more watch them and familiarise yourself with all the characters. Most of which have something to do with religion, but in the general sense of the characters and playing on stereotypes rather than being either for or against religion itself.<br/><br/>It's such a tragedy that Dermot Morgan (Father Ted) died. This series gave so much laughter to many and in my opinion; it just kept getting better and better as the characters developed.<br/><br/>So don't miss out on watching this rare TV treasure..

So Ted (The smart one but nothing goes his way), Dougal (The dumb one that everything goes his way but he doesn't notice), Jack (The drunk pervert that Ted and Dougal can't look beyond) and Ms. Doyle (Every Irish woman over 80) all make a great team.

2456,Father Ted, Drink + Feck + Arse + Girls + 3 Priests = Quality Comedy.,"I must admit to never getting round to watching this masterful comedy series when it first aired on Channel 4 way back in the mid 90s. I guess it was because I couldn't see how they could make a sitcom using three Catholic priests and a manic housekeeper without having to tone down the religious content for fear of offending someone.<br/><br/>As a consequence Father Ted passed me by for all that time until Ch4 repeated the 3rd series a few months ago and I just happened to tune in by accident, and the rest is history as they say.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go as far as saying this is the best ever comedy series to come out of the UK (for me I would opt for Black Adder, Only Fools &amp; Horses, Fawlty Towers &amp; Yes Prime Minister), but it certainly ranks in my top five.<br/><br/>Each episode is so skillfully written without any excess fat to slow or detract from the main storyline. But even a great script counts for nothing if you don't have quality actors to bring that story to life using their own masterful interpretation.<br/><br/>I guess we all have a our favourite character. Some people prefer Father Jack (Frank Kelly),  the dirty old priest with a fixation for girls &amp; booze and brought into the public consciousness the rather abusive but highly amusing ""feck &amp; arse"".<br/><br/>Other people love Mrs Doyle (Pauline McLynn), the housekeeper and general dog's body to the three dippy priests. But she has a heart of gold and a certain innocent charm for this rather naive &amp; skitty middle aged lady.<br/><br/>It came as quite a shock to the system to learn that Dermot Morgan (Father Ted Crilly) died just one day after shooting the final ever episode. But in spite of the sorrow we should be thankful to him for entertaining us &amp; making us laugh out loud so many times with his rather bumbling &amp; frustrated character. <br/><br/>But  for me I would have to say that Ardal O'Hanlon as Father Dougal McGuire takes the honours as the most hysterically funny priest ever. His character reminds me of a Homer Simpson - a kind of naive charm, very slow on the uptake, innocent &amp; childlike and yet from time to time comes up with the most amazing lines, ideas &amp; suggestions that just take my breath away with laughter.<br/><br/>Im glad, in a way that only 3 series were ever made (it was agreed between the actors and writers that series 3 would be the very last despite the death of Morgan shortly after completion). Had he lived the pressure to produce another series at some latter stage would be too great and I personally feel would not have been in the same league as the previous three. <br/><br/>As the old saying goes, once you reach the top the only way is down. Three series, therefore, was just right to maintain the quality for the sake of quantity.<br/><br/>Arse!<br/><br/>****/*****",11 out of 14 found this helpful.,8.0,22 August 2002
2457,Father Ted, Simply one of the Best Comedy Series Ever,"The best thing you can say about Father Ted is that even though it is being constantly repeated on British and Irish TV channels it is still very funny. There is an almost irresistible temptation to watch an episode when you find one by accident while channel hopping.<br/><br/>This is hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen the programme. Of the four main characters three are completely cartoonish. Dougal is thick, Jack is manky, Mrs Doyle is bizarre. Their characters don't change in any way but this doesn't stop them being funny.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's the litany of even more bizarre characters that drop in on Craggy Island in each episode. The acceptance that the stories are surreal and not to look for any sense or realism in them will also help your enjoyment.<br/><br/>Too much analysis from me.

2459,Father Ted, My Favourite TV Show,"Yes, Father Ted is my favourite TV show of all time. In the UK and Ireland, we quote this show as much as the rest of the world quotes The Simpsons, with so many lines and terms from the show becoming implanted into our psyche. I've been watching Father Ted since I was a kid and even though I didn't get off any of the adult jokes back then, the wacky and surreal humour always had me in fits of laughter. I don't think there's been a month in the last 17 years that I haven't watched one of its 25 episodes, yet I still can't pick a favourite!<br/><br/>Every joke in Father Ted works on so many levels. The setting of the fictional Craggy Island is surely the most backward ended place on Earth but this is all brilliantly downplayed. Whenever anything absurd happens, the characters react in an unsurprised or not surprised enough manner. For example, when Ted discovers Craggy Island has its own Chinatown. Just how does an island off the coast of Ireland have a significant Chinese population and how does a person living there not even know about it?! I could take any joke from this show and list on multiple levels as to why it's so absurd and surreal. The inconsistencies and even the odd plot hole just makes everything funnier.<br/><br/>I suspect one of the reasons Father Ted became so successful is that it dispelled the notion that the Irish are completely oblivious to the outside world in the sense that the characters talk about popular culture just like people in any other civilized county would. Granted the characters in every other sense don't act like people in the real world but I believe this one aspect made the show more relatable to a wider audience, from references to bands such as Oasis and Radiohead to various film references (Dougal, we are not watching Aliens!). I'm from Ireland and even to this day, I hear stories from Irish people who have gone abroad and meet people who think Ireland is technologically un-advanced country and that we all live in cottages. One story I always remember was an Irish guy telling me of how he told an American he owned an Xbox 360 and the American couldn't believe it.<br/><br/>Allow me to hold up my cup of tea to Father Ted. May I continue to watch it for years, with Dougal and Mrs. Doyle and Father Jack forever and ever and ever and ever and ever and ever...",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,5 April 2015
2460,Father Ted," I'm Catholic, and I love it.","Irreverent, politically incorrect, and absolutely hilarious, Father Ted is a phenomenal series about three priests living on Craggy Island in Ireland. Talk about an outpost - the opening shot shows a house with nothing around it.<br/><br/>The late Dermot Morgan plays Father Ted, not above a shady deal or two. He lives with Father Dougal McGuire (Ardal O'Hanlon) an impossibly stupid young priest, and Father Jack Hackett (Frank Kelly) an old priest who hasn't drawn a sober breath in probably fifty years. Helping them out is Mrs. Doyle (Pauline McLynn), a somewhat unstable housekeeper. It's obvious the priests have been sent as far away as possible to dwell in obscurity.<br/><br/>It's very hard to choose a favorite episode, but I'm partial to Speed 3. My favorite part of that is Ted working feverishly at the blackboard while lots of discussion is going on. One poster mentioned the stolen whistle - I just saw that one, and it is hilarious. I also love the raffle, when they raffle a car in order to fix their leaky roof. And the vacation episode is a classic as well.<br/><br/>A no-miss.

2461,Father Ted, Excellent show,"I was recommended the show by a guy that usually has poor taste, so it was a while before I actually got around to giving it a try. When I did, it took about 5 minutes until I grasped the concept when Ted said 'It's a longshot, but we'll leave some paper and a pencil outside the tent and hope that God writes down what we should do' (not quoted but those in the know, know). From then I was hooked as was my good lady. To this day if she asks a question I might respond by adding Ted or Len on the end of the reply and give her a Dougal glazed look. I would love to know where it was filmed in Ireland as I'm sure both of us would be wanting to visit and pay homage to this fabulous series.

Father Jack Hackett is an intellectual disguised as a drunk (only joking),whose very conversant on matters ecumenical. Finally,there's Father Dougal Maguire, played by Ardal O'Hanlon (the real intellectual) who uncovers Father Ted's schemes all the time.<br/><br/>The scripts are incredibly funny,socially satirical and well acted.The housemaid never runs out of egg sandwiches and there's always an odd bishop or two who visits our trio and gets transformed in the process whether he wants to or not.<br/><br/>There's a plethora of local folk who add colour to the humour and the whole show is blessed by the pope ..Ahemm!!",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,2 July 1999

And the acting? Second to none. Never over the top, always real and tangible and on character. Can not say enough about the lead actress.

Hjordis is the most wonderfully vulnerable yet amazingly strong person you could wish to meet and the fact that she and Uffe can converse fluently in Elvish is a stroke of genius. This series has made me gasp in horror, giggle hysterically, cry in anger and sadness, laugh out loud at some of the antics, repulsed me in some scenes and warmed my heart in others.

2466,Rita, Makes me want to visit Denmark,I truly enjoyed this show on Netflix and I didn't get enough. It is very different television than we have here in the U.S. They are more open and accepting of different lifestyles. Rita's character is very complex and I love her. She does so many things wrong and breaks rules in an effort to do the right thing for the school children. She is a teacher that truly cares for the kids she teaches but she isn't the best mother. This show reminds me of Nurse Jackie which is an excellent show on Showtime (Cable here in the US).

The story is about Rita, as in the title, a parent of a dis-functional single parent family whose character is so well portrayed and played.

Rita plays the role of a mother, a teacher and a outgoing sexually driven, outspoken individual whose life tribulations make a gripping tale.

And, not only that, but it is the first show that I've seen in a really long time in which the main character has an abortion. Probably because the show is Danish and not American; in the US no women on TV have abortions, even if they get pregnant through rape or incest. In the US, getting pregnant and having babies is celebrated to such an extreme degree on TV and in movies that it's not realistic. I've gotten tired of seeing characters get pregnant, not want to be, yet have the baby anyway. Not so on Rita. Yay! Women's right to choose is still alive on TV somewhere in the world. Not only that, but Rita has the confidence and chutzpah of no other character that I can remember who's not holding a gun.

I've laughed a lot watching it and also cried. The comedy and drama still comes through. The lead actress really is the show stopper here with the actress playing Hjørdis a close second. They're so totally different but both lovable in their own ways. Occasionally, it's a little over acted in the beginning but things really get ironed out by season 2 and get really juicy by season 3. I'm really excited to read there will be a season 5 as I'm very much enjoying the ride! I saw they've attempted to remake it in the U.S. before and it wasn't picked up and another go is coming. I don't know if they'll be able to capture the same it factor that makes this show so fantastic. It's an easy binge. At times you'll find yourself hating Rita but still rooting for her. That's a testament to the talent of the lead actress and her ability to create a multidimensional character. You won't always agree with her but she gets results.

It's the one I never miss during weekdays In fact, it's been my favourite for quite a few years now, given that Eastenders has certainly suffered a great 21st century downfall The viewers' ratings for this Soap always suffer in comparison to the universally watched Soaps (Eastenders, Coronation St), much to do with the fact that Channel 4 suffers in comparison to BBC1 and ITV Nevertheless, I would say it is the most realistic of all the Soaps, and doesn't overstretch the boundaries in storytelling. In fact it is more in touch with human nature than all the other soaps, relating its plots to real teenage problems and even parental problems Moreover, it doesn't need to bring a character back from the dead to boost ratings; and most of the families are central to the main plots so you become familiar with them My current favourite characters are Louise, Warren, Carmel, Tony, John-Paul and Jacqui, all of whom are very much involved in the current gripping episodes I would recommend this Soap to both genders and to people in their teens and above, however the Late Night Specials include more adulterated content",23 out of 38 found this helpful.,10.0,25 March 2007

That's how bad the acting is.<br/><br/>I know people comment on movies that have okay acting as having terrible acting and I am well aware that a lot of American soaps like Sunset Beach and Days of Our Lives have rather poor acting but THIS has THE ABSOLUTE WORST and THE MOST PITIFUL excuse for acting I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The characters of Max, OB and Justin are performed quite well but the all of the rest are simply awful. I know for a FACT that many of the so called actors are chosen by their looks alone and not for their acting abilities. A rather stupid way of casting a TV show it is. Many TV shows do this but no other show has such A DISGRACEFUL DISPLAY of acting than Hollyoaks. <br/><br/>The direction is dull, miserable and very bleak. Every scene is lit with grey light that puts an incredibly depressing atmosphere on everything. When this ain't the case it's painfully obvious it's being helmed by a film-school graduate desperate to show off his non-skills. <br/><br/>Even the pathetic stories are nothing more than childish morality plays and Sunday-school style 'don't do this' kind of lessons. Since the target audience is mainly teenagers the producers tend to condescend to them with endless amounts of these simple cautionary tales. They don't even attempt to make it subtle. I'd be really offended watching this as a teenager if they thought I was as ignorant and naive as the badly written characters. They are SO VERY BAD you'll either be rolling around on the floor in laughter or be enraged at such an atrocity.",28 out of 54 found this helpful.,1.0,3 July 2000
2492,Hollyoaks," Probably one of the best soaps in the UK, here's why!","Firstly, I am a big fan, but for good reasons!

2493,Hollyoaks, How is this so popular?,"I can understand why teenagers might like ""Hollyoaks"" - it produces a glamorous myth about university/young working life in a somewhat realistic environment (what I mean is a small town that most people would end up residing in as opposed to the centre of London or the hippest part of Manhattan). However, I cannot understand why so many young adults and students can find ""Hollyoaks"" so intoxicating.<br/><br/>A great number of my friends are addicted to this and will rush home for 6:30 so as not to miss it, and then watch the sneak-peak for tomorrow's episode on E4 after that has finished (they will most likely also watch this episode when it is screened nearly 24 hours later on Channel 4). I cannot get my head around how they could moderately enjoy this. It makes mid-range productions like ""EastEnders"" and ""Coronation Street"" seem like productions from the Royal Shakespeare Company. Pretty much everything is bad, from the corny acting and contrived story lines to the awkward use of pop-music and the often shoddy direction. Somebody actually told me once that the cast of ""Hollyoaks"" are actually hired through modelling agencies and not through acting agencies, which would make a lot of sense giving the show's banality.<br/><br/>I understand that I shouldn't expect the pinnacle of sophistication in a soap-opera, but it frankly sinks far below any level of quality to be worthwhile.

They cast the actors purely on looks, a lot of the cast were models prior to being on Hollyoaks. And I must say the writers seem absolutely clueless, as most of the story lines seem to be totally unoriginal and cliché... <br/><br/>On the other hand, there is a certain spark to the show which makes you enjoy watching it, and carry on watching it. There are a few lovable characters, and a few which you hate so much that you watch the show again just to laugh or cringe at.

2497,Hollyoaks, This show has seen better days,"Hollyoak's is the brainchild of Phil Redmond. Redmond has provided the British public with some of the best cutting edge drama in the last 30 years. Beginning with Grange Hill in 1978 he established what has now become a legendary national treasure depicting the trials and tribulations of teenagers in their G.C.S.E and A-Levels. He then created Brookside, which changed the story lines of British Soaps forever with its continuous devotion to depict gritty, real suburban live. A programme set in Redmond's native Liverpool that revolved around a community of adults. Then in the 1990's came Hollyoaks. This was Redmond's project to depict live of the twenty something's in Chester.<br/><br/>On its release in 1995 it was considered typical Redmond's style. Its depiction of real live issues was sometimes relentlessly hard to watch but in other areas it was terrifically funny. It's cast were wonderful with the emphasis was on a naturalistic performance. The writing was crisp and fresh and very inventive. It dealt in a very mature fashion with the issues depicted and its sensitive approach meant that the soap was held very high in both the public and industries eyes. But as the old cast began to move on and replacements were drafting in it became clear that the previous hard work was being replaced by glamour and over the top story lines. The new actors were looks friendly and not very talented and the acting descended from well thought out characterizations to populist acting. This consists of over the top performances throughout the episode. It is quite frustrating to see this considering whatever went before them were genuine actors and actresses. This is not helped by the over the top story lines. Since January 2006 there has been a kidnapping, incarceration of a rapist who then escapes and commits mass murder. It is now Sept 2006 and the big action packed story lines are still coming. This is not helped by the cheesy camera direction that is employed in some of the scripts. One particular sequence involved a tomato ketchup mustard shoot out involving two girls. This was shot to the style of a John Woo. Some people say this is inspirational but to me its just rubbish and it quite clearly pisses upon what Phil Redmond set out to achieve in 1995. What was a good British Soap full of characters that you would genuinely care for have now been forsaken for a more Americanised product full of whining wannabes.<br/><br/>In it's time it has tread some ground that has met Phil Redmond's brief of Realism. The most powerful storyline to date was the male rape of Luke Morgan. This was the last time that Hollyoaks generated such a response from the public. Many of whom welcomed such a topic that had until then been swept under the carpet as a taboo issue. Since then the cheese has been processed weekly and distributed on a daily basis. In the film The Insider the Christopher Plummer character says in relation to media "" You will only be remembered for what you did last night "". If this statement is true I really hope Phil Redmond has another ace up his sleeve because at the moment it looks like Hollyoaks current mediocrity will be remembered. 4 out of 10",9 out of 17 found this helpful.,4.0,29 September 2006

2503,Hollyoaks, Embarrassingly amateurish acting,"Oh my god, can the acting seriously get much worse?!<br/><br/>I have to say that the acting has never reached Oscar-winning heights, but at the present moment it is so positively dire, that it is extremely laughable.<br/><br/>How the directors can possibly 'direct' these so-called actors, or pieces of wood as they have more in common with, with a straight face is unbelievable. How they can put them on air without seriously worrying about their credibility status as professional directors is beyond me. Because let's face it, these actors are so bad, that it has to reflect on the directors.<br/><br/>Okay, taking a breather from my rant, I have to say that NOT ALL of the Hollyoaks cast fits into the above mould. Most of the longer-serving cast members are perfectly adequate as soap actors. They will never be the recipient of a major award for outstanding acting achievement, but perfectly adequately fit the requirements for British soaps. Even some of the newer cast members, such as the Hunter family for example, can hold their own in this department.<br/><br/>But a lot of the influx of new members were so obviously chosen for either their looks or their connections, as the acting is so amateurish, it even lowers the (already rock bottom) standards of some British soaps.<br/><br/>
""Hollyoaks"" is marketed as an accurate portrayal of British teen life, but the acting and production is so embarrassingly awful that to compare it up against an American contemporary, for example, ""Dawson's Creek"", would bring shame on to the entire British nation.

MAybe I'm just old fashioned, but I like my soaps to have some mature characters. Coronation Street became famous for featuring actresses and actors like Violet Carson, DOris Speed, Jean Alexander, Arthur Leslie, Jack Howarth, etc. Hollyoaks works because it appeals to a younger audience who may not care about adult matters.

To make matters worse, the show was often not aired in the slot advertised in the TV schedules (which, in 1990/91, before the net, was pretty much the only way to know what would be on). The worst example was once when I tuned in to see The Flash, I was just in time to see it going OFF!

2515,The Flash, A Great Origin,The Pilot episode for the Flash TV series was the origin and was done very well. Barry Allen a scientist is working in a lab with many chemicals when lightning strikes through the window in which a small explosion occurs. What is so great about the origin is where he begins to discover how fast he is and how he learns to adapt to his new superpower. The discovering of his superspeed was done in a couple of semi-humorous situations. A scientist/physician (Amanda Pays -with big beautiful eyes) performs tests on him and helps him control his new found speed. She also gives him his costume so his clothes don't rip apart when he is running very fast. The subplot was fair to okay with The Flash catching a motorcycle gang who tries to take control of the city and killed his brother. - The rest of the series was up and down with good &amp; bad scripts. Also the writers didn't do enough to build on the chemistry of Barry Allen and Christina McGee that was laid out in the pilot episode. John Wesley Shipp was an excellent choice to portray the Flash. The costume and the effects in the series were cool.

2517,The Flash, Yet another good show that deserved a better chance.,"I was a big fan of this show the first time around.  I was already something of a comic fan, and this series was a great translation of the material into a series.  The Flash was a great-looking show, and the actors played their parts flawlessly.  John Wesley Shipp, who played the Flash, has that Bruce Campbell-like ability to portray a likable, average guy, who just happens to get super powers.  His sidekick, the lovely Amanda Pays (formerly of Max Headroom) was a good, but underused, addition to the show.<br/><br/>The special effects were surprisingly good for a TV show, although I do seem to remember some wince-inducing moments, like one villain whose costume included - unless my memory is really messing with me, which has been known to happen - a Nintendo Power Glove.<br/><br/>On the subject of villains, they were usually done well.  I highly recommend the episodes starring Mark Hamill as the Trickster.  Fans of the animated Batman series will notice an early version of Hamill's Joker persona here, which is interesting since the Flash comics' Trickster character was basically a rehash of Batman's Joker in the first place.<br/><br/>All in all, this show really didn't deserve to get canned after one season. Given another season, it could have grown into something classic. Luckily, videos of this seem fairly easy to come by, so it's still possible to check out this underrated footnote in the history of superhero television.",37 out of 44 found this helpful.,8.0,24 January 2004
2518,The Flash," A great TV series, just a little before it's time...","The Flash is one of DC comics most endearing heroes for this simple reason; even though he has been given a tremendous gift of super-speed, he is still only human. Superman always could do the incredible tasks of saving the world and managing to rescue Lois Lane from the bad guys... The Flash is always trying to beat the clock. Batman makes detective work look easy, The Flash spends the majority of his day painstakingly analyzing evidence in a lab. Imagine one of the crew of CSI spending the whole day collecting evidence and then trying to stop villains in whatever time he had left of his day: all of this while working in a police station that is hunting down his alter-ego! For those who were not comic book fans, this series is still worth a look. It was ahead of it's time in many ways: X-men, Spiderman, and the upcoming Batman Begins all focus in on the people behind the masks and the costumes to reveal the true character of the Hero.<br/><br/>The Flash Series had a hero who was fast, but not too fast. He had weaknesses and limitations and problems with his love life. And no matter how fast he was he never seemed to be on time! Memorable performances from John Wesley Shipp, Amanda Pays, and Mark Hamill as the Trickster.<br/><br/>Budgetary reasons were the reason the show had to shut down, which was unfortunate. The show was definitely hitting a good stride between good characters and great plots. There was a large body of rogues to choose from, and I personally loved the adaptations of Captain Cold and the Mirror Master. No need for flashy outfits for these guys, the writing and action was so stylish that there was no need to put these two in ridiculous colored spandex.<br/><br/>If you can find either the Pilot or the Trickster episodes to rent, give them a look.

They managed to capture the Barry Allen costume and not look silly, along with lots of innovative sets and lighting, and the effects were quite good for the time. The character was a mix of Barry Allen, killed off several years earlier in the comics, and Wally West, the current comic book Flash, and played by John Wesley Shipp. Amanda Pays played a sidekick/romantic interest fairly similar to her character on Max Headroom. Mark Hamill played the Trickster in two episodes (sidekick Prank seemed like a fairly direct reference to Joker &amp; Harley Quinn), David Cassidy played Mirror Master in another. Another episode was a nice homage to the popular team-ups of ""Golden Age"" WWII era Flash with the modern day Flash in the comics, here a retired hero called the Prowler, complete with a deep-frozen villain of the originals.

John Wesley Shipp's flash had this way of speaking that always made you feel alright. It was a different time. There were a lot of kids who needed it, and I was definitely one of them. Of course the networks had no idea what to do with it - even Batman was a fluke at the time, because comic books were still considered something specifically for nerds - and liking nerd things meant being uncool. Now after 25 years, comic book movies rule entertainment. I gave it 8 stars out of ten, because there were some cheesy moments. It comes off very G-Rated these days, but we shouldn't measure our shows by how dark and violent they can be, because people are forgetting about the goodness and kindness that comes from the natural desire to do good. The flash is a kind person who respects the people around him, and I'm happy to see that the 2014 Flash series with Grant Gustin is carrying the torch in not only giving us another flash, but paying homage to the 90's version by including John Wesley Shipp. I hope to see more of the 90's cast make appearances as time goes on.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,15 September 2015
2523,The Flash, Great adaption of the comic book,"The Flash was based on the DC comic of the same name. The TV show stayed pretty faithful to the comic version. Following the adventures of police scientist Barry Allen, who is transformed into a super fast costumed hero known as The Flash.The show maintained very high production values, awesome effects,especially when depicting The Flash running at super speed,and a great theme by Danny Elfman who did the music for the Batman movie the year before.The high production cost is probably why the series was axed after only one season.",10 out of 15 found this helpful.,,4 February 2001

It wasn't given a fair chance. I loved that show but, like others have on this forum have said, it was bounced around the TV schedule like a rubber ball, and often preempted because of the Gulf War, which took precedence on the airwaves. The acting was great, the special effects were quite good for the time, and the episodes were quite entertaining. I own on the complete series on DVD now that it's available on DVD and I really enjoy watching episodes.

2526,The Flash, Child's Play,"I always thought The Flash would make it.  CBS used strategy placing an hour long drama Thursdays @ 7:30 (CST).  Why?  So that teens who watched The Simpsons on Fox would switch over to CBS.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, NBC's Cheers beat out The Flash in the ratings race!  CBS moved the show to Saturdays in 1991.  <br/><br/>If it had been a hit, would they have had a Kid Flash?<br/><br/>My favorite episode would be Child's Play that had John Wesley Shipp team up with the late Jonathan Brandis.  <br/><br/>The Flash gives Corey (Brandis) a super speed skateboard ride, goes through a vibrating wall (which the comic book character actually did) &amp; has the guts to beat the villians by playing the electric guitar!  Cool!  He played a black Fender Strat.<br/><br/>No super hero had the guts to play a musical instrument with these execptions.<br/><br/>1).  Batman, Robin &amp; Batgirl played fifes to lure rats out to sea on an episode.<br/><br/>2).  The Kid Super Power Hour had a band @ the near end of the show.<br/><br/>3).

2527,The Flash, True to the early 70's comics,"I thought this was a great series. The wonderful theme by Danny Elfman rivalled his other great creations. John Wesley-Shipp was not a bad cast. I knew him from his Guiding Light days.<br/><br/>At the time it came out, it might have been a tad confusing for comics fans who had just seen Barry Allen extinguished in the Crisis of Infinite Earths. But such is Network TV<br/><br/>It was a bit camp, but I didn't feel it was overdone. It had the feel of the early 70's Flash comics.<br/><br/>I remember a particular episode where the villain sprays a drug in the Flash's face, and he starts tripping out a bit. He uncontrollably vibrates through a wall without damaging it. His hi-speed activity have caused his body to burn off the effects of the drug and he realizes what has just happened (that he can vibrate through walls). He then goes back inside (some sort of auditorium) grabs a guitar on stage and plays a frantic hi-speed solo that makes the baddies pass out. It was hilarious.<br/><br/>Also, similar to the old Batman series, celebs wanted to play baddies on the show. Mark Hamill as the Trickster, David Cassidy as the Mirror Master, and others...<br/><br/>As the shows progressed, the creators gained to confidence to make him do the stuff he did in the comics, and it worked.<br/><br/>unfortunately, someone didn't think it worked.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,,30 September 2003

2529,The Flash," Beautiful, nostalgic, gone way too soon","WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS....<br/><br/>This show takes me back to the days long before CGI and Superheroes were very uncommon especially on Network Prime time. The show ran a full season before it was tragically cancelled due to low ratings mainly due to the Gulf War and airing against The Simpsons that was highly popular at the time... The show itself revolves around CSI tech Barry Allen, perfectly portrayed by actor John Wesley Shipp. To me Shipp doesn't get the credit he deserves. He really is one of those actors like Bruce Campbell and I would love to see him more involved in the upcoming episodes of the New CW Flash or it's sister shows. <br/><br/>Shipp is joined by the beautiful Amanda Pays who plays scientist Tina Magee who learns of Barry's super powers and helps him become the crime fighting superhero The Flash. The F/X were very impressive and still hold up to the day. The show had a mixture of tones: everything from 1960's Batman to the darker Keaton Batman. The setting was set with a mixture of the present and the past. It had a very pulpy feel to it. The stories were very engaging and The Flash was always plenty visible in his maroon suit which I don't think they will ever top.<br/><br/>There are many famous guest stars along the way including Tim Thomerson, Mark Hamill, and of course before he was famous Bryan Cranston. This show is a true piece of nostalgia that we would never get today, it's just a shame we never got another season or at the least TV movies.",5 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,6 September 2016

If I remember correctly, it was only on for a year or two before it was given the axe. In that time, they probably put out ten or eleven episodes.",5 out of 13 found this helpful.,,26 February 2000
2531,The Flash, Rushing Hero,"This is one of my favorite live action comic book adaptation shows of all time and it's another childhood gem. Back then I never even heard of ""The Flash"" let alone any of the other roster in the DC verse. Seeing this show it really blew me away because it's given me another favorite superhero in my roster and this show didn't come a moment too soon as the 90's were a bit of a gold age for the comic book films that were just starting their assent from the live action films ""Batman"", ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", ""The Rocketeer"" etc. so why not have another DC superhero shown the spotlight and given his own TV show ""The Flash"" was a good choice.<br/><br/>This show really had a lot going for it which I don't say for a lot of live action comic book adaptations shows, as most of them don't always have the same staying power as the source material I read, as some of them don't always meet certain expectations I hold. This show is one of those cases where it does meet my expectations or at least comes close which is all I can really ask for a live action adaptation or any TV show in general.<br/><br/>The production value is impressive, I felt this was one of the prime examples of not just doing a live action comic book adaption right but also any TV show right when you put effort or extra effort for that manner, it really showed that the creators truly cared about what their creating. I really love the look of Central City as it's goes for a sort of art deco look which is like the one in the film ""Batman"". I like that here we see a sort of alternate America where it looks like the present but there is a mix of some of the 1920-40 America as you see certain car models that could be at a car museum or convention, as we as certain things people where, let alone weapons where in some episodes some criminals are shooting Tommy guns. Certain mural art that you would see along with some vibrant colorful lighting in places. It also gives the show a noir quality, showing as color and fascinating a place it is, it's also a dark world that has danger hiding in every shadow.<br/><br/>I really like the running effects, they really give out the illusion of super speed well. Despite the effects in the 2015 version of ""The Flash"" I still like the first effect a lot better as it's a little more practical, cinematography is very good as well as we sometimes get his view point. I remember watching those sequences as a kid I would sometimes pretend I'm running at super speed that shot was that cool made you feel like you the viewer were ""The Flash"". Some of the things he does with the super speed are cool and would be very handy, like the little thing of being able to read a book at super speed, yeah wish I could read that fast get more books done that way. But I also like the Red color and multiple movement visual effects, but best of all that sound of super speed which is just music to my ears. Even like the design of the costume as it really looks like it came straight off the comics and I wouldn't want it any other way.<br/><br/>The music in the show is also great as it's done by one of my favorite composers Danny Elfman, whom in the 90's was just on a roll. This show has one of favorite theme songs and super hero themes I've ever heard which I feel is something that is sorely missing in most comic book TV shows and movies; this song just signifies ""The Flash"" just as the themes for ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" signify their heroes.<br/><br/>John Wesley Shipp is great as the Flash he is the Flash much as Christopher Reeve is ""Superman"", Peter Weller is ""Robocop"", and Karl Urban is ""Judge Dredd"", really like the look of the actor as he kind of looks like Bruce Campbell but isn't, defiantly has the same chin (Bruce Campbell as a DC verse character that would have been something). He just fits like a glove in this role, sure there have a been a couple of other live action versions (Grant Justin is my second favorite version) but this is my favorite version as he is the first and still the best in my book. He's a likeable guy that is a CSI detective by day and superhero by night which I like that concept of being a hero in both the day and night time. Has reserved charisma out of the suit but also sharp charisma with the suit.<br/><br/>Really love that he's really smart which to me is ""The Flash's"" true strength showing that even with all the super powers and abilities human intelligence is still the best weapon. But also I like how he reacts in coping with having the power along with dealing with the supervillain that come to town, it feels like how any other person would react; yeah I'd think if I ever saw anyone dressed up like ""The Trickster"" I'd think their off the rails or have taken cosplay too far. Or if I at first had the same powers as ""The Flash"" I'd be a little scared but also amazed at the same time.<br/><br/>Other supporting characters are solid like Julio (Alex Desert) Barry's best friend he's a helpful character but also really like how he's concern for both Barry's social life and well-being; in a way he's sort of the equivalent of Cisco from the 2015 version sort of.<br/><br/>Another is Tina played well by Amanda Pays another underrated actress, I really like how she is Barry's number two as both help each other understand how to control and even push the power past their extent. I like how she helps provide intelligence but also scientific knowledge into whatever situation their dealing with which is very useful, and sometimes even gadgets for the Flash for him to get ahead of his enemies. Also, possible would be significant other had the show gone on longer.<br/><br/>Megan Lockhart (Joyce Hyser) despite only in a few episode I also like as she is hot with persona to boot, she's a sharp private detective that can hold her own against danger, she's also is a bit of a significant other to Barry; I can't help but think this should have been Iris West some of the characteristics were there; yeah we did have an Iris but she was only in the pilot and that version didn't really feel like Iris to me, so if you watch this show you can always pretend this character is Iris if you want. Fun fact most of the cast in this show showed up in the 2015 version of ""The Flash"".<br/><br/>Most importantly the action and story. The action is good, as it's well choregraphed and really look and feel like comic book battles and action come to life. I like that it's not just all fisticuffs but also a battle of wits as there is science involved.<br/><br/>The story is pretty good, some of the stories were written by late great comic book writer Howard Chaykin. Despite serious it's also slightly humorous, the show knows how to have fun with itself but also knows when the comedy ends. I like how in the show they incorporate most of the famous rogues from the series which I feel is something sorely missing in most comic book shows including the 2015 version.<br/><br/>My favorite rogue and the one that truly stands out for me is The Trickster played well by Mark Hamell. Mark was just a blast in the role, I can tell he was having fun doing it; in a way this was a dry run for him as this was a couple of years before he got to play his most famous voice acting role as ""The Joker"" in ""Batman the Animated Series"" along with the ""Batman Arkham"" video game trilogy. I really like how he is both funny but also very menacing at the same time due to his unpredictable psychotic nature. He's a worthy foe for the Flash as he is true to his name but also with is persona can flip on a dime at any moment which makes it all the trickier to anticipate his next move.<br/><br/>It sucks that this show didn't get any extra millage and track, it really disappointed me as a kid when we didn't get another season there really was so much more that could have been done. Even if they couldn't get another season, he could of came straight to the silver screen which would have been awesome, DC in the 90's could have had two successful film franchise ""Batman"" and ""The Flash"" side by side, sadly they passed up the opportunity. It would be awesome if DC Comics did a comic series based on this 90's tv series, I see no reason this shouldn't happen they've already done ""Batman 66"" and ""Wonder Woman 74"" so why not ""Flash 90"" it's a thought anyway.<br/><br/>This is a vintage live action comic book classic worth rushing to, as it's got plenty of mileage for fun.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars",3 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,13 February 2019
2532,The Flash, Good old days,"At the beginning of the second season, new Flash started to bore me. I don't want to give up on it just yet, but I decided to pause for a while by going back to a show of my childhood, ""The Flash"" from 1990. When I was in elementary school I thought this was awesome. Now... The show is outdated in every aspect, but although the story is much simpler than in the new one and effects are more primitive, old Flash has that nostalgic charm of '80s B production and comic-book atmosphere. Although the new one is objectively better, the old Flash I love much more.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Plots are completely different. Beside a few names and the fact that Flash is a speedster who fights crime, they have almost nothing in common. The way Barry becomes Flash is completely different and ""same"" characters have completely different characteristics and mutual relationships. While in the new Flash Iris is a black journalist and his adopted sister in whom he is secretly in love, in old one she is a white artist and the girl who leaves him. The new Flash is based on his father being convicted for the murder of his mother and Flash trying to find a way to free him and punish the real murderer, but in the old Flash both of his parents are alive and well and he has cop brother who dies. From base to details these two shows are completely different. I have no idea which version is adapted from the comics, if any, but in my opinion, the plot of the new Flash is too complicated and in combination with modern technology, effects and production it totally lacks the soul of comic-book.<br/><br/>7,5/10<br/><br/>As I watch more episodes I like this more and more and I have less and less will to ever finish the new version. I just realized that the same actor plays Flash in the old and Flashes father in the new show. Beside John Wesley Shipp, at least four other actors appear in both shows. Amanda Pays, who plays the leading female role in the old Flash, role divided to Wells and Caitlin in the new version, 25 years later reappears in the same role. Alex Desert, whose role in the old version is the closest thing to Cisco from the new one, also reprises his role in a few episodes of the new Flash, same as Vito D'Ambrosio as Mayor Bellows and Luke Skywalker as Trickster. In the old version Barry became Flash after he was hit by lightning, so he's the only meta-human there, while villains are mad, genius and backed up with some serious technology, but still just humans. Bunch of meta-humans makes the new Flash nothing special and the new show seems like a better produced version of ""Power Rangers"", full of monsters and empty action. Stupid and boring. The old show is more down to earth, more realistic, with more convincing situations and relationships and a decent dose of healthy humor. It has a much better atmosphere and I have to improve its rating once again.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>I finished the first and only season and I'm sorry that there's no more. But it may be a good thing, because they would probably spoil it in time. I collected impressions and, although it is very far from being one of the best shows of all time (maybe strong seven), in my opinion, this is the perfect example of how comic-book adaptation should look like. Shoulder to shoulder with Batman from the previous year, within the genre I rate it a perfect ten.<br/><br/>8,5/10",3 out of 7 found this helpful.,8.0,5 September 2017
2533,The Flash, Not even laughable!,"If you're going to have a show populated entirely by one-dimensional characters (at best), and spoken in overused clichés, I suppose the only way to do it is to for the cast not to act.<br/><br/>I saw the episode that came with the Smallville DVD, and struggled to get through it. I thought it would be a fun evening, sitting back and watching the series based on the movie of 1990. I own the movie. I enjoy it. It has the right level of campiness.<br/><br/>But this episode of the series tried, like so many products of the late '80s/early '90s, to tackle issues such as homelessness and genetic engineering. And, like most of these products, it came across as jumping on board the cliché bandwagon. On top of that, characters spout lines comic books wouldn't print, with no emotion or sense of what they were saying. Perhaps I can't fault the cast; they had nothing to work with.<br/><br/>At least it drags on.",5 out of 15 found this helpful.,,26 September 2005
2534,The Flash," What killed ""The Flash""?","Many here have already given many of the reasons for the series only lasting the one season. To summarize: 1. Too expensive to produce (more on this later, as this could very easily have been fixed, even at the time before affordable CGI, and indeed this is the point of my Comment). I seem to recall that it was one of the most expensive series (on a per-episode basis) ever on TV up to that time, rivaled only by the original ""Battlestar: Galactica,"" and much of that (in both cases) was the SFX budget.<br/><br/>2. Bounced around the schedule, often unannounced, sometimes at the last minute. Of COURSE people can't watch it if they can't FIND it! There were no TiVos or auto-updating Internet versions of the TV Guide back then, either.<br/><br/>3. Lousy timing and luck, historically speaking. Pre-empted several times by Gulf War I news. Not quite as bad as the news-related bad luck that afflicted the earlier superhero series ""The Greatest American Hero,"" whose main protagonist had the same last name as the man who, while the series was still airing, became notorious for shooting then-President Ronald Reagan.<br/><br/>4. Inconsistent use of comic book elements. It seemed that the network execs couldn't make up their minds over whether the Flash should battle ordinary criminals or bring in some of his Rogues' Gallery from the comics (The Silver-Age ""Barry Allen"" Flash has arguably THE single richest Rogues' Gallery of ANY hero in the history of comics!). We did see Captain Cold, The Trickster (who was portrayed more like The Joker, and in fact Mark Hamill's portrayal of The Trickster is very likely what convinced WB animation to use him as the voice of The Joker in the outstanding animated Batman series and spin-offs from the mid 1990s up to and including the ""Justice League"" animated series of the early 2000s), and Mirror Master. We also saw a kinda-sorta ""Reverse-Flash"" (a clone of Barry on the TV series).<br/><br/>But other excellent Rogues' Gallery members were ignored entirely. One in particular, one of the greatest, Gorilla Grodd, was mentioned off-handedly by the stoolie whom we often saw, in the episode ""Deadly Nightshade"" (in which the Golden Age Central City hero ""The Nightshade"" {note to an earlier commenter: NOT ""The Prowler""!} came out of retirement and worked with The Flash to help hunt down a new, murderous vigilante who was using the Nightshade's name and costume to kill criminals), as a HUMAN gang-lord ""up in Helltown."" Presumably, he was big and tough, perhaps built somewhat like a gorilla, so ""Gorilla Grodd"" was just his mobster nickname.<br/><br/>That angered me to no end. I realized that doing a real GORILLA Grodd would be difficult and expensive for the special effects of the time, and that a TV audience wouldn't likely accept the concept of a hidden city of sapient apes in Africa, but I didn't consider that good enough reason to just write the character off like that! So, shortly after the series ended, I wrote a fanfic episode (available on the Internet if anyone's interested) which introduced a version of Grodd that would (A) be cheaper to use in an episode, and (B) had an origin that was more palatable to an adult TV-watching audience -- I even tied Grodd into the series continuity so tightly that his existence explains many of the continuity problems with the series itself (such as how come Dr. McGee knew so much about how to treat Barry Allen in the pilot, saving his life from the effects of his altered, rampant metabolism).<br/><br/>Anyway, back to #1: I said that the effects budget could easily have been fixed, and it could have, right from the git-go. You see, back when the series was announced, the producers received an offer from Mike Jittlov (http://www.wizworld.com), a special effects wizard of the time who had earlier produced a music video (later expanded into a feature film of the same name, about the making of the video) called ""The Wizard of Speed and Time"" which had special effects WAAAAY better than were on ""The Flash"" TV series, and which were WAY CHEAPER to do! Indeed, he did most of them IN THE CAMERA! He NEVER used a computer or other such gear! But, the IDIOT PRODUCERS TURNED DOWN HIS OFFER to do the SFX for the series! He was even willing to do it for SCALE!",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,,28 March 2005

The absurd happenings actually take place--in reality.<br/><br/>It does not take long to fall into the imaginative world of ""Man Seeking Woman"". Now, after four episodes, I am happily ensconced in Josh's (Jay Baruchel) wacky world.<br/><br/>Initially, the action revolves around Josh's attempts to find success on the social scene after breaking up with his girlfriend. He is totally inept, but he keeps trying. His best friend Mike (Eric Andre) is little help because he is a playa and a user (of women).<br/><br/>The story lines feel like an extended SNL skit--a good skit. I recommend the show, but be warned that it is edgy and definitely not PC.<br/><br/>Update 2/13/15: After the ""cupid"" episode guest starring Minka Kelly, I am upgrading my vote to an 8. The humor is consistent and, well, badass.<br/><br/>Update 3/14/16: I am increasing my grade to 9, because this show is consistently funny episode to episode like only the best comedy shows of all time. A wonderful blend of creativity and imagination.",30 out of 50 found this helpful.,9.0,5 February 2015
2545,Man Seeking Woman, Smart Shmart... Get over yourself haters,"I had to review this show after all the bashing...<br/><br/>Man Seeking Woman is a quirky, imaginative show. Derived from the hip young mind of former SNL writer Simon Rich. For those who don't 'get it', I think it would help to think of it as a sketch comedy show. This show would actually benefit from the main character setting up the situations for the viewer. Not that I want that, I love the show the way it is. Casting has been great so far, cameos aplenty (Bill Hader... ""Uh-oh"") I hope more people give it a chance. As we've seen before, shows can become more appealing and entertaining as they progress. It is a Fantasy Love Story with a massive dose of Sci-Fi. Think of Princess Bride mixed with Spaceballs. With Jay Baruchel and the amazing Vanessa Bayer! I love it, and can't wait to see them all! I recommend this to anyone who has ever been in a relationship... THAT MEANS YOU!",26 out of 43 found this helpful.,10.0,22 January 2015
2546,Man Seeking Woman, Weird yet funny.,This show is absolutely one of the stupidest things I have ever seen yet it is incredibly funny and insightful. It's not just a brain dead spoof show. The creators have put a lot of thought into the concept and execution. The cast included. <br/><br/>It may seem a little extreme but who hasn't faced some of these emotions and felt that their world was going to end. People naturally have a tendency to overreact. All they have done is turned it into a literal representation. Each episode I find myself relating to his angst and uncertainty. It's ridiculous but comically realistic.<br/><br/>And don't be confused into thinking it's a laugh riot as the humour is more intelligent than that. It won't be for everyone but everyone should be able to relate.,14 out of 21 found this helpful.,7.0,29 January 2016

The actors are amazing, I really love the faces of every on of them, the ideas are very funny and the way of presenting the oldest problem of life is so refreshing (as I heard many people say about the show before me). I recommend ""Man seeking Woman"" especially to people going through a break-up. This series understands you like only a very good friend does. Especially the last episode of the first season makes everything kind of okay. Another thing worth mentioning is the awesome intro with a soundtrack by Photay, which makes me dance every time I hear it. Thumbs up!

Jay's character is as fragile as a dumped person really is with his over the top, bad adviser best friend who supports him but at the same time boycotts his every move. <br/><br/>Open your mind when seeing this show as is not the typical comedy.

Some of the ideas are so damn ludicrous you eventually get hooked to it.

I've read that the humor is intelligent and people won't get it. Myself I find that its mostly whining and first world problems. The jokes are common but told in a creative form, like the joke about not wanting to introduce your mom to your love interest. Finished maybe four episodes trying to find a new show to binge watch, but I can't even with this, unfortunately. Whenever it comes to Netflix I'll probably give it another shot.

I was hooked after the first episode &amp; have watched it to the end again. I'm sad that the show has ended but it is about finding love &amp; the right person for you. I am also a huge fan of Jay. We've all been there before &amp; it does hurt someone, either you or the other person. This show was amazing because everything you've felt after being dumped or dumping someone was taking to the extreme at times but who hasn't been through this?! Especially deleting your ex's number or walking up to someone &amp; straight up ask them out, only to be rejected almost every time. That alone takes ball's &amp; it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. At some point through this show, you'll be able to relate to more than one of these situations. I hate to see it end but I'm happy for how they ended it! There's going to be times when you think wow really sex with a car??! But at the same time you're laughing &amp; thinking hey that could be so n so my crazy ex, especially when she drives through his place. I'd say give it a try before you listen to the hater's out there! This was I think my 3rd time watching it from start to finish. Still laughed, cryed, cringed at times it's still laughed through it all for the most part anyway. I couldn't laugh when Josh was in pain, I felt his suffering &amp; related to it a time or two.

2554,Man Seeking Woman," Bizarre, genre bending rom-com","Man Seeking Woman intuitively grasps the high-drama narrative stakes felt by people falling in love, and the show's genre flirtations are great at conveying the way that experience feels. The show beautifully captures how two people in a relationship construct an imaginative world together, becoming the heroes of a private mythology. In a new relationship, mundane activities can take on an epic dimension: For instance, the site of your first date might turn into a sacred space, a landmark in your mental map of the world. The show has evolved with each season, beginning as just a series of one-off dates for Josh before focusing in on a single crush throughout Season 2 (which also caused tension with his best friend, played by Eric André). In Season 3, however, Man Seeking Woman gives Josh a stable, serious relationship with Lucy (Katie Findlay), who finally seems like the girl meant for him, and vice versa. Through this, the show morphs again to focus on jokes surrounding relationships and being in a couple, and does so with the same amount of wit, insight, and bizarre twists as it did in prior seasons.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,11 February 2017
2555,Man Seeking Woman," Surreal, hilarious and a bit profane","Just what TV needs--a smart, wild and outrageous (in a good way) comedy with bizarre happenings and plot points that are unexpected. If you haven't seen it--start with episode 1 or 2 and get acquainted. I loved each episode except ""Wedding in Hell,"" as it fell flat toward the end of the show. Otherwise, Jay Baruchel, who was excellent in ""Nick &amp; Nora's Ultimate Playlist"" and ""Tropic Thunder,"" not to mention ""This is the End,"" continues to amaze with his slacker downbeat no girlfriend life. As his sidekick, Eric Andre is a rare find. I can not recommend this series too highly. Production values and CGI are great as well.

But it takes some adjusting to it.. You might get offended here and there.. wandering if they didn't took it too far. This is why, it's better to watch in a company. Also, watching it alone might make you miss a thing or two while laughing or simply because too much is going on.<br/><br/>For my personal taste: It would be much, much better if less time would be given to special effects and more effort to dialog's and characters to evolve. But then it wouldn't be what it is now.<br/><br/>I like the not so subtle critique of modern society..

More and more talents like Jay Baruchel are making a waves by creating content that makes fun of our society's convoluted idea of ""success"". <br/><br/>It's almost poetic that the stiffs over at SNL decided to take a shot at Man Seeking Woman.

The difference from all other ROMCOMs out there is the surrealistic approach that involves dating a ...troll, time travel and other gimmicks that are to (or NOT to) be seen.<br/><br/>The Pilot features a disgusting troll puppet who eats garbage and tries to eat the hand of the protagonist. The 2 minutes sequence with the troll at the beginning of the 1st episode is repulsive and unfunny and stigmatized the series for me.<br/><br/>I usually like ROMCOMs. I even rooted for some recent ones like ""A to Z"", ""Marry Me"", ""Selfie"" (now canceled), ""Manhattan Love Story"" (also canceled).<br/><br/>This one however looks and feels terrible and I will probably skip the remaining episodes.<br/><br/>Also, while the breakup is definitive, I see that the Asian ex-girlfriend is credited in the entire season (10 episodes) meaning that there will be many sad or awkward moments while he will try to get her back.<br/><br/>Anyway.

I'm also a City University of New York Campus Peace Officer and find the show to successfully incorporate real issues within each episode, such as relationship situations (between the officers of the various departments), personal issues like child care concerns, marital problems, etc., as well as most of the official procedures which the uniformed Officers (Police, Fire &amp; Emergency Medical Technicians) utilize in the performance of their duties. The portrayals of the characters by the cast is wonderful, as they succeed in bringing each character to 3 dimensional life! You get the feeling that these are real folks you could actually run into while walking down a New York City street. (Yes, all their performances are that good!!) The action in the show is great, combining the perfect amount of gritty realism and excitement with (at times), a dash of humor.

The actors (besides Eddie and Michael Beach) I never knew of so it wasn't any big names but they pulled themselves as this group and it was never amateur. <br/><br/>The first season I liked and it did have a premise about how they all fit into the premise of the story, and I saw they changed in the second season where they formatted into taking 1 character each week and the story revolved around that character for the week so whatever character that wasn't focused always had something coming up. But it has become more of a show that I was surprised that lasted longer than I thought. Thank you NBC to keep this show because as they changed a lot of time slots I thought maybe this might be the last season (i.e. ""Monday Night Football"", ""Everybody Loves Raymond"", ""Ally McBeal"" (which it turned out to be the one that didn't get renewed as it was their last season)and now possibly ""CSI Miami""). And besides its so good that 85% of the show is shot on location in NY that they have a lot of space to show it and despite what NY went through after 9/11. But only one thing I'm not over.

2581,Third Watch, Great show!,"One of my favorite series of all time. Too bad it was cancelled, i feltit had some more seasons left. The cheap shows etc stay... I have watched the series in full at least 2 times. Worth it! It felt realistic in every way and it brought up actual real life problems. The characters had depth and you got to see them in a work environment as in the private life of the people. It shows the hardships police, firefighters and paramedics have to deal with but also everything good that comes with it. I felt the ending was very sudden and much more was to be told about the lives of those people fighting for all of us day in and day out. It might be a fictionall show with fictional characters but according my dad who was a police officer it was very good and realistic.

Loved Faith, his partner, and Cruz who plays a great renegade character who u can't decide if u respect or hate with each episode!!

Now, I don't care what every girl thats going through puberty says about Boscoe leaving and they are not going to watch the show. Cry me a river even if Boscoe wasn't in the show and they had a different person playing the role of Boscoe the show would be good.

2585,Third Watch, DVDs,"I've often wondered why Third Watch is only on DVD in Asia, but I'm told by some connected friends it has to do with copyright and royalty issues with the music. Since Third Watch has mainstream music by big, established artists, they need to pay them more to use the music on DVD. Asia has more lax laws governing this. A good example of this is the Married... With Children DVDs. Notice the theme song ""Love and Marriage"" is replaced by some generic keyboard music? Other shows didn't have this problem, as there were fewer artists and songs used (Like Tour of Duty - Most in-show music was original scores, and the theme song ""Paint it Black"" was and always will be connected to Tour of Duty). Once they pay the artists, we'll get our DVDs. Oh, btw - Third Watch introduced this old rocker to The Crystal Method (Theme song Keep Hope Alive, also used in the Tomb Raider movies, but will ALWAYS be identified as the Third Watch theme. Best recording ever of this tune is on the Family Values Tour '99 CD, recorded live in Biloxi, Mississippi). I say ""NBC, pay the artists/labels/whoever the money, I guarantee you'll profit huge when you release the DVDs! Then, sell the show to a movie studio, and make a Third Watch feature film, using the cast from the final episode!""",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,23 May 2007
2586,Third Watch," A great show with exceptionally talented, underrated actors and actresses.","This is my favorite television show to watch, even though it ended its run over a year ago. I never watched the show during its run, and came across it one night when I couldn't sleep. After watching a few episodes over a few consecutive nights, I found myself liking the show and the characters, and began watching and taping the show on a regular basis. The characters are great. You really find yourself caring about them, and hated to see them hurt. The most endearing characters to me were Monte 'Doc' Parker, Faith Yokas, Ty Davis Jr., Bobby Caffey, Maurice 'Bosco' Boscorelli, Jimmy Doherty, and Kim Zambrano. The actors on the show are all exceptional as well. Coby Bell is my favorite actor from the show and is very underrated. He's an incredible actor. Molly Price is also extraordinarily talented, and yet she's not a household name. She's great. Michael Beach also, as Doc, was really good. The rest of the cast, also, was just impeccable. The writing on the show was some of the best I've seen on TV. The story lines were compelling and completely sucked you in for sixty minutes each episode. Then, you're left waiting on the edge of your seat for the next episode. The show had a devoted following, but was inexplicably cancelled by NBC in March of 2005. With the NBC network really struggling right now, they should really be kicking themselves for cancelling such a great show.

The cast chosen do an amazing job with their parts; Molly Price and Jason Wiles play off of each other spectacularly.

Most shows get caught up in the personal aspect, but this one focus more on their daily jobs; showing how they save people on a daily basis. The only downfall is that it can get exhausting after awhile with the fast pace of the show.

2590,Dead Like Me, Fabulous TV--It's a shame it was canceled,"For me, TV hit a golden age during the early-mid 80's. It's been a long time since I've been as moved by a television show as I was with Dead Like Me.<br/><br/>Dead Like Me features Ellen Muth, who plays an 18 year old kid who gets killed by a toilet seat from the space station MIR. Her death introduces us to the fascinating world of the Grim Reaper. Full of workplace rules, guidelines, assignments, and generally horrific deaths, Dead Like Me explores the subject of death in a very unusual, yet original way.<br/><br/>When George(Muth) becomes a reaper, her whole world as she knows it changes. She, and her group of reapers, lead by Rube(Mandy Patinkin), use a German waffle house as their base of operations, receiving post-it notes with the names and times of their reaps. Another sub-plot of the show centers around George's family, and the adjustment that they go through after George's death.<br/><br/>Throughout the two seasons(currently available on DVD), the viewer follows life through the eyes of George, and also though her quirky narration. We see George grow into a more confident young woman, and also witness the interactions amongst the various characters and their reaps.<br/><br/>This show is without a doubt one of the most interesting shows out there, and with any luck, Showtime will decide to re-visit this show. I watched for about two minutes and was hooked. I'm certain you'd enjoy this show, too.",169 out of 180 found this helpful.,,1 August 2005
2591,Dead Like Me, Witty and grim,"Although the Takers of souls that populate 'Dead Like me' prefer being called ""Reapers"" they are in fact Grim. Each Reaper has his/her own dark secret or painful memory from their life that they have to deal with in their After-life... <br/><br/>'Dead Like me' is a witty, funny, but realistic look at what it would be like if there was (or is) an afterlife. Mandy Patinkin stars as ""Rube"" the boss, wise but contemplated. Ellen Muth stars as ""Georgia"" a young teen who was killed by a toilet seat, she's having trouble adjusting. Jasmine Guy stars as ""Roxy"" the angry Meter Maid with a license in 'kick your ass'. Callum blue stars as ""Mason"" the druggy, he drilled a hole in his head just to feel high. Laura Harris stars as ""Daisy"" the town /cough, country, slut... ""i once blew (&lt;insert famous person's name here&gt;)<br/><br/>Other noticeable mentions go to Cynthia Stevenson who plays ""Joy Lass"" (oh the irony) who is the disgruntled mother who can't face her grief. Britt McKillip as ""Reggie"" the silent sister who misses her personal idol, Georgia, her sister. And Christine Willes who plays ""Dolores Herbig"" who is Georgia's boss at ""'Happy Time' Temp agency"", a lovable character, with a huge heart. <br/><br/>Brilliant writing, Funny but not over the top. Has plenty of drama, but doesn't breach the Series/soap opera boundary. For those who say ""Oh they just a spin off of 'Six feet under'"" you are wrong, 'Six Feet Under' is a Drama. 'Dead like me' is a Dark comedy. Believe me when i say they are on opposite sides of the tracks. <br/><br/>In my years of viewing gems that enchant my interest. Dead like me has struck a nerve. It shows you that live life while you can, (and other such cliché's) Or you might just miss it.<br/><br/>I give this show a 10 out of 10.",128 out of 139 found this helpful.,,24 July 2004
2592,Dead Like Me, my new favorite show,"It's hard for me to like much on TV. I was devastated when they pulled Keen Eddie, it was one of the best things I've ever seen on network TV. I feel better after watching this show. It's quirky, engaging, and humanizing. I particularly admire the upbeat take on death juxtaposed to the darkly comic view of life. Dead Like Me is the only reason I'll continue to pay for Showtime. Most studios are desperate to be fringe and edgy, neglecting to notice that (while audiences love novelty) we also want characters with flaws. I'm sick to death of the beautiful empty. The show helps to remind us of what we are neglecting to notice in everyday life, the mundane poetry of the collective order. George discovers the beauty of life only after she's dead. The character's are lovably eccentric, the dialogue is casually caustic. It's Gen-X genius.",124 out of 135 found this helpful.,,11 July 2004
2593,Dead Like Me, Not anything like six feet under,"After reading another comment about this show being a rip-off of six feet under I'd like to comment.<br/><br/>I've seen every episode of six feet under and consider myself an avid fan. The main differences are not hard to determine. <br/><br/>Six feet under is a show that centers around a dysfunctional family in the wake of their own tragedy.(Death of the father). The way the series has played out makes the fact that they own a funeral home unimportant. Great drama is always about the characters. Six feet under is no exception. There are various story arcs that play out over the course of each season. Some stories carry over to the next season to keep you watching. It is very original.<br/><br/>Dead like me on the other hand is a fresh perspective of how the human dead are handled in the grand scheme of things. The idea that there is an entire sub-culture of un-dead following orders to take care of the mundane task of reaping a soul and showing the dead folks the way to the other side is comical but also makes you wonder ""hmm... who's to say this doesn't occur? It also centers on Georgia Lass (freshly dead after a toilet seat from a de-orbiting space station takes her life)and how she handles the dubious distinction of becoming a reaper. Now in its second season, it again is focusing not on the occupation of those in the show, but the characters in the occupation of reaping. We are starting to get a glimps of the lives of Roxy, Rube, Daisy et al before they became reapers. I think Ellen Muth and Mandy Patankin are fantastic. I also like every last supporting character. It's superbly written and actually make you think about life in a different light. If you've not seen the show, at least give it a chance. Now if HBO came out with a show called ""Gay as Family"",(their version of Queer as folk) then I'd be screaming rip-off. Never forget Death happens to everyone eventually. There is surely room for more than one show that focuses on it.<br/><br/>Watch and be entertained,",209 out of 234 found this helpful.,,23 August 2004
2594,Dead Like Me, One of the most creative shows on television since Twin Peaks,"""Dead Like Me"" proves that cynicism, humor, depth, and even compassion can not only co-exist on a single television series, they can actually flourish together. With sharp and witty writing and directing, ""Dead Like Me"" explores the bizarre world of our working-class grim reapers, the good folks charged with escorting human souls to the afterlife. As the second-lowest level group of bureaucrats in the afterlife system (best not to ask about the lowest), grim reapers must trudge along ""popping"" the souls of the soon-to-be-departed before they meet their grisly (and, dare I say, often hilarious) ends. And they must also survive, and pay rent, in the living world.<br/><br/>The chief protagonist on the series is George (a.k.a. Georgia), a recently deceased, uber-cynical, 18 year old who just can't seem to resist rebelling against the whole ""death"" system. Her fellow reapers include an unapologetically opportunistic drug-smuggler, a meter-maid who does a lot more than write parking tickets, a happy-go-lucky pragmatist who has developed a truly macabre taste in photography, and an actress whose resume is surprisingly out of date. And then, of course, there is Rube.<br/><br/>Rube is the would-be foreman of this somewhat strange assemblage of reapers. He is also, arguably, the most sympathetic, complex, and mysterious character on the showâ'thanks in no small part to the superb acting of Mandy Patinkin. As with the other characters on the show, no amount of space here can really hint at the depth alloted to Rube by the writers and directors of ""Dead Like Me"" or the skill with which Patinkin explores that depth. Suffice it to say that Rube plays a lot more like a real person (or real undead person) than any mere television contrivance. Rube is more alive as a dead man than any television character from the living world.<br/><br/>The very essence of ""Dead Like Me"" is, in fact, its willingness to explore not only the bizarre world of the reapers, but also the lives and personalities of the reapers themselves. Undead life has had (and continues to have) some pretty strange effects on these formerly-living reapers, and watching their individual responses to the problems of their bizarre occupation provides much of the humor of the show.<br/><br/>And, not to leave out the living world, the creative minds behind ""Dead Like Me,"" also frequently turn their attention to living characters on the show, from the ""soon to be referred to the past tense"" reaper clients to the families they leave behind (most notably George's grieving family). Just about any character is subject to being fleshed-out on this show (even dogs and frogs). A minor character named Angus Cook makes a more memorable impression in one episode of ""Dead Like Me"" (appropriately titled ""A. Cook"") than most TV series regulars will make in an entire season.<br/><br/>Some have compared ""Dead Like Me"" with shows like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and similar, more pedestrian, fare. But about the only thing Buffy and George have in common is youth and blonde hair. And the only thing the reapers have in common with television vampires is that they've both been around a while. Of course, one of the problems with television vampires is that they never seem to *realize* they've been around a while. They are also generally kind enough to join up with either the ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" teams of the Buffyverse and its ilk, teams which don't exist in the universe of ""Dead Like Me.""<br/><br/>But you might want to visit the universe of ""Dead Like Me"" for yourself, and form your own impressions. Just don't stay too long. You might end up with a post-it note and a new job.",124 out of 137 found this helpful.,,16 June 2004
2595,Dead Like Me, My place is in front of the TV every Sunday night to WATCH!,"Finally a show I can watch and get interested in. Dead Like Me continues to intrigue me through great acting and well written scripts. The whole reaper thing seems to be a sub culture; go to the message boards. There are back and forth discussions about minute details, as if the reapers are real. They aren't, but one can still empathise with these ""dead"" people. As each reaper grows through life situations (usually sticky) the viewer grows to like each character even more. <br/><br/>Mandy Pantinkin adds a wonderful balance to the whole cast. His character Rube fascinates me. He is secretive, yet he opens himself to emotional attachments with the reapers he ""manages."" Each of the reapers have their weaknesses and strengths, but like the viewer, they discover them through the crazy situations they find themselves in. <br/><br/>Its on late Sunday night, I'm on the West Coast, but I don't care because the show is the highlight of my Weekend TV viewing.

2596,Dead Like Me," Completely wonderful, Alive","This show is easily one of my favorites. Ellen Muth's interpretation of the disaffected, cynical teenager who is forced into sticking to a higher standard is right on. The writers have produced some of the funniest comedy, especially where George's boss Dolores is concerned; a former junkie who has taken home drifters (""passionate lovers"", she calls them), who gives no thought to using a Tazer on a courier at the elevator in order to get her incontinent cat to the vet. The dialogue is funny, and hearing what's going on inside George's head while she puts on a smile is more than a little amusing. The show still visits the serious side of things, showing how the Lasses lost a daughter, while George has lost her whole family. Little by little, the audience is fed bits and pieces of information about the lives and deaths of the main characters. Most mysterious is Rube. He has a love-hate relationship with the unseen being who delivers the death lists, and we know only that he had a daughter, and that he attempted to send money to someone named Rosie and her mother back in the 1920's. (The postal service failed to deliver it,unknown to him until 2004.) We can only wait to find out how everyone's lives -and deaths- have played out. This show is absolutely nothing like Six Feet Under, for which I am grateful.",80 out of 88 found this helpful.,,12 September 2004
2597,Dead Like Me, Sheer brilliance,"Dead Like Me is one of those unique TV series that will be remembered long after ""flavors of the day"" shows like The Sopranos are forgotten. It is bright and dark, hilarious and sad, awe-inspiring and introspective -- all at the same time. It is a wonderful piece of television.<br/><br/>I recently saw the season one DVD set and I must say this show is a marvel. Although it took me a few episodes to warm up to Ellen Muth as George the slacker grim reaper, the show was easily carried by old pro Mandy Patinkin as food-loving reaper Rube and his co-stars, including the gorgeous Rebecca Gayheart who makes a welcome - though all to brief - return to TV after coming off her own real-life tragedy which rivals anything seen on Dead Like Me. I won't rehash the details or the debate -- go look up her IMDb biography if you need more information.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is outstanding, including Jasmine Guy - much older and wiser than her Different World days - Callum Blue and latecomer Laura Harris as George's fellow grim reapers. Harris, as wannabe actress Daisy, starts out annoying but very quickly develops layers that make her among the show's most interesting characters.<br/><br/>The format of the show is fascinating as there are two arcs going at the same time: George adjusting to the afterlife, and her family slowly falling apart because of her death. Central to this is George's kid sister Reggie, played by newcomer Britt McKillip. It probably isn't considered kosher to refer to an 11-year-old as beautiful unless you're a parent, but keep an eye on this one as she is going to develop into a spectacular talent.<br/><br/>Of course, a supporting cast means nothing without a strong lead, and Ellen Muth more than delivers. As I said above, she took a little getting used to, with her unconventional looks and a performance that gives ""quirky"" a whole new twist. It wasn't long before Muth truly owned the show and the character, and her narration is hilarious and touching throughout.<br/><br/>There were a few minor missteps in the show's first year. For some reason it was decided to do a flashback/clips episode at the 3/4 mark of the season. I will admit that the episode is fantastic and actually one of my favorites, but it might have been stronger without the flashbacks. Such things might be necessary when you're trying to create a jumping on point for an arc, but this isn't the case with Dead Like Me -- and the first season was only 14 episodes long; too short to need a recap.<br/><br/>The other problem I have with the show is the apparent use of the ""Reset button"" between most episodes. The events of one episode do not necessarily carry over into the next. This is very apparent as George appears to forget certain lessons learned in the previous episode on occasion. This is probably a minor quibble as this might not be so apparent if you watch the show in weekly chunks rather than all at once.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Dead Like Me is the first made-for-cable series I have seen that integrates adult language and sex (though the latter is relatively minor) in a way that is not jarring. This is not a kid's show, but I wouldn't have a problem letting a teenager see it.<br/><br/>Dead Like Me is easily the best series of the 2003-2004 television season, with Wonderfalls -- created by the same man -- in a very close 2nd place though it only aired 4 episodes. Dead Like Me deserves all the Emmys it can get.",157 out of 195 found this helpful.,,23 June 2004

Actually, this program deals more with life and how to live while you're alive than with death. The deaths are always wildly improbable, but then again, if you watch the news people die in weird ways every day. The music is appropriately atmospheric and thoughtful.

It's the best role I've ever seen him do. He was born to play this part. (Possible spoiler)** I love his comments on the afterlife, e.g. ""I don't see Della Reese at this table"".

She conveys the frustration of being given a job that you do not want to do but have no choice in the matter. He does not - quite rightly - totally fill the role of Father figure but has a tenderness toward her that grows.<br/><br/>Cynthia Stevenson as the mum was an inspired choice &amp; I thought the scenes between her and Britt McKillip as the younger daughter sparked. The child who was almost better prepared or better able to cope than the adult to deal with grief. <br/><br/>Greg Kean conveyed the tiredness and regret of his character with such empathy. The husband and wife of twenty years dealing with such loss and finding out where their relationship has gone was touching.<br/><br/>I would have wished that Rebecca Gayheart's character had lasted longer but Laura Harris sold me the moment she came. The chemistry between her and Callum Blue was so good that you rooted for them to get together.<br/><br/>Christine Willes was just a delight as Millie's boss and for me the star of the office was Crystal. Always in the background but the force to be reckoned with and such fun was had with her character.<br/><br/>The individual stories and the overall arc was set that I think had season three come it would have been the best one. I have so many questions and I'm hoping the DVD will answer some of them.<br/><br/>I miss the cynical voice over of Ellen Muth's character. It's entertainment I know but it's helped me deal with the subject of death and loss.

2603,Dead Like Me, A Ubiquitous Success,"Dead Like Me is one of those pop culture phenomena that while not a all-out success in its first run, proved ubiquitous, influencing pop culture in many different ways.<br/><br/>The concept of the show made a vague reference to Six Feet Under, and other predecessors, but was original; its take on death and the hereafter, and the way this was visualized was remarkable. The show was not a great success, surviving only a few seasons, but has gone on to prove incredibly influential.<br/><br/>Imitations of Dead Like Me's theme music, fashions, special effects, etc, have since appeared everywhere. And while one could argue that Dead Like Me drew some concepts from Six Feet Under, one could not claim that Medium and Ghost Whisperer were not created primarily to exploit the buzz created by Dead Like Me.<br/><br/>The Dead Like Me phenomena is extremely unique in America, for, while the entertainment industries of the UK, Australia, and certainly Canada, are OK with a singer, film or TV show going sub-culture, the American entertainment industry is more pragmatic, and wants to see the money roll in ASAP.

For those who have not discovered this gem, imagine a cross between ""Tru Calling"" and ""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" that pushes the envelope of irreverence about as much as ""The Family Guy"". Then imagine that behind all the surface irreverence is a transcendent reverence for the human condition. If that level of complexity appeals to you, ""Dead Like Me"" is something you should immediately track down.<br/><br/>I was permanently hooked by the conclusion of the ""Pilot"" episode when the resolution did not take the traditional happy path. Instead of being able to intervene and change the destiny of the little girl, George (Ellen Muth) is forced to do her job as a reaper. They go out to the strains of ""Que Sera Sera"", normally very corny but here very ironic. The song was originally written for Hitchcock's ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"", a film about parents trying rescue their child which has parallels to what George is attempting and on another level the little girl is symbolic of George. And the song's lyrics are a perfect fit for the ""randomness of life"" theme of ""Dead Like Men"". <br/><br/>Each episode has subtle details like this, which may require repeated viewings just to uncover elements that you missed initially. I recommended purchasing a DVD of each season just to have the flexibility to watch several times at your convenience. <br/><br/>""Dead Like Me,"" has the mark of writers who aren't thinking about audience reaction or how the Showtime executives will relate to it. The story just pours out with a lot of verve, wit, and audacity.<br/><br/>Any series that focuses on a teenager killed by a falling toilet seat from the space station Mir has something going for it. George is sometimes called Miss Toilet Seat. She is assigned to Rube (Mandy Patinkin from ""Chicago Hope""), who is kind of a platoon sergeant for a small group of ""not always grim"" reapers (soul collectors) who meet in a German Waffle House (listen for the occasional yodeling in the background). <br/><br/>The story is told from the point of view of 18-year-old jaded slacker Georgia ""George"" Lass (Muth), whose voice-over commentary sometimes contradicts what is happening on the screen. Her intelligence and advanced maturity give a world-weary ""whatever"" to the endless bizarre situations she must deal with; ""it looks like death was just my wake-up call"". <br/><br/>There is a running side story about the family George left behind. Her grieving unhappy mother Joy (Cynthia Stevenson), her professor father, Clancy (Greg Kean), and her sister Reggie (Britt McKillip) who collects toilet seats and may remind you of Dawn Weiner.<br/><br/>The reapers might technically be the undead but they interact with the living 24-7; although in a different body than they had when they were alive. There is no pay but they need a place to stay and food to eat so they get day jobs or relieve the dead of their spare cash. They even have pets; George keeps Mr. Blinky, the little girl's frog from the pilot episode. <br/><br/>Rube gives each reaper a yellow sticky note with a name, address, and an ETD; it's up to the reaper to collect the soul-ideally just before the actual death, and guide them to the next life. Reapers don't know why they got the job or how long they will be performing it; they accept it because it affords them the opportunity to continue to experience the things they liked and disliked about living; and they are not ready to give these up.<br/><br/>As a series ""Dead Like Me"" establishes a complex and consistent set of rules that viewers embrace. The writers are good about playing within this set of constraints and not cheating when they feel lazy or it is otherwise convenient. <br/><br/>Humor of various kinds is the predominant emotion but things often get serious and philosophical in a believable and intelligent fashion. <br/><br/>""When I was just a little girl I asked my mother what will I be? Will I be pretty? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me. <br/><br/>Que sera, sera. Whatever will be, will be. The future's not ours to see. Que sera, sera... ""<br/><br/>Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,7 September 2007
2606,Dead Like Me, Brilliant Writing and Great Class,"It is such a shame that this show has been cancelled. I had been looking forward to the next season but I guess that won't happen! This show was so brilliantly written and the cast was perfectly picked. The premise of the show is so unusual you just had to watch. I was ended up thinking at the end of every episode. It left you wanting more and left you searching your own soul.<br/><br/>What gets me the most about this show is the way death is looked at. It is such a unique process.

A distinct ""What Next"" anticipation.<br/><br/>It had begun to discover its' true foundations in the realm of the ""Meaning of Life"". The characters and their backgrounds were completed and it appeared that the overall story arc was beginning to grow.<br/><br/>I never would have seen it, except for a chance viewing of the repeats on the SciFi channel. I then went and purchased the series on DVD and became engrossed by it.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,20 March 2007
2608,Dead Like Me, My new favorite TV show.,"Ever get the feeling that something you're watching was made just for you? Where the overall tone, the humor, the drama, the characters and the stories all click right away and never lose any of their magic? It just fits your own personal definition of TV greatness like a glove? For this reviewer, that show was Dead Like Me.<br/><br/>The show won me over from the opening voice over in the pilot where Georgia Lass introduces herself, ""That's me. I'd say I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm not. I excel at not giving a s---!"" Ellen Muth brings a kind of cheerful pride to George's cynicism, giving her voice over narrations a lightheartedness that keeps it fun. Even later on when the character explores her emotional side there's usually a wise-crack waiting to bring her from going completely melodramatic (usually, but not always.) <br/><br/>Muth has a very expressive face (and an entire array of the funniest ""WTF?!"" expressions I've ever seen) complimented with dead on timing. Half the fun of Dead Like Me lay in watching George react to the increasingly bizarre world around her. Especially in scenes she shares with Christine Willes who plays Delores Herbig (aka the boss from hell  not that Delores is cruel and mean  just  indescribably weird and freaky and upbeat and she goes on about her cat and she tells you things you don't need to know and Ugh! Make it stop! The whole dying and becoming undead to reap the souls of the living thing? Yeah, that's normal juxtaposed to Delores Herbig.) <br/><br/>Which brings me to the rest of the Grim Reapers: Mason (Callum Blue), the perpetual screw up forever in over his head with every possible sin he can commit in his afterlife. Roxy (Jasmine Guy), the no-nonsense, kick-ass, counterweight to the chaos that is Mason. Daisy, Daisy Adair (Laura Harris), the aspiring extra from Gone With the Wind with stories about every actor from the golden age of cinema. And lastly, Betty (Rebecca Gayheart), the free spirit from Season 1.<br/><br/>The great Mandy Patinkin leads the pack as Rube, a character that walks dangerously close to disastrous clichés. The foreman of the group, kind-of a father figure, to keep the Reapers in line, and someone for George to rebel against early in season 1. But Mandy Patinkin infuses the part with a sense of real-world honesty  the employer who never forgot his origins. Even when he reprimands George for her rebellions or the screw-ups of Mason with words that very easily can be taken as condescending, his delivery carries a subtext of wisdom and sincerity as though he knows this is the only way to get through to these stubborn kids.<br/><br/>I liked each character in their own right, but I liked them better as an ensemble  their differences and clashes brings out the best in each. And typically such deliberate placement of different character types in the ensemble annoys me, yet it feels natural with the premise of Dead Like Me where none of the characters have any say about their circumstance  none of them choose to continue on as Grim Reapers. Thus their postmortem associates is forced upon them, and they have to make due with the hand dealt to them. In the land of the living, the show follows George's dysfunctional family as they deal with her loss amidst their own problems. I particularly liked this family's portrayal  it resonates with a sad truth that I seldom see on TV. Things aren't all right by the episode's end or even the season's end for that matter. This isn't a family concerned with climbing back up  that's a dream, a miracle, that won't happen. The reality they face and the best they can hope for is to simply stop the spiraling descent.<br/><br/>The little sister Reggie, obsessed with George's death, gravitates away from her parents and never really connects with them anymore (mirroring her older sister when she was alive.) I like how the mother, Joy, never seems to handle this rejection well, never seems to find the right thing to say, and even when she does Reggie almost never responds. It gives the impression that Joy would handle things differently if given the opportunity, for once giving meaning to the expression ""hindsight is 20/20"" in a TV show. Furthermore, it implicitly asks whether or not a ""right"" answer even exists at all.<br/><br/>Joy and Clancy face an exhausted and loveless marriage that goes largely unvoiced except in snide remarks and petty cheap shots. Not a perfect family, not even a happy family, just one trying to get through life. And yet the show never dwells on them long enough to depress its audience. It presents them with enough restraint, and just enough positive turns of fate to keep it from dragging the episodes down to full blown angst.<br/><br/>None of the characters are entirely likable (save George  George is always fun); however, that doesn't detract from the show at all. In fact, it enhances it  it gives the characters more depth, a wider range of personality  it shows they have a darker side, an irritating trait, that they have bad days. It shows the characters screw up. That they misjudge  Mason crosses a line with his lifestyle, and essentially betrays those around him. Rube will be overly harsh on George in one episode for something beyond her control. Daisy inexplicably gets involved in a stupid relationship when she knows better. Again, these touches only add to the characters.<br/><br/>Lastly, a show about Grim Reapers deals heavily with death. And despite the emotional grounds that come with the territory, Dead Like Me manages to dance delightfully around the macabre premise with its impish ludicrousness and uncanny patience. Alfred Hitchcock would be proud.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,,18 December 2006
2609,Dead Like Me, One of the best shows for years,"What can i say about dead like me? Excellent, terrific and most importantly why the hell was it canceled.<br/><br/>Being a English person we often join the best shows late, usually well after they are canceled. This is the case with dead like me, that i found late one night whilst channel surfing on satellite.<br/><br/>The show has so much dead plan humour in it which endeared me to the character of george, who was the main character throughout the first season (until the other characters started to being evolved in season 2) The show is done in very much the style of the wonder years where the main character george does the voice-over explaining certain things.<br/><br/>If you like dead pan humour with lots of weird and wonderful ways to die then this is the show for you. So either check you TV listings for details (hint sci fi in the UK has just started showing season 1). But does make you wonder when great shows like this get canned after 30 episodes yet certain shows run for years and yeats that are trash.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,19 November 2006
2610,Dead Like Me, Another series that was too smart?,"This series was such a joy to discover! Living in Vancouver, BC, the city in which the show is shot, I'm only now receiving it on Canadian television thanks to the SHOWCASE station.<br/><br/>On a personal side note - it's wonderful to watch a show that, although shot in a Canadian city under the guise of being an American city (Seattle, I believe), doesn't hide the street names, the weather, or the skyline and scenery of Vancouver, BC! This is not a series typical of the usual American sitcom fare, thank god! It ain't a tiresome reality show, or a poorly disguised soap opera for the masses.<br/><br/>I would say that it would appeal to all of those who dig the movie ""Donnie Darko"", enjoy ""Six Feet Under"" and those who are willing to look at the humor in the blandest of everyday activities, as well as the inevitability of death with a dash of hilarity.<br/><br/>This is an original concept of a show that takes us through the ""lives"" of the undead few who have been chosen at the point of their deaths to have the responsibility of being ""reapers"" of souls in there not-quite afterlife.<br/><br/>The great thing is, even those these chosen undead ones, these ""Bail bondsmen for the disembodied"", are given the power of being reapers of souls, they have no special powers (except appearing not as themselves to those who knew them in life) and must maintain jobs (or commit petty larceny as the character of Mason does) in order to pay the rent, bills, and all of the other unpleasant factors of a real life. This particular gaggle of reapers is run by ""Rube"" played by Mandy Patinkin, meet at ""Der Waffle Haus"" each day to receive their post it notes on which are written the first initial, last name, place or address, and E.T.D. (estimated time of death) of their ""reaps"" for the day, and must find the time to do so despite their interferences of everyday ""lives"" and jobs.<br/><br/>The main character of Georgia Lass, or ""George"", the wry-witted, sarcastic and irreverent 18 year old struck down in her prime and chosen to be a reaper is beautifully portrayed by husky-voiced young actress Ellen Muth.<br/><br/>As the series progresses, the audience is taken through often hilarious, sometimes heartwarming lessons of life with a wicked sense of humor. Teaching that life is short, that we all die, that the little moments in life are what count and so on could've made for a very clichéd show, but this series takes such an original and dry approach to its characters and humor that it touches all who can appreciate a good laugh wrapped around a positive message. The majority of the lessons taught throughout this darkly humorous, often irreverent, always entertaining series seems to be ""You don't know what you've got till it's gone"", a message that cannot be delivered enough times to enough people in this crazy day and age! Having watched the entire series (seasons 1 &amp; 2) on DVD, I was pleased to see the evolution of the show's characters into a solid ensemble piece of fascinating people rather than a single centralized character driven piece with caricatures surrounding her, which I must admit, was a risk that the series could've suffered had it not grown up very quickly from its initial 2 or three episodes.<br/><br/>Yet again I'm saddened by the cancellation of one of the few intelligent and truly funny shows on television these days - ""DEAD LIKE ME"". Why this happened to a show that is so well written, acted, directed and cast is beyond me, but I've given up on reasoning what is obviously a network decision based on money, ratings and the whathaveyous that control such things.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the series yet, watch it, or better yet, get the DVDs and watch the whole thing straight on through - you won't be disappointed!<br/><br/>~T.Paul",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,,10 October 2005
2611,Dead Like Me, Could have been much better,"I know it seems many like this show; if you like it, obviously I'm just stating my views, maybe I just have wrong expectations or a strange taste. But in my opinion, this show could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Obviously, spoiler alert.<br/><br/>First of all, I love the idea of the show: what a great new perspective of death. And I like the actors, I think they all did a good job. It's sad that Ellen Muth and Laura Harris seem to be out of the show business, I hope it's temporary, I'd like to see more of them. That's why I still finished the whole two seasons.<br/><br/>In an interview, the show's original creator, Bryan Fuller, explained that the network Showtime cancelled the show mostly due to bad storytelling. I agree. To me, except some episodes, most of them are just like ""this and this happen, end of story,"" many details are not going anywhere instead of moving the plotline ahead. In a story, every detail must have its purpose, either to drive the story or to show the characters' personality, but I see too many conversations or scenes have no reason to be there. Actually, there seems to be no plotline, they just reap souls and that's it. No conflict, no ""what's going to happen? Will they/won't they?"" I honestly fell asleep in some episodes.<br/><br/>A bigger problem I have is I fail to see the motives of the characters' behaviors, and therefore it's very hard for me to care about them or relate to them, only find them annoying. For example, Mason is impulsive, selfish, and airhead. It can be fun to have a character like that, but if we know what happen to him when he is alive, if we know what makes him that way, we'll have more understanding and sympathy. But his life (and actually, most of the main characters' lives) is nearly blank; we only know he dies of a stupid death and nothing else. Now I only find him annoying and stupid. Rube seems to have a dark and sad past, but the revelation of his life is way too show, too limited, and fragmental. How about Roxy? She's murdered by her friend, and that's it; it could have developed into a great subplot. When Mason learns that Daisy's last word is ""why nobody loves me?"" I thought this is such a great line! But that's the end of it, no further development, no further conflict.<br/><br/>A glimpse of a good plot is Ray the bad guy. He charms Daisy, obviously only using her, but she can't see that (or doesn't want to), and Mason is trying hard to help her. NOW that's the conflict! But it ends so abruptly and easy. Ray's troll is easily killed by George-which doesn't make sense: Daisy and Mason have worked way longer than George, but they seem to have limited knowledge of that troll than George? And George is the one kills it without any problem? I'm not saying George can't kill it, but at least show us some fighting and struggle, show us George's fear and courage to overcome it!<br/><br/>The subplot of Reggie and her parents' divorce isn't quite appealing either, I thought they should have shown more about Reggie's reasons of struggle instead of just showing her as a brat. But that might be just me.<br/><br/>And I know it's a ""comedy,"" but many ""deaths"" in the show are just silly and impossible, more like slapsticks, which isn't actually the tone of the show.<br/><br/>Finally, I have a problem with way too many George's narration. Narration is fine, but too many makes me feel I'm reading someone's account of bio instead of a story. Why not just show us? If George is learning a lesson, don't tell us, show us the change of her behavior or conversation!<br/><br/>All I can say is: it seems the show's cancellation after only 2 seasons has a reason. In fact, I'm a bit surprised it has a season 2; quite a few good shows got canceled after only 1 season.<br/><br/>That said, if there's a season 3 (probably not gonna happen), I probably will watch it and hope it gets better. It's such a great idea, and it actually makes you think about life and death.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,5.0,9 July 2020
2612,Dead Like Me, An odd little show that's flabbergastingly good,"This is one of my all-time favourite TV series that I've now seen and seen again. I'm assuming it took me a few episodes to really appreciate it, but honestly I don't even remember a time when I didn't love it. I found it thru suggestions in the wake of Pushing Daisies and Wonderfalls, and while those were both excellent, Dead Like Me feels much more real and gritty. The acting and writing go hand in hand perfectly--it's whimsical, yes, but not technicolour, doused in saturation whimsy. All of the characters have their own charm. Mandy Patinkin is always great to watch, and Ellen Muth and Laura Harris grew on me too. The soundtrack is mouth-watering! At times charming/upbeat and at times desperately haunting...<br/><br/>There's kind of a fine line between disliking (or liking) a show because it's up your alley vs. because it's well-done. Dead Like Me isn't exactly a drama, or comedy, or fantasy, or some surreal art piece, and because of that in many ways it feels almost subdued, but there is a lot of wit and story-telling and beauty in it.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,10 May 2018
2613,Dead Like Me, This series was excellent,"Dead Like Me is such a great series in that it gives the viewer a way to laugh at the greatest fear we all have, death. The reapers are all too human,... in-humans. They use their undead persona's to better their plight, within reason, under Rube's loose supervision. There are hints of teen rebellion, tempered by ironic twists where the children are more mature than the adults. Toilet Seat Girl, (Ellen Muth) is a reaper who hasn't experienced much in her short 18 years on earth. Her eyes are opened as a reaper to a world that she never knew, or gave a chance to. Her introduction as a dark, cynical slacker gives the viewer little reason to bond. Mason,(Callum Blue) the English teen who also died too young, starts her on new life by bringing her to a mass murder scene. She learns that to survive as a reaper, she'll have to work...At the very place where she died. Her inability to give up her family, who she couldn't stand to be around when she was alive, is one of the most touching aspects of the series. She becomes a far more sympathetic character, dead, than she ever was in her life. You see this through flashbacks of her short, yet turbulent life. Stewart Copeland's musical direction is spot on and the great characters from Roxy to Delores Herbig (""as in her big brown eyes"") carry this show. SciFi has been running the 1st season, hope the second makes it on. And oh yeah did I mention that you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,7 November 2006

How could I forget the ending. Grounded? Run away from home. Sure, potentially it's a good idea to run away if you're in an abusive or violent household. But Elodie is literally grounded for stealing a car, an sensible and appropriate punishment, so successfully runs away with some wild rockstar type. I think it's a dangerous message.

Moreover, the premise of the show (shoplifting, it's how the three girls meet, connect and become friends) doesn't really add much to the plot lines.

The characters are likeable, and the performances were reasonable, but the story ebbs and flows in the personal relationships, without much strong plot points to make a real impact. Its watchable, but it could have been unique, focussing more on their criminal skills, and less on their personal dramas. Deserving of a second season, to see where it goes.

And high schoolers do not have relationships with people in their 20s and 30s, I guess except in Portland. The first few episodes are about the ""stealing"" problem, but that quickly goes by the wayside and it becomes an obnoxious teen drama without a good storyline. And not trying to be moralistic, but the kids who constantly drink and use illicit drugs are somehow having no problems in school.

2642,Flashforward, An interesting idea cancelled too soon,"When I saw this series advertised I thought it looked interesting and so it proved to be. In the opening episode everybody in the world suffered a simultaneous black out during which people saw what they would be doing at the same time several months later. The story follows the activities of the FBI office in Los Angeles as one of their agents saw himself in front of a board detailing an investigation into the cause of the blackouts. There is a fairly tangled web of things seen in the future. The agent's wife saw herself with another man who turns out to be involved with a science project that may have caused it, another man sees himself in Afghanistan with his daughter who he believed had died some time before and some people had no flash forwards, which they take to mean they won't be alive then. Having seen the future they must determine whether this is an unavoidable destiny or can their knowledge allow them to change the future.<br/><br/>In a series with a large cast of characters it is impossible to mention everybody but the most notable cast members are Joseph Fiennes who did a decent job as Agent Mark Benford, Sonya Walger who played his wife Olivia and Jack Davenport who plays scientist Lloyd Simcoe who is apparently destined to end up in bed with Olivia. Over the course of the series my opinion about whether or not the flash forwards will all come true or not changed several times... I won't say whether they all did or not but will say I was satisfied with how that day finally turned out. It is just a shame that the final episode sets us up for a second series which won't happen due to its cancellation meaning that it is unlikely will ever learn the full story about who caused the black out and why.",65 out of 71 found this helpful.,7.0,3 June 2010

2645,Flashforward, The pilot episode and the overall concept alone has got me hooked.,"Wow. Who would've thought that in the history of TV, a show such as Flash-Forward, a sci-fi show of all things TV, knocks ""Survivor"" off the top spot in the ratings!! Amazing. People are finally getting a show that clicks with viewers amidst the sea of chaos of soulless Reality/Gameshow crap of today's airwaves with such an impact of drama and mystery-tinged bravado with exceptionally good acting performances from Joseph Fiennes and Courtney B. Vance. David S Goyer of BB and The Dark Knight lens his pen to ensure that the series is both epic and captivating and it's because of this that I'm hooked. The female leads are not bad either but could use a bit of polish that's bound to improve in future episodes. But on top of all this is the show's concept which is really cool and has me anxious to see the next episode. Some may complain about the slow build up but I'm glad for it because it lets the audience become acquainted with the characters and their experiences during a worldwide cataclysmic event and the plot moves at a steady pace without leaving too much out of the main story. It's a little rough around the edges but I say here's to ABC for delivering a intriguing and exciting piece of TV that has yet to reveal itself in a grand and spectacular fashion.",172 out of 228 found this helpful.,9.0,28 September 2009

I just try to take in what I'm experiencing there and then and if you do that, I think you'll find Flash Forward's opening episode pretty good. The concept is great and they have a great cast of actors. What I especially liked was the suspense of it all, what everyone ""saw"" themselves doing, who they were with, who they weren't with, and so forth. And lastly, is this a supernatural type of story? A natural disaster or phenomenon of sorts? A deliberate event or experiment? Who knows! The natural fear exhibited by the cast is also fairly realistic, when you place yourself in their shoes. I imagined myself in the same situation... what if you caught a glimpse of yourself 6months into the future? What if you didn't like what you saw? Scary....<br/><br/>The challenge will be to see if they can maintain the intensity through the life of the show....",139 out of 185 found this helpful.,9.0,29 September 2009
2647,Flashforward, Shame there's not a 2nd season,"Positively gripping from the start. Great storyline, likable characters, and just the right amount of sci-fi (enough to be somewhat believable).<br/><br/>There is however, one criticism. Half way through the season, they introduced too many 'Baddies' (none of whom knew who they were working for and why) which can become slightly off putting as the story can seem repetitive. For example, Alda Hertzog, who seemed to be a key suspect, flitted in and out of just 5 episodes. Hellinger, who seemed to be accountable for the blackout, also appeared quite briefly in five episodes. Hellinger didn't feature enough times in the season for us to create any emotion involving his character. I also think Frost deserved a better developed character background. <br/><br/>So was the blackout just an experiment to prove that no matter how you try and change your course in life, you will still always return to your designated path? Or was it something greater than that<br/><br/>It's still, overall a very good show. I did think half way through, how could they possibly create a second series from this? But after seeing the ending, I am truly disappointed that there isn't a second season to look forward to. <br/><br/>It's a recommended watch!",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,1 July 2012

I have been texting my friends and family on Thursday nights, telling them to start watching this show. It is fast paced, and the drama keeps building. It will make you think about your own future. The surprises keep getting me, and I am hooked for the season. It is a thriller that revolves around a core cast, and each character develops his or her own plot line, and many times those elements tangle with those of the other characters. It just adds to the suspense and gives a real feeling of what's at stake. Every week a new clue is discovered and further obstacles arise. The main premise is what caused the black- outs, and it seems as though a group of people are responsible. It was not a naturally occurring phenomenon. The FBI is front and center in the investigation. Every person in the world has a story to tell--everyone saw a glimpse of the future.

A Stadium in which everyone was passed out, the noise of explosions and crashing cars, plumes of smoke rising in the horizon. And then a title, FlashForward. That was it. Simple and effective. I immediately started searching the web and found brief synopses. Being a sci-fi fan, the concept was appealing so i decided to give it a chance when it first aired in AXN. And since then i stuck with it, even through the ""slow"" episodes, even through the 3 month break. And i'm glad i did. Since it's return FlashForward has given more thrills than anything else out there. (I'm not following LOST since i lost track of it around season 2, gonna watch that all in a row). Like most shows that deal with such a wide canvas, it has it's faults and plot-holes but if you focus on the story being told and the characters and don't think too much about all that, FlashForward is what is supposed to be.

Maybe next time they'll get it right, but the production team behind FlashForward just couldn't manage this time.

I thought oh Mom you know I hate fluff and cute little shows like this. I was so wrong. The story line seemed unbelievable, until I saw how it happened. The premise seemed ridiculous until I began to like Noa and her assistant. But Daniel is the kicker. He brings a fresh feeling to an old story.

While it wasn't perfect (Melody ISN'T the attractive one?), it was great fun, uncomplicated without being insulting to kids, and had characters who were unique and likable in context - except for Lucy as the all-purpose wisdom dispenser. The stories managed to stay lightweight yet engaging, and it was interesting observing what we would later know as sexual tension between the lead male and female (David Lascher and Kelly Brown).

Anyway, when checking out Hey Dude further I was shocked to see that many of the fine actors had 'Hey Dude' as their only acting experience, ever.  Danny, that America Indian genius was so brilliant on camera that I thought he for sure would have millons of offers on the table.  Perhaps SAG killed him fearing that he is such a great actor all future films and theatrics in general would be outlawed for fear of never being able to live up to the skills of Danny.  I hear Mr. Ernst was murdered by his son Buddy.  Brad is selling her body for $4 on some street corner in downtown Pittsburgh.

Interesting that if you try to see recent pictures of Brad or Danny you have no luck.

It had all of the teen characters which the NBC series had, only this series pretty much ran on the Nick network. It usually ran on week day afternoons or Saturday afternoons.<br/><br/>I saw about 10 or 20 of these and to me the theme song was catchy especially the way they'd let the instrumental run loose during the shows closing credits. The plots were generally family friendly fare and the actors were all suited for their roles.<br/><br/>As is usual with these shows, the teens are always smarter than the adults, except for the one everybody made fun of. There was teen romance, and harmless fun for all. Now if DVD's of this come out &amp; there are outtakes, that might be of more interest than the series is.<br/><br/>Overall, to me this was a pleasant series and a pretty decent way for Nick to fill air time around 1990.

2713,Petticoat Junction, Petticoat Junction,"Hi, everyone. I'm Roy. Petticoat Junction was already halfway through its first season when I first got to view it. This would be February 1964 and I was nine going on ten. I was already hooked on The Beverly Hillbillies and had grown fond of the rural sensibilities of that show. My home town, Fresno California, was a lot like Hooterville in the '50s and '60s.<br/><br/>After seeing my very first episode, which was Last Chance Farm, I knew that I wanted to continue watching the show. I can't really specify what it was about the first episode. I did develop a crush on the youngest daughter, Betty Jo, but that wouldn't happen for weeks. In the meantime I enjoyed watching Kate outwit Homer Bedloe and also looked forward to seeing what Uncle Joe's latest moneymaking scheme would be. Tuesday night (when it originally aired) actually broke up my school week. It was like getting an extra weekend because I enjoyed it so much.<br/><br/>I didn't get to see the pilot episode until the first season had gone to reruns. I remember that night my Mom's brother and his family had arrived from Alabama to visit all the California relatives, and poor Mom had to keep pulling me away from the TV telling me I could watch that anytime. But this was the pilot! I didn't know how to get that point across.<br/><br/>But I certainly concur with everyone who has commented favorably on the first two seasons. They were, for me also, the best. While my favorite Billie Jo was Meredith, who didn't come along until the fourth season, I always liked what Jeannine brought to the character during her time on the show, and Pat Woodell's portrayal of Bobbie Jo.<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to meet four of the actresses (Linda Henning, Lori Saunders, Jeannine Riley and Gunilla Hutton) at the celebrities conventions held in Southern California. All were sweethearts, just like their characters. I also remember getting jazzed when I heard that TV Land was going to air the first two seasons. But that wound up not happening, and my understanding is that the demand wasn't strong enough. I realize PJ had, and has, something of an esoteric appeal, and isn't a show that's generically referred to the way its sibling shows, Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres, are. That said, though, I discovered six years ago through the miracle of the Internet that I wasn't the only viewer on the planet Earth who appreciated the show as much as I did. I've gotten to meet some other fans who have become some of my closest friends. I'm a regular poster at the Shady Rest Forum, where we have some great discussions and share memories of the series. Sadly, it hasn't aired in the United States since March, 2000, when TV Land pulled it off the air, and I sincerely wish that one of the networks, if not TV Land, would bring it back.<br/><br/>-Roy",47 out of 51 found this helpful.,,12 May 2005
2714,Petticoat Junction, Folksy &amp; heartwarming shenanigans at the Shady Rest,"This is a mindless, entertaining series from the 1960's that baby boomers such as myself grew up on. Petitcoat Junction is something of a first cousin to The Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres. The series portrays the goings on at the Shady Rest Hotel, which is located on the outskirts of the little village of Hooterville. The hotel is run by the widowed Kate Bradley and her three lovely young daughters, Billie Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Betty Jo...all without much assistance from their lazy but protective Ol' Uncle Joe. Much of hotel life revolves around the local steam train, the Cannonball, operated by Floyd and Charlie, who make regular stops during their runs to Sam Drucker's little country store.<br/><br/>The two main stars wonderful, with Bea Benadaret playing the widow, Kate, and Edgar Buchanan Uncle Joe, who's mainly seen concocting get rich quick schemes while lazing about on the hotel's porch in his rocking chair. Yes, he's a-movin' kinda slow at the Junction. The three beautiful daughters are adequately cast, though with various actress changes mid way through the series.<br/><br/>The show gets its name from the three daughters at the Shady Rest. Naturally many of the plot lines revolve around the suitors of these lovely young ladies. Betty Jo, the youngest, is the one given the most character portrayal, initially something of a tomboy but eventually growing up to wed sweetheart Steve, the first Bradley sister to marry. Unlike some viewers, I don't recall her two sisters having very distinctive personalities, except for Billie Jo being starstruck. In my opinion, they mainly seem to look pretty, banter a bit with each other &amp; their mom, and attract beaux.

2717,Petticoat Junction, It has to be confusing when your sisters keep changing in appearance!,"This was one of a group of CBS rural comedies popular in the 1960's that were actually grouped together as far as having interdependent casts - ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and ""Green Acres"" being the other two series.<br/><br/>The show is about life at the rural Shady Rest Hotel, owned and operated by widow Kate Bradley (Bea Benaderet). Action centers around guests at the hotel as well as Kate's three attractive daughters, Betty Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Billie Jo. The actresses portraying Billie Jo and Bobbie Jo changed over the years. In fact, season two is the last of two seasons for the first actresses to portray these roles. Betty Jo, the youngest and the tomboy, was played by Linda Henning, daughter of the series creator Paul Henning, for the entire run of the series.<br/><br/>The hotel is literally in the middle of nowhere, halfway between two very small towns. The actual location (state for example) is never given, and the issue of how exactly it is that Kate manages to make what seems to be quite an adequate living running a hotel that theoretically should have few if any guests is never even addressed. This is a show very much rooted in the early 60's, and the idea is escapism and fun, not realism.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,7.0,25 March 2017
2718,Petticoat Junction, The Inventor of Jiggle T.V.,"When this show first premiered its biggest attraction were the three Bradley daughters.  However, you really got to see a great comedy and the real stars were the late great Bea Benederet as Kate and the late and equally great Edgar Buchanan as Uncle Joe, who was always looking to get rich quick.  The girls themselves were pretty well fleshed out characters themselves.  Billie Jo was the ambitious star-struck one, Bobbie Jo was the somewhat dim bulb and Betty Jo was the tomboy.  Betty Jo became the most evolved character as you saw her grow up from being a girl who was pretty much pre-occupied with sports into a beautiful young woman who eventually settled down and married the man of her dreams.  Too bad Bea Benederet passed away.  When that happened the wind seemed to go out of the show and within two years it was gone.  Perhaps it was a precursor of things to come becuase within a year after it had gone off the air all the great rural television shows were virtually wiped out in the infamous purge of 1971.",18 out of 22 found this helpful.,,22 April 2003

Created by Paul Henning,who also served as executive producer of the series,this series produced 222 episodes during the course of it's network run. Out of the 222 episodes,only 57 of those episodes during the first two seasons of ""Petticoat Junction"" were in classic black-and-white that aired from September 24,1963 until June 15,1965. Out of the entire 222 episodes of this series only 165 of those episodes were in color for Seasons 3 thru 7 that aired from September 21,1965 until April 4,1970. Out of the cast members that were on this series,only actors Edgar Buchanan and Linda Henning were the only cast members that stayed on throughout its entire seven-year run. The show's sponsor for the series entire seven-year tenure was the Proctor &amp; Gamble company (the makers of Tide Detergent, Duncan Hines cake mixes, Joy dish detergent and JIF Peanut Butter).<br/><br/>""Petticoat Junction"" was one of the great,heart-felt show that was part of CBS' rural line-up of comedies that were right alongside ""The Beverly Hillbillies"",""Green Acres"",and ""The Andy Griffith Show"". Set in the town of Hooterville,this series featured the great Bea Benaderet(who was a regular from ""The George Burns/Gracie Allen Show"",and not to mention was the voice of Betty Rubble in the animated cartoon ""The Flintstones"")as Kate Bradley,the widow and the manager of the Shady Rest Hotel,which is located just on the outskirts of the little village of Hooterville. Kate Bradley runs the hotel while taking care of her three lovely daughters,Billie Jo, Bobbie Jo, and Betty Jo...all without much assistance from Uncle Joe(Edgar Buchanan)who in just about every episode was looking for quick rich schemes,while lazing himself away on the hotel's front porch. The show enjoy great success within the Nielsen ratings until the 1968-1969 season when actress Bea Benaderet passed away from lung cancer at the start of the 1968-1969 season,and that was when the show was declining in the ratings. In an effort to save the show,actress June Lockhart was brought in as Benaderet's replacement as Dr. Janet Craig,a physician at the nearby hospital who took over the responsibilities of the Shady Rest Hotel(June Lockhart was no stranger in the land of television shows. She was the mom on ""Lassie"" from 1957-1964 and was Dr. Maureen Robinson on the science fiction/adventure series ""Lost In Space"" from 1965-1968. June Lockhart came on board ""Petticoat Junction"" after her series ""Lost In Space"" ended production in 1968). By the show's final season which was the 1969-1970 one,the ratings were at the bottom of the Nielsens. In order to save the show,the producers did however do crossover episodes which consisted of characters from both ""Petticoat Junction"",and ""Green Acres"",not to mention bringing on the characters from ""The Beverly Hillbillies"". The episode titled ""A Christmas in Hooterville"" was that crossover episode that aired in December 12, 1969. Because of low ratings,CBS canceled this series on April 4,1970 after 222 episodes. The precursor of what was to come came within a year after ""Petticoat Junction"" was canceled with CBS' infamous purge of 1971.

2727,Petticoat Junction," ""There's A Little Hotel Called The Shady Rest At The Junction""","During the Sixties CBS was known as the rural station because heading its ratings were such shows as Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres, and the show from where Green Acres spun from, Petticoat Junction. You loved the endearing characters created on Petticoat Junction and the interchangeable regulars on each of them.<br/><br/>Petticoat Junction was somewhere in the Ozarks a really rural part of the state. Part of the gimmick here was the Hooterville Cannonball, the railroad that ran from Pixley to Hooterville and back. It was run by Smiley Burnette and Rufe Davis, later Davis alone when Burnette passed away. It was vital to the lifeblood of the economy of Hooterville.<br/><br/>After all who was going to stay at Bea Benaderet's Shady Rest Motel which as Kate Bradley she ran with the help of those curvaceous daughters of her's. Bobbi Jo, Betty Jo, and Billie Jo were enough of a sight to make any weary traveler stop. Helping out as little as possible at the motel was Edgar Buchanan as Uncle Joe who did as little physical work as possible, but who schemed big.<br/><br/>Scheming was a necessity because the Hooterville Cannonball became an obsession with railroad executive Homer Bedloe, played endearingly by the raspy voiced Charles Lane. Lane brought years of experience playing exactly these types in hundreds of movie roles, but Homer Bedloe became his career part. Half the episodes were devoted to the citizenry of Hooterville rallying behind Benadaret keeping the Cannonball running. You've got to wonder when the US rail system consolidated into AMTRAK just where was the Hooterville Cannonball in the scheme of things?<br/><br/>The development of the Bradley girls became known as 'hooters' thereby entering our culture. And the name Hooterville became synonymous with calling any place that happened to be located far from any decent sized city. I remember on a trip to Portugal referring to the village of Fatima as the Hooterville of Portugal. Don't think so, take a trip there and see how far out in the Portugese boondocks it is.<br/><br/>From Frank Cady as Sam Drucker the general store owner and a host of other semi-regulars who got in more than one episode of this and Green Acres. They were the real richness of the show. In fact they contributed so much that when Bea Benederet died in 1968 the show just kept on going. It could have kept going, but for a deliberate decision by CBS to cancel those rural comedies because they wanted to appeal to a different demographic.<br/><br/>Still Petticoat Junction had its fans. Still does even among city slickers.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,17 July 2008

2730,Petticoat Junction, Heart-Warming Hooterville Valley,"This to me was one of the very best heart-warming situation comedies ever on television.<br/><br/>The premise of a widow raising her three daughters with the Uncle Joe as a surrogate father to these girls and all of the joys and challenges of running the Shady Rest and keeping Homer Bedloe from shutting down the Cannonball (only means of transportation) has provided many with a wonderful ""escape"" of real life and lots of wonderful laughs.<br/><br/>I cannot write about this show without giving the proper kudos to its central character and matriarch, Kate Bradley played by the wonderful actress Bea Benaderet.  She was to me an unsung actress who not only played every role quite well.  She played Pearl Bodine in the Beverly Hillbillies and always stole the show with her great comedic talents.<br/><br/>Kate was the one who held everything together.  Uncle Joe made a lot of noise sometimes, but was very protective of Kate and her girls.  He always had his ""get rich quick"" schemes and always felt the Shady Rest was just as good (if not better) than the Conrad Hilton Hotel--or was trying to cook up a scheme to bring it up to the standard of the latest resort.<br/><br/>Her girls?  I am sure some may feel they were just TOO GOOD to be true, but that is the great wonder of this show.  Each daughter had their own personality and I imagine many young men wished they had a Billie Jo/Bobbie Jo/ or Betty Jo they could take home to meet his parents.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the story of Betty Jo falling in love and marrying the Air Force pilot Steve Elliott.  I always wished all of the daughters could have married sometime in the course of the show.<br/><br/>The saddest loss of course was when Bea Benaderet succumbed to cancer in October of 1968. It left many voids in the hearts of viewers.  Since this was a situation comedy, death was a very delicate subject.  Even through her radiation treatments they were stories of Kate ""being away"" and a brief return by Bea in hopes that the treatments had taken all of the cancer.  I am sure CBS and the Petticoat Junction crew were having quite a challenge on how to handle the loss of their central character.<br/><br/>Bringing June Lockhart to the cast as the lovely Dr. Janet Craig was a delightful change and she added a different dimension to the show (it was the late 60's and many women were becoming career women), but it was not Kate.<br/><br/>TV Land was the last station I know of to show this wonderful show.

2731,Petticoat Junction, CBS Cancelled an Era!!,"In 1970 when CBS took ""Petticoat Junction"" off the air, it was for purposes of deviating itself from the ossified reputation of a network perpetuating rural comedies...CBS was on the verge of embarking on sitcoms with social poignancy and ethnicity recognition!! (Shows like ""All in the Family"") As a child, I always fondly remember ""Petticoat Junction"" as a wholesome T.V. show....My identification with ""Petticoat Junction"" was particularly positive because it resembled my mother's family of three daughters, and, my mother was the youngest daughter who got married first (Just like the T.V. Show!!). This culminating with ""My Three Sons"" mirrored my personal family situation, as I was one of three sons in my family!! The Shady Rest Hotel was a quaint resemblance to my days up at my grandfather's summer home in Michigan...The innocence more than anything, encompassed a fondness for the fortunate unity that a happy family possesses!! I seem to remember one of the last episodes of ""Petticoat Junction"" where Billie Jo was advocating women's liberation!! This particular episode sort of explained why ""Petticoat Junction"" was taken off the airwaves!! Ignoring the tumultuousness of the 1960's totally, producers of ""Petticoat Junction"" were sort of conveying the message that they had a very uncomfortable disposition with social issues!!<br/><br/>As time has passed, it makes you realize that comedy back then was very innocent, and, the need for change simply accommodated the future....One of my favorite movies is ""Sex.Lies, and Videotape"" this film is the antithesis of the television show ""Petticoat Junction""...Here is the catch though!! The movie ""Sex,Lies and Videotape"" could have taken place in Hooterville!! The actual depiction of small-town America is not a paralleled panacea right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Realistically assessing Hooterville, it would most likely be a town which would be subject to an abyss of dreadfully high unemployment, and, it would get bludgeoned by one recession after another. You would have a scenario whereby Wal-Mart would be putting Sam Drucker's store out of business. Also, the divorce rate would most likely be commensurate with the national average too!!<br/><br/>What I am saying is that, television needs to change with people!! The homey associations of family values pertinent to yesteryear, were indeed for the past!! Today's comedy is not just about sex, but also, they are about realistic proclivities which reflect the lifestyle patterns of today!! The illustration of human error is what a comedy is all about!! I loved ""Petticoat Junction"", I do not think I would want to watch it as a new television show today though!!...From the seventies there arose many television series which articulated the rage form of the American public.. Petticoat Junction's innocuous demeanor was an anachronism to this trend of agitation and ideological malcontent. Hence, the perception of moral infuriation, by the television audience, could not be quelled by hovering around the piano and singing! I feel it is imperative that television should mirror American's personal and social transitions! I liked ""Petticoat Junction"" back then because it reflected my happiness as a young boy with a loving family! A state of cop-aesthetic satisfaction is humorous in its own realization!! Realism and doubts, as depicted in television shows today, also have a comically identifiable twist to them....Shows like ""Petticoat Junction"" placated the ambitions of the perfect post World War II American family, and resonated themselves to a state of domestic idealism! Many shows today evoke a candid commentary which is very amenable to misery and social injustice! This appreciation in entertainment dichotomy makes me an utterly saturated recipient of the television industry!!",33 out of 65 found this helpful.,10.0,21 December 2005

That is how innocent and non-violent Brendan is. That the first thing he could think of ON HIS OWN was a freaking HAIRCUT!!! Those interrogators were SO frustrated by his obvious lack of knowledge of what happened to the poor woman that they announced for all of us to see THAT THEY TOLD HIM she was shot in the head.

It may seem a bit one sided but if you look at the list of people at the end who declined to be interviewed you will see why. You can't begrudge the producers for the other side not cooperating. That being said, the outcome is not very surprising. If you've paid any attention to America's justice system ..... ever ....you would understand that cops and judges are above the law and they can do whatever they want and they have zero accountability. This series just solidified that. Everyone is going to act angry and appalled but then never actually do anything about it.

2746,Making a Murderer, Haunting; Unbelievable,"It's hard to put into words how moving this documentary series was. The view of this work from 30,000 feet is perhaps that it is a beautiful but tragic depiction of the powerful versus the powerless in the context of the American criminal justice system, and a haunting reminder of what human beings are capable of when we believe the ends justify the means. The view on the ground - from a very intimate front row seat in Steven Avery's hometown of Manitowoc, WI - is that one man likely endured not one, but two of the most egregious injustices imaginable. <br/><br/>One thing that sets this series apart from previous shows in this genre (like NPR's Serial) is that the producers never once make an appearance on camera, nor does the viewer ever hear their voices, at least not in a literal sense. Instead, they rely on interviews, court proceedings, news clips, and telephone and video recordings to tell the story, often against the backdrop of the Avery's family compound. In a simple and clean way, the series is beautifully shot. And the story itself... unbelievable. But even the most reasonable, even skeptical viewer will have to grapple with the theories put forward. Theories that would seem a reach at best if it weren't for the overwhelming hard evidence unfolding, on film, right before your eyes. <br/><br/>I started out by saying that it was hard to describe how moving this documentary was, and I actually found myself transitioning through the same emotional states (albeit to a much lesser degree) that the key figures seemed to experience: from shock and disbelief to anger and ultimately to a sense of despair. <br/><br/>To me, what separates television and film that constitutes true ""art"" from that which is merely entertaining, is that it reveals something perhaps not so obvious but nonetheless true about human nature or the human experience. This easily surpasses that standard, but what makes it particularly chilling is that this is not a carefully constructed fictional plot designed to pull our heart strings. This actually happened. And it happened to real a person. To a real family.",346 out of 434 found this helpful.,10.0,20 December 2015

2750,Making a Murderer, The best true crime legal documentary ever made,"Making a Murderer documents the true story of Steven Avery, sent to prison under questionable circumstances, exonerated on DNA evidence 18 years later, and accused of murder shortly thereafter under equally questionable circumstances.<br/><br/>MaM, ten hours long, is gripping throughout. The story is revealed chronologically, paced so perfectly to leave the viewer gasping at regular intervals, yet never feeling manipulated. But make no mistake: the filmmakers do have an opinion. And by the end of MaM, it is an opinion you will share.<br/><br/>The comparisons to gems like Paradise Lost and The Jinx are inevitable. Up until now, Paradise Lost represented the pinnacle of the genre; MaM tells its story similarly, yet surpasses PL. Where The Jinx, an otherwise excellent documentary, left me with a bad taste, feeling that the truth played second fiddle to its filmmakers' ambitions, MaM never focuses on its creators. The drama is narrated only by the players, the argument made convincingly by historical footage, media and police manipulation made plain not by rhetoric, but by the simple evidence provided by context.<br/><br/>Avery's story, as presented in MaM, is a horrifying story that leaves one infuriated at law enforcement, politicians, and news media. Not generally one for righteous indignation, this was the first series I've ever watched from which I had to take regular breaks out of sheer rage. Avery's story is not a pleasant or uplifting one.

It makes me sick. When it comes to Brendan and his statement I immediately started to think about Jessie Misskelley. A boy with below average IQ and was one of three teenagers that got falsely accused of murdering three young boys in Memphis. He also made a ""confession"" after the cops had lured and guiding him towards what they wanted to hear. Anyway, I hope that one day, the truth will come out and the ones, that still walks free, get the judgement they deserve and that Brendan and Steven Avry will get their freedom back.

Once you get a grasp of what it is all about, you just continue on with the flow until the documentary reaches its conclusion.<br/><br/>An important point if you are coming fresh from the similar true crime series, The Jinx, then you might feel that this documentary series doesn't put as much emphasis on flair and reenactments. Instead the approach is based on journalistic substance with a lot of focus being placed on police reports, recordings, court documents etc. However, I found the series intro theme to be hauntingly beautiful. It really gets stuck inside your head.<br/><br/>Like The Thin Blue Line, Murder on a Sunday Morning, and Paradise Lost documentaries before it, the approach is overwhelmingly in favor of the defendant. You feel like you are witnessing a great injustice unfold before your eyes. There is little room for you to argue that Avery is guilty. But with the amount of evidence both substantial and circumstantial presented in Avery's favor, there is certainly little to argue anyway.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would recommend this documentary to anyone into true crime.

What happened to letting them fend for themselves instead of giving them money, jobs, and projects to keep them occupied? Where did the individualism, the goals and the character go? <br/><br/>Is it just me, or does anyone else miss the med students, business entrepreneurs, artists, musicians, race car drivers... heck, even a cop! Was it fair to replace them with a bunch of ""pretty people"" with six pack abs, and teeny waists who's only goal appears to be who can ""hook up"" with who first? Some may say that the former doesn't fairly represent most of today's youth, but the latter certainly doesn't either! <br/><br/>I think it's just run it's course. When a show has run it's course, the creators resort to pathetic tactics in an effort to pull ratings and hold interest.

I didn't really care for 'em, to be honest, but they WILL be remembered as the most ""pure"" cast. No playing to camera, as most following casts did. I liked the 2nd cast, a lot. However, you got the impression that they were being ""controlled"" by their producers. We got the first cast member ejected from the show for a prank that went bad. I'd love to see ALL the footage from that incident! I suspect we'd see a lot more than we got. And I'll bet the young man would probably have our support.<br/><br/>The Miami cast is also one of my favorites. they get the task of starting a business, and we see how a group of young people can't seem to get together for what's expected of them. <br/><br/>From then on, I think the show was truly past it's ""Sell By"" date, and should have been ended. <br/><br/>It all boils down to the same types on each show, the ""ALPHA MALE"", ""HIS NEW BEST FRIEND"", ""THE BITCH"", ""THE GAY PERSON"", and so on.

For you kids who watch MTV now you probably think MTV never did. Well, they did but before you were born.

The kids that have been on every Real World show have no idea what the real real world is. For if they did they would not be on this program. The producers put these spoiled kids up in million dollar homes or whatever, pay for trips to other countries and give them all kinds of things to do. All they have to do is complain, fight and be offended by things that are not politically correct. The line up for the real World cast is normally this: Black guy, black girl, white feminist girl with hang-ups, macho jerk white guy, wimpy white guy and of course a homosexual.

I loved the second season, because at the time the show was more of what it pretended to be. They found several unique individuals, threw them all together and people got to see what happened. Or at least that's what it seemed like.<br/><br/>The one that everyone always bags on, London, was also a favorite, as was Miami. But with each passing season, the ratings grubbing Mtv execs pushed more and more for the formulaic tripe that we see now. All the people are as attractive as can be, and the show centers around sex, drinking and what looks like scripted melodrama (probably because the producers encourage certain kinds of behavior through subtle suggestions). I enjoyed Hawaii on some levels, but at the same time it was the ultimate undoing of the series. The sex, drinking and extreme weepy melodrama of this season got such huge ratings that every season since has tried to copy it. As a result, they have gotten progressively worse.<br/><br/>I couldn't wait to see them do The Real World in Chicago.

When the MTV casting call came her to UNC-CH, I was one of the first people in line to audition for the show (though I didn't make it). What is it that has made this show such a cultural phenomenon? It is simply that society craves the act of seeing real people put into strange situations. It is like a car crash beside the side of the road--you don't mean to look as you pass by, but you just have to. But there is nothing wrong with loving this show. It is like any other tv show.

2769,The Real World," That was then, This is now.","I remember the first time ""The Real World"" hit the airwaves back in the summer of 1992.  I had just graduated from 8th grade and I use to watch it with one of my older siblings, who had graduated from college.  It was so cool to watch a TV show with real people and no scripts.  You always wanted to tune in next week to see what happened next.  In retrospect, the first Real World in New York wasn't that exciting.  The thing was it was a new concept, when you compare it to how many reality shows are on the air now. That's the other thing, the show was more real back then.  The more the years go by, the less chance for getting people on the show who will not put on an act.  The first Real World cast did not know what to expect.  They did not have seasons of other members to learn from.  They really experienced it.  I was so skeptical of the second season (L.A.) because of the first one.  You can't beat the first one.  It did.  It didn't beat it because it was a cooler cast, but rather because it was more interesting.  After all David was the first Real Worlder to be kicked off the show.  The years kept coming and when season 5 came around (Miami) they decided to add a new element, working together.  Over the years, the job or duties have changed. They all have to partake, which gives more of an opportunity for good ratings.  I liked the 6th season (Boston) because not only is that where I am from (well around there) but I was currently living in Boston during the taping of the show.<br/><br/>Over the years many crazy moments have happened on the show.  Each show can be known for at least one character, and I do mean character.  Whether people are really being themselves or totally acting, its not 100% real because editing it performed and people are displayed in a way to get ratings.  You could have someone who might drink more than the rest or have sex more than the rest, but all they might focus on is that.  You obviously did it, but it may be displayed like that's all you ever did.  Then by the last season (San Diego) the cast members know exactly what they are getting themselves into.  That doesn't mean they are prepared for dealing with the life of being taped 24/7, but they know what the show is all about.  I haven't liked all the shows. <br/><br/>My thoughts on the seasons are:<br/><br/>1- New York:  This one was cool because it was the first one.  They didn't have reference on what to expect.<br/><br/>2- L.A.:  All right.  Dominic was my favorite on the show and we got to see someone kicked off.<br/><br/>3- S.F.: All right.  If it weren't for Puck, it would have been pretty dull. Unfortunately, one of the cast members (Padro) has since died of AIDS.<br/><br/>4- London:  Pretty boring, other than when Neil's tongue was bitten off.<br/><br/>5- Miami:  First one where they had to work together and this one was a refreshing change from the previous one.  This one had quit a few heated moments.<br/><br/>6- Boston:  I basically liked it for where it was filmed and less for the show itself.  <br/><br/>7- Seattle:  Had allot of interesting episodes.  I wasn't totally crazy about the cast, but it worked.<br/><br/>8- Hawaii:  Can be summed up in Nudity. lol.  Also in like the first episode a girl almost drinks herself to death.  Wow.<br/><br/>9- New Orleans:  This one wasn't bad.  It was right near Mardi Gras.  It was decent.<br/><br/>10- Back to New York:  We already did N.Y., was it really needed to do it again?  The thing that kept this one good is Coral.  I hated her with a passion.  She continued to be her great self on other MTV experiences.<br/><br/>11- Chicago:  This had a pretty decent cast and one girl trying to carry on Hawaii's nude torch. lol.  There were some good heated arguments on this show.<br/><br/>12- Las Vegas:  I really didn't even get into this one too much, even though it was one of the crazier ones.  They were in Vegas after all.  All they did on this show was drink and have sex.  So I guess great for ratings. lol.<br/><br/>13- Paris:  Allot better than the first European experience.  Hard to follow the Las Vegas cast, but it was pretty good.<br/><br/>14- San Diego:  This was the last one and I really got hooked in.  Mostly because of Frankie, I thought she was cool.  The show for the most part was very interesting and allot of stuff took place.  It's the one cast I could really say may have had theirs problems, but got along really well with each other.  A bunch a people, I could see myself hanging with.<br/><br/>Well, we will wait for the Philly cast to wrap up.  The longer this show runs the faker it will get.  They also push for the ratings and try and get people together who won't get along.

And they also get their jobs hooked up for them with any of them going on an interview.  In their spare time, they go partying at nightclubs and having sex with total strangers (or their roommates).  At their temporary lodgings, they are shown doing nothing, but playing around on the Internet, watching TV, or sleeping.  That's not the real world. Then these ""Real World-ers"" try to become actors after the reality show ends. HINT: Being on a reality show doesn't make you an actor.<br/><br/>Most of these people are annoying, except for a few.  The most annoying ""Real World"" cast member, as of late, has been Chris Tamburello (a.k.a CT) from Real World Paris.  CT is a fake-hoodlum type (with a rag on his head 24-hours) from Boston.  His heavy Boston accent just annoys me.  He is so loud and obnoxious, you just want to see this guy take a big fall in life. CT was shown several times getting drunk, being disrespectful to other people, and slugging a nightclub patron several times.  CT would've been arrested for assault and sued if he was in the United States.  CT isn't as tough as he thinks he is.  The second annoying person is Leah Gillingwater, also on Real World Paris.  I couldn't stand this little wannbe bully.  In one episode, she was shown as maybe having cancer.<br/><br/>The only person I like is Melissa Padron from Real World Miami.  She was sexy.  That lesbian shower scene she did one episode was probably the hottest episode in Real World history.  I didn't like the fact that Melissa tried denying her naughty side.  No, Melissa did NOT do a 3-some in the shower with Mike and that waitress (like everybody thought).  It was only Melissa and that waitress that was making all those loud erotic noises. Mike passed out because he was drunk (or because he wasn't wanted). Not a good thing.<br/><br/>I hope the future Real World episodes get better.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,,7 November 2003
2773,The Real World, Show Has Fallen Off,Early seasons were way better. Newer seasons just straight up trashy. 1990s-early 2000s seasons 10/10. Have to give overall show 7/10 though since all the recent seasons have just been a shame to watch :/. Same dusty hoes getting piped by the same squad over and over again.

2774,The Real World, Locations Are Ridiculous!!!,"Whenever I think about this show ""Real World"", I always think about the locations of the show:  Boston, Chicago, Hawaii, Las Vegas, London, LA, Miami, New Orleans, NYC, Paris, San Francisco, Seattle.  All of these cities are very exciting cities, but there is a problem here.<br/><br/>All of the mentioned places are regarded as high-profile cities, world class cities, international cities, EXPENSIVE cities.  These are the cities which are shown in ""bold print"" on world maps.  These are the cities where ""nightlife"" is booming.  These are the cities where tourists flock for vacations.  These are the cities that are shown on television all the time. These are the cities which are fast-paced.  These are the cities where the ""action"" is.  These are cities which will never be classified as ""boring"".<br/><br/>However, there is more to geography, and more to life, than that.  If this show is supposed to be called the ""Real World"", give people just that.  What about having the ""Real World"" take place in these types of places:<br/><br/>¨ Cheyenne, WY ¨ Binghamton, NY ¨ Savannah, GA ¨ Columbia, MO ¨ Dayton, OH<br/><br/>Or, if you want to take the international route, how about these places:<br/><br/>¨ Sussex, England ¨ Nice, France ¨ London, Ontario (as opposed to London, England) ¨ Cork, Ireland ¨ Perth, Australia<br/><br/>The idea here, is that all of these places are not regarded as the ""world class"" places like NYC or Paris.  These places are slower-paced.  These places don't have the ""nightlife"" that Chicago or Hawaii has.  Tourists do not flock to these places like they do to San Francisco or Vegas.  However, these ""other"" cities are special in their own way.  They give you a look into what life is ""really"" like, without all the hussle and bussle.<br/><br/>Why has the ""Real World"" NOT taken place in lesser-profile places?  It's on MTV.  MTV appeals to Generation X'ers with short attention spans who want excitement and action-packed locales.  They will not get action in Little Rock, Arkansas, nor will it keep their attention.  <br/><br/>Also, how can early twenty-somethings who are just getting started in life afford to live like royalty in these high-priced places?<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm too critical.  Perhaps I'm not.  MTV is not exactly intelligent television like PBS or the Discovery Channel.  The ""Real World"" is not going to appeal to people in their 30's and beyond.  Even though others have discussed the other putrid aspects of this show, I felt that the location issue should have been addressed.",7 out of 22 found this helpful.,,20 September 2003
2775,The Real World," A ""reality"" TV pioneer","This is one of the first ""reality"" TV shows. It is based on an interesting idea -- take 7 MTV-crowd members who don't know each other, put them into one residence, and have cameras watch them. There have been charges that the producers feed the castmembers ideas, but maybe if that didn't happen, the show would be as boring as watching video of anyone at home.<br/><br/>The seasons have been uneven depending on the castmembers and locations. One of the best aspects of this show is that it allows the MTV viewers to see real gay people being real gay people. The gay castmembers are not actors, and their situations can illustrate for the young MTV watchers that gay people are not any more weird than anyone else. <br/><br/>Especially touching was the San Francisco story of Pedro Zamora, a young Cuban immigrant with AIDS. He did a great deal to educate the twentysomethings about gays and AIDS just by being himself. Tragically, he died of AIDS the night before the last episode of the San Francisco season aired.<br/><br/>Danny Roberts in New Orleans is another example. He is a sweet person whose struggle with being gay is very instructive to the viewers. His boyfriend is an Army officer and so must be blurred out on screen to protect his identity. This situation illustrates the stupidity of the military's homophobia. I found especially touching the episode when Danny was tempted to stray with the boys from the gay bar but then gets a surprise visit from his boyfriend on Valentine's Day.<br/><br/>I commend MTV for coming up with this idea and with keeping it fresh -- most of the time.",3 out of 7 found this helpful.,,7 August 2000

I don't remember much except they had an awesome house and a guy named Teck jumped into a pool naked.<br/><br/>The Real World:New Orleans.  This season holds a special place in my heart. Probably my favorite Real World house so far.  The cast was great, I liked Julie the most.  The last episode was really sad.  And in the end you liked all the cast.<br/><br/>The Real World:Back To New York.  This season I didn't watch very much... did they even have a finale episode?  It was very boring.  I think it may have been canceled do the the attack on the WTC.<br/><br/>The Real World: Chicago.  Hmm... the last season.  There were some great memories.  And who could forget Tonya?  The girl everyone loved to hate. And I've yet to meet a single person who can stand her.  My favorite moment was when Theo made Tonya cry... no, just joking.  My favorite moment was the lat episode in the hot tub.  In the end I liked all the cast members... except Tonya.<br/><br/>So, I guess when you like a season of The Real World, you really like it.

I grew up watching The Real World when I was younger, but didn't fully grasp the context of what was going on. I recently rediscovered the first season, which is appropriate since this year marks the 25th anniversary of the show. It's really great. What makes reality TV interesting is that it's unscripted and unpredictable. 7 twenty somethings are chosen from around the country to live in a mansion for a few months to see what happens. We see them interact with their roommates, deal with issues and usually find common ground. In my opinion, the first season is the best. It has evolved over the years as times and culture has changed. Definitely worth a watch.",1 out of 2 found this helpful.,9.0,15 July 2017

2782,The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.," LAUGH OUT LOUD!! The ""Most Underrated"" Anime of 2016.","Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan(TV) AKA 'The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.' is a Japanese gag anime based on the manga of the same name by Shūichi Asō. Kusuo Saiki is a high school student who was born with all manner of psychic abilities, including telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation, and more. Despite having all these powers, Saiki faces all kinds of hardships and tries to avoid attention as much as possible. The story follows Saiki as he attempts to secretly use his powers to live a normal high school life while dealing with his less than ordinary classmates at P.K. Academy. <br/><br/>Story: 8/10 <br/><br/>There isn't any rigid story-line or synopsis. Saiki is more out to be a slice-of-life comedy anime. <br/><br/>Animation: 8/10 <br/><br/>Animation is good. The characters are well made to fit in their comic roles. <br/><br/>Voice &amp; Score: 9/10 <br/><br/>The voice actors are doing a really great job, although the dialogue is pretty fast sometimes and it may be a little hard to follow, but it is understandable for such a short anime. The intro song is very short , but it is catchy and fits the anime. The background music, also, fills the scenes nicely. <br/><br/>Characters: 10/10 <br/><br/>They are core of the anime. Each and every one of them are quite hilarious(especially Kaidou and Nendou). The protagonist himself is the center of this 'flood'. <br/><br/>Entertainment: 10/10 <br/><br/>I mean you can't possibly count the gags and comic situations in this anime. The more you laugh, the more you forget about the previous ones. This makes the anime a watchable one to its very end. <br/><br/>Overall: 10/10 <br/><br/>I'm trying to be honest here that 'The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.' is 'Most Underrated' Anime of 2016. It didn't receive quite an appreciation or recognition from the anime audience. But those who had watched the anime hail the series with unanimous positive responses. As for enjoyment, Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan will definitely make you laugh with its hilarious jokes, interactions and characters!

2783,The Disastrous Life of Saiki K., Hilarious Comedy Centered Around (Possibly) Anime's Strongest Character,"Saiki has ultra strong psychic abilities, which makes me dare say that he is the most powerful anime character of all time (even more powerful than One Punch Man or Goku). However, trying to live your life as an ordinary kid among ordinary people will surely produce so much tension-- which is the where The Disastrous Life of Saiki K revolves around.<br/><br/>Saiki is a very introverted, extremely self-reliant, boring teen, but his commentaries and how people (and animals) interact all around him make this show hilarious.<br/><br/>The show does not follow a linear storyline and features several mini-episodes for each 24-minute episode. There is no culminating plot and the series doesn't require you to invest too much time to see the next episodes to understand a grand story. This anime is light to watch and is very entertaining and enjoyable. Highly recommended anime!",22 out of 23 found this helpful.,9.0,9 November 2018

2793,The Disastrous Life of Saiki K., Funniest anime since Gintama.,"Saiki K is one of anime's greatest comedies that is less known despite being acknowledged as one of the greatest ongoing animes. Check all the funniest animes and I'm shocked to notice that this series still does not have the fame it deserves. It must be on par with gintama. The show appears first not to take itself seriously as most things are rushed through in the early episodes but it does one thing perfectly- makes you laugh on the turn of every single episode. Never have I enjoyed any anime comedy like this. The D.L. of Saiki K made me laugh so hard. The main character Kusuo is not the funniest centre of the show unlike Gintama, school days, or Toradora. The true gold of the show are the side characters: Nendou and co. So much attention is given to a large side characters who never disappoint and really make us laugh our hearts out. For Saiki having such abilities, one will think there will be main villain or something but no. Rarely is there a bad guy threatening the protagonists. Instead the show focuses on the slice of life, and really works on the comedy. What I like about this comedy is that it doesn't invest too much in parodies such as race jokes, poking other countries, anime titles, movies, etc. Instead the anime focuses on its own unique way of comedy and trust me it will really make you laugh. The animation is great and the pacing is great. However, more sequels should be released quickly because there is a whole lot of great arcs that can be taken from the manga. However, this anime is still stereotypical as art styles for black characters suck hard! Zolbe Kageyukouji is given a terrible art style. His lips for instance is the same as Takahasi's which is described as ugly by everyone in the show. That's very disappointing for these great Japanese shows. Look at Kilik Rung of Soul Eater and some blacks in Bleach. These are worthy of emulation. Zolbe also has those typical stereotypical ghetto character. Japanese artists and writers must really step up because there are a lot of black people who love anime but many turn away in disappointment because of silly blunders like these.Every single episode made me laugh.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,27 July 2020

But this also somewhat ruins the show because after a while, all it is about is how Kusuo finds creative ways (by abusing his powers) to avoid his classmates, instead of just telling them that he doesn't want to hang around with them. For example, there is a girl who clearly likes him, but instead of just telling her that he isn't interested, he plays the very cruel game of just avoiding her and playing mean tricks on her.<br/><br/>At this point, he ist just getting obnxious, and the show gets tedious to watch as most of the episodes just feel the same.

2802,The Disastrous Life of Saiki K., Excellent 1st season... but pretty much drops off from there.,"I loved this show's first season. It was probably the funniest animes I have ever watched although beyond the midway point of season 2, it kind of falls into mediocrity. If you want to have the most enjoyable experience, you should probably watch it until mid-season 2. Beyond that, you won't be missing much.<br/><br/>The show had a brilliant and funny premise of a kid called Saiki Kusuo who has powers that possibly rival character's like Goku but rather than being arrogant like your average hero, he is very down to earth and hates attention. You also have other characters such as Teruhashi and Nendo who were also very enjoyayble and funny... however, here comes the first flaw of the show.<br/><br/>By season 3, it has too much characters! Many appearances that by the end of season 2 ended up feeling forced, unnatural or out of the blue as if the writers just remembered about some of the character's existence. Another flaw to do with characters was flanderization (when a character trait is so exaggerated, it becomes the character.) Characters like Nendo got dumber and dumber and Teruhashi became more vulgar and mean and even Saiki himself lacked any character development and ended up making him feel more unpleasent as time when on.<br/><br/>It follows a 4 mini episode structure every episode which makes it easy to watch but that makes each segment feel very fast paced which is good if done right. Some stories are better than others but it was good for a while. The only thing is that it meant that they had to make so many mini episodes that they inevitably started running out of steam.<br/><br/>One other major flaw is repetitiveness. I noticed quite a lot of gags being repeated. Many plots like a girl liking Saiki (which are quite a few) have been reoccurring mostly with the same plot points and most end up getting forgotten other than Teruhashi and Aiura (introduced in Season 2). Post season 3, you kind of end up feeling like you are watching much of the same thing over and over again.<br/><br/>Here is my rating for each season:<br/><br/>Season 1: 9.5/10
Season 2: 6/10
Season 3: 5/10<br/><br/>To sum this LONG review up. Do I think Saiki K is a good show? Absolutely! Does this show have flaws? Yes. Many critical flaws which badly affected the show in the long run. Do I think Saiki K should have been a one season thing? Yes although there are a few highlights in other 2 seasons and Saiki K Reawakened (that in it's self is another subject).

2804,The Disastrous Life of Saiki K., It Takes You Back,"Here is what I like about it:
Saiki, when faced with difficult situations, maintains his composure and and takes his time to think. He then carries out the plan with responsibility and care. As the matter of fact almost all the characters do this in all kinds of situations. This might be easily overlooked but the fact is it's astonishing how much improvement could be brought to life if we stopped to think and yet how we far too easily forget about this precious superpower!
This show portraits Japanese etiquette all the time. It is great to see how much care the characters take in their mannerism and behavior. That, it matters to be polite and to avoid hurting people's feelings unnecessarily.
It also reveals some other aspects of Japanese culture such as preferring uncrowded yet very appealing and cosy interior designs, performing social duties, paying attention to details and valuing education.
But most importantly, with this you can travel back and experience being you when you were younger and remember how a lot of things felt back then. For instance, to remember what it is to love your parents, grandparents and friends as a kid, to timidly experience romance as a teenager and to be carefree ;)
It also makes you laugh even if you don't want to!",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,8.0,10 September 2020

Don't let the negative reviews keep you from watching it. I'm a seventh generation Texan from South Texas. It's as if the mythology of my family history has come to life. For anyone doubting the historical accuracy of the writing, simply google Mary Hefferman of Beeville, Texas for a brutal account of the violent clashes between whites and Indians. Or read up on the legacy of the famous King Ranch, whose Running W brand no doubt provided the inspiration for the McCoullough family ranch brand. The mythical depiction of the oil, the politics, the violence, the opulence, and the toughness of the people is all very real.

2808,The Son, A storytelling masterwork.,"This is a top-tier production in terms of acting, writing, directing, cinematography and the effort put into to accurately recreate 1915 south Texas. At first, I was a bit uncertain about Pierce Brosnan's seemingly self-conscious portrayal and iffy accent (he's an Irishman playing a Texan), but he quickly, comfortably settles in to his compelling character. The other actors are of the highest caliber, particularly the show's namesake played by Henry Garrett. The scenery is also beautifully shot. And the biggest surprise is the story itself, which becomes engrossing within 30 minutes into the pilot episode. I expect very, very good things from this show. Once again AMC proves they are serious about quality television, and I do hope viewers reward ""The Son"" because it entirely deserves your attention.<br/><br/>I should add a few people have noted some time-line discrepancies. These may exist, but they are completely unimportant. Some of the other reviews here seem to nitpick over ridiculous irrelevancies. I do not know how these people can enjoy television! We have to remember a product like this costs tremendous money for a television studio trying out an unproven new show without any guarantee of ratings, and we should at least be admiring of the effort put in.",69 out of 79 found this helpful.,10.0,16 April 2017
2809,The Son, This years best kept secret,"If you're reading this maybe your like me and your late to the party too! For whatever reason I held off on this show. Maybe it's because none of the reviews really sold me or I just simply put it off. HUGE MISTAKE! In hindsight best mistake, because I was just granted the luck of watching the best 8 hours of pure brilliance and all the while I kept asking myself, how is this series not a massive, massive hit! It's like a watching a great old fashion novel. I'm not writing this to tell you what it's about, no I'm writing this to sell you this series like I wish could have been done for me. There's flashbacks to the main character to his earlier years where he's held captive and it reminds me of dances with wolves in essence, and I literally yearn for the Flashbacks. Zahn McClarnon from Fargo season 2, plays an incredible part in the flashbacks as young Eli's captor, but what that relationship becomes is a prize to watch unfold. Both timelines are so fascinating and captivating that each one can have its own TV series! each timelines plot is so stunning and stellar and the way they both intertwine is beautiful. That's the only flaw with this series is I don't want to leave a particular time period because the story is told so richly. When we leave 1850 to return to 1915, I yearn for the earlier time period. It's absolutely riveting and captivating! This series has every key ingredient to mold a masterpiece of a series! pierce brosnan is incredible as well as the additional cast! so prepare yourself for a binging experience like no other! so whatever your doing right now stop and watch The Son!

2811,The Son, Authentic accounting of Indian raid,"Well, after one episode, this series looks promising. Mostly I would like to speak to it's authenticity, at least in regards to Indian raids. My husbands's great grandfather was Dot Babb, an Indian captive taken very much like shown in this series. His family was one of 3 ranches in northern Texas and while his father was away on a cattle drive, the Comanche Indians raided his ranch, brutally knifing and shooting an arrow through his mother to death. His baby sister was left to die (neighbors rescued her). Dot and his sister, Bianca, and the governess were taken as captives. At one point, he tried to help the governess escape and he was tied to a tree and the Comanche braves tried to break him down by shooting arrows very close to him. Then he was tied up and they put brush around him and made it look like they would set it afire. He was so stoic and showed no fear that they decided to make him a brave. He lived as a captive until his father rescued him. He was a friend of the Comanches all his life. Anyway, this part of this series is historically accurate. Dot authored a book about his captive experience and his early years as a Texan rancher, In the Bosom of the Comanches, available online through the Library of Congress. There are other captive stories similar to his and it appears perhaps these stories were used as reference for this series. So those unfamiliar with Texas history should read some actual first hand accounts by Texans.",97 out of 119 found this helpful.,8.0,9 April 2017
2812,The Son, Great first episodes!,"Yes, this series is a bit cruel, which is only realistic since it's set in early 1900 (and before). A show must be able to show topics like racism and savagery without people shouting ""it's a racist show!"" like one person did here. It has nothing to do with racism. The whites are not portrayed in a very favorable light at all many times, far from it. <br/><br/>The pacing is slow compared to more ""actioney"" shows like Hell on Wheels. It has a main and a secondary plot, both of which are very enjoyable. So far it does not contain any cheap nudity or such, which i think is welcome. <br/><br/>It's leaning far more towards realism than being over the top - everything from clothing to language e.g the native Americans speak their own language. So if you're expecting Xena in Texas, well, you'll be disappointed ;)<br/><br/>Like always I really enjoyed Zahn McClarnon's performance, great actor with such great presence.<br/><br/>Looking forward to see more.",65 out of 78 found this helpful.,8.0,9 April 2017

2815,The Son, Transitions,"This show's focus is on the relationship of a father to his son, only in this case we have several father-son relationships, including the young Eli McCullough (Jacob Lofland) and his Comanche captor (Zahn McClarnon), the elder Eli (Pierce Brosnan) and his two sons (Henry Garrett, David Wilson Barnes), and Eli's son (Henry Garrett) with his own son (Shane Graham).<br/><br/>Add to the father/son relationships is a West in transition, with the end of the Buffalo hunts in mid 19th century, and the faint beginnings of the oil industry in Texas in 1915.<br/><br/>If this isn't enough to entice you, throw in race relations, between the whites and the Indians and the whites and the Mexicans, and within the races, between those who practice compassion and those who do not, and those who have power and those who do not.<br/><br/>Onto this broad landscape we have marvelous photography, great location shots, and terrific acting.

What was probably meant was that Eli was born the year Texas won its independence from Mexico in 1836. In that case, Eli would be twelve years old when his character was introduced in Episode One.

2824,The Son, A Brutually Honest Western,"I really did not want to become involved in another AMC show. However since Hell on Wheels finished its run and enjoying Westerns I decided to give The Son a chance. This is an excellent western well written and acted. Pierce Brosnan and cast are outstanding. Although the western frontier was considered ""closed"" in 1890 there seems to be issues that need to be settled even in 1915. I look forward to seeing how this series goes forward. Although Gunsmoke &amp; earlier TV westerns were good drama The Son takes the Western to another level. At times brutal unflinching and unvarnished The Son probably presents a better idea of what the old West was really like. I enjoy the juxtaposition shown between the young Eli and the 1915 Eli. This isn't Dallas and with all due respect to the late Larry Hagman as good as he was in the role of JR Ewing, Pierce Brosnan's Eli would give JR a real run for the money.",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,,10 June 2017

2827,The Son," The Pioneer Spirit Of Texas, And The Guts And Guile That Made It What It Is Today","My great great grandfather, Hillary Bruce Bush, came to Texas from Scotland in 1836. He came across the Atlantic on a sailing ship, apparently landed at Baltimore, and then traveled overland to the Red River, where he took a ferry down to the new settlement of Bois de Arc, later renamed Bonham, after James Bonham, one of the heroes of the revolution of that year. 
As the revolution unfolded and Texas became an independent nation, my great great grandfather, along with other settlers who had arrived with him, carved out a niche for himself on the land he had acquired. He built a house, started growing crops, and married the daughter of his neighbor, the esteemed Edwin Clay Rogers. 
Eventually Hillary bought a slave to help with the work on his land, had four or five children with my great great grandmother Angeline, and joined with other Texas pioneers to petition the new government in Houston to name their part of Texas Fannin County, after James Fannin, another hero and martyr of the revolution. During the Cherokee War of 1839, he joined a militia, formed by local men to defend the community against Native American ""trepidations,"" called the Fannin County Mounted Gunman. 
Hillary died young, either from disease or at the hands of the Comanche or some other tribe, and Angeline got remarried to a man named Stephenson, a widower with several children of his own. She then, apparently, died shortly thereafter, and two of her sons, from Hillary, went on to fight for the Confederacy. 
After the South lost the civil war, and the Bush family lost land they had acquired on the Red River, the sons of both Hillary Bruce Bush and Stephenson, which included my great grandfather, also named Hillary Bruce, went off, in hopes of striking it rich, to Leadville, Georgetown, and Silver Plume, Colorado to dig for silver in the mines there. 
They never did get rich, but during that time my great grandfather did meet my great grandmother, Amelia Celia Tregoning, a tin miner's daughter from Cornwall, and they had several children, including my grandfather, James. 
The Hillary Bruce Bush family eventually gave up mining and moved back to Texas, where my grandfather met my grandmother, whose maiden name was Minnie Lee Rambo, and they had my dad, Joseph Jesse, who went on to be a war hero and survivor of the infamous Bataan Death March and three years in Japanese prisoner of war camp. 
The story continues from there, and there is much more to it, but suffice it to say, I was originally attracted to 'The Son,' on AMC, simply because it was about Texas pioneers. But as I continued to watch, I became more and more impressed by how it really does capture the spirit of Texas, and the guts and guile that enabled Texas to survive and thrive. 
'The Son' also effectively dramatizes the conflicts that often occurred between father and son. The disagreements between Eli McCullough and his son Pete, over Eli's tough traditionalism and Pete's softer modernism, accurately portray some of the same conflicts I had with my father and he with his. For example, after the war my father married my mother, a Spaniard with the maiden name Iglesias, and when my father and grandfather argued, my grandfather would often bring up and criticize the fact that my father had married a ""Mexican.""
In 'The Son,' the combination of light and dark, positive and negative, are well portrayed, both by the great writing and fine acting, which very ably expresses the truth that, in the creation of Texas and in the taming of the Texas territory, good and bad, and right and wrong, were not simply or easily defined. As I said, it took both guts and guile to make Texas what it is today. 
Finally, I've just had the privilege of working as an extra on an episode of the second season, and while I am not at liberty to discuss the episode, I can say that it was a real pleasure to work with a great bunch of background actors, an exceedingly friendly, welcoming, and helpful crew, and a very gracious bunch of professional actors. Especially Pierce Brosnan, a man who appears to bring a 'down to earth' friendliness to the set, which is apparently appreciated by all concerned. 
I'm looking forward to the second season of 'The son.' And, if you haven't watched it yet, I would highly recommend that you check it out. It's a good one.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,16 December 2017
2828,The Son, Show vs. Novel,"I have been watching this new show since the inception, but I also just started reading the novel from which it is based. Already of course there are players that are either not being depicted as in the novel or we are not getting any play on the characters that are in the book.<br/><br/>Thats okay though, I often have read the books before or after a movie or show only to notice characters have been added, changed or left out all together, perhaps so the show flows better with less characters or the story-lines can be more easily adapted. I get that.<br/><br/>I say the show is a 10 but it may come down as it proceeds, I feel as if the novel is maybe only 70 % of the show, or visa-versa, I see Eli has one more son in the novel as is being introduced in the show, I do not see reference of the granddaughter in the novel, only later, a great granddaughter.<br/><br/>I see the show as a good, rough, edgy TV drama, of course edgier than the old days, but today's TV audience, specially adults demand an adult drama. You are not watching Bonanza, and although my Mom would say Gunsmoke at the time was edgier than Bonanza at the time, I would have to say this meets the match of being what would be considered an adult Western, not a family Western.<br/><br/>Pierce Brosnan is believable as the Western Matriarch. Having an accent already makes him easier to believe than if a Californian attempted the roll, since the south has remnants of a European drawl....he is also an edgy actor, not fluff, so the roll fits very well.<br/><br/>The supporting actors are good, but since they are the spokes in the hub its hard to mess that up, but the lead son does act very much like the torn individual who is trying to hold the family together in very hairy times.<br/><br/>The flash backs are good, because it is showing how Eli matured and was created out of the horror of his family being killed and his maturing during his being kept as a slave in the Native American tribe that kept him. Yes it was an ugly time, something that is not often shown in family westerns.<br/><br/>I will report back but so far this is the only show I am looking forward to seeing every Saturday.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,29 April 2017

2832,United States of Tara," Despite a shaky Second Season, Thus far, ""United States of Tara"" is one of TV's Strongest Current Shows! Incredible and Touching!","A few weeks ago, a friend of mine encouraged me to watch Showtime's series ""United States of Tara."" I was unsure, as I had heard the concept and expected something silly and outlandish, but I gave it a shot, because I'm a fan of creator Diablo Cody's film ""Juno"", and I had heard that Steven Spielberg was an executive producer. He popped in the DVD, and we watched the pilot on his computer. The instant it ended, I pushed him away, loaded up Amazon and ordered the first two seasons for myself! I was that taken by the show! Within two days of the DVDs arriving, I had watched both seasons, ran to my mothers house, hijacked her TV (and her Showtime on Demand), and watched every single episode available! ""United States of Tara"" is easily one of the best shows on TV right now. It is an often poignant, thoroughly dramatic, and generally hilarious look at the life of a woman suffering from dissociative identity disorder, and how she tries to hold her family together through her struggles.<br/><br/>Toni Collette easily earns her Emmy Award as Tara, the star of the show, and her (thus far) seven ""alters"" (her alternate personalities) who take over when Tara cannot deal with reality. The performance Collette gives is incredible, because Tara and each of the alters is it's own ""being"", with its own style, voice and traits. For all intent and purpose, Collette has played eight characters on the show, often switching between 2-4 per episode.<br/><br/>John Corbett, Keir Gilchrist, Brie Larson and Rosemarie DeWitt round out the cast as Tara's supportive (almost to the point of breaking) husband, her kind-hearted son (who happens to be gay), her sometimes troubled teenaged daughter, and her somewhat self-absorbed sister, respectively. This is one of those rare casts that perfectly ""gels"", and there is no sore thumb in sight!<br/><br/>The show itself is well structured. While I had heard it was comedic, it is actually more often a very serious drama, with comedy thrown in. While you will laugh at it, and with it, you will also often find yourself ready to shed a tear for the characters. Cody and the other writers prove themselves, establishing and paying off characters masterfully, in ways that most shows could only dream of. Story lines also draw you in, and you will feel a very human suspense. This is a show that feels real, feels edgy, feels funny... It just works.<br/><br/>Thus far, the show is comprised of three seasons (I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a fourth, despite season 3's lower ratings). This is why the show didn't get a perfect 10 from me- a slight inconsistency with the second season's quality. The first season was outstanding. It truly was one of a kind. It tugged at my heart, and made me laugh. The second season was at times just a bit too... ""blah."" It was occasionally too dark (more than once forcing story lines and images that felt just too darned uncomfortable, and derivative of the first season), and it felt like there wasn't as much happening. It was still good, but it wasn't as fresh. There wasn't quite the sense of urgency that season one seemed to ooze. It felt like, for lack of better word, an unneeded movie sequel- sure, it's fun to catch up with the characters, but it's not quite as fresh. Thankfully, it did finally get back on track as the season wrapped up, and the finale was heartfelt and worth the ""wonky"" earlier episodes. And I'm happy to report that Season Three (the current season) is arguably just as good, it not better, than the first season! It was quite a comeback, and I'm glad the show found its legs again.<br/><br/>All-in-all, I highly recommend ""United States of Tara"" to all open-minded people who want a touching, thought-provoking and smart comedy-drama to follow. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's a phenomenal show overall, despite an only so-so second season. I give it a near-perfect 9 out of 10!",23 out of 24 found this helpful.,9.0,15 May 2011

Someone else mentioned that this is not the typical family, but what the heck IS a typical family? As for making a joke out of rape and incest, I don't find that to be the case here at all.

Normal day-to-day activities can turn upside down, and planning things can become impossible due to the unpredictability of it all. Even going to your job every day can be a challenge. Then there are days where everything seems perfectly normal.<br/><br/>And that's an area they only lightly touched on. The suicide ideation/attempts, raging, depression, guilt, eating disorders, emergencies, money problems, lack of boundaries... these are much more severe and common than what they showed (but that probably wouldn't make for an as entertaining series.) And, at least in my wife's case, her alters aren't as well defined or as persistent. Some don't even have names, and frequently there is just dissociation without alters. None of them wear different clothes.<br/><br/>The difficulty with getting proper treatment is also shown. But they didn't touch on the cost very much. Most insurances must ""pre-approve"" treatment for mental health issues, which is a joke. Break your leg, go to the hospital. Have a meltdown and need immediate counseling? Ask your insurance for permission first. And don't even think about paying for it out of your own pocket (unless you're independently wealthy, which you probably aren't since someone with DID isn't likely to be holding down a job).<br/><br/>Overall, an entertaining but also educational look at DID. Someone did their homework.",19 out of 21 found this helpful.,9.0,13 September 2014
2837,United States of Tara, A very entertaining and promising show,"I'm unsure as to why there's so much negative reaction. Perhaps people are burnt out on the whole Sundance-is-hip thing and have form a I'm-even-more-obscure crowd. The dialog is clever, the acting -- especially by the magnificent Toni Collette -- is surprisingly good, the plot has been interesting so far and nothing seems forced. There are few shows on TV nowadays -- including the ever declining Weeds -- that I think have such merits going for it.<br/><br/>Toni portrays her personalities wonderfully; a very broad range of personalities. There's so much articulation in the portrayal of mixed happiness and stress in her family -- portrayed wonderfully by the cast.<br/><br/>It's only been on for one season but I can definitely see this being a show I will hold onto.",56 out of 72 found this helpful.,9.0,22 September 2009

2840,United States of Tara, Putting the FUN back into Dysfunctional!,"I absolutely loved this show! Why oh why didn't they make a 4th season?!<br/><br/>This show touches on some serious issues: DID and childhood sexual abuse being the most prominent ones (as well as homophobia, under age sex) and I can see why people are keen to spout righteous indignation before having even seen how they have dealt with this in the show. I have personal experience in both these issues and I can honestly say that it is done in a very respectful, courageous and thoughtful way. It is not entirely realistic in places, of course there is plenty of artistic license involved but this is a work of fiction, not a documentary! I also believe in the importance of using humour in order to get through life, even at the most tragic of situations and I don't feel that this show was in any way belittling, damaging or insensitive to the issues it included. It is heartbreaking in places and absolutely hilarious in others, but the humour is timely and appropriate. It is not exploitative or mocking in any way and despite its creative license dismissing a few real life technicalities, I don't believe that it does a disservice to those affected by DID or CSA.<br/><br/>Toni Colette is absolutely superb in this as she switches in between her 4/5/6? 'alters' and she plays each one to perfection. Her 'Buck' character is hilarious and between them all it just shows her range as an actress.<br/><br/>The relationship between her and her patient and loving husband Max is endearing and beautiful. To people who are saying that she is a b*tch (can you imagine just for 2 seconds what it is like for her knowing what her condition does to those she loves without having any real control over it?! It is exhausting for one and puts you in a permanent state of guilt and self absorption) and saying that he's too sweet/saintly and it's too unrealistic etc, you have clearly never met a couple who are completely in love, no matter what life throws at them. This couple clearly has that, he is devoted to her and contrary to what your jaded life experience may have taught you, this kind of love and commitment and support exists! Go back to sex in the city if you want to believe that is what true love (ie compromising for the rest of your life with an incompatible pig) is all about.<br/><br/>The love/hate relationship between the two sisters (Charmaine and Tara) and the way that the whole family interacted with each other was touching and remarkably well done. Yes of course the characters quirks were all slightly heightened, but again this is TV land, do you really want to watch a show of a bunch of people just like your next door neighbours who pretend to be 'normal' for the cameras every night? I don't think so. It isn't overly done on the quirky factor.<br/><br/>The son, a quiet, intelligent introvert is lovable and sweet and mature beyond his years but this is quite realistic of someone who has had to grow up with a young mother who suffers from a disruptive mental health problem. It is just as likely for a child to become rebellious, wild and want to grow up fast just as the daughter does. Again the relationship between them is realistic enough and a pleasure to watch. All of the characters are developed really well as the show goes on, particularly that of Tara's younger sister Charmaine who is self indulgent and uptight to begin with before she unfolds as a complete wreck and then becomes more lovable as time goes on. Tara's character also develops well as do all of the alters (although realistically they are not as multi faceted as Tara as herself)<br/><br/>Eddie Izzard, despite him being a better comedian than he is an actor, did a great job in this too. I thought his character was great and he gave a sincere performance.<br/><br/>The message that far surpasses the subject of psychiatry is one of love. It's about how we connect to each other in our relationships and the strength we can find in family and friendship. It is a feast for anyone who enjoys quirky, flawed but endearing characters, has a vague interest in psychology (but doesn't feel the need for 100% accuracy from a TV drama) and doesn't mind peeking into the lives of a liberal, colourful and unique family for laughs and a warm fuzzy feeling. It has plenty of drama and a few cliffhangers to say the least! As well as sex, drugs and jazz!",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,4 May 2013
2841,United States of Tara, United States of an American family,"Despite I am from Brazil, I can understand the middle class American family and, I must say, has a lot of similitude with the middle class Brazilian family. The point that make they different is the history of each country.<br/><br/>The American culture is formed by the problems in the middle class of the United States. United States of Tara has a plot, in my personal opinion, that shows the problems, desires and frustrations through the relationship of a family which has a mom suffering from personality disturb, played by Toni Collette. Each personality shows a piece of the middle class family. <br/><br/>Until this sitcom I have never saw Toni Collette as a great actress, since I saw her interpretation in United States of Tara, I must say that I'm in love for her work. She gave so much life for the personalities inside the character, that until now I am very impregnated. <br/><br/>Hence, this is a must see show. My only doubt here is if Diablo Cody will have the ability to continuous to write for several seasons without destroy the idea and keeping the viewers attention.",23 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,15 March 2010
2842,United States of Tara, Very Disappointing.,"I heard that the creators/writers (presumably Spielberg/Cody) had spoken with ""experts"" on DID yet Diabo Cody didn't want her main character to have a ""mental affliction"". That in itself doesn't make sense at all. I am very disappointed in all of the artists attached to this series. The series begins with ""Tara not taking her DID medication"" thus the whole platform is false, as there is no medication for DID. I would think that if one studied DID, they would be more respectful to people who had their childhood stolen from them from predators and their adulthood stolen from them from the disorder and all its accompanying disorders. I don't think a comedy full of overblown, misunderstood concepts would even cross a humane persons' mind.. If I were them, I would claim ignorance of the development of DID, it made me uncomfortable, feeling like the producers, crew and affiliates of this production are advocates of repetitive, on going, horrific torture of children, involving but not limited to a childhood of mental torture, years rape, group rape, involuntary isolation, molestation, penetration into the body with inanimate objects, simulated drowning, being chained, flogged, beat, lit on fire, burnt with irons; basically atrocities in the developmental years. Since obviously, they are now capitalizing upon it. I am most disappointed in Spielberg. What's next a Musical Schindler's List??? Or Comedy in the Camps??? Ridiculous.

2843,United States of Tara, This was horrible and another sign that the Sundancification of Hollywood must stop.,"After watching the pilot of the United States of Tara I felt I had to write a review.<br/><br/>This is horrible! And the fact that some ""indie"" fans on IMDb are applauding it is just sad IMHO. More and more a small minority of pretentious people are getting to call the shots in Hollywood and the results have been a disaster.<br/><br/>Showtime which was making some inroads against HBO by producing some good shows seems to now want to imitate them and the results for Showtime will be the same as for HBO. Cult fans for shows that regular people realize are stupid, low ratings and a lack of profits.<br/><br/>Fey, silly, quirkfests that rely on phony unrealistic story lines are the style that comes straight from crappy mostly unwatched Sundance films. Big on the festival circuit, BO flops when they go wide.<br/><br/>And yeah, I know Juno and Little Miss Sunshine were hits. I also know Chumscubber, Hamlet 2 and Eagle Vs. Shark had straight to DVD numbers when they were released.<br/><br/>Toni Collette is awful in this show. It was like watching a bad actor's exercise. John Corbett was likable, but could have just as easily been playing the new boyfriend on an episode of The New Adventures of Old Christine, the 20 year old that is playing a 15 year old was ridiculous because she plays much older, maybe that's why I wasn't creeped out about the teen sex until they said she was 15 in the show and then I just thought - ""no, no, no!!!"" another Diablo Cody creepy storyline that is so phony its ridiculous - and then there's the young boy - everything about him was phony - the kid in Two and Half Men is more realistic than this ""kid"" - a total writer's indulgence - And that's not even getting into the stupid ""storyline"" and the ""goth kid"" straight out of a 1980's John Hughes film - unbelievable -",131 out of 280 found this helpful.,3.0,10 January 2009
2844,United States of Tara, Not the sum of it's parts,"The opinion on this show seems divided, mostly because the show is extremely well done, and has stellar acting and some truly clever dialogue, but is also plagued with a self-conscious need-to-be-hip which ultimately begins to feel both preachy and forced (much as happened with Six Feet Under, another Showtime project).<br/><br/>Firstly, Toni Collete's acting is superb. Some people complain that it isn't an accurate portrayal of DID, and this may very well be the case; but this is a TV drama, not a documentary, and it's the depth and degree to which T.C. plays her characters that give this show so much strength. This is a show about one person's disorder and how it effects her family, not the whole community of people who suffer from DID. In this regard, the show is compelling and establishes a range of situational dramas that are much more original than any family-based drama has been in some while.<br/><br/>Much of the show deals with Tara trying to figure out why it is that she suffers DID in the first place, since this condition is usually premised by something traumatic in childhood (usually sexual abuse). This storyline is handled quite well, and becomes a more intriguing mystery as the show proceeds.<br/><br/>The other 'main' focus of the show deals with the complications arising from Tara's condition --- that her 'alters' have their own sexual libidos and desires, for instance, which strain Tara's marriage; that she may slip into another persona at critical moments (which sometimes turns out for the better, amusingly). This part of the show is also handled extremely well.<br/><br/>The dialogue is also notably better than the dialog in many shows as of late. There are some truly laugh-out-loud exchanges between characters, and a good deal of realistic conversation, as well. Most importantly, all the characters (even the alters) all have distinct ways of explaining, presenting, and relaying information. For the most part, it's an impressively solid bit of dialogue writing.<br/><br/>But alas, U.S.O.T. does suffer from some rather unfortunate indulgences, as well. Namely, it wears it's liberalism a bit too proudly on it's sleeve not to become preachy. The main place where this is evident is in the subplot through the series of Marshall (Tara's son) coming to grips with his own homosexuality as he grows up; personally, I think it's a brilliant way to toy around with the theme of identity, as it extends outside Tara's disorder. However, this subplot is handled so clumsily that it comes across as self-righteous and quite forced. It's as if Showtime decided they needed something edgy, and defaulted to 'gay teens', since that's apparently not been done enough. As more emphasis is put upon how gay Marshall is, he becomes a less and less interesting character, defined only by the fact that he's gay, rather than layered and clever as he is in the first season.<br/><br/>Another problem with the series is the formulas which it creates for itself with promising relationships turning bad. As new romantic interests are introduced, these new characters seem sweet and interesting, but all eventually turn out to be secretly neurotic stalkers and sociopaths. It gets a bit cliché within the small confines of the show, and sadly predictable.<br/><br/>Again, this show bears a lot of the same structural strengths and weaknesses of Six Feet Under (although U.S.O.T. is decidedly funnier and less bleak), so if you enjoyed Six Feet Under, you'd probably like this. If you found Six Feet Under too lacking substance for all it's provocation, then you'll find that same disappointment here, and this show's probably not for you.<br/><br/>Definitely worth trying, if for nothing else just to see Toni Collete's impressive acting.",22 out of 39 found this helpful.,6.0,15 June 2010
2845,United States of Tara, The Trouble With Tara...,"The United States of Tara has a few crucial issues and they could be potentially fatal.<br/><br/>Let's be clear. This show is NOT a sitcom, as it was first promoted by Showtime. It's a thirty minute ""dramedy."" That in itself isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does represent a kind of false advertising for the program. You aren't going to find the laughs of a ""How I Met Your Mother"" or even ""The New Adventures of Old Christine"" here.<br/><br/>What we do have is Toni Collette in what amounts to a tour-de-force role as 4 different characters, brought on by DID: Dissociative Identity Disorder. She becomes a teenage slut, a Vietnam vet (so ""he"" claims), and a happy homemaker in addition to her regular self: mom to two teens, wife to a landscaper husband and sibling to a financially troubled sister.<br/><br/>There are several glaring issues about this situation, and I'm not even discussing the question of whether it's OK or not to use DID as the impetus for the show's action. That is a separate argument that, believe it or not, isn't related to my criticism of what's going on here.<br/><br/>The first issue is based on the use of drugs and alcohol. We are told that Tara was on prescription drugs to control these ""alts"" and had recently come off of them so she could live a more focused life. Yet she is very often drinking on the program: beer and wine are the most common choices, but even hard liquor has been seen. The use of alcohol in this situation makes me question how serious this character is about getting better. If the alts appear when she is unhappy, drinking alcohol, a known depressant, would be a huge mistake. Also, why would her therapist permit that kind of behavior? <br/><br/>In addition, the characters do not relate well to each other. It seems as if they each have their own agenda and have no connection to what anyone else is doing, creating logic gaps. For example, Tara's sister Charmaine is trying to sell products. One of her ""team mates"" hires Tara to paint a mural for her, but Charmaine spills the info about Tara's alts to this unrelated person. <br/><br/>Charmaine first claims that she didn't tell, but then admits to it. This upsets Tara. Why, if everyone knows about Tara's DID, does she get upset when Charmaine explained it to her client, and why did Charmaine lie to Tara about telling? Wouldn't it be one or the other? Then, after an evening of drink, (there's the alcohol) one of the alts defaces Tara's mural for the client with a horrible comment etched into the wall. What? There needs to be a certain logic within the framework of the show, some basic rules that the characters need to respond to in order for it to make sense in its own reality and I simply do not see that working here.<br/><br/>Also troubling is the point of this isn't clear. What are we learning (or even observing) here? To indicate Tara's ""changes"" they have tried an audio cue (a little tone) and even a visual cue (the image going unfocused for a moment) and that seems awkward. We see Tara suffering through the issues of what her alts do, but I don't get any sense that there is any progress.<br/><br/>Perhaps worst of all, the dialog seems to be uninspired. Characters say things I couldn't imagine ""real"" people saying in some circumstances here, and that's always a bad sign.<br/><br/>Originally, I gave the show a 7, based on the pilot alone. Having seen more episodes, I've lowered this to a 5 and I can say that this show is in trouble, but I believe it can be fixed.<br/><br/>The key is related to how the characters interact. Yes, each one of them has a list of things that they want. But to make the plots move in a logical way, they all have to interconnect. Buck buys (or rents) a bunch of porn DVDs. Where does he get the money? The alts apparently are able to use Tara's credit cards. Does this make any sense? There are several gaps of this sort within this framework of the story and they could be series killers.<br/><br/>My advice to Diablo Cody and Steven Spielberg: stay small, stay focused and stay logical. A series like this, with one actor playing 4 characters can get very sloppy very quickly, so everything needs to make sense. The smaller, more focused the stories are, the more genuine it's all going to seem.",64 out of 132 found this helpful.,5.0,3 February 2009

2847,United States of Tara," A Disgusting, Inaccurate Portrayal of a Very Tragic Disorder","Apparently Showtime doesn't want to know the REAL facts about DID, and what a person who has DID struggles with on an hourly basis. I feel insulted to have received an obvious ""form email letter"" in response to my heartfelt email to Showtime. What I saw in the first episode, is that Mr. Spielberg is using ""sex, sex, and more sex"", to sell a series. The second episode was even more disappointing.<br/><br/>At least with the massive number of anti-Tara emails that Showtime obviously has received from DID sufferers, they have included an ""informative"" video from Dr. Kluft; however, even in his short documentary, he did not address the magnitude of the horrific childhood sexual abuse that causes Dissociative Identity Disorder. The so called ""consultant"" that the writer, Diablo Cody is conferring with, had DDNOS, not DID. Apples and oranges... sigh.<br/><br/>Imagine for a moment, if you can: A new Showtime series called, ""The Deformed State of Tara"" - a COMEDY about a girl who confronts comedic situations in her every day life revolving around her dealing with her inability to climb stairs, her sexual encounters, and her comedic experiences with people staring at her scarred and deformed face and arms. (As a child, her parents had physically abused her so intensely, that her repeatedly broken bones resulted in a leg amputation, and the repeated burns the parents inflicted on her arms and face resulted in grotesque scarring which made her face appear as almost inhuman.)<br/><br/>This scenario is NO DIFFERENT than creating a ""COMEDY"" about a person who suffers from a disorder caused by repeated, early childhood RAPE AND INCEST. One might say that the results of childhood physical abuse are apparent to outsiders, but the results of childhood sexual abuse resulting in Dissociative Identity Disorder are also readily apparent to others in public.

It's a great showcase for Toni's acting talents...but that's what it boils down to, a stunt to showcase an actress's range. It was much better artistically and commercially when it was called The Tracy Ullman Show. Each character was fully developed as a sketch, and Tracy could return to each character week after week without having to worry about a narrative arc.<br/><br/>I liked Juno and think Diablo has a real ear and eye for quirky speech and behavior, but she doesn't know when an idea should be a movie or a TV series. This might have made an OK one-off film, where you have time for development and you're not bound by the 28 minute clock. But this just seems half baked and striving for something it never can achieve....a real family trying to cope with an amazingly rare syndrome that has lasted for 17 years!!!! Gimme a break.

2850,United States of Tara, Porn Without the Action,"Brilliant in that it sums up in one half hour how incredibly lost our culture is at present. These are talented gifted folks, the writing is good better than good, the acting too. The result is a show that is awful and at the same time all too watchable. Its just another original series from one of the subscription channels who honor a corporate mission statement that must read, 'people will watch anything with or related somehow to raunch and sex'. <br/><br/>Toni Collette whom i used to really respect, has bitten the forbidden fruit by accepting this role. Great actress, and she holds her own, but this is embarrassing. She plays a woman suffering from a multiple personality disorder who could be in a straight jacket, but instead lives as a happy housewife/mom tormenting her family with her perverse alter egos. These things are sometimes mildly funny when executed in a sketch format as farce, but not like this. Predictably, Tara is presented not as farce, but as some twisted vision of reality the series producers have created that begs our acceptance. With most other Sopranopera possibilities exhausted, little else remains but to turn mental illness into dark comedy. Sybil, the PG-13 sitcom. If this all seems unimportant to you then you will be delighted to learn the entire premise really isn't important anyway because what is the show really about?

2854,United States of Tara, A huge thing for something not so interesting,"We know Diablo Cody. She's the one that got famous with that Juno kid. She's smart, a lot intelligent and her mind is a terrific machine expressing thru modern writing and fictitious characters her own experiences and her interesting point of view as an observer. And now, she joined forces with Steven Spielberg in a so daring project. Having a SPIELBERG name in the show doesn't necessarily mean that it's good, just means that things are some way easier. Anyway... there's something that keeps punching my head: why is Spielberg in it? I mean... this show is completely out of his style.<br/><br/>Tara is another desperate housewife, but instead of having 4 friends also desperate, she has 4 different personalities, each one of them with their own problems. After watching entire first season, my general impression is that things got really interesting just after the 8th episode and that happened just because I forced myself to keep watching it cause I could see the great potentials on the show, but I couldn't feel it till that time. The show lacks of straightness, I mean... you don't know if it's a comedy, a drama, a dramedy... or whatever. Until 7th episode, despite some great acting level, something was missing and everything in it was always ""a half"": half of drama, half of comedy, half thrilling, half interesting, half funny... a bunch of ""halfs"" that together wasn't giving a ""whole"". There are shows that writers know how to travel thru these different kinds of styles as natural as a linear plot, but seems that Diablo was lost someway in her creation. On the last 4 episodes, drama was the highest point and that was comforting because some things just stopped being a blur in a point that I was not pushing myself to understand the point of everything anymore. We can feel that Diablo just relaxed on her ideas in the last episodes, because things were flowing with no pressures, and that's the tone that I was expecting during entire show, so I hope she keeps herself relaxed for the 2nd season.<br/><br/>About the actors, well... At first this show got my attention because Toni Collette is in it, she is awesome, and great roles is all what she needs because she's a lot versatile and for someone being Tara, Alice, Buck, T and the other strange one... there must be a lot versatile and she's doing an excellent work and is holding entire show on her back, her performance is mesmerizing as Tara or as any of her alters, mainly as Alice and Buck. Keir Gilchrist, as Marshall, is being a gem in the show... Although the show suffers from some problems, the subtlety under the character's teenage homosexuality is a very interesting thing that only Diablo would be able to explore amazingly and shameless. Kate (Brie Larson), is a very interesting character, dealing with those teenage existence crisis, never knowing what to do, what to want, what to expect.<br/><br/>The show also worths attention just for the interesting fact that Diablo's handling entire show not only as a creator but as a producer and writer - and maybe as a director in the future, who knows - but I think that after Juno and her Oscar, she's overrating herself and her capacities a lot in this project. It's not a bad show, but it's far from being one of the best things. In my opinion, the show still needs improvements inserting more substantial facts, replacing blank fields with things that would make audience keeps their attention or expecting something far from the obvious as happened just in the last four episodes. It was hard to know what was the point of entire show as its plot is a huge thing for something that seems not so interesting or different from what we're seeing in television right now. I repeat, it's not a bad show, and not an excellent one either, but it has excellent potentials to be something much better than it's being and I'm hopping for it.",43 out of 94 found this helpful.,6.0,10 March 2009
2855,United States of Tara, Brilliant!!!!!,"I just can't understand what all the complaints are about - I just find this show one of the absolute best shows on TV today. Snappy and funny writing, great acting and interesting universe. The acting by Marshall and Kate alone is sublime, and the character of Max is just so moving. And really, for the once I feel this universe is expandable way beyond the first season, the problem I feel plagues so many series these days. Perhaps I'm so happy about it since I had no expectations - I live in Europe and have never seen the promo(that has put off a few) or care about who's producing, who's writing and so on.

I don't care for anime in general, but I do love a good story told well. The animation is rough at first, but even that is just kind of cool. Seasons 1 and 2 are character and world building. Then season 3+, the show gets truly amazing. They're artful with the death and gore instead of bloody and gross, so even though the fights are intense (and definitely have consequences for the warrior heroes), it isn't bloody and realistic. Beasts break into ash when killed, and blood is shown like rose petals most of the time. The story is extremely good as it moves forward.

2860,RWBY, A great new show from the makers of Red vs Blue,"I'm not going to sugar coat it. Yes, most of the episodes are very short, even by anime/cartoon standards, and the voice acting is sometimes a bit off. <br/><br/>Saying that, this is the first time that Rooster Teeth have attempted this kind of show, so this season is basically a test run. As with all of RT's productions, you can tell that they are making this because they WANT to make it, not just to widen their appeal. When comparing it to other anime shows, you have to take into account that most of them have quite wealthy companies producing them, and this is being funded by Rooster Teeth alone. There wouldn't be much point pouring lots of funding into something that could be a complete failure. Expect a lot more from the next series.<br/><br/>The characters have plenty of room for character growth and when the fight scenes happen, you are so amazed by them that you no longer care how rare they are. <br/><br/>Overall, I would say that while there is lots of room for improvement, it is a great series to watch when you just want to take it easy and have a good time.",54 out of 69 found this helpful.,10.0,8 October 2013

2862,RWBY, An achievement beyond my comprehension,"I first became acquainted with the RoosterTeeth anime-not-anime when one of my Canadian friends posted the ""Red Trailer"" on facebook. I assumed it was a trailer for a video-game, but really liked what I saw. I watched the three successive trailers with much delight, but then managed to forget about the series.<br/><br/>Around late 2014/early 2015 I re-discovered the series, and absolutely adored the first volume. There was something about the notion of Red Riding Hood - aided by Goldilocks, Belle and Snow White - decapitating an enormous monster raven by means of a machine-gun-scythe that I found VERY enjoyable.<br/><br/>The second volume continued on the tradition of the first, becoming a highly entertaining and emotionally satisfying webseries masterpiece.<br/><br/>Since then, with Volume 3, Miles Luna, Kerry Shawcross, Gray G. Haddock and the rest of the geniuses over at RoosterTeeth have honoured the memory of the irreplaceable Monty Oum and crafted an unbelievable saga, a truly exceptional experience: well-conceived, well-written, well-directed, well- designed, well-acted, well-composed... I could go on for quite some time.<br/><br/>""RWBY"" is, quite simply put, one of the greatest narrative achievements. Ever. Of all time.",43 out of 57 found this helpful.,10.0,13 February 2016
2863,RWBY, A RWBY in the rough,"When I first heard of this show I never thought I would watch it beyond just curiosity at this indie passion project, let alone review it professionally. I was barely interested in the first volume, but the more I watched the more the setting and cast captivated me. In fact, the sheer grandeur of the most recent volume convinced me to actually review it. I will admit that I wasn't impressed by RWBY's start, but honestly, when it started who expected this indie web series to become the astounding masterpiece it is now?<br/><br/>Story: The story starts out very straight forward but gets deeper and more complex as time goes on. It has a way of taking very common storylines/themes and while sticking to the typical guns with them in a lot of ways the show provides a unique spin on them. A big way it does this is with the characters, which definitely fit certain archetypes but have a depth and emotional connection strong enough to make any used plot line feel fresh and new. It's a high fantasy that methodically unveils the secret history of the world through multiple characters and at different points in the plot. All in all, RWBY is one of the greatest western fantasies of all time, with spectacular action to boot. The action is also quick but easy to follow, none of that minute-long inner monologue during the fight garbage.<br/><br/>Art: I was not a fan of the early volume's art style, however the later volumes are some of the best in western animation. But the show doesn't have enough sakuga scenes. When it does shine, though, it does so nigh-perfectly. Action packed moments that are animated well in the show are great, and its Monty and the RoosterTeeth animators doing their job right.<br/><br/>Character and world-building: The characters designs are great. The characters themselves are constantly growing and each offer a unique perspective, whilst the world-building is simply phenomenal and really differentiates itself from the lazy world-building in modern western animation. There is a huge learning curve for the main characters, and you are really able to see them grow in terms of ability and character. All the characters learn and grow through their character arcs which is incredibly relatable. Ironwood is an amazing character and his philosophical dissension with Oz is wonderful.<br/><br/>Music: The music is god-tier and fits every moment perfectly. The opening and closing credits also contain excellent songs and imagery that change to match the tone of each arc. The intro's and outro's, rather than being a jumble of random scenes like most shows, give subtle hints as to how the story will unfold. Only as you progress will you be able to appreciate how much thought and intelligence went into making them. Plenty of shows make a custom soundtrack for the show, but RWBY is the best and Jeff Williams masterfully incorporates the show's themes and the character's psychology into the soundtracks.<br/><br/>Criticism: RWBY has a really slow start, I only watched the whole thing by accident. But I do appreciate the attention to detail in the early volumes, I only caught most of the mythological and fairy tale allusions and foreshadowing on my second viewing. Many viewers don't understand the character interactions, world-building and set ups in the early volumes, leading them to drop or hate the show. The arcs are also very long for how short each volume is, and some viewers might have already lost interest or forgotten vital information foreshadowed before by that point. It's necessary for the pay offs later but many viewers might have already dropped the show and missed its greatness.<br/><br/>I just wish Monty could see the fruits of his passion project, thank you for creating this GOAT show.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,4 April 2021
2864,RWBY, Continue Past Season 1,The animation was suffering in season 1 however every season the animation gets better while maintaining its own style.

2865,RWBY," An incredible series as a whole, but has some issues that might detract from the amazing bigger picture and deter potential fans","I am a huge RWBY fan. With the combination of a very original idea, insane but believable fight scenes, and (normally) well-written characters that you either love or love-to-hate, it has the makings for a real hit. At the very least, I fell in love with it. However, there were some stumbles along the way that might turn off potential viewers.<br/><br/>The first - and most obvious - of these stumbles is the animation of the first and (at times) second season. Even the most avid RWBY fan will admit that the first season's animation is problematic. However, this problem is mostly remedied by the second season, and the third season is masterfully made. The fourth and fifth seasons use a different animation engine, which radically improves the overall look of the show while staying true to RWBY's core art style. Beautiful.<br/><br/>Another major stumble is the show's pacing and writing, especially during the fourth and fifth seasons. The one of the reasons behind this particular problem is because Monty Oum, the creator of the show, passed away in the middle of the third season. Without his vision, there are times where the show kind of slumps where it really shouldn't. Monty was also one of the show's primary animators, and as he choreographed many of the fight scenes, they also tended to suffer (although it seems that the creators of RWBY are stepping it up in this regard).<br/><br/>Apparently, many fans out there have problems with the voice acting. However, besides the rare display of Annoying Voice Syndrome and some occasional moments where I wish things were said differently, I've never really had any problems with the voice acting. To each their own, I guess.<br/><br/>Yes, this show has some problems. Yes, it isn't perfect. But you'll almost never find a show that meshes out-of-this-worle action, a compelling story, and feels to boot. IMHO, the show's strengths greatly outshine its weaknesses; without spoiling anything, there's a reason I gave this show a 9 out of 10. Come into this show with an open mind, and your mind will be blown.",15 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,22 August 2018
2866,RWBY, Refreshing and underated,"One of the most interesting things about the show is the fact that it does not care about originality.
In a time where every other piece of media out there is trying to be new and original, RWBY accepts the fact that nothing is original. Everything has been done before.
And it uses it's unoriginality to further it's story and it's themes.<br/><br/>In a volume all about whether or not Ironwood and his well-meaning authoritarianism can be trusted, how better to get the audience to doubt his benevolence than to introduce the legendary hero Robin Hood in opposition to him?<br/><br/>Want your audience to immediately doubt and distrust an authority figure? Make him the known con-man, the Wizard of Oz.<br/><br/>Want to imply a backstory of abuse years before it's going to be revealed to the audience? Why not Cinderella?<br/><br/>RWBY is a story written by people who understand their audience has seen other stories before.

It doesn't take long to get good, and it only gets better.<br/><br/>On my first rewatch now, think I got lost somewhere in season five. Seriously thinking the entire series was some kind of dare with Monty Oum. ""Oh yeah? If writing compelling female characters is so easy, why don't you do it?"" So he did, and it's pretty amazing. And it's not just one, but there's so many to choose from, and he managed to do it without making the male characters unrelatable. Might be the first time ever.<br/><br/>Really doesn't matter who you are, this is a great series to push through. So many brilliant firsts.<br/><br/>RIP Monty Oum (1981-2015).

Now, I am through season 2 and I love it. The music is great, the story is interesting, and the animation fits the show perfectly. While the episodes are short, they do rival their TV counterparts in quality and length doesn't make a difference. RWBY is better quality than Cartoon Network shows and is definitely worth the watch. It stands up to RT's Red vs Blue, and is more family friendly. The main characters are very good and can be related to. This show is overall very awesome, but it does have an acquired taste.

Vol. 2 still has writing that is alright but not great, but animation has improved and the fighting scenes are VERY fun to watch. Even with the not so great writing it manages to have cool characters with some of the most unique weaponry I've ever seen. Voice acting is sometimes a problem and can be a bit wonky or even cringe-worthy, however most of that has to do with the poor writing in most cases.

Yes, there are holes in the details of the script, and some of the dialogue could be better, and we all could find improvement in the acting.
And yes, it's an Australian production, so it's a slow burner, it's a cultural thing.
But when was the last time the ABC (or anybody else?) put out a watchable drama series located in the WA outback? The scenery and locations alone are atmospheric.
We should welcome good drama that comes from a different place and perspective. Not all police procedurals should be based in the USA.

She was near the end of her career, obviously, but you'd want someone experienced, mature, forceful, decisive, etc., and those qualities increase with age and experience.

2889,Mystery Road, A gripping crime drama set in a remote Western Australian community,"This six part Australian drama is set in a remote corner of Western Australia. Two young men have gone missing from a cattle station, one an indigenous man who was expected to become a football star, the other a back-backer. There is some evidence that they were victims of a crime. Local police officer Emma James calls in Detective Jay Swan, himself a Native Australian to assist with the investigation. As the case progresses things are learnt about the missing boys as well as various local secrets coming to light. Swan's task isn't made any easier when his wayward daughter and his ex-wife turn up in town.<br/><br/>This was a really gripping series set in a part of the world I don't think I've seen used in such a series before. It may be set in the vastness of West Australia but the community still feels claustrophobic. The central mystery is intriguing and the characters are interesting. Aaron Pedersen is great in the lead role and Judy Davis is impressive as Officer James. The fate of the boys is revealed sooner than I expected but that didn't matter. We still need to discover who did what and why. There are numerous possible motives and the identity of the guilty is far from obvious.

Just to see all those actors together - Pederson, Colin Friels, Judy Davis, Deb Mailman, Tasma Walton, against the stunning backdrop of the harsh and huge - but beautiful - Kimberley .... wow. Ernie Dingo in the last episode was a revelation - as was the man who played the young Scottish backpacker in the scene where he leapt out of the car , tensed to face the thugs.

Some of the best we have seen
* Well-balanced, appropriate and intriguing background music
* Clear, direct dialog
* Great, simple, non-cliched story with some pleasant twists
* Pitch-perfect pacing, especially in relation to the story environment<br/><br/>It also thankfully included:<br/><br/>* NO Shaky/Nauseating too-close or shaky camera work - YAY!!
* NO overused/emotional epic music drowning every scene
* NO overdone swearing (there is very little and only where appropriate)
* NO obligatory adds-zero-to-the-story sex scenes
* NO cast of wanna-be underwear models with clothes to match<br/><br/>It was SO refreshing to watch an entire series that was neither too short nor too long (the latter of which happens a LOT lately). Also refreshing that the entire experience was left to us to actually enjoy - we never once felt like they were trying to manipulate our emotions or club us over the head with an agenda of some kind. Everything was left to unfold and we felt like we were part of the experience. Simply wonderful.<br/><br/>There were several times where you could feel a ""standard"" series would have headed straight down Cliche Road and Mystery Road did not! NICE!! All the characters felt like real people with real issues without resorting to the same-old, same-old. It was great!<br/><br/>Did I mention the stunning cinematography? Perfect use of just a little drone camera work that added a very special something (which you will have to see to appreciate). Zero shaky-cam. Zero nose-hair-cam. You could actually feel the area like you were there - which is what good cinematography should do!<br/><br/>Overall we found Mystery Road (2018) to be like a wonderfully slow-cooked meal with all the flavors and smells perfectly balanced. There was just enough so you finished with a full, satisfied feeling, while still wanting a little more.<br/><br/>Hopefully there will be more! And more series put together this well!",15 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,23 August 2018
2892,Mystery Road, Slow Build up with beautiful landscapes,"Starts off good, with characters you are starting to get to know. It is a slow build up with a good story line, but it starts to drag after episode 3. The performance by two actors is a standout Wayne Blair who plays Larry Dime and Crystal Swan (Madeleine Madden). Both actors are a slow fuse, they start off as insecure and irresponsible slowly progressing to be vulnerable and conditioned by circumstances and the people who have let them down. Both actors use silence as a force to communicate more than words could. Especially Madeleine Madden, she brings complexity to her character. The only performance that was a let down was that of the actress playing Shevorne Shields, she had one look in the entire series with no range at all. A few tears shed and violent outbursts and that was it, she had a lackluster performance, she couldn't use her eyes or body language to communicate her characters vulnerability. It was unfortunate as she is one of the key characters and she made the series hard to watch. Her acting should have been stronger, and her line delivery was horrible. The rest of the cast were good especially Judy Davis. Give the show a shot, the story line is done before it is some of the actors performances which are why it should be watched and of course for the beautiful landscapes and natural beauty.",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,7.0,8 June 2018
2893,Mystery Road, Another great Australian drama,"Fell upon this completely by accident while channel hopping, but having watched other Aussie mystery dramas like Glitch, I know I like the style of this kind of show. It's a slow burner but that's what I like about Australian shows. It's enough to keep you hooked but without going all out guns blazing every episode. I hadn't heard of any of the actors other than Deborah Mailman, who I loved in Secret Life of Us and Aaron L McGrath who was excellent in Glitch but I liked Aaron Pedersen's character once he'd warned up a bit from his spiky persona in the beginning. <br/><br/>I had kinda guessed who the protagonist would be before the ending but that still didn't make it any less enjoyable and I hope they do another follow up series or another storyline. I haven't seen the related films either but may give them a watch as apparently there's nods to those in the series (Although I don't think it's imperative that you've seen the film's to watch this series). Finally, the cinematography in this show is stunning. Wide shots of barren landscapes and starry skies. Overhead shots of dusty road tracks and shadows. Drone filming has never been utilised so well. It's truly beautiful. The moody soundtrack is good too. Well worth a watch.",13 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,8 October 2018

2899,Mystery Road," Unfortunately, the usual mistakes...","I was looking forward to this series, having enjoyed the movie 'Mystery Road'; however, I was disappointed. Disappointed, but not so surprised as the series demonstrated, yet again, everything that is wrong with too many Australian productions. These are:
1. The idea that spectacular scenery is on the same level as dramatic effect. By all means include spectacular scenery, but not as a replacement for the drama; it's not supposed to be a travelogue.
2. An over-loud and (to my ears) rather whiney soundtrack that, again, seemed to be there to replace the lack of dramatic effect that should have been achieved with better plot construction, character arc and dialogue. In addition, too often the soundtrack seemed to be warning of an impending crisis that didn't eventuate.
3. A plot that was, by turns, unbelievable and banal (I won't list the criticisms for fear of spoiling an otherwise spoiled plot). But they beg the question: don't the film-makers themselves ever discuss the plot and try and eliminate the obvious 'fridge moments' before filming starts? I wouldn't have thought it would be that difficult.
4. Characters with only a single characteristic - and remaining without any transformation throughout the series. In most cases, this single characteristic was a sort of dull and sour glumness. The only characters who seemed to have a sense of humour - or, I should say, were trying to exhibit a sense of humour without any script support - were the characters played by Judy Davis, Colin Friels and Tasma Walton. The only two characters who livened up the scenes they were in were the two backpackers who - perhaps because they were not Australian - were given more leeway in their characterisations. 
5. Lack of interesting dialogue. It seems to me that many Australian film-makers have misinterpreted the exhortation 'show, don't tell' to literally remove any but the most essential dialogue - thus missing the fact that the exhortation is referring to exposition, not dialogue per se. It also seems that the Australian film-maker's consideration of 'realism' obscures the need for the dialogue to sparkle with humour and originality. Good dialogue is essential for defining differences in character and, unfortunately, by equipping most of the characters in Mystery Road with only grunts and ill-formed sentences, all the characters are essentially identical. In addition, please stop the nonsense of artificially creating dramatic effect by refusing to allow characters to normally communicate with each other by, for example, asking obvious questions. It's just laziness. I read that the two stars (Davis and Pederson) had a significant input into the dialogue. Just goes to show that they should stick to what they're good at - acting.",35 out of 62 found this helpful.,4.0,24 June 2018

2905,Mystery Road, Worth A Watch,"After a promising start this series descended into the usual stereotypes, with the usual mundane issues.<br/><br/>There was some elements that were drawn from Scandinavian Noir but weren't worked up to any dramatic intensity.<br/><br/>The lead cop was brilliantly played as was the local female cop, the chemistry between them was good and a further injection of irony/sarcasm/humour would have made this even more convincing.<br/><br/>Both cinematography and music was of the usual high standard we get from Australian productions.<br/><br/>The ancillary characters were mostly awful with little reasons for their actions and there was often a feel of teenage angst with some ridiculous storming in and storming out.<br/><br/>In Swedish Noir as a matter of principle relatives obstruct the police in their investigations as the relative has been accused of wrongdoing. Here several characters obstruct the police when their relative is an innocent or merely missing. A quite ridiculous position. If you were attempting to conceal an issue you would withhold or lie which would be a more convincing dramatic turn.<br/><br/>Lastly why is ""missing"" often the subject of Australian drama, come on be more inventive!

2906,Mystery Road," Could Have Been Excellent, Bit of a Yawn Fest","I sat down and watched the film (2013) of the same title before tackling the TV series. The film is excellent, with an aura of mystery as the title implies. The acting and dialogue is natural (in an Australian way). The story is enigmatic, requiring one to concentrate.<br/><br/>For the TV series, the location has been shifted from Queensland to Western Australia with the same protagonist, the detective. I thought his acting was not so natural this time round; acts as if he is in a constant bad mood.<br/><br/>In the intervening years since the film, I sense that PC (inclusion and diversity) has crept into the ABC and Australian films: thus, the senior sergeant is now an officious humourless woman and one of the constables is of Indian descent; as we are a good 1,000 km from the capital city, is this likely? The other constable is a bit of a caricature - the bungling, inept cop. Also, one of the town's inhabitants is a convicted paedophile, released during the time line of the series!<br/><br/>Still the story is intriguing; we will have to see how it develops.<br/><br/>Up to part 4 now: as is common with these series, after a strong start, the story has started to drag - slow pace and much unnecessary fill - 5 minutes of tedium and then a short burst of interest (something that is actually related to the plot) followed by more tedium.",8 out of 14 found this helpful.,6.0,2 October 2018
2907,Tales of the City, Oh dear - It just didn't work.,"I wanted to enjoy the series. I really did. Unfortunately I was let down badly. The witty repartee, lovable whirl of personalities and hysterical (if pertinent) social insights of the books seem to be have replaced with stilted quasi soap opera scripting, PC overload, and for those who know and love the books, strange twists of the characters, timelines, reference points and history. To pick a cast for such a well loved series of books always leads to criticism. In general I found the acting was pretty good with lovely performances by Olivia Dukakis, Laura Linney and Paul Gross. However, the choice of Ellen Page as Shawna has me completely baffled. It seems that everything I have seen her in is a slight variation of the same character, and that intense, dark, troubled persona that Ms. Page is so good at portraying just doesn't do the character, or back-story, of Shawna Hawkins any credit. The saddest part of the series for me was the ending. Armistead Maupin wrote one of the most fitting demises for a character such as Anna Madrigal - an image that 'Tales' lovers hold dear, and should never have been messed with. To have seen fit to re-write it is pure sacrilege. I wish the series had worked. Not only for myself, but for of Maupin's Barbary Lane fans.",76 out of 97 found this helpful.,5.0,9 June 2019
2908,Tales of the City, Not the same show I fell in love,"I was curious about the new Tales Of The City.<br/><br/>I never read the books, but I do know Maupin's intentions with them, and how important the book series became to pop culture as a social registry about San Francisco since middle 70's, which also reflects much of other societies and LGBT communities around the world.<br/><br/>The very 1st season is simply amazing. The references of that time, the sexual liberation, and the shock of different cultures and sexualities were all within loveable characters. Really, what did cach my attention was that none of the characters was unpleasant. Yeah, except very specific antagonists, necessary for plot twists and mysteries solving.<br/><br/>The main character, Mary Ann, is just that kind of character that everyone feels related somehow, because she represents the conflicts between different social cultures and how maturity knocks at our doors in some point of our lives. You open it, or you keep it locked. Is totally up to you how you expect to face reality, and Mary Ann simply wide opened it beautifully. And beautifully is how Laura Liney developed the character as well.<br/><br/>Other Tales and Further Tales, both tried to keep the same pace of the original, and kind of did it nicely and respectfully even with recurring production problems about cast members and years that separate one season from another.<br/><br/>But I must tell that, after watching the first 3 seasons, the new Tales are very disappointing in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>First of all is that Mary Ann became a kind of character that I could never expect. After so many positive changes, pursuing real reasons to be a better person and dreaming about a meaningful life, she comes back to San Francisco after 20 years being everything she tried not to be for so long. Now everyone is bashing her selfishness, claiming all the time that she ""runs away from everything, as always"". That is awful. Seems that she's a completely different character, because it doesn't make any sense. The character's transition from the naive and conservative Cleveland girl to a brave open minded young woman was very authentic and believable through the years. And if there's something Mary Ann never was (at least in the show) was selfish or coward. She's now unpleasent, unfunny, yelling all the time, someone that no one is comfortable being around, when she was completely the opposite. Yeah, 20 years make a hell of change in someone's life, but the way writers did were unfair to the character. Maybe the books have a better development for that (I don't even know if they do), but in the show it makes no sense at all. From a loveable character that Mary Ann was, now she's there just to push the humor to cringe moments, or the drama to a constant and superficial self pity.<br/><br/>Characters in a whole have no more that sweet honesty, or that heartwarming presence. There are no enjoyable dialogs about life and ordinary things like past seasons did, and characters are thrown randomly to the scenes for the sake of representativeness more than their real relevance to the story. Also, the way the show changed the personality of some of them, as already mentioned, created lame conflicts to put it into a modern pattern. Also, it's not necessary show mobile apps all the time to the camera just to state that the story is happening in a modern and connected society. I never understand the relevance of that. We've been there from over a decade now, and when writers try to bring relevance to that, it just feels they are treating audience as primitive people that finally discovered the fire. Really?<br/><br/>Yeah, entire Tales TV show was like a soap opera, but this time looks like a very bad one, and all that enlightening humanity is gone.<br/><br/>The most annoying thing for me is Ellen Page. I read a lot of people claiming that her character in the books is completely the opposite of the performance she delivers. True or not, her performance is painful. I would not only blame the writing and direction, but mostly Page herself. As another one noticed, she is locked in a self character forever. Really, she's always making clear that she doesn't even try, as an actress, to deliver something slightly different from what she did before. Her presence is always unexpressive, like she is deceiving the audience all the time, making it clear that she doesn't care about the kind of performance people expect from her. Pick Umbrella Academy and Tales, she is exactly the same in both shows, even the shirts and caps. Maybe she filmed both in same days just to avoid changing clothes.<br/><br/>Wardrobe would never be a problem if her performance was different one from another, I must say. Which is not the case.<br/><br/>The original series is considered the first show to talk openly about social diversity in a decade when TV was affraid to approach those issues in a very positive and natural way as the show did. It was something new and controversial for that time, which is not today. Diversity is all over the place now, and Tales could feel a little outdated if they maintained the same structure of the past, but at the same time wouldn't be bad at all keep its roots. Showrunners lead the show to a different path to make it feel relevant and connected to new and younger audiences, while original characters feel misplaced, doing ordinary actions only to reinforce some strong ageisms. Yeah, Tales doesn't seem the same anymore. The name is there, but all the character and atmosphere is gone.",12 out of 13 found this helpful.,5.0,23 July 2019

Wren was amazing in the books. In this she's just a side note.<br/><br/>Shawna was ruined beyond all recognition. I was so excited for Ellen Page to play her with the same happy Whip It quirkiness that was in the books. She was constantly described as being happy and fun loving.
Instead we are given that hat.That hat I was wanting to burn by the end of the first episode.<br/><br/>The lack of the original score was also very obvious.<br/><br/>I've been disappointed by plenty of book to movie adaptions, but this is one of the worst things I've ever seen.

2912,Tales of the City, A tough reminder of the importance and delirious fun of the PBS original,"One shouldn't fault the new series of Maupin's ""Tales of the City"" for skipping over, well, reality. After all the original work was about an overly idealized account of an era through the eyes of the pixelated magic found at the top of the stairs at the mythical Barbary Lane. Yet the magic of the original work was capturing the ""high"" found in an emerging queer culture, or the fleeting ecstasy in dancing to disco, or the rose-colored reflection of a city and a place that advertised anything goes or everyone's welcome. None of which was actually true, but no one can fault the effort of the author of the place and time he wrote about. It was a dream walkabout.<br/><br/>The downside of it all was never really the subject of Maupin's articles about the place which were published serially in the newspaper. Yet, on a facing page in the news print were often the actual stories that reflected San Francisco's mean streets.<br/><br/>Today is a whole other vibe, and the nostalgia that gets trucked into the social challenges of 21st Century San Francisco are brittle, fake and...well, even a little irresponsible.<br/><br/>One scene sums up my objection: Zosta Mamet's character invites Ellen Page (both superb in this series, by the way) to lie down with her at the corner of Taylor and Turk--the site of the Compton Cafeteria riots of the 1960's--on the bare pavement and stare up at the sky. In today's Tenderloin that could never happen. You'd be taking your life into your hands either from the constant muggings and violence or from the dire health hazards of the coming into contact with the filth on the pavement. (Occasionally the sidewalks are steam pressure washed, but if you're going to attempt this crazy act, you'd better act quickly after a washing and have a third person keep an eye out for your safety.)<br/><br/>There are moments in this series where the truth outs, e.g., finding an affordable living space on short notice (or any notice, in truth) and a dinner scene where a young ""Millenial"" is surrounded by men of a certain age, and the young fellow corrects the use of the word ""tranny."" ""Today, we say 'transsexual.' The resulting anger of how-dare-you-young-whippersnappers correct a generation who fought and suffered to give you the freedom you have rings true. And viewing the scene both side's offense is presented without criticism by the writers.<br/><br/>But there's little else that seems very honest (even the frequent sexual couplings which don't seem to take a toll on the participants).

2917,Tales of the City, Excessive,"Overstaying one's visit always leads to embarrassing moments. This series purports to extend the life of Maupin's clever and entertaining novels and films about San Francisco well into the 21st century after an absence of the better part of three decades. As such, it fails to deliver much of anything...with one or two exclusions. Laura Linney was one of those. She is a class act irrespective of a weak script. Another small gem is the relation of an historical fulfillment of the character called Anna Madrigal.
Beyond that I found myself wondering how Armistead Maupin could bring himself to produce and appear briefly in this desperate attempt to follow his previous successes. Whoever was responsible for writing and editing here was trying too hard to cram every possible scrap of millennial dialogue or blatant vulgarism onto a story that fit best in its own earlier time.
I was so put off by a cast that simply rambled through their lines (except for Linney) that after the first few episodes I turned off the sound and relied on subtitles for most of what remained.

2918,Tales of the City, I really wanted to like this!,"I live in San Francisco, I read all the books, and loved the original P.B.S. series. I'm definitely in the target audience.

Murray Bartlett and Ellen Page are welcome additions and fit right in to the cast as Michael Tolliver and Shauna. Armistead Maupin's story has always had a whimsical ""alternative, somewhat idealized reality "" that you have to somewhat suspend reality to be on board for both the books and the television series. The new writers have maintained this tone which has it's pros and cons. The pros are: it's cute and whimsical. Gay men also enjoy it for being able to see men actually doing more than kissing. The P. C. sex scenes of all genders are plentiful throughout the episodes. The overall story lines seem slow and very drawn out over the 10 episodes. I'm an attempt to please everyone, particularly a younger maybe more progressive crowd, there's the young kids storyline with the trans and gender fluid kids. A 2 hour movie would have moved the story along in a more smooth and succinct way, instead of ""way to many "" conversations about people and past events.

2920,Tales of the City, Massive Failure,"The original first series, set in 1976, was done in 1993 and was one of the best book to film adaptations ever undertaken. Unfortunately, a bunch of conservative spoil sports petitioned PBS from continuing on with the series. A different production company picked up the story and did a second and third series in 1998 and 2001 that left the story in 1981, just before AIDS changed everything. Although many of the original cast returned for the two later series, the magic had diminished.<br/><br/>Now, the series has been revived but set in the present day with no explanation and the math is too much to get past. The actor playing Michael Tolliver would have been 5 in 1976 when 'Mouse' first met Mary-Anne at the Safeway. At first, this leap in time seemed inexplicable, but it soon becomes clear why. The series wants to capture the same edgy look at contemporary issues, but this time its about diversity, inclusivity, non-gender/binary blah blah blah...<br/><br/>Mary-Anne, Brian, Mrs. Madrigal and Mouse are just a plot device to introduce a new generation of characters that are all, unfortunately, uninteresting. I don't know if I can get past the math problem of the missing 15-20 years, but I do know I am bored by Generation Z's sexual proclivities as they wade into a rehashing of the original plot that includes a blackmailing plot of Mrs. Madrigal. Although there is an excellent scene when the old queens give a tongue lashing to the twink about generational attitudes, ultimately, this series fails to hold any interest for anyone I know who knows and loves the original series and books.

2921,Tales of the City, A big disappointment,"I really wanted to like this series and went into it with a very generous, open mind because it's the sort of series I tend to enjoy. Unfortunately the weak writing, wooden acting, constant cliches and cloyingly over-sentimentalized tropes made it really difficult to love.<br/><br/>I did stick with it in hopes that it would 'get better' but unfortunately it never did. A real shame because the idea had potential but it felt more like a bad after school special than a ground-breaking diversity story. It actually feels dated (in a bad way) and it's from 2019.<br/><br/>I gave it 7 stars because there are so few LGBT-friendly series out there I just didn't have the heart to give it less, but if I was being more honest it really doesn't deserve much more than a 5 or 6. While it does have some charming moments, it's too cutesy and devoid of grit to be truly ground-breaking.",31 out of 46 found this helpful.,7.0,18 June 2019
2922,Tales of the City, Good effort,"Having read all the books several times I was looking forward to this series on Netflix.
I'm so glad Olympia Dukakis, Laura Linney, Paul Gross and Barbara Garrick came back. Shame one of the original 'Michael' actors didn't return.
The story was ok but hardly resembled the story in the last 3 books that would be appropriate for the passing of time for the characters. Anna's flashback story was a good addition however but the ending was quite underwhelming.
I feel that it missed an opportunity to tell the real story of the characters as there was a wealth of story available from 'Michael Tolliver Lives' 'Mary Ann in Autumn' and 'The Days of Anna Madrigal' to make a brilliant season.
Shame they got the timing wrong! Michael and Mary Ann should be in their 60s now! It would have sat better if it was set in the late 90s yearly 00s.<br/><br/>Also a shame they didn't keep the original theme music. It would have helped to retain some of the magic of the original. Netflix seem to have aimed the series at a new audience but forgetting the existing fans of the books and first 3 series.<br/><br/>A good watch that filled a rainy day.<br/><br/>We wait now for the next book by Maupin about Mona as he announced on Radio 2 last week.",31 out of 46 found this helpful.,7.0,9 June 2019

It doesn't want to be pretentious, which I was afraid of. Tales of the City does deliver some great stories. This should be clearly a series which needs more story and episodes to give some characters more space to tell their story.

2929,Tales of the City, Deeply disappointing after waiting years for a new adaptation,"It seems if you never read any of Maupin's books before, and never watched any of the previous three miniseries, you may enjoy this Netflix series. If you did read each of the novels and enjoy each of the miniseries and wait years for a new work to hit the screen, your satisfaction begins and ends with seeing Olympia and Laura and Barbara and Paul reprise their roles. If you read Maupin's last three books in the series and were waiting to see these wonderful story lines brought to the screen, you'll be sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>It seems that Lauren Morelli had a story she wanted to tell, but wasn't confident enough to present her new characters in a new universe, so instead co-opted Maupin's San Francisco, crowding it to the point that there's no room for most of the new characters Maupin had introduced in the later novels. I wish I could unwatchable this, but I can only re-read the novels and re-watch the original miniseries.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,3.0,5 June 2020
2930,Tales of the City, False Advertising,"The first screen credit after the title of every episode is ""Based on the Book Series by Armistead Maupin.""<br/><br/>With few exceptions, this is a bold-faced lie. It would be more accurate to state ""Suggested by Characters from the Book Series by Armistead Maupin"" or ""Inspired by the Book Series by Armistead Maupin.""<br/><br/>I have difficulty understanding that Maupin would allow such a travesty of his work to be produced. This is a bit far off, but why the hell is Michael Cunningham, a Pulitzer-Prize-winning author who, stylistically, is about as far away from Maupin as possible, credited as a ""Consulting Producer?""<br/><br/>We all thought the Barbary Lane saga was complete after ""Sure of You,"" the sixth novel of the initial series. I remember clearly the day it was released to bookstores: I was in line before the store opened and bought the first copy, ran home, and read it cover-to-cover without pause. I did so again a few days later.<br/><br/>The three TV-series were made and fared amazingly well. Casting, especially that of Olympia Dukakis, Laura Linney, and (in the first series) Marcus D'Amico as Michael, was luxurious down to cameos from the likes of Sir Ian McKellan.<br/><br/>Years went by, and suddenly there was a most-unexpected miracle with the publication of ""Michael Tolliver Lives."" Was that the end? No: stories still had to be told and tied-up, and ""Mary Ann in Autumn"" and the extraordinarily moving ""The Days of Anna Madrigal"" followed. (If you read ""The Days of Anna Madrigal,"" don't even suspect you'll get a slight whiff of it in this misbegotten series.)<br/><br/>Had these novels served as the basis for this new, 10-part series, it would have been wonderful.<br/><br/>But no. There are magic moments, but they are limited to the interactions among the characters we know and love: Mrs. Madrigal, Mary Ann, Michael ""Mouse"" Tolliver and his younger lover Ben, Brian, and, to a lesser degree Shawna, and Jake, whose story is diminished by his partner, Margot, one of many insufferable new characters. Despite the brevity of the part, it is nice to see DeDe Halcyon Day, daughter of the late Edgar Halcyon (Mrs. Madrigal's romantic interest in the very first book) and widow of the unforgettable Beauchamp Day 
Even what we are shown of the known characters is rife with narrative and chronological discrepancies and outright errors and major contradictions (Mr. Maupin: how could you let this happen?).<br/><br/>The rest is packed with filler including some of the most annoying characters to populate Barbary Lane in 2019, especially the interminably annoying performance artist ""twins,"" denizens of The Body Politic, the bar where Shawna works, and numerous on-again/off-again romances and mostly gratuitous sex romps with forgettable characters who have no business in stealing away time - and interest - from the main story: the sudden sale of the Barbary Lane house by Mrs. Madrigal and the dispersal of its most recent ""family"" members, which turns out to be a slight, anticlimactic diversion that fails as a plot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the majority of the running time of each episode is devoured by these intruders, leaving us with only isolated bits worthy of the egregiously misleading credit ""Based on the Book Series by Armistead Maupin.""<br/><br/>Kudos to the two returning star actresses, and to Murray Bartlett and Charlies Barnett, who are quite convincing as Michael and Ben. Trans actor Garcia does a good job as the perpetually-confused Jake; Paul Gross is badly/sadly miscast as Brian. ""Guest Stars"" led by an insufferable Victor Garber are a sorry lot and miss the entire feel, the entire enchantment of Barbary Lane. By far the worst performance is by Zosia Mamet as the insufferable videographer Claire.<br/><br/>Never forget what Mrs. Madrigal tells us very early on in the initial series of novels: everyone has two families - their biological family, and their logical family.

I have no idea why the scenery would change so drastically, you'd think they would simply move all of the set's from LA to Atlanta and keep them intact, instead they went fresh with everything and threw-off the vibe the show had.. Even the quality of the film is bad, it's almost amateur HQ Camcorder-ish.<br/><br/>It also seem like Tyler Perry had a little influence in the writing now, the women seem more uneasy, stuck up, angrier, uptight and the men seem more like these Politically correct cavemen and Clean-cut Thugs..

2934,The Game," Refreshing, Original, and Entertaining!","""The Game"" tells the stories of three women (Melanie Barnett, Kelly Pitts, and Tasha Mack) who are the girlfriends, wives, and mothers of professional football players (Derwin Davis, Jason Pitts, and Malik Wright) who play for the fictional San Diego Sabers. The show has a refreshing premise. Some say it's similar to the BBC show ""Footballers Wives"", but that show is a moody drama, while this show is a comedy that focuses on the relationships between the women and their men. The show is pretty accurate in the way they portray the women (especially the hierarchy: groupies are at the bottom of the pyramid, the girlfriends are next, the wives close to the top, and the footballers' mothers at the very top) and the players (especially how the veterans refer to the newbies as simply ""Rookie"".) The show has its funny moments, but does need better writing. The show is brilliantly cast, with several familiar faces from very popular shows.<br/><br/>Tia Mowry, known for her six years on the hit WB sitcom ""Sister, Sister"", leads the young and talented cast as the rookie's naive girlfriend, Melanie Barnett.<br/><br/>Wendy Raquel Robinson, who starred on ""The Steve Harvey Show"" for six seasons, portrays Tasha Mack, the abrasively blunt and honest mother / manager to her star player son.<br/><br/>Coby Bell, who is best known for his six-season stint on the popular NBC drama series ""Third Watch"", as well as a recurring role on UPN's ""Half &amp; Half"", portrays the Sabers' notoriously frugal team captain and star player, Jason Pitts.<br/><br/>Brittany Daniel, of the series ""Sweet Valley High"", portrays Jason's ditzy wife Kelly Pitts, the leader of the wives / girlfriends organization, The Sunbeams.<br/><br/>Pooch Hall, who made several guest appearances on the WB's short-lived series ""Pepper Dennis"" and starred in the holiday special ""Christmas At Water's Edge"" with Cosby kid Keshia Knight Pulliam, stars as the team's ambitious rookie, Derwin Davis.<br/><br/>Rounding out the cast as the womanizing and sometimes-immature quarterback Malik Wright is Hosea Chanchez, who previously had a recurring role on ""For Your Love"".<br/><br/>Good show, wonderful cast, great acting.

I don't have one good word to say about this show. It is amateurish and anyone and everyone associated with this show should be embarrassed. <br/><br/>Now that Tia Mowry has left the show, there really is no point in continuing.

2937,The Game, The new Game,"This New season of the series ""The Game"" has been OK. It's had ups and downs. But overall grade has to be a ""C+"". Until tonight, I had to stop my self from changing the channel. It was just overly dramatic, way to short and not enough substance. The writing this season was totally subpar compared to the prior seasons. The show seems to be moving more towards a bad daytime Soap Opera.<br/><br/>While acting on this show has grown in spite of the script. There is a foul stench of reality TV starting to seep in. Mara Brock Akil and Kelsey Grammar need to take a look how the show was originally produced and try to find a happy harmony between the and now. Salim Akil should take notes from his directing from season two. It feels like the show as a hold has lost its true direction.<br/><br/>Most of us fell in love with this show because of the subtle insight into the lives of Pro Football players and their families, friends, and franchise. The Sabers were becoming one of America's teams. They were replacing the new Cowboys for me. California hasn't had a winner like this since Joe Montana and the 49ers. We didn't want the show to become a blend of ""T.Ocho Show"" meets ""Basketball Wives"" with a twist of ""Days of Our Lives"". The writers should be afraid for there jobs. Tasha Mack was a hopeless shell of her former self since the old series finale (Season 3 Finale). When did Derwin Davis become the sneakiest back stabbing character. They have given him sort of multiple personality complex thing going. ""You my boy Malik"", "" Yo 'F' you Malik!"" ""Let's get you to rehab Malik."" ""Man Malik's career is over Yo 'F' him."" Isn't he the church boy? Is Derwin and Jason the same character now? Is every character the same type of person! What happen to the diversity in the roles. This is not the show we all clamored and protested for since 2009 through 2010.<br/><br/>Congrats to the actors for true growth. ""Tee-Tee"" Barry Floyd, you my boy, and Terrence J.

2944,The Game, Underrated Show,"This show followed the life of football player Darwin Davis as he tried to balance his relationship with Melanie and his career. It was one of the funniest sitcoms I ever saw, with clever and witty lines almost every second, and actually justified the use of the laugh track. The show became more dramatic in the second and third seasons, but it felt authentic and there were still plenty of hilarious moments to balance it out. In 2009, CW cancelled the show in order to make room for more teen dramas, a very disappointing move. Everybody Hates Chris was booted off too, leading some people to believe they were ""whitewashing"" the network, myself included. However, in late 2010, BET, who had already reran the show for about two years, revived the show. It seemed like a dream come true until...<br/><br/>We got a completely different show. New locations, a new filming style, the phasing out of the laugh track, more melodrama, and the characters seemed to have a vicious bent to them. Ironically, Tasha, formerly the fiercest character on the show, became more dependent and less strong willed.<br/><br/>I will admit, I was bummed out by the shift from comedy-drama to full-on drama, but with stronger storylines and keeping the characters true to themselves, BET could've pulled it off. Instead, we got a soap opera filled with played out stereotypes. Formerly, the characters tried to make the best out of dodgy situations. In the newer ones, they seemed as if they wanted to make a living hell for each other. T.T was the only character that remained (mostly) consistent. When Melanie left the show, it was the final straw.

In the first episode of the show we meet the star quarterback Malik Wright, his abrasive, blunt, and brutally honest mother manager Tosha Mac, the frugal team captain Jason Pits. Jason's wife and leader of the sunbeams Kelly Pitts. The Game gives us a look inside the world of professional football players. One thing I like about the show is, the characters are not perfect they are just like you and me they make mistakes. The actors and actresses portray their characters with realism that is rarely seen in most sitcoms. Some posters have claimed about the writing, but for me, the writing is some of the best writing on television today for me, the acting on The Game should be required viewing in acting classes. I will admit, sometimes the story lines could be a little on the daytime soap opera side. If it wasn't we probably wouldn't watch it.",1 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,6 April 2011

2956,MADtv," Started out as one of the funniest TV shows out there, but has gradually slid down these past couple years","The first time I saw ""Mad TV"" I was hooked. This show was very funny and had a lot of brilliant sketches. From ""OJ Simpson Bloopers"" to ""N'sync: The Movie"" this show had non-stop laughs. The best cast was from 1997-2001. Unfortunately, Nicole Sullivan and Will Sasso left the show and it went down. Every Saturday I looked forward to seeing a new episode, and now it's not that big of a deal anymore. It's not as funny and creative as it used to be. But I would recommend seasons 1-6 any time. Those were the great episodes. Now, it's getting a little too sexual and racist. It's also not as original anymore. I'm sure that most ""Mad TV"" fans would agree as well.",60 out of 72 found this helpful.,,2 February 2005
2957,MADtv, One of the best comedy shows of all time. Light years beyond SNL.,"Mad TV was one of the best. It made fun of every demographic, party, race, celebrity, religion, or idea imaginable. This show came about when SNL was in its waning years, in my opinion, and picked up the slack. SNL has survived into 2017, but Mad TV should have been the one still on air. Where SNL has become a long-winded political church service and Ad Campaign for millennial hipsters, Mad TV was raunchy and never very PC. I found it to be way more open-minded and randomly hilarious than SNL's overrated crap. All the losers from SNL get a lifetime movie deal and attention from networks, while Mad TV stars are rarely given attention after leaving the show. It is obvious that you simply have to be a part of the ""inside clique"" and the ""cool kids"" club to be with the SNL bunch, but Mad TV was more unique, and took way more risks with stupidly funny parodies and characters. SNL is so tired and now it is nothing more than a holier-than-thou sermon and trash fest of whatever president or figure the cast/writers/producers hate that year. They are so biased and also boring, with ugly, dull characters and lame ""musicians"", who are usually just bubblegum performers marketed to idiots while they lip sync. Mad TV used to actually have great bands and lesser- known performers, but ones who were still very popular in different genres and their ideas were infinitely better than any comedy show on regular TV today. You can find some exceptions to this on cable TV, but very few. Mad was on par with Chappelle and Sunny in Philly. I miss it a great deal.",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,7 September 2017

2959,MADtv, Sometimes better than SNL,"I always loved MadTV since it's debut. How did they get their cast? They went out in a truck and recruited a couple of prostitutes, pimp, a suicidal woman, a homeless veteran, and an overweight crossing guard. They are some fabulous skits like ""That's my White Mama!"" with Artie Lange as fat white man who has the soul of a black woman. Ms. Vancome is always vocal about her bigoted opinions. Ms. Swan is a priceless character of sheer irritation. They spoof the President Bush and Clintons needlessly. They even did a good spoof of ER where everybody in the show is getting ready to leave. I thought that made a strong criticism of the show. Finally, sometimes they do things that SNL won't do or forget to do. I love SNL and MadTV. I just wish MadTv would start at 10:30pm than 11pm. so I don't have to debate which to tape. I hope MadTv last as long as SNL.",37 out of 52 found this helpful.,9.0,10 January 2002
2960,MADtv, Brilliant! This show really gets it!,"I only started watching this show about six months ago on Comedy Central, and I have been hooked since. SNL doesn't even come close to this show's originality and creativity. One of the real main differences between this show and SNL is the way this show ""lets loose"" and isn't so political, pretentious, and self-conscious. It lets its actors breathe and get comfortable, making for some really hilarious skits and recurring characters. SNL is so tight-laced and ""lets all make fun of the President again""...and ""this constitutional bill just got passed,"" and now the musical guest is gonna be in the skits, and the celebrity host needs to make a huge entrance and make the skits about ""them."" With MadTV, you get to really know the actors more, and it makes things that much funnier. Plus the show is just plain hilarious!! My absolute favorite person on the show is Michael McDonald. My favorite sketches are Ms. Swan (""I tell you every-TING!"")...Stuart (""I found it on the floor!"")...Lorraine (""my husband Carl's got gas real bad"")...the ""Literally"" couple...Debra Wilson as Oprah...and Reality Check (i just watched the one with ""Richard Simmons,"" and I was crying it was so funny). The TV show parodies are a riot, like ""The Queen of Queens,"" Will &amp; Grace, I Love Lucy, and Laverne &amp; Shirley.

2966,MADtv, Mad Vs. Snl?. There's No Question.,"While SNL will always be the granddaddy of these sketch shows, it is a hit and miss show that elicits few big laughs even when it is on an upward swing. Mad TV is, without a doubt, ten times funnier. Even when it isn't hitting on all cylinders, it is still funnier that most of SNL and gets bigger, heartier laughs. The characters, like Stuart, Ms. Swan, Dot, Lorraine, Trina, Marvin Tikvah, Rusty, and impersonations of Kenny Rogers and Oprah to name a few, far outshine any characters SNL has done in the last 10 to 12 years, if not longer. The cast is funnier and more talented than the majority of SNL cast members in the last 9 years that Mad has been on. What is most surprising is how easily Mad tops SNL, who at times look like it's going to explode from pushing too hard. Mad is a lot edgier, and has pushed the boundaries that SNL hasn't even tried. I like SNL. It's an institution, but Mad TV is clearly superior television, while SNL remains a somewhat funny security blanket.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,17 February 2004

2971,MADtv, Love at First Sight!,"It was a September night in 2002 at Jerusalem. A few of us were flying to Berlin the next (early) morning, and we were spending that night at my colleague's place. To kill time, we started watching TV programs first, followed by ""Monthy Python's Meaning of Life"" and another movie. And then when we had nothing else to watch, but still a couple of hours to pass, suddenly there sprung up MAD TV. What the program was about how Arnold, the Terminator, was assigned the duty of protecting the newly-born Jesus and how he went on his duty, killing Judas to stop Jesus from being betrayed. And sitting at a place, only about 3 miles from Bethelhem, I fell in love with MAD TV. The love is still there!<br/><br/>Not that everything MAD TV does is fun. Many of the programs are boring and repetitive; but each Saturday night, one gets at least 15 minutes of real fun within an hourly episode, which is sufficient for someone like me to wait for the show each week.

2975,MADtv, Madtv should've been cancelled years ago.,"With ""Saturday Night Live"", they still occasionally have a funny sketch, but with Madtv I haven't seen a sketch that made me laugh in years. The first 5 years of the show were very good, seasons 1-3 being the best. They had movie parodies that looked like the movies, being filmed differently on good film. The old shows usually had around 20 skits per episode, and they tried to capture Mad magazine. They had Spy vs. Spy, Don Martin cartoons and had Alfred E Newman as the shows mascot, which they have since dropped for some reason. Now Madtv has around 8 sketches per episode, with a couple of them being about recurring characters who get very annoying very fast. When you have 8 sketches per episode, it's much harder to get a good sketch, where with 20 if half are good, the other ones are short and if bad, they're still funny. So over the years, the show has lost a lot of talented actors, and gained mediocre performers, they've lost their hilarious animated segments, and they've lost any relation to the Mad magazine. I'm hoping the network cancells this soon, because I'd hate to see it get any worse.<br/><br/>My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 1 hr. T14",5 out of 11 found this helpful.,5.0,18 June 2006
2976,MADtv, Still The Funniest Saturday Night Live Alternative,"Fox produced a smash hit with this zany and creative alternative to NBC's Saturday Night Live. Airing every Saturday at 11pm since 1995, Mad TV is now in it's 10th season. Cast members have come and gone, even reprised their roles in comeback cameos. Among these are the original cast- Nicole Sullivan, Debra Wilson, Artie Lang, Will Sasso, Michael MacDonald, Mo Collins, Phil Lamar, Orlando Jones, Ares Spears. The first season (1995 to 1996) was an explosion of comic skits and colorful characters. Back then, there was a closer connection to Mad Magazine. The logo/cover of the magazine appeared during the opening credits and the Black Spy Vs White Spy bit was used frequently. Later on, it took its own path and new characters were developed. These included the sassy, rude and discriminating Vancome Lady played by Nicole Sullivan, Oprah Winfrey portrayed dead-on by Debra Wilson, Lina and Melina, two Puerto Rican sassy girlfriends, Phil Lamar as the overactive UPS Guy, Michael McDonald as the depressed and rude Persian cab driver and as the witty but mentally challenged boy Stewart. And who can forget Alex Borstein as the stereotypical Asian woman Miss Swan who ran a nail salon and who drove people crazy by saying ""He look like a man."" While too many people, this show is cartoonish and definitive of Fox broadcasting (Frank Caliendo, a newer star of the show, is even a spokesperson for the NFL on Fox), this show has attracted a variety of stars. Director and producer Amanda Bearse, better known as Marcy Darcy from Married With Children, was behind the scenes of the show.

2980,Wire in the Blood, Suspenseful British Drama at its Best,"I was lucky enough to have a copy taped from BBC America (cheers, Mom!) -- if you're a Robson Green fan, it's a fantastic showcase for his acting. Not as cavalier as his ""Touching Evil"" series; his ""Wire in the Blood"" character of Tony Hill is much more reserved, quirky, and, being a criminal profiler, is more internalized with his processing of information. Even if you're not a Robson Green fan, this will surely garner him new followers. There were three full-length movies: ""The Mermaid's Singing"", ""Shadows Rising"", and ""Justice Painted Blind"". The first two, ""Singing"" and ""Shadows"" are adaptations of author Val McDermid's books;<br/><br/>""Justice"" is an original script based off of McDermid's work, but closely follows her style and she was directly involved with its creation, so I think it's a respectful homage to her work as a whole, so I don't think her fans will be disappointed. All three deal with strange and grisly serial killings, the profiling of possible suspects, and the drama involved with tracking down the unique killers. Set against the backdrop of the bleak, lonely hills of the north of England, the movies are all gritty and disturbing (but not overly-so), and they really show the darker side of human nature and the lengths at which a profiler like Tony Hill is willing to venture to capture the killer. The supporting cast is brilliant; Hermione Norris as D.I. Carol Jordan is just wonderful to watch. Intelligent, sincere, and admirably professional, it's as much her story as it is Tony Hill's. The chemistry they have is marvellous to watch and not at all contrived. Personally, I think ""Mermaids"" was the best; it was the first, it clearly had the most detailed characterizations and plot complexity, and was definitely the most vicious -- some scenes definitely not for the faint of heart. But still compelling and highly recommended. The other two are still great, well-plotted and suspenseful, but slightly less edgy as the first. I recommend seeing the series in its proper order, to catch little references to past storylines.",74 out of 79 found this helpful.,,15 January 2003

It's quite dark, with just enough wit to keep you from falling over the edge into the great abyss. The intelligent and complex story line demands focus to follow clearly, and make you think. Sometimes the jumps in logic can seem a bit far fetched, but that is what makes it interesting and fun, without having to be a series of mindless chase scenes and explosions. Robson Green is incredibly impressive (and maybe a little bit scary) as eccentric psychological profiler Dr. Tony Hill, and Hermione Morris does a great job as tough DI Carol Jordan, a woman in what is still very much a man's world.

(Think ""Cracker"" meets ""Inspector Morse"" meets ""CSI"").There is a bookish, academic quality to Doctor Hill, without him being tweedy and standoffish (he's more human, and less lofty than Morse).<br/><br/>Dr. Hill is well played by actor Robson Green, who played another complex Detective in the British miniseries ""Touching Evil.""<br/><br/>In ""Wire in the Blood"" the stories and the crimes often unfold slowly, with just enough bits of clues and hints to make the slow development seem satisfying.<br/><br/>WARNING: The crime scenes can get a bit grisly, but are never gratuitous.<br/><br/>

The show is bases on the books written by crime  novelist Val McDiarmid. In series 1-3, Hermione Norris played Detective  Inspecter/Chief Inspecter Carol Jordan of Bradford CID, who managed to  rein Tony's scattered abilities and make sense of them. In series 4, Ms  Norris has left the show and Simone Lahbib as Inspecter Alex Fielding  has the dubious job of reining in Hill.  Green is, of course, the lead of the show and he is brilliant. He mixes  in just enough idiosyncrasies to make Hill human, endearing and  sometimes down right aggravating. Norris brought an adult, feminine,  vulnerability to her role as Carol Jordan. Brought up to believe in  hard case police work, her world was turned upside down by Tony's  presence. In the end, she asks for a transfer. Enter DI Alex Fielding,  Simone Lahbib. Ms. Lahbib is an unknown entity to me, but as I finished  watching series 4, I felt a bit queasy. When one actor leaves a show  and is replaced. It is important to give the newcomer a distinctive  identity. Fielding is a single mother with a son and a cat, yet in the  second episode of s4, ""Torment"", the writers were able to slide her  easily into the role that would have been Norris'. The ""Jordan""  character was specific to the McDiarmid book ""Torment of Others"", of  which the episode was derived. The Jordan/Fielding character played a  large part.   The writing is exceptional, especially for the episode, ""Torment"". The  acting is exceptional. This statement is meant to include: Mark  Letheren(DI Kevin Jeffries); Emma Handy (DC Paula McIntyre) and Peter  Sullivan (ACC Paul Eden). When there is an ensemble cast and crew that  work their hardest to put out the best product possible, it makes  viewing a very satisfying activity.  Note: this show is designated TV-MA, because of some intense or violent  scenes. I would not recommend this show for anyone under the age of 16.",32 out of 41 found this helpful.,10.0,30 November 2006
2985,Wire in the Blood, One of the best Crime drama/ Mystery Thriller TV shows ever made,"I first discovered ""Wire in the Blood"" by happy accident, I was watching Agatha Christie's Miss Marple on Amazon prime and ""Wire in the Blood"" popped up in my recommended list. I became hooked from the first episode ""Mermaids Singing"" which is done in 2 parts, with each episode my enthusiasm for the show also grew. Wire in the blood is now one of my favorite crime/Mystery/Drama shows for T.V. I'm a big fan of good,clever mystery. There are many crime/mystery books and shows out there but few are done this well with excellent character development, believable plots and story lines that are on one hand complex, terrifying, fully engrossing and on the other hand funny, thoughtful and informative. The show and books are dark and twisted. If your a fan of the genre and have not yet discovered Dr.Tony Hill I recommend that you do. <br/><br/>Wire in the blood was created and produced by Coastal Productions for the ITV network, it ran from 2002 to 2008 comprising of six seasons. Wire in the Blood was ITV's top rated show, was syndicated to 30 countries and won multiple awards. So when ITV did not pick up Wire in the blood for another season there was widespread disbelief and major disappointment for the millions of devoted fans. <br/><br/>Coastal Productions was created by Robson Green and Sandra Jobling in 1997. Their main objective was to create and produce quality shows in east Britain, creating jobs and giving voice to that area of the country. It blows every CSI, cop procedural made in the US totally out of the water. Wire in the Blood is based on the books of noted and award winning Scottish crime writer Val McDermid. <br/><br/>Dr.Tony Hill played by Robson Green is our main character, he is a clinical psychologist who works as a profiler for the Bradfield police; he specialises in repeat violent offenders, and has come into contact with a number of serial killers throughout his career. D.C.I. Carol Jordan played by Hermione Norris is a hard working officer and head of the Major Incident Team (MIT) of Bradfield Metropolitan Police's CID. Season 4 introduces us to a new lead character - DI Alex Fielding she is a senior detective at Bradfield CID and is a dedicated professional, always willing to put in the hours to get the case solved. Her warmth and down-to-earth style have gained her the respect of her police colleagues and Dr Tony Hill. There are many very well developed characters in this series i recommend you visit Wikipedia to get the full description of the show and it's wonderful characters http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_in_the_Blood<br/><br/>I also recommend that once you finish watching the series you read Val Mcdermid's books on Tony Hill &amp; Carol Jordan. After the last episode of season 6 I felt left just hanging there - I wanted more more more and to know what happened next?!! As tribute to the shows success and devoted fans there is even a fan site where fans of both the TV show and books have written some pretty good Fan Fiction from chapters to full short stories. http://www.fanfiction.net/TV/Wire-in-the-Blood/",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,1 June 2013
2986,Wire in the Blood, Ghost of Mr Thaw,"Green's vulnerability, intensity and flexibilty in his craft is a complete pleasure.

2987,Wire in the Blood," Vivid, believable shows with a charismatic psychologist solving intriguing crimes","Wire in the Blood, is first of all a showcase for the excellent acting skills of the charismatic Robson Green. For a mystery/suspense,thriller this show easily surpasses virtually all shows in the genre. The shows all involve murder and this is the focus of the plots. The plots, moreover, are taut and well-written. The setting and actors are British. For non-British viewers the British actors provide something faintly exotic and alluring, which works fine to subtly draw the viewer into the action of this suspense show. It is our not insignificant loss that more shows weren't filmed<br/><br/>The acting overall is fine; Green's outstanding acting seemingly makes all of his fellow actors elevate their performances. The stories are quite compelling, but the real interest is in the way Green solves the murders, using his training as a psychologist who teaches at a university and in at least one episode is seen acting as a therapist. His credentials are present just to make him initially credible. He has the intelligence, training, and experience to solve complex crimes.<br/><br/>For a t.v. show, there an unusually high level of tension and suspense, often only seen in movies. All in all, this show rewards close viewing, while the violent/gruesome scenes are few, they are minimally sanitized, and are contextually justified. In fact the reality of violence and destructive sexuality reflect quite accurately what homicide detectives see in the real world on a regular basis. This is a show about evil--so don't expect extenuating circumstances, except for brief views in some of the shows of the past of the criminals, usually childhood, that help explain why they commit their heinous crimes.",18 out of 23 found this helpful.,9.0,16 February 2012
2988,Wire in the Blood, Formulaic,"There is a certain formula each episode follows. There are multiple scantily clad young women who get brutally murdered. There will be many scenes of hookers and trashy bar people. Police are rude to Dr. Tony Hill and refuse to work with him. They are gradually won over. People who are innocent are very rude to the police and refuse to co-operate for no apparent reason. Dr. Hill comes up with detail after detail about the perpetrator, without any more explanation of how he did it than Sylvia Browne, psychic, ever gives. The criminals are deeply psychologically twisted, far more so than any person you have ever encountered, even in the newspapers. There is a last minute dash to rescue some young woman being held by a psychopath. She is always rescued.<br/><br/>Despite this strong formula structure, the episodes are entertaining and surprising.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,7.0,10 June 2015
2989,Wire in the Blood, 10 Stars!!!,"Brilliant series. The third episode not quite as strong a story as the first two, perhaps has something to do with the fact that it was not based directly on the books of V. McD. Robson Green is a great talent, in spite of what his fellow Newcastleian had to say above. I've enjoyed his first rate performances in two other series I've seen, and can't wait to see how his character's flirtation with D.I. Jobson develops in future episodes. Comparisons with ""Cracker"" seem off the mark to me. Although its one of my favorites, the only things in common with ""Wire..."" are forensic psychologists profiling murderous sickos, and helping the police catch 'em. Note to the producers: Have Robbie Coltraine guest as ""Cracker"" character in a future episode assisting Hill and Jobson! Imagine all the fun they could have conflicting professionally, not to mention romantically, vying for Jobson's attention and favors! Brilliant!",20 out of 27 found this helpful.,,21 August 2005
2990,Wire in the Blood, Entertaining,"I have been seeing quite a lot of this show on TV lately and i find it surprisingly entertaining. Surprisingly because i'm usually no fan at all of the serial-killer genre nor the kind of grisly imagery that this show always provides. But the gratuitous images and the worn-out theme aside this show has a lot to offer.<br/><br/>My favorite aspect is without a doubt Robson Green as the forensic psychologist Tony Hill. His weary and distraught appearance is enough for this to be worth watching. Also his interaction with Hermione Norris as the steely CID Carol Jordan is entertaining as well as many times touching.<br/><br/>The scriptwriting doesn't really live up to the characters in my opinion, but it's decent enough. Considering that i have read several of Val McDermids novels and liked none of them the writing in this series far exceeded my expectations. McDermids writing is simplistic and unimaginative in my opinion and the only real aspects from the novels that has been transferred to this show is the gratuitous nature of the crimes.<br/><br/>All in all i would say that this is a very entertaining show, at least for those who can stomach the gritty themes. I feel it far supersedes other shows in the same vein like for instance the quite dull ""Messiah"". Recommended.",19 out of 27 found this helpful.,7.0,10 September 2005

2992,Wire in the Blood," It's like watching a big budget film on TV. All 24 episodes are great! Gruesome scenes, Very dark and depressing at times.

Done very tastefully.<br/><br/>Very seldom will you find a British murder mystery TV series of this quality were ""every single episode is great"" not just OK, but great.<br/><br/>Even amongst the UK's best such as Prime suspect or A Touch of Frost. While undoubtedly there great TV series some movie episodes fall short of expectations. But not Wire in the Blood.<br/><br/>I watched all 6 seasons and 24 episodes. I rather enjoy dark, gruesome mysteries and Wire in the Blood isn't just that, it's also intense, VERY INTENSE! As well a graphic.<br/><br/>I read on the wikipedia page that the series was canceled because of it's high budget cost of about $1,250,000 per episode. Well.... watching this series you can really tell were all that money went. Each episode feels like your watching a multi-million dollar Hollywood production on TV. It is very fast pace tangled with multiple sub-plots everywhere.<br/><br/>Interesting that prior to this series, Robson Green started in ""A Touch of Evil"" that remarkably resembles Wire in the blood on a more ""toned down"" level. I suggest watching this one as well.<br/><br/>I specially find the first 3 seasons entertaining. I rather like the female co-star better than the one on the last 3 seasons. I felt the was more chemistry. In spite of that though the intensity of the series and plot lines don't die down. If anything they it gets even better with each episode.<br/><br/>Of any British TV series this is the one I hope is resurrected as too many things are left unresolved during the last episode.

2993,Wire in the Blood," Brilliant, passionate and eccentric ...","An eccentric psychologist, with zero social skills, and a smart and charming female detective come together in Bradfield, England, to solve cases that no normal policemen could ever. I found this series especially delightful because Robson Green's character lives within the confines of his own mind. Though he shows remarkable insight into the actions of the violent and deranged, he also displays that phenomenal lack of social consciousness that is particular to geniuses and artists (as in ""Yes, I just invented nuclear fission, but no, I didn't know I was supposed to wear socks and shoes to this award ceremony.""). This makes for some truly unusual and amusing situations, that help bring levity to the gruesome crimes he investigates.

2994,Wire in the Blood, Misinformation,"Okay,I admit that I am addicted to this series although I wish I weren't. It is grisly and makes me wonder what kind of city this is to have more than its share of truly awful crimes. Apparently I am seeking reality; odd that I would want that where blood and gore is too too realistic.<br/><br/>In the first season, several of the serial killers were female - truly uncommon. Serial killers are much more likely to be male. Not only are women less likely to commit serial murders, they rarely murder except in crimes of passion or self-defense. Secondly, I believe that clinical psychologists are grossly misrepresented by Tony Hill; psychologists do make keen observations but certainly don't read minds. An empathetic therapist may attempt to put her(him)self in his clients place to gain perspective, but certainly cannot ""see"" the other's plans. In other words, the plot itself is full of misinformation. Last, If a DI could not solve any crimes without a profiler, would she(he) be promoted?<br/><br/>What is Tony's source of income? If he teaches, he certainly doesn't put in much time or effort.<br/><br/>Hermione Morris was in MI5. In both roles, she plays tough women.

2995,Wire in the Blood, Regarding the title,"The title ""Wire in the Blood"" is a phrase from T.S. Eliot's poem ""Burnt Norton"", which is the first of his ""Four Quartets"": ""The trilling wire in the blood/Sings below inveterate scars/Appeasing long forgotten wars."" The poem is at least in part about the relationship between the longing for spiritual peace and ""the release from action and suffering""; it touches on these ideas as part of a Christian and also a Buddhist world view. I haven't read the books that the series is based on, so I cannot say how the author originally put the title in context (if at all.)<br/><br/>The phrases that follow ""wire in the blood"" in the poem are significant to the title's meaning for this show, I think, with the invocation of scarring, forgetting and violence.",8 out of 17 found this helpful.,,22 September 2008

Tony gets into the minds of both killers and victims in his attempt to help DCI Carol Jordan (Hermoine Norris) and later, DI Alex Fielding (Simone Lahbib). The crimes are gruesome, violent, and sometimes hard to watch.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this dark, atmospheric series is compelling and absorbing to watch.

But, I believe that what makes it successful, is simply the United Cast (including Jasper Frost), who bring to the forefront some amazing acting.<br/><br/>Now onto the 3rd season, it is hoped that The Royals will continue, as is, with occasional, and not flooded adding of new characters who will spoil the whole development. Certainly rating this show with a High 9, I certainly do agree that this series may not be for everyone - as previous Reviews have shown - but, this aside, not all Brits watch with anticipation those Political Programs that are about Presidents and Senators we don't view on a day-to-day basis (Arnold Schwarzenegger and Clint Eastwood aside, of course).",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,3 February 2017

3020,The Royals, Unusual take for a fictional modern Royal Family drama,"When the first time I heard about The Royals, I was thinking of the Tudor-type drama but it turned out to be a modern day Royal Family arrangement, with significant relations that we knew today.<br/><br/>I was very intrigued on the TV Trailers and to know more on the main characters in general perspective. Likely they put it more in twist so that it would not look like the real Royal Family. So when I first watched the pilot episode, there are so many twist and turns that the mystery would be unfold for the later episodes. And in the end you will want more of it.<br/><br/>I was admired on Elizabeth Hurley's portrayal of Queen Helena - something that I never saw her like that on TV. And also London playing the character city in order to embrace the essence of the story.<br/><br/>I would give this TV series a chance to show it what it made of, and to prove that it is not cheesy enough to watch it in the first place.",18 out of 25 found this helpful.,8.0,18 March 2015

3023,The Royals, One of the best shows on TV,"I absolutely love this show. If you like Gossip girl it's very similar and it's written by the same person who wrote One Tree Hill. The whole show is wild and sexy but I LOVE the relationship between Eleanor and Jasper. There is nothing on TV quite like them. Eleanor is a badass party girl who is used to getting what she wants. She is very similar to Effy from Skins. Jasper (at first) is -a stone cold, very manipulative, secretive bodyguard who is used to being dominant. Jasper and Eleanor are 2 pro manipulators who go head to head. There's lots of betrayal and heartbreak, they basically destroy each other. It's a very dark romance that starts out with lots of angry, reluctant sex. There is also the love triangle between Liam, Gemma, and Ophelia while there is lots of scandal going on including death. But anyway it's probably my favorite show on TV at the moment.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,10 March 2016

God I love Eleanor so much!! By the way I don't think royal family dynamic with Liam ,Eleanor,Helena so well.If the show is based on that.....of course these other remained characters they bring into the fold, i think it's necessary to give more room to explore about characters' relationships.

They can't act well. The show would've been okay if it was anything but royalty. Madeline Stowe would've made a better queen. Cersei makes a better queen.

3027,The Royals," Total trash, so I'm sure it's a big hit","I'm one who misses the prime time soaps of the '80s, which have been replaced by crime and reality shows.<br/><br/>I decided to tune into The Royals, a new series on E! mainly because I read that Joan Collins was in it. She's always good for a laugh.<br/><br/>Well, it's hard to know what to say. Soaps, particularly night time soaps, were always trashy. But the acting was good, featuring people like Jane Wyman and Julie Harris, and there were usually some good dramatic scenes, even if the plots could be typically soapy.<br/><br/>The Royals is different. First, it's on E!, the trash channel of television, with its true stories of celebrities, the Kardashians, fashion criticism, etc.<br/><br/>Second, the writing is awful.<br/><br/>Third, some of the acting is worse than the writing.<br/><br/>Fourth, times have changed so there are no holds barred when showing revolting behavior.<br/><br/>The story concerns a royal family of England - not the present one, another one, as if the House of Windsor didn't exist. The King is a good man, but he has a treacherous brother. Because of the death of the elder son, Robert, in a plane crash, the next in line becomes Liam (William Moseley). He is the twin of Princess Eleanor (Alexandra Park). <br/><br/>Park looks like an overly made up Kate Middleton. The model for her character was probably Justin Bieber. She's a complete slut and drug addict, and in the last episode, she sprayed her room with graffiti.<br/><br/>The Prince is a nice boy, though a playboy, and very good-looking. His present girlfriend is an American, though he is being pursued by his ex-girlfriend, a blond bimbo. William Moseley is very good in the role. Brother and sister are devoted and loyal to one another.<br/><br/>Eleanor seems to model her behavior after her mother, who is also a slut and takes drugs, which she gets from Eleanor. The Queen slept with the same bodyguard that Eleanor slept with. <br/><br/>The Queen also has a secret boyfriend. She is highly manipulative and scheming. Joan Collins plays her mother, and if Alexandra Park wears a lot of makeup, Joan wears a ton.<br/><br/>The Queen Consort is beautiful and glamorous - well, it's Elizabeth Hurley and she looks fabulous, even when she's throwing her thong at the Prime Minister so he can wear it.<br/><br/>The King (Vincent Regan) takes walks alone. I actually came in on this show late so I don't know what his story is.<br/><br/>There is a lot of treachery going on behind the scenes, much of it between the Queen and her brother-in-law (Jake Maskall) who wants the throne for himself. Maskell plays this role in a very campy fashion, I'm assuming on purpose.<br/><br/>Also, there are a lot of music video-type sections within an episode.<br/><br/>I'm embarrassed to be watching this, but it's like an accident you can't stop looking at. And make no mistake, it's a real soap and E! actually has a magazine with news of them online, called De-Throned.<br/><br/>It's outrageously fun and outrageously bad.",18 out of 29 found this helpful.,5.0,3 May 2015
3028,The Royals, Love it,"I know a lot of people have been saying that the characters are based on the royal family but as someone who lives in the UK I really can't see it.

Plus I really don't think that princess Kate would do drugs or act the way the princess is portrayed in the series. <br/><br/>Also I'm very fussy about what I watch and I saw the trailer and thought it might be an alright show. Now I can't get enough of it I love it!! The only problem I see with the show is the storyline, like the fact that if prince Liam is now in line to the throne they why is he being allowed to carry on the way he did before his brother died?

3038,Feel Good, Much Needed Representation and A Heartfelt Romance!,"I was happily surprised when I heard that there was going to be a show like this. A story involving a sexually fluid comedian would never have been told ten years ago, but times have changed since then. Mae Martin plays herself essentially since it is based off of her life. In interviews she has stated that this was her life about ten years ago.<br/><br/>The series focuses on her romance with George (Charlotte Ritchie), who has predominantly been straight for her entire life. As a result of being straight her whole life, she keeps it a secret that she is dating Mae from her horrible friend Binky (Ophelia Lovibond). That is not the only problem however. Both rely on one another far too much and have intense separation anxiety when apart.<br/><br/>Mae sees her relationship with George as an addiction. For years, Mae was addicted to all forms of narcotics. The writing is superb for effectively showing how Mae is dependent on George. Not only is the writing excellent at showing Mae's addiction to George, but how an addict also obsesses over one object or person. This was educational for me because I never thought addictions as trading one addiction for another. Another fascinating plot device was that Mae gets ringing in her ears when confronted with narcotics. Overall, the writing was phenomenal.<br/><br/>The series also shows the impact of addiction. Mae's parents are played by Lisa Kudrow and Adrian Lukis. There is a love there, but it is strained because of Mae's past activities. Episode 4 is very heartbreaking because their relationship is explored, but it is an amazing episode and full of several different emotions.<br/><br/>The show is absolutely hilarious too. Mae is super funny and loving with George. Another source of comedy is George's roommate Phil (Phil Burgers) who is from California and is completely zany.<br/><br/>Lastly, I am most pleased with the representation. There are stories about straight white men and women frequently with little variety. Recently, I am happy that has changed. Shows like Ramy and Fleabag have changed that. I hope to see stories like these become a commodity in the future. I definitely suggest this show to watch, it is absolutely amazing!!!",20 out of 29 found this helpful.,8.0,22 March 2020

3053,Feel Good, Neither funny nor original,"I had high hopes before watching this show and I really tried to like it, but it disturbed me a lot. And it's not like it is meant to be disturbing so I'm disturbed kind of disturbance. It's more like a cringy disturbance.<br/><br/>First of all, the show looks like a 2000s queer movie where a straight woman falls for another woman (or in this case an nb person), struggles to come to terms with her gayness and cannot tell her friends that she is dating a woman etc. I think we were over this cliche. I get that it tries to reflect a toxic relationship but still it could be more contemporary. If I wanted to watch the same thing over again I would go watch lots of old lesbian movies which have the same plot.<br/><br/>Secondly, none of the main characters are likeable or relatable in the slightest (unless you are or were an addict or a straight white woman), the chemisty is definitely not there at all and the dialogues are cringy most of the time, especially when they try to be funny but cannot. I expected a more intelligent and funnier writing after reading about Mae Martin and her fame. I watched the first episode with my gf, we didn't laugh even once. She stopped watching it, I continued hoping it would get funnier but it didn't.<br/><br/>Thirdly, nothing about it seemed original. Every subject it deals with is done before so I felt bored most of the time. As I said, it might be relatable for addicts but there are lots of other narratives about it, some of them better-written. I know it is hard to create something original in the 21st century, but I also want to see some effort. It may look like a good show to people born after 2005 but probably not to a millenial.<br/><br/>All in all, I can say that this series fails on multiple levels. It could be unoriginal but at least funny, or it could be none but the characters could be likeable. There could be such a good chemistry between Mae and George that we could forget about all the faults (as we gays always do). But no. It gives you none of these.

I never expected I would ever spending literally hours watching any TV series like this.. but it happened with this one. needless to say, I liked this series a lot. In particular, I liked the strong character played by JLH. She totally delivered in the performance.. and so did the other supporting actors. The overall story is OKish if I think of it now, but what really made the difference was how the story was told/unfolded/delivered. The last few episodes in S2 were really gripping and kept the suspense going till last minute of S02E15. JLH is one damn hot babe, with a sensual yet a pleasing/lovely demeanor.

3056,The Client List, Has a lot of potential. . .,"I'm already developing a sort of love/hate relationship with this show. The love part is with Jennifer Love Hewitt, especially with the way she is so good at creating warm, likable and lovable characters. That's a big plus for me because I just finished watching the first (and probably the last) season of Ringer only to never attain that feeling of empathy or connection with the characters. Riley is very easy to like and feel a connection with. I also like and care about the other characters on the show, her coworkers and her mother (played by Cybill Sheperd). I also like the premise of the show which is about a single mother trying figure out how to provide on her own and going into prostitution as a means to do that which has to be a common issue for some single mothers.<br/><br/>The problems I'm having with the show have to do with the plot lines and characters needing more depth and complexity. There's simply not enough internal and external conflict happening with Riley over the choices she's making. She fairly easily segues into performing sexual favors after being hired as an LMT (Licensed Massage Therapist) without the pesky conscience. What I would expect to see is a woman who might start this in need of money to raise her kids but would have a mixture of good and bad in choosing it. She might go through periods of self-searching and guilt or disgust while sometimes actually enjoying it. She might develop issues of self-esteem while at the same time feeling a sense of power and confidence in her sexuality and in her life in general. But her experience so far is one-noted and difficult to believe. It just all comes off as so easy for her.<br/><br/>Another problem is the glorifying of the prostitution. It's made to look (exclusively) like a glamorous profession, easy to do, fabulous clothes and men who are all successful and good looking. Seriously, the ""johns"" so far are guys who could easily get it for free. They need to show more average, bald, old, fat, insecure or ugly men and Riley having to deal with performing sexually on guys who it wouldn't always be so personally gratifying for her to perform for. There are other issues that also need to be brought in (and maybe will be) such as the threat of STDs, the john who is abusive or dangerous, the angry wife. They did a little thing of a wife painting ""WHORE"" on Riley's car but it was turned into a big nothing. I would like to see a situation where some wife or girlfriend writes ""WHORE"" on Riley's car and comes after her but Riley has no defense or justification or is not vindicated in some way but has to deal with the real repercussions of being a hooker and damaging marriages and relationships. They're whitewashing what Riley is doing for a living and they made it look like the wife was the one to blame for the husband going to a ""brothel"".<br/><br/>Finally, there's this unexpected issue with the show. LMTs are up-in-arms about this show because they feel that it is depicting their profession in a negative light. They feel it enforces the misconceptions and stereotypes that it's common that LMTs perform sexually for clients as part of their job. A perception that they've combated for many years. They are afraid that they will lose the respect they have fought for and that it will cause an increase in clients coming in expecting, or possibly demanding, sexual favors in a hostile manner. They are concerned that LMTs who work alone may actually have their safety compromised by a client who won't take no for an answer. At the very least, the show will dredge up a loss of respect, snickers and jokes about the profession that LMTs have been able to assuage through decades of public education. I think they're right. The reason is because this show isn't depicting this scenario as a tacky ""massage parlor"" that is an obvious front to prostitution (something that I think the original movie came closer to) but as a legitimate massage therapy facility where the LMTs are performing sexually for clients. When real LMTs have posted their concerns on the CL Facebook page and on various message boards, they are met with disdain and ridicule by (already) fans of the show and treated like a nuisance that is raining on everybody's parade but they do have legitimate concerns that should be acknowledged. I don't think the show should be canceled or pulled like some LMTs suggest but they could have depicted the premise in a different manner (like the movie) or possibly attach a disclaimer about this issue during airing of episodes (as another LMT suggested). People pretty much know the difference between reality and fantasy, that real LMTs aren't hookers, right? But the reality is that there are plenty of people who watch TV and think that they are being well ""educated"" about something and will act on it.<br/><br/>This show has a lot of potential to go into areas about the premise with intelligence, sensitivity and depth.

It could've been a fun show, but instead they've given us this drivel. <br/><br/>I think aside from the truly terrible, terrible writing; one of the biggest problems that I have with this show is how unbelievably unbelievable it is. I mean, every guy she sees is chiseled and attractive? Except for the one married guy who isn't getting any at home. Aw, boohoo. Sure, I'm willing to believe one, maybe two chiseled hot guys. But pray tell, where are the old wrinkly guys? Where are the heavy bordering on obese guys? <br/><br/>Avoid. Unless you want a laugh.

3058,The Client List, Not what I had hoped,"So right off the bat, let me get this out there, yes I'm a guy and I know this is Lifetime ""Television for woman."" Okay now that that's out of the way, secondly I'm married and have two girls, hence I don't control the TV much before 10pm and my wife and daughters watch a fair amount of Lifetime and either I'm tuned in or out (actually it's somewhere in between if I'm to be at all involved), but I saw many previews for the Client list and that was enough to peak my interest. So the Client list, aired on Lifetime for reasons which I'm still trying to comprehend although yes I do realize the movie was put out by them and rightfully so as it's within their target demographics, but a series, really?<br/><br/>So down to it, my wife couldn't make it through the first episode and thought it was totally unrealistic, cheesy and overall gave masseuses a bad rep and felt it would make any wife creep out over their husband going to see a masseuse. So she's done, game over, congrats Lifetime as you've disgusted your target audience on the first episode. Now me on the other hand, I watched this for one reason only, JLH and if you need to look up that acronym perhaps you should stop reading now. She is beautiful and her being in lingerie and seductive scenes was enough to peak my interest, however very mixed results for me. On the one hand she is very beautiful and looks stunning in some of the attire she wears so it was a win there, however there is so much of the show that just seems so artificial, all these in shape guys come in, the towel guy in the 2nd episode, all sweaty from what changing towels? Yeah I've seen housekeeping, number one I've never seeing a male housekeeper and secondly 99% are not Caucasian. Taking a step back, okay I gotta remember this is ""Lifetime"" and they have to put something in there to reel in the woman so I guess this is it being how the plot is pretty unoriginal (hence the movie came and went and was complete in itself). But JLH's character is just not coming off right to me and it went downhill in episode 2. She gets drunk and pretty much puts out a sign for her brother in law to bone her, real nice. Wonder how long it will be before they do get together. So yeah I had little respect for her before being she's boning or hand jobbing or whatever to these clients (which they are careful not to really show or dive too much into) but now she's an easy target for the brother in law? Could we get any sicker???<br/><br/>Besides some bad acting, stupid supporting characters this show is just a mess and heading for the tube, and I don't mean the boob tube. I had hoped that somehow Lifetime would be able to pull this off and it looks like their method will be to turn her into a quasi therapist / hand job artist. But this therapy while tying into her life is just stupid and I certainly cannot buy into it. I give it 3 out of 10 stars, just for her being nice eye candy on the screen, but at this point I'm fading out. I know I'm only into the 2nd episode and I might give it another one or two but am on the way out. Even her pretty face and hot bod cannot keep me interested if I have to sit through detritus. Now had this show been on HBO or something where they could get raw if JLH would be so bold, then it could stand a chance, but without that just trying to stand alone on this honor-less story isn't going to win over the woman nor keep the interest of the guys, so I guess there you have it",66 out of 98 found this helpful.,3.0,16 April 2012
3059,The Client List, Great cast but completely out of touch with reality!,"I gave this show 2 stars for the cast and lifetime's attempt to objectify men. It's just totally unrealistic in every aspect &amp; not even funny enough to be a comedy. Perhaps it's time for a new genre like Unrealistic/Fictional/Drama. Imagine a massage parlor where very hot guys go for happy endings from not so prime looking masseuses and the undesirable looking people go for just a therapeutic massage. Sadly all the other plots and character personalities are inconceivable. I guess it's a lack of creativity with emphasis just being placed on what they think women want to watch. Surely they could have put some thought and discussion into the production. Then it might have been a great show. Such a great disappointment and abuse of talent!

But for people over thirteen it's just ridiculous. <br/><br/>And there is not much more to say about it but i can't be published under ten lines so don't read me no more, i said it all but i'm still filling the lines to get over with it.

3061,The Client List, Is this a satire or something?,"I couldn't get through the pilot because this show is a joke. Let me sum it up to you. First of all what do we learn about prostitution:<br/><br/>1) Apparently only good looking guys go to massage parlors with happy endings. Probably because they are the ones with self-confidence issues.<br/><br/>2) Guys who do go there respect and admire prostitutes and want to talk about their problems because what they really want is a psychologist.<br/><br/>Give me a break.<br/><br/>Second of all I have a problem with the main character. I can't feel any compassion for her, because her situation is that she is stupid. I tell you why:<br/><br/>1) Why would she buy a house from loaned money? Probably because everyone else does... Banks are nothing more then legit loan sharks. They don't break your leg, but they do take everything you have if you can't pay.<br/><br/>2) All right, so she has a mortgage and no money. Why would she drive a gas eating monster? She could have just bought a scooter like Larry Crowne did (you know, in the movie with the same name).<br/><br/>3) When things are really tough she becomes a prostitute. Well I guess that sums it up.<br/><br/>I like Jennifer Love Hewitt and she is beautiful but that's not enough for me to watch a show.",89 out of 143 found this helpful.,2.0,9 May 2012

Yes her clients are all unrealistically attractive guys - why would these type of guys have to pay for it!

3064,The Client List, Could be called Sex Whisperer,"I really miss Ghost Whisperer and was happy to see Jennifer Love Hewitt in another series. This show to me has a very similar vibe to Ghost Whisperer, but instead of ghosts being gently coaxed to go into the light, gorgeous men are coaxed to find a life outside paid sex, whether that be in the form of working on their marriage or ending their workaholic ways. Guess that's a little like going into the light. <br/><br/>It is indeed a very silly show. But then so was Ghost Whisperer. I'm not complaining, except for the prostitution aspect of it. The Client List is very entertaining. Jennifer Love Hewitt has something that comes across that screen and makes me care about what is going to happen to her character. I cringe to think of the day when Riley is outed to her family and friends. <br/><br/>It's wonderful to see Cybill Shepherd in another TV series, and she is living up to her well-deserved reputation as a great actor, comedy or drama. She's the perfect Mom to Hewitt. I still miss Moonlighting, one of the best shows ever made, and also very silly. And I love, love, love Loretta Devine as Georgia, manager of the massage parlor. Without her, the massage parlor wouldn't have the comedy that it needs, and even with her amazing talent, there is still not enough comedy in that workplace. <br/><br/>On the downside, I think the show would stand just fine on its own without using prostitution to show the plight of a woman struggling to raise children on her own. <br/><br/>If the prostitution in this show is intended to be comedy, then more needs to be done to let the audience in on the joke. The way it is now, there is just enough serious in the plot that it begs the point to made about what prostitution really is: a sad, heartbreaking thing that has more victims and tears than beautiful women, gorgeous men, and laughter. <br/><br/>Regardless, I still enjoy this show a lot, and I will keep watching it.",19 out of 29 found this helpful.,6.0,25 April 2012
3065,The Client List, Started off great..,"I was hooked on the first few episodes, Jennifer Love Hewitt played a desperate lonely and betrayed wife trying to make ends meet. Then however half way through the season and into season two she became all ego, I believe she is the executive producer so she ensured that she would gain loads of comments about her looks and assets. 
That's when the show began to disappoint. I'm all about a woman empowering herself but vanity is another thing and she has plenty of it. She barely changes her look and always has a face full of makeup and false eyelashes that are so annoying.. no one wakes up with perfect hair and makeup so a bit unrealistic. Jennifer also is a hypocrite knocking others about their 'secrets' yet here are far worse. 
It's a shame as she is a natural beauty and doesn't need to cake on the makeup. Bad behaviour is a much better show.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,4.0,16 May 2018
3066,The Client List, another TV show trying to be on the edge of reality...,"In ""The Client's list"", we have the economy -crisis- as a severe background but a housewife who seems really compelled to buy non essential things. I can understand the difficulties of that family but why the big SUV, the new boots, and apparently the new kitchen: didn't she hear about savings? So that situation leaves her with no other choices than to accept to be a masseuse (despite the strange definition of the job) and put aside her apparent morality... And what about her so-called clients! all so wealthy and good looking! because everyone knows than the ugly ones don't have the same needs than the first category... Seriously!?! Do i have to add that i'm not convinced by the relationships being developed between all the protagonists... none of the characters seems to act natural but trying to enter a category: you have the brave strong mother, her cheerful friend, her tormented brother-in-law, the jealous co-worker... Finally what do we get of that show? a remedy to financial crisis: moral crisis! or how to flip a problem for a new one...

It's as if it was a show wrapped around someone that just can't seem to get enough of herself. ""oh look at me, I'm so adorable"". I wonder if she produced it. I think this because she is the only ""hot"" woman on the show. You would think that in a ""happy ending"" massage parlor all of the women would be hot. But no, you have a large woman running it, an older lady, a very average young girl, another woman that is a total bitch and nothing to look at, and JLH's best friend is a heavier girl.

I would say the only thing about the show that's a little hard to believe is that so many of the clients are really hot extremely fit guys (personally I think lifetime added the hot guys because they know their audience). <br/><br/>The biggest reasons why I like this show and will definitely keep watching is because the show is filled with secrets,sex and romance.",14 out of 29 found this helpful.,7.0,12 April 2012

3074,The Client List, Subversively realistic,"I'm really amazed by how honest and accurate this show is regarding sexuality. It completely flies in the face of long established post- war dogma. <br/><br/>1) The inclusion of obese women, while not visually appealing, makes the show realistic. No one can deny that female obesity greatly exceeds male obesity, yet outside of a few major metro areas this is a regular part of life that is not depicted on television. <br/><br/>2) We live in a world today that proclaims women as victims of all manner of sex crimes, prostitution among them. Uniformly in this show, we see how prostitution is very much entwined with all female characters even if it is simply tolerance. <br/><br/>3) Amazingly, male socio-sexual behavior is very accurately prescribed. Most men are without question losers, or desperately desiring female love and affirmation. It is hard to watch this show and believe in ""the patriarchy"". Yet, this is how it goes. <br/><br/>4) The depiction of the kids is really tremendous. This is a messed up show in many ways, and it does show them as a casualty. You can't walk away from this and think broken families are a good thing. <br/><br/>5) The diversity police weren't bad in this show. I feel like the black and white relations were very typical of modern Southern society. Nothing seemed forced, and it seemed genuine. <br/><br/>6) While the show clearly shows how prostitution is a part of the female existence, there is an element of caring to it that is not commonly understood.<br/><br/>7) The show indirectly brings awareness of the ongoing economic crisis. Soft prostitution has undoubtedly increased significantly over the years, and this shows just how it happens.",5 out of 9 found this helpful.,,8 April 2017
3075,The Client List, Has the potential to be a good show.,"I gave it 4 starts because even though I like the show I can't really get into it because of how phony the writing is at times to benefit JLH. The storyline can draw you in but only to a point because JLH is always getting told how ""beautiful"" she is, making it very corny. It gets old real quick. It must be produced by her because in every single episode they have to throw in the whole town fawning all over her like she's Angelina Jolie and not the girl next door that she is. Its weird. Like other reviews have mentioned...the rest of the cast is below average in looks to make JLH's average looks go farther. Except for her BFF, she's beautiful, but a bigger girl, so I guess she's safe for JLH to act opposite of. The drama and her hectic life is very well written...if they can stop treating her character like the hottest thing to ever walk the Earth and get beautiful women to act opposite her like any other show not produced by her would have, they really will have a good show.",8 out of 17 found this helpful.,4.0,22 April 2013

For example the last 2 episode, one left till the finale and it's looking awesome. I just love the dialogs, and the way at the end it teaches you something, about life, about people, cause I believe that's what cinema is, it tells you a story or presents a situation that either teaches you something or makes you wonder about something... and The Client List does just that; Yeah! I loved the film too, and it was hard at the beginning to deal with the changes, but Hewitt and the writers make it all worth. I just love the fights between Riley ans Selena, I can feel the fire they are both putting into it, and as much as I hate Serena's character I admit that girl is doing a great job.<br/><br/>I already look forward to a new season from The Client List!

The acting is terrific, and each team member works to make the ensemble a cohesive and chemistry rich whole. Not to mention a jazzy, eclectic atmosphere which exudes a neo-1920s-esque level of cool.

Not something you can multitask and watch either since they have twists and turns in it you do NOT want to miss.

3087,Hustle, Hustle is a spicy update of the 1960's Mission Impossible,"""Hustle"" is a rush! It borrows heavily from the 1960's American television, ""Mission Impossible"", but it was a great formula 40 years ago, &amp; it is a great formula today.<br/><br/>Instead of running a con to bring down a corrupt foreign government or rescue a Cold War spy like Jim, Barney, Rollin, Cinnamon, Willy &amp; Paris, the ""Hustle"" crew selects a corrupt, evil or just plain nasty wealthy mark and plays a long con to rob them of a piece of their ill gotten fortune. Robin Hood would be proud of this London based crew.<br/><br/>The composition of the crew is similar in both shows; a handsome, charismatic &amp; ultra intelligent leader, a femme fatal, an electronics expert &amp; a man on the street. Quick change artistry abounds! <br/><br/>""Hustle"" is a delight, &amp; the occasional break of the 4th wall with a glance or wink to the television viewer lets us know that we are a welcome part of Mickey Stone's crew.<br/><br/>The dynamics of the crew keep the energy flowing. Elder statesman Albert (played so well by Robert Vaughn) has passed the torch to Mickey who has Danny nipping at his heals. Everyone loves Stacie, &amp; Ash keeps the ball rolling with quick location transformations.<br/><br/>""Hustle"" is what television used to be when there were quality actors &amp; writers on the small screen.

I really loves the references to ""The Sting"".<br/><br/>Witty plot, beautiful settings, clever lines and many surprises along the story line all combine to make a great show.<br/><br/>American TV can take a lesson or two by studying this show.<br/><br/>And did I mention Adrian Lester ???<br/><br/>Look for it !!!",36 out of 47 found this helpful.,,30 January 2005
3090,Hustle, The Con Is Done,"I think the one mediocre season people are referring to may well be the one when Adrian Lester took a break and Ashley Walters stepped in as Billy Bond for that season. I personally never took to him as a character but then in fairness to him, Mickey ""Bricks"" Stone was a tough act to follow both character and actor. Maybe they are referring to the first series without Danny and Stacie (Marc Warren and Jaime Murray) who were also very hard acts to follow. Again I never quite warmed to Emma and Sean Kennedy (Kelly Adams and Matt Di Angelo) although she was very VERY easy on the eyes. Not as easy as Jamie but easy nevertheless.<br/><br/>Despite all these changes I continued to watch because it was such a fantastic breath of fresh air with great stories, likable characters, brilliant writers and exceptional acting. The other reason to stay with it was of course the A &amp; R Team of Ash and Albert played by Robert Glenister and Robert Vaughn respectively. Until this show I had always really disliked Vaughn. He was a smarmy git in Man From U.N.C.L.E. and a nasty cowardly git in The Magnificent Seven although he did redeem himself at the (pun intended) death. Who would have thought that he would pop up in Britain's most famous street?<br/><br/>Then there is Ash, my absolute favourite character throughout the series. He was just great to watch all the time and one got a sense that if push came to shove he would be the first to take a bullet for the others. Remember the blow fish scene in Eddie's bar? Also, I am a great lover of actor consistency in shows and the fact that the A &amp; R Team were in the series from day one to day done was a biggie for me.<br/><br/>One has to give a nod to Rob Jarvis who played dear old gullible Eddie. Can't really call him the comic relief because the show was intertwined with humour anyway along with the action, drama, mystery and sometimes great suspense. Eddie was simply the backbone of the gangs social life from the start. He was their one constant, solid safe haven and perfect straight man for the tricks and itsy bitsy teenie weenie playful mini scams they played on him. They all loved him intensely though, which was clearly evident in a very subtle and touching dialogue from Ash in the final episode. If not for Eddie's bar I think they would have split up years ago so can I get a big Amen for Eddie?<br/><br/>A couple of things I did miss were the way all the action would freeze and members of the gang would freely walk around through a motionless scene and talk directly to you and me. Whether to show us something we may have missed, tell us what was going on or just simply for the pure hell of it THAT, was a great part of the show for me. Also the way every now and again one of them would just give a subtle smile and or facial expression directly at the camera when something was afoot so to speak. Oliver Hardy would do that and it made me smile EVERY time. These little directorial gems were halted in the early years of the series although those looks and smiles did thankfully return in the final. I loved that style of direction in ""Alfie"" (original with MC) and loved it more so in ""Shirley Valentine"" but not as much as I loved it when Mickey, Danny, Stacie, Albert or especially Ash did it. It felt like this look or smile was just for me and I believe some of the shows charm was lost when that stopped. Ah well, each director to his/her own I guess.<br/><br/>So the Con is Off or the Con is Gone. The great Hustle is done and.........so am I.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a couple of sentences but as you can see, I got carried away.......or I should be.....carried away that is. <br/><br/>Okay, Bye.<br/><br/>P.S. Great theme tune as well.<br/><br/>P.P.S.......Just kidding.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,26 February 2012
3091,Hustle, Awesome series,"This series is refreshing, engaging, thought-provoking and just plain fun! I haven't looked forward to a television series this much in many years.<br/><br/>The chemistry amongst the cast members is apparent, and seems so natural and unstilted. The players are well drawn out by the writers, giving them depth and personality. The plot lines are excellently written with the solution not becoming apparent to the viewer until the end of the show. The background music is perfect. This show has just the right balance of humor, mystery and intrigue, and yes even humanity. I appreciate too the lack of brute violence that seems all too prevalent in many television shows these days.<br/><br/>I can't wait for AMC to air the next season in the series!

3092,Hustle, Breaking the law never looked so good,"The first time I watched Hustle I was hooked. I love how everything comes together at the end, and how the picture freezes and the characters talk to one another or to the audience. Sometimes the characters look directly at the audience so you feel that you are a part of the picture. It is so refreshing.<br/><br/>My favourite character is Mickey Stone played my Adrian Lester. He always seems so calm and collected which is a complete contradiction to Danny Blue, a headstrong young man and prefers the 'short con' whereas Mickey prefers the 'long con'. The other three, Stacey, Ash and Albert, compliment the picture totally. Albert is called upon whenever they need a distinguished, rich-looking gentleman, Stacy is usually as distraction because of her stunning beauty and Ash is just an expert at everything.<br/><br/>I wonder when they will stop tricking the bartender (I can't remember his name). <br/><br/>My favourite episode so far is ""The Henderson Challenge"". Both Mickey and Danny were tricked (Danny was tricked twice). My favourite con in that episode occurred when Danny stuck a sign on a ATM reading ""OUT OF ORDER. PLEASE GIVE ALL DEPOSITS TO THE SECURITY GUARD"". He stood next to the ATM in a security guard uniform and eagerly accepted the deposit envelopes. That was hilarious. And also the fact that Mickey won from the quarter that Danny gave to him while showing off.<br/><br/>The show has comedy and drama. In a nutshell.....WATCH IT AND DO NOT MISS AN Episode.

3093,Hustle, Makes Oceans 11 look like a joke,"There are 6 episodes per season and each episode (although not congruent with one another) are made to a movie caliber. There's some amount of wink, wink and hint, hint at the cameras, breaking the forth wall. But it's subtle and not overwhelming. The pace and chemistry of this crew is electrifying and addicting.<br/><br/>There's not much of an overall story plot, other than a con per episode and there isn't too much of a background on all of the characters, but you will learn to love them within a nick of time.<br/><br/>The cons are justified although not like freaking Leverage where there is a sappy scene giving the money to the less deserved. No this crew is after the money among other things, and do not make excuses for their own gain. However, they are so charming, smart, and yet humane that you learn to love them and watch them as they take down the greedy. Take note, that they do not go after those who have always wronged others, but just those whose greed leads path for this crew to take their money away.<br/><br/>Hustle is my favorite ""fun"" TV show by far, because you just learn to love the con as well as the characters. Also the plot per episode is just so smart and outside the commonality of the con plots that it is astounding that this show isn't the number one show of all time.<br/><br/>Also, I love Jaime Murray (who plays Stacy), I think she's puts sexy, smart, and beautiful all into one character and person.<br/><br/>Lastly, they all have British accents.

3094,Hustle, Absolutely fantastic!!,"I think Hustle is a wonderful series! Its your typical British con show which isn't as slick as your typical Hollywood con show (or something similar - you get the picture). In this version, almost every episode, you think one of the characters is going to get caught, or indeed all of them - which if course they don't but nevertheless! Its gripping with a new storyline every episode so you can tune in halfway through the series and understand what's going on immediately (although I recommend you watch the whole series). Apparently there's a new one beginning filming in August 2005 so we can look forward to more Hustle around this time next year - YAY!!

3095,Hustle, Everyone loves a great con.,"Hustle is one of the best TV shows that exists at this time. Its an honest opinion from someone who have seen 24, Homeland, Chuck, Prison break,Sherlock and many more. However, each TV series has its pros and cons. But in this show you can find absolute fun and not a boring moment. You will love Marc Warren without any hesitation. I have seen 3 seasons in a row and missing Adrian Lester and I don't know why he is not in the show. This TV series has wit, lots and lots of tricks, a whole bunch of teasing which anyone will find absolutely hilarious. Robert Vaughn gets loads of respect for his presence in the show. He plays the big daddy who has experience in conning almost anyone. Glenister is dazzling as a technical genius and the truth is whatever he is expected to do in the TV series is believable. He not only does the computer, he has to act and react to convince. Jamie is like a filler in each episode and later I believe she has gained a reputation of being very important. This show reminds me Oceans movie big time. Its my second British TV series and I have become a fan of their accent. If you haven't seen it, just take a ride with the first episode.

He just can't find the time. A shame! <br/><br/>Hustle has become one of my most favourite TV dramas of all time.

However, the writers seemed to get through their best ideas quickly in the first series and the second series was noticeably inferior.

3098,Hustle," Smart, clever and dripping with genius.","Hustle raises the standards of television; television that has recently sunk into the depths of reality shows, repeats, and more reality shows. Hustle also shows that originality goes a long way. <br/><br/>This program contains three essential legs that keep it upright. Firstly, the idea. The idea of the show is so brilliant that it feels as if a breath of fresh air hits you in the face every time you watch it. It is produced superbly and the atmosphere of the program is modern, original, smooth and sophisticated.<br/><br/>Secondly, the script. Week in, week out, Hustle delivers something new and exciting. The writing is witty and gives the juxtaposition of characterization freedom to move around, while being tied down by the umbrella that is the genre and idea for the program. The dialogue is also good, by the second series the writers seemed to have let characterization seep over the wall of initial curiosity about the acceptance of the program.<br/><br/>The third point is the acting. Everyone plays their character perfectly, as if they are straight out of a jigsaw puzzle, everyone fits brilliantly. The actors gel well on camera and give a positive atmosphere when all together.<br/><br/>The only real thing i can say negatively about the show is that sometimes you have to take a step back and say, wait a minute, they are stealing. That is the greatest con on the program, they completely cover up the fact their stealing and rename their actions as HUSTLING.<br/><br/>But still, this program uplifts BBC's reputation and actually produces some healthy viewing. 99% of todays television is copied, processed and dragged out to the death, It is junk .

3099,Hustle," When it's good, it's very, very good...","but when it is bad it is trite, clichéd, and reminiscent of something better. I enjoy this show. The characters are fun, the twists are (usually) good. When it is at its best, you never see the turns coming. You get inspired and might even want to try a con yourself. I love the way the characters wink at us, the observers. I like the interactions and the relationships that they have built. But occasionally I watch and I know that I have seen this con before, in some movie or book, where it was done better. And occasionally the writers have tried so hard to come up with a surprise twist that you cannot help but see it a mile away.<br/><br/>So, when it is good, it is very, very good.

3100,Hustle, Very engaging,"I am thoroughly enjoying this show; I find it slick, stylish and interesting. The direction is unusual, with strange camera angles, a regular slowing or stopping of time, and characters that occasionally speak directly to the audience.<br/><br/>This team of con-artists are all portrayed brilliantly: there is not a weak performance in them. Leader of the gang is Mickey Stone, a clever, experienced man who is nonetheless cautious due to a previous spell in prison. He clashes constantly with Danny Blue, the youngest member of the group who is a headstrong man and has yet to discover the 'art of the con'. Albert is the eldest among them, a smooth-talker who everybody looks to for advice. Stacey is the obligatory sexy woman, but she has a fun side and she always keeps track with the boys. Finally there is Ash (my personal favourite), a middle-aged man who sets up a lot of the cons and provides the function of walking encyclopedia.<br/><br/>The cons are interesting and dynamic to watch(even though they 'rip off' other shows), but even more interesting are the dynamics of the group, especially when their various pasts come into play. These pasts are never fully revealed; hints are dropped here and there, and I for one would like to know more.<br/><br/>Even though the first episode of Series Two was not as sharp as that of Series One, it was a nice taster and left me looking forward eagerly to next week.

I liked the attention to detail and the ability for it to be fairly believable, despite the fictional capability of Airwolf. The characters complimented each other and made the show very dynamic. Even the music created by S. Levay was really good. It is very unfortunate that the series ended the way it did.  Jan M. Vincent had problems with alcohol and the politics with universal infringed on Bellisario's ideas.  The ""lady"" did not go down with a blaze of glory but rather an un-answered and open ended destruction with the final series. I think that is why so many enthusiast still hang on to Airwolf, it was a killer show that just suddenly ended, even though the ratings were so high. It would be cool to have a new movie produced to give Airwolf a final resting place in T.V. history. But that is unlikely. However, there are all kinds of fan clubs and sites that celebrate this one of a kind 80's show, you will see that Airwolf is very much alive out on the internet.

3107,Airwolf, Fun Flight While It Lasted! Warning: Spoilers,"From the opening music (possibly the coolest theme song in the history of television) to the sleek dark helicopter, to the brooding pilot movie for this series, there was everything for action fans to love! Airwolf began with so much potential: Its brooding anti-hero Stringfellow Hawke and his search for spiritual cleansing and atonement after his experiences in Viet Nam; his gruff mentor, Dominic Santini, whose checkered past sometimes caught up with him; and Archangel, real name Michael Coldsmith Briggs III, a suave and occasionally very dangerous spy with whom the first two form a reluctant agreement. Add to these three different characters some female help and a dose of high-tech espionage, and what emerged was a winner from the mind of Donald P. Bellisario, who also brought the public Quantum Leap and Murder, She Wrote.<br/><br/>Airwolf began as a mid-season replacement show and started off the series with the top secret chopper being stolen by its developer, Dr. Charles Moffett, and taken to Libya to be used as Qaddafi's personal weapon against anyone he dislikes. Stringfellow is approached by Archangel, who very nearly died when Moffett stole Airwolf, and is offered plenty of money to get Michael's pet project back. Hawke, however, has little need of money; he's already comfortable and cultured, so the offer of riches means little to him. There IS something else Hawke wants and, being a top-level spy with access to classified information, Archangel may be able to get it for him. String wants his MIA older brother St. John found. Alive or dead, he doesn't care, but he wants his brother brought home from Viet Nam. Dominic objects vigorously to Hawke having anything to do with Archangel, but he's talked into the deal. He and String retrieve the stolen Airwolf but then refuse to return it to Michael. Hawke wants to use the chopper to force the spy to help him. Archangel seems more amused than annoyed at Hawke's actions, and is amazingly unsurprised by Airwolf's theft. The three men form a shaky alliance: Archangel will try to use his resources to find St. John Hawke, and String and Dom will fly missions for the spy and his organization, the FIRM.<br/><br/>The implausible technology aspects aside(helicopters cannot attain supersonic speeds without destroying themselves), this was a decent show. The effects were passable, the writing generally good, and the acting was solid. Airwolf was unusual in that it had three former movie veterans in its lineup. Jan-Michael Vincent was great as gloomy Stringfellow Hawke, Ernest Borgnine was perfect for tough old Dominic Santini, and Alex Cord made a sophisticated yet vulnerable Archangel. Deborah Pratt played Michael's assistant Mirella for the first half-season. She was later replaced by Jean Bruce Scott as spunky Caitlin O'Shaughnessy, a pilot that Hawke had helped in a previous episode.<br/><br/>Airwolf never sank significantly in the ratings but was pulled after the second full season. Part of the problem was CBS's efforts to tone down the brooding dark quality of the show that made it so unique. The network wanted a more ""family-friendly"" program, which caused the episodes to veer almost schizophrenically between human interest fluff and cool espionage stuff. The biggest obstacle to the show's success was the escalating substance abuse problem of its main star, Jan-Michael Vincent, which negatively affected his work. Airwolf was a fantastically expensive series, even by 80's standards, and having its star showing up with increasing frequency unprepared for work couldn't be tolerated for long. We at first thought it was a cross between Blue Thunder and Firefox, but soon realized that it was neither. It was, and remains, a very original program that we seriously hope comes out on DVD someday---soon! It was a fun flight of imagination in the 80's and is still one today.",15 out of 15 found this helpful.,,5 March 2005
3108,Airwolf, One of the last intelligent suspense shows!,"AIRWOLF, which debuted as a heavily promoted CBS movie of the week in January 1984 (and continued as a weekly series until July 1986); was well written, produced (CBS kicked in a great deal of money for its production) and acted.  It was a thinking person's action (and espionage) show, that truely emphasized personal relationships over technical gimickery.  Every week Stringfellow Hawk and Dominic Santini (J.M. Vincent and Ernest Borgnine) fetched the ultra high tech AIRWOLF helicopter from its lair in the California desert to do the bidding of Archangel (Alex Cord) of the CIA to do one thing or another, though not usually until the last third of the episode which gave time to build a story amongst the players.  The stories mostly centered around SoCal, but occasionally AIRWOLF took a trip overseas (curteousy of USAF tanker support) to fight a cold war type battle.  Like most show's, the best episodes were in the first two seasons.  However, by season three AIRWOLF started to look tired.  By that time Jan Micael Vincent's alcholism problems caused serious production delays (in several 3rd season episodes Vincent is noticably intoxicated), such that CBS ultimately canceled the show; though not with out giving Vincent ample attempts to straighten himself out.  The show still had legs, and was taken over by the USA Network (shot in Canada on a much tighter budget) for a fourth season with a new cast (Barry Van Dyke stepped in as Hawk's long lost older brother St John Hawk) to carry on the CIA's ""chores"".  For the USA show's; cold war espionage was the theme of most of the stories as oposed to the CBS show's getting involved more in current events and family interests of Hawk's and Santini's.  I liked the show alot, and was fortunate to have recorded many when USA rebroadcast them.  It is of interest to note that Jan Michael Vincent went from a per episode salary of $250,000 (for the 58 CBS episodes 1984-1986) to now (2002) near poverty, and is living in a minimum security re-hab type jail, due to several arrests for public intoxication.",30 out of 33 found this helpful.,,11 February 2002

Alex Cord, Jan-Michael Vincent and Ernest Borgnine were very good in their roles (the lovely Jean-Bruce Scott joined them in season 2)and very convincing.<br/><br/>The plots were good. Throughout the series Airwolf went to battle against rogue dictators, wicked scientists and bad guys who wanted their hands on Airwolf. <br/><br/>The action scenes were always fantastic. The music accompanying the action was brilliant. There was always an action scene at the end where Airwolf went to war against the bad guys who usually had their own helicopter/plane.<br/><br/>It was a typical 80's show which aired when the cold war was still very hot. No-body knew who to trust. Even Michael Archangel played by Alex Cord seemed to have his own agenda. Stringfellow Hawke also had his own agenda.

3110,Airwolf, Airwolf - a show a head of it's time?,"In my opinion - the answer is definitely yes. I'm not speaking of the monstrous super-copter, or at least, not mainly of it. The character of Stringfellow Hawk, who is the main attraction of the show, is one you might find in nowadays shows. Not a shallow hero, but rather a complex and deep one. In fact, I found Hawk's character to be very similar to another, more recent one - that of FBI's legendary agent Fox Mulder. I'm sure many eyebrows must be raised right now but think of the following - Both characters are eccentric, isolated and have only one close friend whom they trust, both Hawk an Mulder are obsessed with a missing sibling and their lives are centered around that issue. Both have their own truth and won't hesitate risking their lives for that truth. Need I say more? Jan Michael Vincent was the perfect choice for Hawk's roll - Hawk and Vincent are one. JMV brought a lot of him self into his character, the two are one, practically inseparable. In on of the discussions forum I'm participating in, a question was raised regarding the possibility of making an Airwolf movie. I said that I hope no such movie will be made because I can't see anyone entering JMV shoes as Stringfellow hawk. All of the forum members agreed. All in all, I think that what made Airwolf the great show it was, is JMV and of course we must not put down Ernest Borgnines contribution. Airwolf will always remain a classic.",24 out of 28 found this helpful.,,6 February 2005
3111,Airwolf, Cowboys and Indians ... with missiles,"As a young teenager at the time, Airwolf was compulsory viewing for a generation who wanted their ""Cowboys and Indians"" to have amazing gadgets and whizz-bang explosions.<br/><br/>In many ways, the show was essentially Knight Rider in the skies: similar comic-book technology, a central character who was essentially a loner, and echoing the concept of one man making a difference.<br/><br/>But in other, important ways, it was thematically very different from Knight Rider, Street Hawk, The A-Team and other action shows of the time. For one thing, the premise of the series is built not on a desire to help those in need, but by Stringfellow Hawke's possession of Airwolf for essentially selfish reasons (as leverage to try to find his MIA brother, St John). And then there is the dark edge provided by basing the series firmly in an 80s Cold War context, complete with Soviet espionage and Central American dictators, not to mention the enemy within. Sure, The A-Team constantly referred back to Vietnam and the team's status as fugitives, but it was generally done with a light touch and was rarely central to the plot itself. With Airwolf, the intrigue was key to the tone and direction of the show - although this was (ill-advisedly) diluted as the series went on.<br/><br/>With hindsight, the Cold War setting clearly dates the series, many of the stories are creaky and contrived, and much of what Airwolf does is clearly implausible even with today's technology. But that's really not the point. Airwolf was rip-roaring fun, it tried to tell interesting stories without relying solely on the big action sequences, and it didn't sugar-coat everything by miraculously ensuring nobody died. Sometimes it failed, but often it succeeded admirably - and on a TV budget to boot.<br/><br/>For UK readers, DMAX (Sky channel 155) have just started (Jan 2008) daily re-runs of Airwolf. Set your Sky+ box for this blast from the past - we may even get the re-tooled, re-cast (and sadly vastly inferior) fourth season, which to my knowledge has never previously been shown in the UK.",11 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,10 January 2008

3113,Airwolf," A classic show, better than Knight Rider","Even though most people remember Knight Rider from the fad of the 80's to have vehicles as the stars of TV shows, Airwolf was a far superior product. Donald 'Quantum Leap' Belissario created this show about a high tech attack chopper, and oversaw its best years. Even though near the end Belissario left and the stories began to degrade, the earlier episodes are classic examples of good 80's TV, with good solid performances and breathtaking aerial sequences that put the Blue Thunder TV series to shame. A series that should be brought back.",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,,18 October 1998
3114,Airwolf, what Airwolf laid ground for,"I think a lot of reviews look at this series and complain about recycled footage without taking into account this series was before effects computers. It's a large way humbling just how that and video changed TV and movie production in just a few short years. Years where Airwolf 'coming ahead of its time' by just three years or so, the show suffers for trying to do things with pre-computer-age film technology. I have to think they did more hours filming Airwolf cruising around the southwest than the studio suits thought they needed and budget complaints prevented more because it wasn't until season three that stuff got notable as repeated. Like things happen with the Stargate series and Cheyenne Mountain exterior for *six seasons*. It would have continued if HD tech didn't prompt needing a new set of Cheyenne exteriors shot. As with Stargate SG-1, if Airwolf had kept a driving force behind it's direction from the start we well could have seen a new round of footage. And probably with newer cameras of the day, too. But it was not to be. The budget item kept getting dropped. By season two the writing was on the wall that it just wasn't going to be needed.<br/><br/>Besides suffering from a divided series vision and objective where some shows were fluff and some writing actually had a message and a way to drive it home, Airwolf series was as much a victim of small-studio Hollywood limitations. As X-files suffered Vancouver-itis, Airwolf suffers from outdoor locations being a bit too southern California or blatantly the Universal back lot to pull off Russia, Germany or the snowy waste of Northern Alaska. And the show had to fake glaciers, volcanic explosions, Mexican deserts, and Russia and night flights time with refilming existing film with filters. With scale models and wind machines. People tugging on strings and pushing buttons. The old fashioned way. Like thirty years of TV before it. In time to make a schedule. So someone better get off their backs! They made that flying prop look gooood. <br/><br/>I think people also slam the believability factor without considering audiences back in 1984 weren't all that sophisticated. They didn't question if the Road Runner and Coyote cartoons had proper physics. Those were fun because it didn't. Consider that the Airwolf show (all TV shows) was a one-off, once a week thing to catch on TV and not see again unless you had one of them new, expensive VCRs. People saw shots once and the human mind filled in any mistakes. And people didn't have the Internet to hop onto and find out choppers don't surpass X knots of speed. The Boob Tube was the source of news and entertainment everyday. And people would simply believe it if the pretty scientist lady says it turns off the blades and acts like a jet.<br/><br/>Then they go on about how the Bell 222A was a dog of a ship to fly around. And when they weren't making it look like a Travel California tourism film, they made that thing look like a barn swallow dogging cats on a lawn. That's true magic! The ability to turn that worked up Bell into The Lady people still fill Internet boards discussing so seriously. I just don't think we have the same kind in the present day. At least not in this age of 'reality' TV... It got young people interested in helicopters and general aviation. And maybe just a touch of science? I almost can't call it an action show. It's a science fiction show actually set on the planet Earth. You really just have to roll with it without there being cell phones and fax machines and personal computers. The hero can't type a letter, but can redirect a sidewinder. He and his mentor actually get their hands dirty and fix aircraft and basic electronic circuitry. About the only show I can think of as its descendant is Heroes for bending the ""they can't do that"" suspension of disbelief like Airwolf did. And now all TV adventure shows/cop shows are done with a bit more attention to how long it takes to fly and drive places. To way more medical science, bombs, physics and laptops than people in 1984 ever cared to think about... As a result from shows like Airwolf and Nightrider. And who knows? Maybe fifteen years from now people will be slamming Heroes the same way?",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,,16 November 2008
3115,Airwolf, String and Dom kicked @$$ when they showed 'em The Lady,"Of course, Airwolf was one of the premier action shows of the 80s and was more believable than the sugar-coated antics of Knight Rider and A-Team, because it was set in the world of espionage and Stringfellow killed LOADS of bad guys when he battled them in The Lady. The series started off as a spy thriller with Airwolf duking it out with Russians, German terrorists, war criminals, renegade US agents and hardened mercenaries. If I remember rightly, ITV showed these episodes on Friday nights at 7pm back in November '84. <br/><br/> When the 2nd season kicked in, they moved it to an afternoon Saturday slot. This is when a new co-pilot Caitlin was introduced. She wasn't bad, and they still did good intrigue episodes such as the gripping thriller Moffatt's Ghost, Fallen Angel and HX-1 (Once A Hero was a spectacular actioner), but gradually, the series became cornier, as the Airwolf team began helping out ordinary people and there were some soapy stories such as String falling for a rock singer. They also started using stock footage in some episodes, more so in the third season.<br/><br/>The 3rd season got off to a cracking start with the menacing Horn Of Plenty. Richard Lynch did a good job as the manipulative Van Horn and Caitlin proved she could be a bad*** as well. Other top episodes were Airwolf II, Annie Oakley and Deadly Circle, but as I said before, they started over-using stock footage from previous series and the stories were becoming slushy. Despite this, Airwolf was arguably the best action-packed thriller on the small screen during the Reagan era.",19 out of 25 found this helpful.,,9 August 2003
3116,Airwolf, Another great 80's show,"Why isn't this kind of show made anymore, in the 80's two producers ruled the roost of TV action series, Stephen J Cannell and Donald Belasarius, Cannell was the more the family kind of show, The A Team, Hunter, Simon And Simon etc. Belasarius produced a little darker drama such as Magnum and Airwolf and has carried it on lately with the brilliant NCIS.<br/><br/>Airwolf was the story of a super powered battle helicopter that had been stolen by it's creator Moffit and taken to Libya, Micheal Archangel who was nearly killed in Moffits stealing of Airwolf tried to recruit Stringfellow Hawke to retrieve Airwolf.<br/><br/>Hawke at first rejects the offer and pressure is put on him by his art collection being taken from his home, Hawke wants Archangel to trace his brother St John who is MIA in Vietnam. Hawke agree's to get Airwolf back and with the help of his friend Santini, they both get Airwolf back and kill Moffit in the process and blow any planes out of the sky that get in their way.<br/><br/>Hawke decides to keep Airwolf and will fly missions for Archangel on the understanding that Archangel continues looking for Hawke's brother.<br/><br/>Overall a great action drama series, the music was fantastic, Sylvester Levy's theme tune fitted the show so well not just at the beginning and end, but when Airwolf was starting up, you would see Hawke pushing the button's to start Airwolf, the blades would slowly turn as the music started to build up, the music got faster and the blades on Airwolf got faster, you would see the instrument panels light up ready for action.<br/><br/>Thye air battles were great although some scenes were reused quite a lot especially in the disaster of a 4th series. A movie would be a fitting tribute to the series and the unfortunate Jan Micheal Vincent who has suffered over the years through various abuses of substances, but knowing Hollywood it wouldn't be right unless Belasarius was involved as producer.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,28 January 2008
3117,Airwolf, Airwolf beats Knight Rider,"Airwolf beats Knight Rider any day of the year, even though I think KITT is awesome. The ship's heroic action is great to watch. But stick with the first three seasons. The fourth season doesn't even have any new footage of the ship. It's a shame that anyone ever bothered to continue the show under that detriment. How can you have a show about a super-secret helicopter that doesn't actually have a helicopter in it? Avoid the fourth season if you really love Airwolf. Although there were some plot problems with the first three seasons, especially when Caitlyn was brought on board and kept dating murderous evil men and falling into danger wherever she went, it's nothing compared to the fourth season. For some unexplained reason, the entire original crew is done away with (literally), except for Caitlyn, who vanishes (poof) without a trace. (Maybe her dating taste finally caught up with her?) At any rate, the fourth season is so obviously a cheap imitation of the real thing, it should have never been called Airwolf. It's not.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,7 November 2011

3119,Airwolf, This briefing is from File A56-7W. Codename: AIRWOLF!,"Airwolf would have to have been one of my favourite shows from the late 80's. It had everything I was into as a late teen, helicopters, electronics, guns, rockets, all that sorta macho stuff. One of the better sequences was seen in the first series of a full startup of airwolf. It began with the camera zoomed in on an iguana sleeping peacefully on the nose gear wheel of the super-helicopter. Dominic Santini (Ernest Borgnine), and String-Fellow Hawke walked up to the aircraft, and boarded, this sequence was complete with the sounds of escaping air from the (presumably) constantly pressurized cabin. The Airwolf helmets and uniforms were unique, especially the helmets that (imaginationally) had a heads up display that the wearer could see. This was pronounced by a [ ] on the helmets outside when the visor was dropped and the pilot was locking onto a target. Continuing the scene, Dominic reaches up and presses the ""Start 1"" button. Following a sequence of beeping from the on-board computers, the aircrafts twin turbines would begin to spool up. The scene was further dramatized by the slowest ever startup of a turbine helicopters rotors, with the whoop whoop of the blades as they began to pick up speed, and different angles of the rotor blades, different views inside the cockpit of the different guages including : Weather Radar, Interstage Turbine Tempurature, Gas Generator RPM, Oil pressure, Exhaust gas temperature, Main Rotor rpm, Whacky(TM) compass thing, Electrical diagnostics panel, radar or gps map, fuel guages and a few others that flashed by so quick I don't recall. Following this, String raised the collective now that the rotors were at 100% rpm governor locked, and you see Airwolf get light on its heels, then lift off. Thanks to the magic of gravity, the end of the scene sees poor Mr Iguana suddenly find himself upside down, and drop to the ground (landing like a cat on all fours!), and Airwolf climbing, turning tail, igniting turbos (two rocket engines either side of the right and left wheel/chain-gun nacelles), and flying off into the distance.<br/><br/>Then the opening credits start! Other cool sequences from the series include Dom and String dropping airwolf out of a C130 Hercules (a bell222 b is too wide by several inches to fit inside a C130!), airwolf taking out fighter jets with their OWN rockets (she was demilitarized for some reason), and the best episode of all, was the first, with the big desert chase sequence, with hawke chasing down moffat, after he killed his girl by cooking her in the desert heat.<br/><br/>The show had many twists and turns, and lots of action to keep it watchable, and the theme is unmistakable, played by Sylvester Levy, had that 80's ""synthesizer"" sound, yet was upbeat enough to tap your foot along to when the action sequences, or titles came on.<br/><br/>All in all, still my favorite show, its why I have the boxed set and the episodes on my hard drive :)",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,14 May 2011
3120,Airwolf," Action, drama, adventure, helicopters!","Airwolf is a good example of dramatic action television that came out of the 1980s. What makes this different is that most, if not all, of its episodes involves aircraft at some stage in the story.<br/><br/>The four seasons of Airwolf feature the main characters getting mixed up in all kinds of drama that eventually needs the Airwolf helicopter to help. Airwolf is an advanced prototype combat helicopter capable of supersonic speed that is deployed on missions of personal and national interest, flown by two of the main characters described below.<br/><br/>Jan Michael Vincent plays Stringfellow Hawke, an ex-Vietnam helicopter pilot and Ernest Borgnine who plays Domenic Santini, an old pilot from way back. Together as buddles, they secretly fly Airwolf with funding provided by an FBI-like firm that agrees to support them until they can locate String's brother, believed to be missing and still in Vietnam.<br/><br/>After an ambitious pilot two-part episode (later re-trimmed into a telemovie) which sets up the ongoing series, Airwolf settles into a typical action TV show formula, however the overuse of repeated aerial footage of the Airwolf helicopter (often sped up to make it more exciting) will spoil it for late comers to the series.<br/><br/>For helicopter enthusiasts it will reward them with countless sequences involving Airwolf (a modified Bell 222) and many other types, often seeing Hughes 500s deployed as the enemy gunships.<br/><br/>For trainspotters, it's always ""fun"" to see the footage from the pilot or early episodes being used in later episodes, or being surprised to see they have shot new footage. It's easy to assume that the running costs of the helicopters had a major impact on the production. The ""dramatic"" original landing sequences were often a highlight.<br/><br/>Some episodes were grounded in personal drama, some were just ridiculous by today's science and some were standout stories and made you wish for more. Many episodes end with a montage of Airwolf flying around with the wonderful Slyvestor Levay electronic theme music as the credits roll.<br/><br/>Season 4 was a low-budget cable-funded continuation of the series featuring new characters mixed with old helicopter footage. It is almost dis-owned by fans of the earlier 3 seasons in much the same way Galactica 1980 was by Battlestar Galactica fans.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,7.0,1 August 2010

According to the pilot ep (sometimes referred to as ""Airwolf: the Movie"", they figured out how to disengage the rotor to create less drag which would prevent that. There was even an episode where Airwolf sort of crashed. But they were able to fix it enough so it could fly, but not under the turbo power that allowed them to break the speed of sound. String even ordered up the 'turbos' but Dom admonished him, ""NO String. The disengage isn't working."" Technically, Airwolf shouldn't' have been able to fly or shoot missiles or chain guns or really ANYTHING that it could supposedly do.

As well as one of the best writing of an action series of its type of the 80s. <br/><br/>But I do remember Blue Thunder as well as being the more realistic of the two but had some the most awful writing that I have ever seen (which is the primary reason that it failed horribly). <br/><br/>How ever to compare the two's combat abilities and prowess is like comparing an urban gorilla fighter to the classic field army solider. If anyone paid any good detail to the Blue Thunder Movie. It wasn't about supersonic speed or multiple types of weapons. But about reaction time relative to speed and knowledge of the city. BT took out an F-16 Falcon armed with heat seeking missiles and Mach 2 speed by first avoiding it missiles by decoying it to other heat sources within the city. Then it hid in between buildings and used its 20mm cannon to saw off its wing. Jets fighting a helicopter in a city is like a car trying to out maneuver a motorcycle in an alleyway, and down park steps and sidewalks. Airwolf likes its pray more out in the open where its speed and long range weapons are at an advantage. If Airwolf stepped into BT type of battle ground it would be at a disadvantage sense its main weapons (missiles) would be at a disadvantage (even the radar guided ones because of the greater radio interference and tall buildings). Also Airwolf's guns lack the turret option of BT. <br/><br/>If BT tried to meet Airwolf in open ground it would be in Airwolf advantage.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,5.0,22 October 2007

Its cute.<br/><br/>Disney's Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is the first computer generated (CG) 3-D animation television series to feature the ""Sensational Six."" Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Daisy Duck, Goofy, and Pluto star in this series, which focuses on interactivity with its primarily preschool-aged audience to stimulate problem solving. Each episode involves the characters helping its viewers to ""solve a specific age-appropriate problem utilizing basic skills, such as identifying shapes and counting through ten."" The series uses Playhouse Disney's ""whole child"" curriculum of cognitive, social and creative learning opportunities.",16 out of 24 found this helpful.,10.0,11 November 2006

3137,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, The worst Disney production ever!,"While my childhood has been immensely influenced by Disney movies and characters, I'm afraid the new Disney productions are just way below expectations.
Mickey Mouse clubhouse is simply terrible with lame and noneducational stories. Mickey seems like a bossy boss who is constantly giving nonsense orders for mixed up adventures (as they call it) that depend mostly on stupidity and magic.
The other characters add nothing to the whole series and every time I watch it with my kids, I wonder why they suggest those horrible ideas. I don't want to sound like someone who is against imagination, but the mouseketools provide twisted and unnecessary ways to solve problems. So what are we trying to teach our kids? And why do we need flirting, kissing, weddings... in a program that is targeting such small ages?
Overall, I don't encourage watching this series.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,1.0,24 May 2020
3138,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, My toddler loves it!,I've never been a big fan of Mickey Mouse but the new cartoons may change my mind. My son is almost two and loves to watch this show. He likes to dance with the music and copies the actions of Mickey. He loves to see familiar objects on this show and shouts the words out when he sees them. It's not set at a speed that is too fast or too slow for the pre-school age group. There are a lot of useful activities for young children like counting and shapes. I think the show is entertaining and educational for toddlers - one of the best I've seen. If you like the Disney Learning Adventure DVDs I think you will also like this show.,10 out of 15 found this helpful.,9.0,16 August 2006
3139,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Mindless Dreck!,"Just everything about this show is god-awful: the stories, the voice ""talent"", the songs, the music... you name it.

To dare to call this dreck ""educational"" is a insult to all other educational programs.<br/><br/>I'm an avid fan of animation, especially the animated films produced by Disney and Pixar, but I'd rather listen to someone scratching their fingernails on a chalkboard for a half hour than be within ear shot of this garbage. ""Oh Toodles!"". ""Mickey Mishka Mooska!"". Give me a break! The 3D animation is at least mediocre. I actually feel sorry for the animators, knowing the painstaking animation process requires listening to these wretched soundtracks over and over again.

3141,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, Better than it is made out to be,"I am 18, and a huge fan of Disney. Mickey Mouse Clubhouse is not their best show, plus it is not even close to the classic Silly Synphonies, but it is light years from their worst. Sure it can have its predictable moments, but it is better than it's made out to be. I often see it criticised for being a rip-off of Dora the Explorer. True, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse uses the talk-to-the-camera technique, but so do other shows even before Dora. And I may get some flack for this opinion, but I think this is better than Dora. Dora I find annoying and repetitive, and other than counting to one to ten in Spanish I learnt little from it.<br/><br/>Back to Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. The stories can be predictable and the dialogue overly-simplistic. Plus the pacing of the episodes can be rushed or draggy. However, I liked the animation. It has been criticised for being rough, robotic and lacking variety. Maybe so at first, but I for one think it improved. The backgrounds are colourful and bright, the colours are nice and the character designs are fairly good. The clubhouse actually looks very interesting in my view. The music is pretty decent too. The theme song is simple but memorable, and the accompanying music is decent enough. I personally thoroughly enjoy the Hot Dog Dance, and liked its imaginative and funny name.<br/><br/>I also liked the social and creative skills that Mickey Mouse Clubhouse teaches children. Children I think will be delighted by the fun that goes into this show(I have toddler friends who adore this show), adults mayn't be so impressed, but the look on their child's faces will say it all as they learn new skills in every episode. The characters are engaging enough for the target audience. Mickey, despite the criticism he smiles too much contrary to his more mischievous persona in the original cartoons, is very benevolent and an ideal character for children to at least relate to. Goofy is still funny, and Minnie and Daisy are interesting without being too vapid. My only disappointment character-wise is Donald, I don't hate him far from it, but I would have liked to seen more of his cantankerous personality that made him so funny yet endearing in the originals. Morever, the voice acting from the late Wayne Allwine, Bill Farmer, Tony Alselmo, Russi Taylor and Tress MacNeille is rock solid.<br/><br/>To conclude, it is a good show but no classic. 7/10 Bethany Cox",9 out of 14 found this helpful.,7.0,7 September 2010
3142,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse," Good fun, if unoriginal","My young children love Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, what can I say? But as I was watching with them, I swore I was watching an episode of Dora The Explorer played out with Disney characters. The similarities are many: interactive questions for the young viewers, complete with pauses to simulate the child's answer, followed by an exclamatory ""Right!""; a ""toolbox"" used throughout the show by Mickey (with the viewers' ""assistance"") to solve problems (just like Dora's ""Backpack""); and a review of the successful journey followed by a celebratory dance routine (ala Dora's/Boots' ""We Did It!"" song). As a leader in animation and film for so many decades, I was surprised to see that that Disney has relegated itself to cloning another successful franchise. But the kids love it...what can I say?<br/><br/>Also, everyone loves the Hot Dog song! It is written and performed by They Might Be Giants.",12 out of 21 found this helpful.,8.0,12 May 2006

Mickey is still the kind leader of the gang, Donald is still the short tempered sidekick that ultimately learns his lesson in the end, Goofy is still...y'know, Goofy. <br/><br/>Even though in the original cartoons Pete is a villain, in this series he's more comic relief.

3153,Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, And I thought Dora The Explorer already was bad enough...,"Okay, so Disney can still pump out some good movies, but when it comes to kids cartoons, they are freaking doomed. What IS this crap? The animation looks someone cluttered on a piece of paper, wiped his/her ass with it and then decided to include it in the final product! But strangely enough, that's the LEAST worst part. The story lines are just boring, overly formulaic and makes no sense. The characters are reduced to be either unrealistically sugar-sweet or total cockalorums (the latter most applied to Mickey Mouse), which would be fine if it was used for comedic abilities, but it's not. NOT. AT. ALL. Also, what have they done to Donald Duck? He was easily the most developed, the most interesting and the most three-dimensional character in the Disney- universe, but you know what? Now he's just like everybody else. Overly happy-go-lucky, kind to everyone and never EVER looses his temper. How did that happen?? It's not realistic, kids KNOW everybody gets mad sometimes, even Dalai Lama probably had a anger moment in his life. So why do they decide to go the weird route that EVERYBODY acts like the super-nicest human being? I always hate that about new kids cartoons, that everyone is just happy all the time for no reason. Also, since when is Mickey friends with Black-Pete? That's just stupid, they are supposed to be enemies! Hell, he even asks Mickey for help in one episode, which is probably the worst moment on this ""show"" there is. Despite all these examples, I have STILL not gotten to the worst part yet. Oooooh no. You know what REALLY makes me mad? All the other factors are god-awful, but what truly makes me rate this 1 is the goddamn songs! The singing voices are horrible, the lyrics are either super-clichéd or stereotyped (like Minnie singing about her bow tique, just because she wears a bow and is a female). For some reason they also just contain words that aren't even words, but just sounds like something a brain-dead retard would come up with, like ""Mickey Muska Mouse"". ""Muska""? Learn your kids to speak real English. No, I'm just saying, for the love of God, turn your kids away from this show or they'll NEVER appreciate true classics like the old Spongebob-episodes, the REAL Mickey Mouse- cartoons from the 40's or Rocko's Modern Life.

3154,Graceland, Series never should have been canceled!,"Something this layered and suspenseful that is based on actual events doesn't come along often and when it does it should be given more than 3 seasons to establish a fan base. Yes some of it is incredulous but there would have to be some of that to offset the reality and gore of violence that is based on reality. Add to that a fine cast of actors and you get a winning combination. Such a shame it was canceled to make room for something fluffy. It's hard to understand why this wasn't renewed, especially given the cliffhanger at the end of Season 3, along with unfinished story lines that would have been exciting to explore. Why is it that once you're hooked on the drama and the characters a network decides to cancel? I don't understand why networks don't query their audiences before making these decisions!

3156,Graceland, Intriguing law enforcement/spy genre piece lives on good casting and locales,"Despite the title (the show is only in the most tangential sense Elvis related, thank goodness), we felt we had to watch at least the pilot because of the presence of admirable Broadway actors Aaron Tveit (NEXT TO NORMAL &amp; CATCH ME IF YOU CAN), Daniel Sunjata (TAKE ME OUT) and Courtney Vance (SIX DEGREES OF SEPARATION).<br/><br/>Vance, as the head of the FBI at Tveit's character's graduation, may not prove an ongoing character (inexplicably for a personality of his calibre, IMDb doesn't even mention him in the Pilot Episode at present!), but he SHOULD be as he serves as a solid grounding for a location and character heavy tale of young cross-agency enforcement agents living and working out of a luxurious beach front headquarters seized from an Elvis-fanatic drug lord (hence the name for the house and series) before the series ever begins.<br/><br/>The true leads in the story about drug enforcement and possibly the investigation of the enforcers are Tveit as the young hotshot just out of training academy with top scores and unlimited potential and Sunjata as the experienced but still charismatically young agent (one of the few with Academy scores exceeding Tveit's own) who is to field train Tveit. The hour and 15 minute pilot was languorously paced but ultimately got in its share of moments of excitement among the hot locations (was the opening shot really intended to evoke the opening shot of THE USUAL SUSPECTS?) and potentially enjoyable cross currents of character relationships in the unusually large ensemble.<br/><br/>The USA Network has made a name for itself with quirky character ""mysteries"" which entertain on many levels and, despite an unfortunate European-style preference for ultra-short ""seasons,"" allowing the well ensembles time to develop followings. Given that time, with slightly tighter story telling, GRACELAND should be another in a popular line-up of lightly challenging USA entertainment. It has something for everyone between beach skin, vicarious luxury, post collegiate kidding, an underlying frisson of mistrust and dark underpinnings and the promise of developing character interplay among the large cast (who will turn out to be bad guys beyond stealing from the communal refrigerator? Who will mate with whom?).<br/><br/>In some ways GRACELAND looks like it wants to be a cross between the BIG BROTHER HOUSE and TRAFFIC. If they can get the mix to gel, and they seem to be off to a good start despite one or two moments which strain credibility - but which may actually be parts of the story supposedly ""based on fact,"" they could have something very special.

This is a story about seemingly ordinary people and their work: FBI agents who enforce the law by arresting the people who break the law, as they've been taught in school. Hence, this job is much more complicated by the criminal mind learned to hide, to connect with all parts of society, only to avoid justice. Because of that, the ordinary people of the law have to work undercover, to look like criminals, to talk like them, to lie and do everything to arrest them. All that lying and erasing themselves could be very dangerous and who knows where could lead.

After the first couple of episodes I would have given it about a 5 compared to other USA shows like Psych and Suits which are strong 8 or 9s. But after these few episodes, the series begins to flip the clichés on their head. Without spoiling anything, the roles perceived at the beginning of the show are switched up with many of the characters holding a secret over their heads. The one secret that has began to shift the story line really has changed the structure of the show using dramatic irony to really give the show an interesting and dramatic twist. The twist and turns as well as the cliffhangers at the end of the episodes really hooked me and even if you don't appreciate the acting( which I still think is good enough) you should at least be able to appreciate the unpredictably towards the end of the series. In summary, I feel like the negative reviews are slightly justified but don't judge this series on the first episode as it really just sets the scene rather than beginning to further the story line of the show.",21 out of 29 found this helpful.,8.0,11 August 2013

I always go by the saying, ""Don't judge a book by it's cover."" I watched the show and I was surprised. If you are reading this review right now it probably means that you have not yet seen the show, so I will attempt to drag you into watching the show in a brief summary without revealing too many spoilers so here it goes:<br/><br/>A regular guy by the name of Mike Warren has just become an FBI agent and wants to be sent to DC to work, but he is reassigned to go undercover in a investigation on a man named Paul Briggs at place in Southern California known as Graceland. Mike is to be trained under Paul and at the same time he is to investigate and make sure that Paul is doing his job. Paul and Mike's new roommates are all DEA and ICE agents who work undercover doing illegal things to help bust the bad guys who are all basically Mexicans, Russians and so on.<br/><br/>This all might sound a little confusing right now, but if you give the show a chance you will understand completely.

Everyone lies to everyone else about everything, which is fine as long as they stay focused on their cases, but when their lies and romantic entanglements interfere with their ability to maintain plot structure, we're all screwed. I'm one of those people who enjoys marathoning where TV shows are concerned. I stay focused for a few days or week and it's over. I move from scene to scene without commercial interruption and see if everything holds together. In Graceland, it's a study in human entropy. Everything is in a state of complete and utter chaos with little resolution without massive bloodshed, both physically and metaphorically. The price the audience pays for restitution is far too steep for the time one spends pushing through it. The series was a great concept, and I am completely convinced that had it not gotten so incredibly off track with the sub-plotting tied to, you guessed it: lies! it would have had a long run. The premise of inter-agency people working under one roof is way out there cool, but not at the expense of melodrama on a grand mal scale.

The lead character is booming with character development potential, taking you into a world of gritty action, mystery, and all shot in beautiful California. It is my belief this show will get even better as the season progresses. <br/><br/>Plus I just love action packed TV Shows with characters that kick ass. Especially when they are against all odds. Being good or bad just makes a good plot twist. If only the FBI where trained in martial arts as well as firearms they could add a dash of drama and some broken bones and the show would be even better.

3167,Graceland, Definitely Improved,I think the show has definitely improved from the first few episodes. I thought that the first 2 or so episodes were very weak and the characters were boring and had no layers but I stuck around because I thought it might get better and I'm glad I did. The characters have much more depth now and the show has gotten less hokey. Although I do think it all may seem a bit unrealistic (not the fact that they all live together but what's been happening) its entertaining and always keeps me guessing and on the edge of my seat. I feel like they try to cram to much into each episode though. But overall it's enjoyable and the acting and the show itself have gotten much better.,9 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,25 August 2013
3168,Graceland, Not right for me... or anyone interested in quality writing,"I'm really a fan of great writing, plot and character development, screenplay, acting and cinematography.<br/><br/>This show has: * hot actors * a nice scenery with MTV fading shots of surf / sand ala Jersey Shore * awful cliché of what ""work"" means when it comes to a profession<br/><br/>The writing is just bad. It's up there with Entourage minus the interesting characters (Gold etc). There are sharp, disjointed elements to the screenplay and writing that boil down to an attempt to put multi- leveled writing in place - such as the social+professional aspects to their lifestyle. The actors are trying to move from catchphrase ""surfs up!"" terms being used to describe their profession with overly fast- talking nonsense about the case which is really trying to add some substance to the vacuous nature of the show.<br/><br/>This is horribly juxtaposed. The attempt to heighten the drama with such bad plot would be fine if the writing were consistent, but it's just not. The only thing constant is the fleeting dashes between thinly executed emotion on behalf of the 2d character's actors and the idea that apparent professionals in the FBI are all ""street"" playas hanging and surfing while talking slang and sharing good times.<br/><br/>It's stupefying to watch and how this got a production budget is beyond me. It may pass for entertainment in the US teen market but this doesn't have the ability to cross the ocean and appeal to a wider audience.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time.",24 out of 49 found this helpful.,2.0,22 September 2013

3170,Graceland, Great season 1,"I thoroughly enjoyed season 1. A group of young undercover agents who do a terrific job fighting crime. Episodes are suspenseful and plots interesting and evolve throughout the season. In season 2, all that skill goes to hell and they can't seem to tie their own shoes laces without screwing it up. The characters who in season 1 were intelligent,courageous and highly skilled have somehow become stupid imbeciles who look like rookies and have seemingly lost many of those skills and act in defeatist ways in season 2. And with each passing episode the characters get more and more inept, emotionally stunted and incapable of carrying out simple tasks successfully. One character who was a star in season 1 seems to become fixated on one thing and looks more and more paranoid and fixated with each passing episode. It's like she had a dual personality; a competent one is season 1 and an emotionally stunted paranoid one in season 2. I'll watch season 3 just to see if any of these people regain some of the skills they seemed to no longer have in season 2. I wonder if the writers wrote season 2 while using some of the cartel's drugs they wrote about in this series as it is a very unrealistic portrayal of how characters can evolve from one season to the next. One final thing. A protagonist in season 2 who in the real world would have been arrested for having $20 million in safety deposit boxes on a $50K/year salary isn't even investigated and is single handedly capable of brining an entire FBI operation down. Further, why are there no alarms or cameras in Graceland for filming any break-ins if it is such a high risk secret safe house. The protagonist can break in with a pick and basically is able to reveal the entire secret group of undercover agents. This just doesn't make sense. This is one of many huge gaps in common sense in the plot of season 2.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,7.0,17 January 2016

Also, I felt like the show was more about how hot the male actors were than the actual storyline. One character in particular I don't believe even owned a shirt. Then you have the cliché of partners being in a relationship (how boring), and then the new guy coming in to replace him (yeah that hasn't been done before), and then he has to get shown the ropes from the goof-ball (wait, have I seen this before?), and last but not least the leader of the group is going through some mental anguish that he has to overcome (c'mon now really?).

Not to mention if your expecting a undercover FBI agent, I seriously doubt you send a message through the cockpit of the plane he's traveling on, asking for FBI agent so and so, and I also doubt the stewardess would go asking for said FBI agent in front of all the other passengers. It kind of tends to blow you future cover. The entire crew seems highly unprofessional in their behavior. This is one of those show that you have seen a million times before, where the ragtag bunch of a undercover crew are suppose to be the best there is and so on, and the newbie make all the mistakes they tell him not to make, and where every one is semi hostile towards him cause he's replacing someone they have worked with for a long time. You've seen it in 21 Jump Street; you've seen it on Dark Blue and basically every other show of this type.

3185,Baptiste," Tchéky Karyo keeps searching even after ""The Missing"".","""Baptiste"" is actually the third season of ""The Missing"", but since the missing person is already found in the second episode and an entirely new storyline develops from there, the makers probably thought it was better to start over as a spin-off with a new title. ""The Missing"" was a great series with tense &amp; convoluted screenplays and a magnificent role for Tchéky Karyo as the brilliant and persistent ex-researcher Julien Baptiste, who still occasionally helps the police with difficult cases. When vacationing with his family in Amsterdam, Baptiste is called upon by the local commissioner (who's also a former girlfriend of his) to help locating the missing niece of a Brit named Edward Stratton. When Baptiste finds the girl, she tells a very different story, namely that she's a prostitute and that Stratton was an overly obsessive client of her. When confronted with her version, Stratton confesses to Baptiste that he's being extorted by a relentless Eastern European human-trafficking ring, the Brigada Serbilu, because he helped the girl to steal a large sum of money from the criminal organization. Shortly after, the young prostitute dies in an attempt to escape from Brigada Serbilu, but the money she stole is still lost and the Brigada now even targets Baptiste's family to force him finding the money. ""Baptiste"" is nowhere near the greatest TV-series ever produced, and even a step down from ""The Missing"" already (especially season one), but it remains well-made action/thriller entertainment with great performances, relevant social themes, solid suspense and a handful of unexpectedly shocking twists. Certain sub plots are rather silly and unnecessarily stretched with implausible twists, like the money that keeps disappearing, but every scene involving the portentous Brigadu Serbilu (and notably the creepy Constantin character) network is realistically raw and terrifying. Like ""The Missing"", ""Baptiste"" is primarily a British production but in collaboration with Belgium and The Netherlands, which mean that several local acting talents have the rare opportunity to finally star in a more prestigious series than usual, like Barbara Serafian, Boris Van Severen or Tom Audenaert.",12 out of 15 found this helpful.,7.0,24 June 2019

3197,Baptiste, Contemporary cross-border sociological analysis posing as a detective series...,"Looked at more philosophically, ""The Missing"" series 1 and 2 and now ""Baptiste"" - from writers Harry and Jack Williams - seem to offer a multi-layered cross-cultural experience, given that they are in real life British-Belgian cooperative ventures giving actors from various countries roles as characters (not always from those same countries) interacting in positive and negative ways. A surprisingly gritty (and far-from-positive) review of modern European realities is offered in the process.<br/><br/>While ""The Missing 1"" harked back to a more traditional ""something bad happens to Brits while on a continental holiday"" theme, it homed in on a Northern Irish guy teaming up over the longer-term with a French detective (the titular Julien Baptiste). It also featured British residents in Belgium-pretending-to-be-France doing horrible things with a measure of impunity.<br/><br/>In ""The Missing 2"", Frenchman Baptiste travelled to Germany to work in the environment of remnant British armed forces still stationed in that country, with again very dark and dirty things going on against the background of that very specific community and environment (also extending to the Middle East given many of the key characters' military service out there).<br/><br/>Now, with ""Baptiste"" - a series ostensibly fousing still more closely on the wonderfully philosophical (and very authentically observed) detective played by Tcheky Karyo, what is really on display is freedom of movement and the roles it plays in a very mixed-up modern Europe.<br/><br/>More-aware British viewers of ""Baptiste"" will probably be more sensitive than most to the (unusual nature of the) idea - here writ large - of people shuttling between The Netherlands and the UK in a matter of hours, for various good and bad purposes up to and including contract killing. So much for ""the precious stone set in a silver sea which serves it in the office of a wall or as a moat defensive to a house, against the envy of less happier lands""! Few films or series you can think of have ever offered such an ""open"" portrayal of our island or emphasised to this extent the mobility that is now possible, and the degree to which the integration process is achieved.<br/><br/>And as Karyo himself notes in the DVD's Extra Materials, a quick visit to ""those streets"" in Amsterdam (now more accessible than ever) represents an ethical and philosophical dilemma for many of us, all the more so in the face of the potential desire we might actually feel, given the fact that we cannot with hand on heart dismiss the women involved (rarely Dutch themselves) as unattractive and only of interest to the desperate (as might have been the case in other places at other times).<br/><br/>""Baptiste"" the series pushes the official Dutch line that having things out in the open may help the prostitutes involved enjoy greater safety, better health and somewhat fuller freedom of choice. But that freedom in 21st-century Europe is apparently accompanied in deeper, darker layers by trafficking activity from various quarters that is parasitic upon it; and the efforts of Europol to counteract that also take centre stage in this series, as familiar actress Jessica Raine features as a British detective working for that supranational body in an all-consuming battle that for her is both professional and personal.<br/><br/>So French and British and Dutch detectives cooperate to combat ruthless Romanian gangs trafficking young Polish women. There is a high body count associated with all that (and a threat posed to Julien's (British) wife and family); and the picture painted of today's EU is somehow one of hypocrisy and unequal struggle; and most of the piece is sad and moody. As in ""The Missing"" the web of connections between characters is incredibly complex, with many a substory thrown in to flesh out the main one, mostly very touchingly or interestingly, and with the emphasis on diversity and eccentricity of experience.<br/><br/>While ""The Missing"" series 1 featured a pretty ""immaculate"" Baptiste that hardly ever said a wrong thing or let us down, the Baptiste in ""Baptiste"" is an older and far more-flawed figure, though still one in many ways proving irresistible. But, considering his being called in here as an ""expert"", one may question how often his sleuthing skills and experience really show, or make a difference? Rather, this version of Baptiste is discovering layer after layer of disconcerting or downright horrible things in pretty much the same way as we in the audience are. Ironically, then, the series ends - as did the first ""Missing"" - with some kind of tribute to the resilience of the human spirit that is telling, touching, but also a bit desperate-looking, considering what has gone before.<br/><br/>Indeed, virtually all the main characters here go through a great deal, but none more so than Edward Stratton, as portrayed by Tom Hollander. For my money, the character moves from being an unconvincing and ineffectual-looking one at the beginning of episode 1 to being an amazing, resilient (if still-unassuming) hero by the time the final credits role. Perhaps no such person could really exist, but it matters little as the acting credentials of Hollander are by this stage beyond doubt. It's a great part for him, to which he does full justice.<br/><br/>While ""Baptiste"" is pretty low on laughs, Hollander's Stratton - surprisingly - offers a few of them, as does Karyo's Baptiste and even Raine's Genevieve Taylor. A sub-story about a technology-obsessed 21st-century peeping tom is also salutory, as well as somehow quite amusing in a dark way.<br/><br/>Not funny in any way, but far more human and nuanced than you might expect, are the excellent portrayals of the Romanian gangsters by Alec Secareanu as Constantin and Zachary Baharov as Nicolae.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Baptiste"" is (and should be seen as) more than just a detective series. It's really a kind of sociological project observing - darkly and I would say quite effectively - the Europe in which we live - and the EU which Brits ultimately decided they might want to escape from...",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,30 June 2019

Too many of the characters are simply not believable, the dialogue is often rather clunky and the plot is too convoluted.<br/><br/>An elderly ex-policeman with a dodgy arm and a limp chasing villains around the streets allied with a tubby civilian, Tom Hollander, doing the same made little sense; neither character was at all realistic. The woman from Interpol, played by Jessica Raine, was wooden and either horribly miscast or demonstrating that she can't really act. Overall, it was slow and lacked cohesion, with sudden bursts of activity thrown in at random as if to wake up the audience. Characters came and went with little reason and less memorability.<br/><br/>The idea was fine, but the execution pretty poor.

3202,Baptiste, What a load of crap.,"Why did they team up with the BBC? The actor in other productions had a better show.<br/><br/>This plot has sooner become unformulatic, dull, queue moody music, diversity, inserting happenstance and glaring conjecture.<br/><br/>It has become irrate and ignorant. As it simply inserts stereotypes by the spade to prop up its cliche driven formulation which only makes sense to the dumber. The gangsters aren't gangsters, the cops aren't cops, the plot happens on the whims of somebody's imagination and it was simply exploiting a market paying for crap. Welcome to the BBC offering another fantasy nobody with a brain watches. Sure there's some other sheeple dressing up as cows and donkeys living in a box.

3205,Rugrats, Classic Rugrats Ruled!,"""Rugrats"" was one of my favorite shows when I was little. I watched it when it premiered back in 1991 when I was four with the other two original Nicktoons, ""Doug"" and ""Ren and Stimpy"". I watched all three shows but ""Rugrats"" was my favorite of the three.<br/><br/>The original 65 episodes where classics. They featured real adventures shown from a baby's point of view. My favorite characters were Phil and Lil, they were funny, and Angelica. My favorite episodes of the original 65 were ""Together At Last"", ""Pickles vs. Pickles"", ""Passover"", and ""Slumber Party"". Even though all of the original episodes were great. <br/><br/>After airing for three years ""Rugrats"" was canceled. It was during the three year hiatus where ""Rugrats"" hit its peak. After popular demand the creators decided to bring ""Rugrats"" back with new writers starting with holiday specials like ""Chanukah"" and ""Mother's Day"". The 97' episodes were good but not as good as the original. My favorites from these seasons were: ""Baby Maybe"", ""Johnathon Babysits"", and ""Autumn Leaves"". <br/><br/>Things soon changed in 98' with a feature movie bringing the arrival of Tommy's new baby brother Dil. The movie was good, however, the episodes that followed staring Dil were not. ""Rugrats"" turned from a show following the adventures of babies to a show about babies babysitting a younger baby. Every episode now followed Dil. If the babies tried to go on an adventure Dil would always ruin it. There were, however, a few good episodes here and there in the Dil season. (two of my favorites being ""No Naps"" and ""Music""). The other episodes were basically about the babies getting abused by Dil.<br/><br/>And just when you think things couldn't get any worse they did in 2001 with the arrival of three new characters. The ""Rugrats"" second feature movie ""Rugrats in Paris"" debuted in theaters in the fall of 2000. I loved the movie and I thought it was better than the first. The episodes that followed however were really, really, really bad. The series went from a show evolving around the Pickles to evolving around the Finsters. Kimi, Chuckie's new step-sister, is a female Tommy.(Why do we need another Tommy?) Kira, Chuckie's new step-mother is just plain annoying. Lulu, Granpa's new wife is just pointless. Why did Grandpa have to move out? Didn't he already try to move out back in 1993 and moved back in because he realized that his grand kids needed him? All episodes featuring the new characters were dull. The babies no longer went on adventures. Instead they just followed Kimi's imagination. The only decent episodes in the Kimi seasons are ""The Perfect Twins"" and ""Pre-school Daze"". And that is because these episodes barely feature Kimi and her imagination at all.<br/><br/>In conclusion if you want to watch a good show, watch the original 65 episodes or at least the Pre-Dil episodes. You can still catch the original 65 episodes on Nick's new T.V. station Nicktoons. <br/><br/>*Ratings* Classics Rugrats(91-94) - 10/10, Pre-Dil(97-98) - 9.5/10, Dil Seasons- 3/10, Kimi Seasons- 1/10",55 out of 73 found this helpful.,10.0,13 May 2005

3207,Rugrats, A reviewer got to do what a reviewer have to do,"Rugrats was one of those cartoons I grew up watching as a kid. Before SpongeBob, Nickelodeon had this show which last for 14 years and it was successful. It was one of the original Nicktoons to be produced. The series follow a group of babies going on adventures by themselves without their parents knowing. As a show itself, its not perfect. I loved the earlier seasons the most especially before the 1998 movie. Come season 6, the quality did became lesser, but it was still good. Seasons 7-9, however, are really boring to watch, since there's recycled stories, and uninspiring writing. It can get repetitive in general, in which most of it have to involved the babies doing something, Angelica try to stop whatever they're doing, etc. Animation wise, it is trippy and art style is unique at the time that it was never on-model. Writing was at its peak during seasons 2-3. Early episodes have its bump, but still had its charm. Seasons 4-6 while weaker in writing still had its Rugrats feel for the most part., even if the latter does become to feel tired. Once you get to the post-Paris movie seasons, the writing fell apart and you'll be disinterested for 70% of the time. The characters are likable for the most part unless we're talking about Angelica and maybe her parents. Voice acting can be obnoxious at times, but they still pull it off during emotional moments. IMO, it's still one of Klasky Csupo's magnum opus. I only recommend seasons 1-6 though and the first movies are classic (avoid the crossover movie with The Wild Thornberrys).",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,24 June 2018

3209,Rugrats, Part Two: Post-1994,"Post-1994<br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>In 1997, at fans' urgings, Klasky-Csupo, with a more complex soundtrack and somewhat better looking animation, brought back Rugrats after a three-year hiatus.<br/><br/>Though not as classic as the old show, it still managed to maintain some of the charm and energy of the original series.  A few of the better episodes which somewhat harkened back to the older series, including ""Radio Daze"", a spoof of the old Dick Tracy radio shows, and such typically whimsical episodes as ""Send in the Clouds"" and ""Dust Bunnies"".  All episodes were enjoyable; even ""The Family Tree"", the set-up for the first Rugrats movie, was decent.  In 1998, however, two tragedies befell the rugrats, sending them into a void from which they would never emerge.<br/><br/>First, the brilliant voice of Grandpa Lou, David Doyle, died.  For fans of the actor or of his character, his last episode on the show, ""Lady Luck"", while hardly  classic, should be cherished as his magnum opus.  This left a void in the show which could never be completely fufilled.  The replacement, Joe Alasky, tries hard but sounds more like he's drunk and suffocating than the much older Doyle did.  Even the relatively annoying Alasky nonetheless held the show together well enough.  But even he couldn't save the show from the next catastrophie.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt Rugrats was FINE.  Most fans found it FINE.  Even kids did.  The show's creators should've stopped while they had a modicum of respectablity and originality left, in 1998.  But:<br/><br/>At the end of the two-part ""Family Tree"", Didi reveals to Stu that's she's pregnant.  Oh boy.  Well, this still isn't necessarily a bad thing; it can be saved.  If they could make an at least interesting new character, than perhaps the show's existance could be prolonged for the better.<br/><br/>But, in the at-best mediocre ""The Rugrats Movie"", we're introduced to Dylan Prescot (Dill) Pickles.  Hah hah, great joke.  We get it, not funny, boo.<br/><br/>
But what's even worse is that Dill is a screaming piece of crap. Literally.  He's there simply to be cute (which he's not) and to make poop jokes (hah hah!).  He abuses the other rugrats (especially brother Tommy), walks around in a surrealistic walker (the ""Kangaroo"", or something equally absurd), poops himself, and says stupid baby talk.  Now the babies are forced to babysit Dill.  Whoo, what fun!<br/><br/>But even worse is that the adult characters are dumbed down.  In the 1991-1994 - and, to a lesser extent, from '97-98 - they were humans.  They had real concerns.  They acted realistically.  Well, they were a bit negligent, but they weren't too contrived.  They are instead reduced to spouting stupid one-liners and observations.  Their previous portrayal provide the framework, but not the characters, of the adults. Their characterization in these later seasons simply plays upon the cliches established in the earlier episodes ('97-98 included).<br/><br/>
In ""Still Babies After All These Years"", creator Gabor Csupo claimed that they invented Dill so that there would be someone even ""less evolved than the other rugrats"".  Yeah, right.  Those of us over the age of seven or who have IQs higher than -10 can see that you were just doing this for money. Make the show run on and on.  Get dumber characters and plot lines.  Milk that cow as much as you can.<br/><br/>By 1999, however, Klasky-Csupo had, shockingly, already gotten tired of Dill.  So, they made ""Rugrats In Paris"".<br/><br/>Personally, I find nothing wrong with the film itself - it had a good plot, funny jokes (especially the ""Godfather"" references), and a great voice cast. Well, actually, yes, I do:<br/><br/>Grandpa Lou got married; Lulu (oh, match up similar names, whoohoo, funny!) is the wife's name.  Now, Chaz gets married, too.  Kira, the mother, and Kimi, the daughter, two typically PC Japanese characters, join the family. Oh, and there's a dumb dog.  Spike, the dog, falls in love with Kira and Kimi's dumb dog and it's just stupid.<br/><br/>What little respectability the Rugrats had maintained following Dill's addition (not much at all, with ""Submarine"" being the only episode that was even tolerable - ruined, of course, by Dill) was gone.  Now, the cash hogs at Nick are caving into to the stupid kids' demands.  Why does the majority have to be stupid?<br/><br/>So, Rugrats just barrels on into oblivion.  It is doomed to implode in on itself, like the dreams of Ms. Bitters.  There may be more movies, and the series shows no signs of stopping.  Rugrats was inducted onto the Hollywood Walk-Of-Fame - I don't know whether to be happy or sad.<br/><br/>And then, in July 2001, a last-ditch effort to save Rugrats occured.  The grand redoubting of the tyrant Klasky-Csupo - which has destroyed such great shows as ""Aah! Real Monsters!"" (actually one of their own), ""Rocko's Modern Life"", and now, ""Invader Zim""(!), brings us: teenage rugrats!  Lame, lame, LAME!  That's all I have to say.  The only thing different is that the babies interact with the adults.  Whoo-hoo.<br/><br/>So here Rugrats is: from great show to money-starved pig.  Enough said.",51 out of 81 found this helpful.,8.0,9 July 2002

3212,Rugrats," A great show, with many memories and a lot of great moments over the years.","This show was fantastic. I started watching it from about 2 years old, and from then on, so I pretty much have many baby and childhood memories of this show. I loved the show. It had a lot of amazing episodes that were very entertaining. All of the babies are interesting and likable in their own ways, as with the other characters. I grew to this show more than I would with any other show from my childhood if I'm completely honest. We even had all the VHS tapes years ago.<br/><br/>The Rugrats Movie was quite good, although the addition of Dil was quite unnecessary and therefore kind of killed the show. <br/><br/>Rugrats in Paris was even better than The Rugrats Movie, I enjoyed it a lot and still do. And I thought the addition of Kira and Kimi was interesting as a kid, but now I realised that adding new characters into a show like Rugrats just makes it dull and less interesting because the classic episodes only had the 4 original Rugrats and that's how we preferred it.<br/><br/>So yes the show went downhill after Dil was introduced, and even more downhill after Kimi was introduced, but those 2 movies were still great. But nothing will beat the classic Rugrats, 1991-1994. THOSE were the greatest. Those episodes are the reason so many people like it.<br/><br/>Overall the Rugrats is a great show, IMO the best show that ever aired on Nickelodeon, and the 1991-1994 era of the show is pure classic.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,22 January 2016
3213,Rugrats, smart and entertaining,"I loved this show in the 90s. It probably started my conviction in enjoying shows that can give the wrong impression but are actually smart and entertaining to older viewers.<br/><br/>Rugrats is about a group of babies (but not made for babies). They can talk to one-another but not adults, with toddlers being a middle ground who can talk fully with either, much like Stewie in family guy today. The show is also full of references, mostly to movies and TV.<br/><br/>Their greatest enemy is fear resulting from misunderstanding, often exacerbated by their older toddler cousin who likes messing with them, or simply imagined enemies in their games that come to life like a vivid long cutaway.<br/><br/>As time went on they eventually added more characters to the baby mix which weakened the show and going back to the earliest episodes the show started quite different with no speaking sections perhaps actually aimed at a young audience.

3214,Rugrats, Was My #2 Favorite Show On Nickelodeon,"Rugrats is about a group of babies named Tommy Pickles who is the fearless leader of the group, Chucky Finster, the scaredy cat of the bunch, and a group of bickering twins named Phil and Lil.  No show is complete without a nemesis, in this case it's Tommy's older cousin, Angelica who is also a spoiled brat.   <br/><br/>I used to enjoy watching this show all the time.  It's very entertaining and the stories for the cartoons were creative.  <br/><br/>I would like to emphasize on ""was my #2 show on Nickelodeon"".  I say that because the show, for a time was very good and entertaining and then  Nick started putting out the newer episodes.  Then there was the addition of Tommy's new baby brother, Dil who is now the most annoying character on the show.  A lot of the humor is gone now, too.  I mean most of the humor now is just stupid toilet humor or worn-out humor from the old shows.  The show has since then, lost a lot of it's impact.  Now the new shows are just retarded. The stories and plots now have the babies making a lot stupid decisions and getting into some pretty idiotic situations.  <br/><br/>I give Rugrats a 10/10 for the old episodes and 1/10 for the new episodes.",21 out of 31 found this helpful.,,17 July 2001

3217,Rugrats, A show that stood the test of time,"I had first discovered ""Rugrats"" since the mid 1990s(during the show's production hiatus), in which I was only a mere Rugrat myself. I loved the characterization, I loved the humour and every aspect of every episode just left me hungry for more. Definitely a great experience of my childhood. However, the later episodes are often criticised, most notably the ones after the show had originally ended production/took a hiatus in 1994. But in my opinion, I find myself enjoying the later episodes as well, even if they are not up to standard with the much earlier episodes. I also loved the development of the characters and the story lines, as I had mentioned earlier. The show's first season mostly focused on Tommy(who in the first season, for the most part, actually acted like a proper baby), but eventually as the series progressed, it began to focus on Phil, Lil, Angelica and even Chuckie. Most notably later on, when we found out that his mother died. It also does well in tugging your heartstrings, as episodes like ""I Remember Melville"", ""Moving Away"", AND ""Regarding Stuie"" show, as well as the movie ""Rugrats in Paris"". In the early 2000s, it began to wane in popularity due to criticisms of Klasky/Csupo producing the majority of the Nicktoons(in spite of Nickelodeon asking Klasky/Csupo to produce Nicktoons for them, instead of Klasky/Csupo just randomly pitching Nicktoons for the network) and the show was eventually cancelled in 2004, due to ""Rugrats Go Wild"" flopping and ""All Grown Up"" (which was recently rumored to be retconned as of late) was becoming fairly popular. Not to mention that SpongeBob's popularity soared heavily during that time period and its movie did so well, that Nickelodeon decided that cancelling and ending that show was a mistake. To me, ""SpongeBob"" actually suffered a worse fate than ""Rugrats"". Because whilst ""Rugrats"" added new characters, at least it never made inconsistent changes to the previous-existing characters and didn't focus on sadistic and mean-spirited efforts to be funny. That is just my opinion on the matter. ""Rugrats"" is a cartoon, that to me, will never get old, has stood the test of time for me and paid high contributions to Nickelodeon's success(though we can't forget that it was Ren and Stimpy that put the Nicktoons on the map).",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,11 July 2013
3218,Rugrats, Greatest animated show ever!!,"Yes the greatest ever-even better than the Simpsons. Rugrats managed to do everything that the Simpsons did, without being rude, vulgar, and obnoxious. Well OK, Angelica was obnoxious. Anyway-The best part of the show, was how accurate every character type was portrayed. You had the super intelligent Tommy, the I am not sure, I am scared of everything Chucky, The spoiled brat cousin Angelica, the I can do anything as good as you Susie, and the bro and sis twins who argued about absolutely everything-Phil and LIl. And then there were the parents and Grandparents. The workaholic, power suit wearing, I am always in charge-Angelica's mom, coupled with Drew(Tommy's uncle)-The yes dear, whatever you say, and I am always right older brother to Tommy's dad Stu. Stu the stay at home dad wannabe inventor, and his wife who always seemed to keep everything together, no matter how bad it got-Didi. Chucky's dad the paper pusher accountant type-who was also never sure about anything(his wife left them in the first season, then later had died). Phil and Lil's parents- The role switching large sized crack the whip type mom, and the mealy mouthed yes dear husband-Howard(who always seemed to have a lot of laundry to do). And last but not least-the granddad(drew and Stu's dad) who lived with Tommy, and my favorite characters-Boris and Minka(from the old country)- Tommy's other Grandparents. As far as I could tell, all the main characters were Jewish, which clearly led to the charm of the show. Another great part, was that the writers always threw in a couple of jokes that only adult viewers would get. So you as the parent would always want to watch, if for nothing else than to see what jokes they would have that day. To this day, my wife and I both use references from Rugrats episodes on a regular basis. Similar to MASH, the baby characters would mispronounce words, that would be a play on that word to give it more than one meaning. My oldest child grew up watching the show, and I think it actually helped her quite a bit. Every funny family subject was covered-especially holidays like Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Passover and Chanukah. There were several Stu invention shows, shows where the babies got lost(mostly because Grandpa fell asleep), and even a 4 part episode about Reptar(their version of Godzilla). If I had to pick one show to watch for the rest of my life-Rugrats would be right up there with MASH and Bonanza, and maybe Star Trek TNG. Can't recommend it highly enough. Tons and tons of great life lessons disguised as a kids' show. And all done in the best light hearted manner possible. Glad they have the reruns on again on late night Nick. At times the show is so funny you cannot take your eyes off it!! IT is the kind of old school humor that doesn't exist anymore!!",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,28 September 2012
3219,Rugrats, Rugrats Started Out On Top Of The Mountain; Ended Up In The Ditch...,"When Rugrats hit the scene, I instantly loved it. I was 7 years old when the first episodes aired, and it was a great show. I couldn't get enough of Tommy, Chuckie, Phil, Lil &amp; Angelica. It was great and had lots of good episodes. Then something terrible happened. For no apparent reason whatsoever, the creators decided it would be a good idea to give Tommy a brother and make a movie. What a horrible decision. Dill added NOTHING to the plot of the show except being ridiculously annoying and ruining all of the flow of the main characters. Also around this time, the writers decided they needed to take the more adult-type themes out of the show entirely and make this show as if it should be shown on Nick Jr. instead of Nickelodeon. I will never understand why they changed the show so dramatically towards their extremely younger demographic group. Rugrats had plenty of older kids and even teenagers and some adults watching regularly. Why pander to your youngest viewers who would watch the TV no matter what show was on? They lost me when they added Dill. However, I did view the show after the 2nd movie because my mom had in-home daycare and they would be watching it. The character of Chuckie's step sister was even worse than Dill. That series of episodes was even more unwatchable than the ones with just Dill. I was just saddened watching that and seeing how downhill Rugrats had fallen. It's a shame that Nickelodeon and their creative writers, did this to basically every show that was good in the early 90's. Am I right? Look at what happened to their best shows, they were either canceled or changed so dramatically that they no longer resembled that great show you once loved. Doug was sold to Disney and turned into crap. Hey Dude was canceled in it's prime. Rocko's Modern Life was given the boot for no reason. Angry Beavers was given the axe because of a disagreement with the creators wanting to keep the show the funny. Nickelodeon from 1990-1995 was great, then it just fell apart and we got stuck with a bunch of garbage mostly after that that has never recovered into anything watchable.

This first came on in 1991 and is still on the make, there has been lots and lots of episodes as the rugrats are likely following in the simpsons footsteps as they are also still on the make with lots and lots of episodes. The Rugrats have made 3 movies and hopefully there will be more movies to come from them. My favourite episode of The Rugrats is No More Cookies Angelica because i really love that episode where Angelica Burps. That makes me laugh.

3222,Rugrats, A crowning jewel of Nickelodeon which somehow ended leaving a bad taste in everyones' mouths,"Though stating the obvious, I think it is safe to say the Rugrats was a giant among 90's children's television. Compared to the sickeningly sanitised animated programming of today (except for maybe Spongebob), Nickelodeon was at its ultimate creative peak from the early to mid 90's. Despite the slightly low-budget animation and sketchy production standards, the originality of the likes of Rugrats, Rocko's Modern Life, Doug, Real Monsters and Ren and Stimpy were simply unparallelled.<br/><br/>Rugrats was my absolute favourite cartoon, growing up as a child. The versatile characters, the witty dialogues, the simple but compelling story lines and the subtle cultural references made for a remarkable show. The world viewed in the eyes of babies and toddlers was a fascinating insight into early childhood. The babies represented universal character 'types' which a lot of young kids can identify with. Tommy, the brave leader; Chuckie, the chronically scared one; Angelica, the quintessential spoilt child; and Phil and Lil, the twins with their similarities and implicit differences.<br/><br/>Much of the original run of the early 90's brought out all these qualities. Episodes which can be viewed over and over again! The show was given a second birth in 1997. This time with considerably enhanced animation standards and a crisper musical score. The episodes, while lacking a bit of spark of the early 90's era, maintained my interest considerably. All was good.<br/><br/>By this time, Rugrats had become a major franchise with an international following. It always seemed like a natural progression to produce a Rugrats 'movie'. Such happened in late 1998. The results were stellar--an all star cast, top notch animation and a crazy, funny and emotional plot. Most notably was the introduction of Dil Pickles, Tommy's new baby brother.<br/><br/>The following new episodes, however, proved much different. The episodes were visibly watered down, relying on gross out, toilet humour and contrived plots. Dil served as nothing but a device for viewer annoyance and disgust. Nonetheless, the stupidity was largely watchable, as it didn't really require much thought.<br/><br/>A second movie was subsequently made, called Rugrats In Paris, in late-2000. Again, this was a triumph much like its predecessor. Tragically this next era marked the beginning of the end for the Rugrats. Yet more new faces were introduced--Kira and Kimi, step mother and step sister of Chuckie. While neither character was as horrible as Dil, they were about as interesting as cardboard cutouts, adding zero relevance to the show. What stuck out the most was the dramatic decline in the show's quality. Each episode became worse than the next, with one-dimensional and predictable plots and a drastic makeover of all major characters. They had been reduced to farcical caricatures of once vintage personalities. Basically, if you had seen one episode, you'd seen them all!! Along with this sad train wreck came new voice overs for Grandpa and Chuckie, the contemptible babysitter character Taffy and a couple of horrendous spin offs. The latter mainly focused on the lifeless All Grown Up as well as the short-lived Pre-School Daze which is up there with some of Nickelodeon's worst material.<br/><br/>It's sort of hard to sum up Rugrats. Its legacy is one that was tarnished towards the end, but the sheer strength of its early days more than compensates for it shortcomings. The cartoon is easily up there with the greatest, because of that.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,23 February 2008
3223,Rugrats," Once Great, now Horrible","I used to love the show from 1991 to 1994. When it came back in 1997, it was okay, but not great as it used to be. But now since Dil and Kimi came on, the show is just plain horrible. What mad me angry is that the show replaced Christine Cavanaugh (voice of Chuckie Finster) with Nancy Cartwright. Nancy is a great Bart Simpson but, she is NO Chuckie Finster! I hope Nickelodeon cancels this show for good, and bring back the great shows like Rocko's Modern Life, Invader Zim, and Ren and Stimpy.",19 out of 34 found this helpful.,,8 November 2003
3224,Rugrats, Good show,"I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I remember it very well. If you ask me, it was a good show. Two things I especially remember very well are the opening sequence and theme song. In addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. Also, the writing was very strong. The performances were top-grade, too. If you ask me, every main character was really cute. However, Angelica (voice of Cheryl Chase) was a pure bully and brat most of the time. I hope some network brings the show back so I can see every episode. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I'm not sure if I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.",12 out of 20 found this helpful.,9.0,4 May 2006
3225,Rugrats, lets morph! ...not,"OK. Rugrats WAS an awesome show. They had good plot lines but the show was on t.v. too long. They ruined the reputation they previously had by allowing Nick to take over. Rugrats ""all growed up"" was an okay movie and a cheap excuse for a television show. I remember as a child running through the door, and grabbing the remote so that i could turn on my favourite show. Then it started to get ridiculous. The simple plot lines where babies outsmart adults morphed into plot lines where they, forced their parents to get married (or not get married), grew up and started dating, and i can't say what else because i found it too pathetic to watch. Nick took a great show and decided that it needed a larger audience (which was totally wrong). They polled people and decided that teens like watching shows about other teens (which is true) and they decided to lose the audience they had and gain a very,very,very small audience. I give the old rug rats a 10 out of 10 and the new rug rats a 0 out of 10 i vote a happy medium with a five out of ten. Good luck to the rest of you forced to watch the pathetic new episodes.",10 out of 16 found this helpful.,5.0,6 July 2006
3226,Rugrats, A all-time childhood favorite,"I loved watching this show. While the situations totally unbelievable (who would really kids alone that long) they were always great. The imaginations of these kids were amazing and always full of fun and adventure. I loved the stories and especially loved the way they talked. It was great when they messed up the words, like the ""jerky"" (jury). Yet when I was born in 1997, they brought this show back and yet they cancelled it in 2004. Plus I loved all two movies, especially Rugrats Go Wild. I find both the old and newer episodes of the show to be funny. A great show that I still love to watch.<br/><br/>Brings back childhood memories.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,31 December 2013
3227,Rugrats, One of my favourite Nickelodeon tv shows,"The first several seasons of the Rugrats were the best. I could watch every episode repeatedly, and still not get bored. That's how good the Rugrats actually was. I use to own several episodes of Rugrats on video, and it was something I cherished. It brings back fond memories if you ask me. It was a great show on Nicktoons too. It was even shown on BBC in the UK.<br/><br/>The great thing about the Rugrats were the characters: Angelica, Chaz, Chuckie, Didi, Drew, Lil, Phil, Stu, Susie, Tommy etc. Every one of them were important and valuable with my favourites being Chuckie and Angelica of course. I liked how Chuckie was scared of pretty much anything and everything, and I really liked how Angelica was so obsessed with getting her hands on that cookie jar. I think Angelica is the star of the show: she was the main reason why this show was so entertaining. She's like the main antagonist of this show despite the ""Grown-ups"" thinking that she's a little ""princess"". And let's not forget the two pets (Fluffy and Spike), who added more spark to the show. I liked that episode between Fluffy and Spike, and consider it as one of my favourites. Other episodes I liked are one involving the football game, where the babies are fighting over that chocolate milk, and another one where Tommy thinks Stu is a robot or something. These episodes among others were awesome, and I could watch them several times, yet still not get bored. That's how great the first several seasons of the Rugrats actually was.<br/><br/>When we think of Rugrats, we usually think of those babies, but it was also the ""Grown-ups"" that contributed as much as those adorable, little babies, and that was important otherwise the show wouldn't have worked as well as it did. I find it amazing how the ""Grown-ups"" are very similar to the people you find in the real world around you. The likes of Drew and Charlotte being busy with their careers, and having very little time to look after their daughter - Angelica. Someone such as Stu working at home, and Didi mainly being a housewife, and looking after the babies. The great thing about the Rugrats was that it wasn't just a show, but a show that can teach others or viewers the true essence of life. It seems as though the Rugrats had some sort of purpose. That Passover episode(s) is a fine example.<br/><br/>However, the show did start to go downhill once a new baby came onto the board/scene called ""Dil Pickles"". This new character, basically, just ruined the show, and the Rugrats started to lose its appeal. I hated Dil Pickles so much: very annoying character. The episodes got so boring once he came onto the scene. I feel the Rugrats should've ended at that moment instead, and the show would've been perfect. So, the Rugrats does have its downsides, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying the show. I do think that this show went for far too long, and that wasn't required at all.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,,17 April 2018

3229,Lovejoy, Perfect British escapism.,"When I sat first sat down for a rerun of Lovejoy after nearly eight years of last seeing its final episode, I was prepared for some nostalgia. However, the nostalgia turned out to be not just mine, but an integral part of the show. This is not necessary something you would associate with Jonathan Gash's novels about the shady exploits of the no-less shady antique dealer Lovejoy. The first series was a bit closer to the spirit of the novels, as some of the scripts were adaptations, but the results were still somewhat uneven, jumpy pieces of television drama. It was only after the show was revived five years later that it broke loose from the original guidelines, and by the third series it had developed a more polished and delightful identity that is as much its own as Gash's creation. And this identity is all about fantasy and nostalgia.<br/><br/>Just look at the characters: There's Dudley Sutton's Tinker Dill, the tipsy but lovable olde-world gentleman with his perennial beret, tweed suit, campy army reminiscences, and a ready selection of antique trivia, poetry quotes and the admonishment ""Visigoths!"" for every occasion (this character particularly was softened from the cynical lush portrayed in the first series). And Chris Jury's Eric Catchpole, the leather-jacketed, heavy-metal-gobbling working-class youth and butt of jokes, ever aspirant but almost never bright or classy enough to strike out on his own. His somewhat neglected replacement from the fifth series on, Diane Parish's lively Beth Taylor, seemed to pose problems for the writers, perhaps because it's okay to take the mickey out of a young white man but less okay to take it out of a younger black woman.<br/><br/>Then there's Phyllis Logan's Lady Jane Felsham, the white, far-from-brittle English rose, who doubled as the unreachable object of Lovejoy's romantic longing and as a ""nice aristo"" with cash and class to support his operations - much to the chagrin of her too-stuffy-by-half husband. Caroline Langrishe's Charlotte Cavendish, who replaced her in the fifth series, may have been airbrushed as a more independent career woman, but ultimately she too was designed as a beauty with a posh accent and suspectibility to roguish charm.<br/><br/>And finally Ian McShane's Lovejoy himself, scampering along as if his jeans were too tight, spinning endless yarns to get him out of a tight spot (and often in them, as well), or taking a double-take glance at something precious - either antique or female - among the junk. As one guest character points out, he is an eternal boy, never ""Mister Lovejoy"", always unattached, always living basically from hand to mouth. So quite different from the Lovejoy of Gash's novels: the cynical, sexist, womanising, manipulative little schemer whom we should still like, because he supposedly does it all with oh such charm and is occasionally even capable of such great displays of basic human decency as putting people above things. And despite the occasional corpse and threat of bodily harm, the adventures of Lovejoy and his entourage in the series are really boyish romps in search of hidden treasures and a bit of budding romance, providing ample opportunity for excitement, witty banter, humorous escapades and lectures in art history - both real and invented. As if to confirm the juvenility of it all, three of the six series featured Malcolm Tierney's delightfully slimy rival dealer Charlie Gimbert as a bullyboy to be dodged and sent up.<br/><br/>But there's more to it, namely Lovejoy's love for antique for its beauty and preciousness - which doesn't stop him from making profit with it. The highly romanticised view of all that's old and hand-crafted with skill and love is a good excuse to hide from the anxiety about the new. This is why the series has dated little over the years: apart from a stray blast of instantly dateable pop music or fashion, almost all of it takes place in the affected timelessness of dusty antique shops, stately country homes or picturesque small towns where the newest thing in sight is Lady Jane's Range Rover. Of course Range Rover, because this is also about saving British heritage - whether it be medals, paintings or the right people - and pulling a fast one on those who see it as nothing more than a business opportunity or an obstacle to progress. Those who are helped are the little people, loveable eccentrics or down-on-their-luck gentry who still harbour the old skills and crafts or are bit useless but decent folks who deserve a helping hand. And those who get shafted are scheming dealers, greedy real-estate developers, yuppie upstarts or brash Yanks and ockerish Aussies with more money than manners - all those Thatcher's disciples clamouring for ruthless efficiency and frightful modernity.<br/><br/>In short, this combination of British archetypes, ironically tinged nostalgia about the old world and jolly adventuring makes for a perfect British fantasy world, the kind that, to outsiders like myself, is probably more real than the real Britain. Like Lovejoy's loaned Volkswagen, Miriam, in series three, it may be a bit rundown, and quite a bit inefficient, but it's got history and character - and it's all we can afford. It's a world where quick wit, a dash of style and knowledge of the past and the crafts of old can still win over ruthless economic realities, tasteless pomp and all the newfangled technology. It's an enticing vision. It's almost complete and utter tosh.<br/><br/>And it works brilliantly. Apart from a slight drop of quality during the final series, the show maintained a high standard of stories, dialogue and acting that kept me watching long after a mere nostalgia trip would have lost its potency. In fact, it's disturbing to see how different this series is from much of today's programming. Few subsequent shows have tried such an almost naïvely waggish approach and fewer still have made it work without coming across as cynical or calculating. Or perhaps I'm just getting old...",98 out of 103 found this helpful.,,30 January 2004
3230,Lovejoy," Lovejoy, love it to bits!","This TV series brings back fond memories of the late 80's, early 90's. Happen to have an interest in Antiques but this was completely unnecessary in order to enjoy the series. Lovejoy the Antiques dealer was an interesting combination of amateur Detective, righter of wrongs, incurable romantic/ womaniser (!), and occasional con-man which gave him a slightly dark edge - though he would generally only con other con-men or unsavoury wealthy types with so much money they would hardly notice it. This was a programme which at the time seemed to out-shine all others. The first series in 1986 was separated by a five year gap to 1991 for the second series. It only returned due to huge public demand in the UK. In the end six series were produced though some of the old characters had sadly disappeared by the last series. Why do I think Lovejoy was so good? Because it was refreshingly innocent - there was no 'body count' (well a very occasional murder), lots of good-natured banter between friends and very varied story-lines. Plus Lovejoy seemed to lead a rather enviable life, sometimes struggling financially, other times with a wind-fall but always surrounded by good friends and enjoying the hell out of life. And what country-side - the beautiful green fields and villages of England's East Anglia! There were 71 episodes to enjoy, and it does get repeated here and there - but only a few episodes have been released on VHS. Where Oh where are the DVD's??? If you haven't seen it yet and get a chance to see it - do so - it'll leave you with a feel-good factor you won't forget.",46 out of 49 found this helpful.,,4 June 2003
3231,Lovejoy, Possibly The Most Wonderful Character You've Never Heard Of,"I have to credit my Ex-Girlfriend, Wendy for one thing... She broke up with me and forced me to move back in with my mother for a time just in time to catch this series on A&amp;E back in 1995! Ian McShane is possibly one of the finest character actors ever to have a lead in a series, and the writing for this show certainly didn't hurt. Of course, it didn't stay on A&amp;E very long, as they seem to prefer British series based on famous literary sleuths (Holmes, Marple, Poirot, etc.). Nonetheless, for an estranged Doctor Who fan (The local PBS station had just announced it's demise and their intent to cease carrying the series) that was jonesing for a fix of cleverly written British comedic drama, this show was a godsend. The stories were rich and enthralling, the supporting cast was wonderful, and McShane's characterization was brilliant. An honorable rogue with more than his share of brushes with Murphy's law made him so enchanting... More Rockford than Rockford, more Magnum than Magnum, and a gentleman to boot. My only regret is that i have no idea how to acquire NTSC copies of the show. I can only hope they start showing it again on PBS or BBC America some time.",39 out of 42 found this helpful.,,4 June 2005
3232,Lovejoy, Like a pair of comfortable shoes ...,"Having moved from the UK to Asia approximately 10 years ago, I have found myself collecting quality British TV series on DVD, most of which I had grown up with during my school and college days. These are great to while away an hour or so on a Sunday evening when pangs of homesickness occur. Series like Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses, Men Behaving Badly, Auf Weidersehen Pet and of course ... Lovejoy!<br/><br/>These series bring a smile to the face, a fair number of laughs and that warm fuzzy feeling like putting on a pair of comfortable shoes.<br/><br/>I had almost given up hope that Lovejoy would be released on DVD and while back in the UK on a business trip last week, was overjoyed to find that the first three series were already on the shelves (and had been since Spring 2004). I bought all three!<br/><br/>On first impressions, I wasn't all that enamoured with the image quality, as it comes across as quite grainy. This is a shame and can be a little distracting at times (especially during night scenes). By comparison, I had a totally different experience when I purchased the first series of Cheers on DVD with an amazing remastering job done on the image that just takes your breath away. The sound is also a bit touch-and-go and it can be difficult to hear some of the lines being delivered, particularly if the character is facing away from the camera.<br/><br/>The three-part interview with Ian McShane comes across as a little amateurish, although the effort was appreciated.<br/><br/>The real winner though is the show itself. As the series is set in the English countryside, it is fairly devoid of fashion, technology and modern cars. The result is that there's very little to date it. Only the occasional blast of background music gives the game away. At the end of the first episode, I had a smile on my face and a satisfaction that Lovejoy is back in my life.",38 out of 41 found this helpful.,,5 October 2004

I taped most of the episodes, but at the end, I'm afraid my collection became a little confused.<br/><br/>I admit to not having read the books, but I understand they're much darker than this show that displayed beautiful antiques, fun characters, and glorious countryside. The ensemble work was great. I confess to especially liking the flirtation between Lovejoy and Lady Jane.

I have read some of the novels and Lovejoy is a real bum at times, actually hitting a woman but not brave enough to save a friend from a rifle butt to the head (book only; not in the series). But he does admit that he's a coward!! Great scenery and good scripts. I ration myself to 2 episodes per day. But could anyone ever live like Lovejoy?

3240,Lovejoy," ""Comfortable"" Television","I am so excited that Lovejoy has finally come to DVD. I used to love the show, but hadn't seen an episode since the A&amp;E network stopped running it some years ago. So as I put the first DVD in the player, I was ready for a huge letdown. But to my surprise and delight, the show is just as good as I remember - a good mix of mystery, action, and comedy with some interesting, fun characters and just a dash of history. Lovejoy is old-world British charm meets modern day realities and cynicism. Watching Lovejoy is akin to wearing an old pair of shoes or a favorite sweater - it's comfortable. It's always been the kind of television that works best when I curl up on the couch late at night. And making the show so special and enjoyable is Ian McShane. I've yet to see him in Deadwood, so I am most familiar with McShane in this role. And what a pleasure to watch he is. He makes Lovejoy a carefree, smart, sly, resourceful character not above doing something underhanded especially if it will help out a friend. He's the kind of guy you want on your side. He is ably assisted by a terrific supporting cast that includes Dudley Sutton as Tinker Dill, Chris Jury as Eric Catchpole, and Phyllis Logan as Lady Jane Felsham. Together, they're wonderful.

I lamented the departures of Phyllis Logan and Chris Jury but thought Diane Parish added a lot to the final series (.(I wish she had had a larger role).<br/><br/>Caroline Langrishe was fine but a tad too combative, the character of Lady Felsham was a better fit. Lovejoy and Tinker are marvelous characters.Their characters are fully developed and complement one another. There was a bit of confusion regarding Lovejoy's daughter. At first she was Kate and later became Vicky. I wonder why the change? <br/><br/>I wish they would do one or two specials (even though the characters arequite a bit older).",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,7 February 2007
3245,Lovejoy, Lovejoy,"This highly popular series filmed over 8 years is probably unique in the annals of television history. I think of it as a comedy-crime drama with a pinch of documentary when Lovejoy occasionally turns to camera and makes some personal remark as if talking to an invisible friend. The viewer feels involved and reassured that despite whatever else is happening in the plot, it's all make believe.<br/><br/>Lovejoy, who likes to be called just 'Lovejoy', drop the Mr. - whose ever heard of 'Mr. Rembrandt' or 'Mr. Matisse' - is a Divi, an art expert but as the series develops is evidently an expect in many branches of the antique trade. He spent 4 years in prison which it is assumed he deserved because his business is clearly to make as much money as possible by any method he can, including manufacturing antiques by 'stressing' a modern piece and making it look much older. Despite this he genuinely loves and appreciates the real thing.<br/><br/>He has two colleagues (Major) Tinker Dill who wears outrageous chequered suits and a distinctive black flat cap. 'Tink' also shares Lovejoy's love for real art &amp; antiques and he is highly knowledgeable in both fields and the antique trade in general. Tinker is Lovejoy's 'barker' and in fairground parlance is the equivalent of the man who shouts 'Roll up, roll up, come and see ...' to attract an audience. I suppose he's Lovejoy's advertising agent.<br/><br/>The other workmate is Eric Catchpole who loves motorcycles and works for Lovejoy as a kind of understudy. He is much less of expert than Lovejoy and Tinker and doesn't seem to share their love for antiquity. He does it to get money for women and motorcycles but not necessarily in that order.<br/><br/>The third regular is Lady Jane Felsham who sponsors (provides the money) Lovejoy in many of his money-making schemes. She both admires Lovejoy and loves him but she never forgets he likes to use women for his own ends; a kind of lovable rogue; a 'bit of rough'.<br/><br/>Lovejoy ought to be a millionaire with his talent but what money he 'earns' is soon lost. He seems to be constantly on the point of bankruptcy but Lady Jane is always on hand to bail him out.<br/><br/>Other noteworthy characters are the less-than-honest antique traders, for example, Charlie Gimbert who drives a Rolls Royce and to whom, it is assumed, Lovejoy would like to aspire. Lots of money, a big house, a Roller and a harem of female acquaintances. But Lovejoy isn't the marrying kind. If he ever did, it would probably be for the money.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,21 September 2006
3246,Lovejoy, Just to know that it exists.,"One of my favourite scenes in Lovejoy was in an episode after 'Visigoths' as Tinker would call them had ram raided an antique shop and damaged far more than they had gone to steal. Lovejoy talked about beautiful furniture. He said that he didn't need to own it, or even see it regularly, just to know that it existed was enough for him. I recently read that Ian McShane says that he hasn't a clue about antiques and the statement saddened me somewhat. I have watched all the episodes, most of them more than once but I never tire of seeing them. Although I greatly admire Loveyoy and Lady Jane, the star of the show for me has to be Tinker.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,10 August 2005
3247,Lovejoy, Revisiting Lovejoy,"I watched this as a television series on A&amp;E, remembered it as good, and just purchased the dvds. Well, it is so much better and truly timeless--I've watched it with friends who never saw it on television and they are all instant fans. Lovejoy and his antiques are as refreshing delightful today as they were in the 1990s. His friends are just as lovable (maybe more so!) and wacky as ever. Set in England, the cars and clothes are not out of place or out of style. The stories--every one of them--gives pleasure, not a poorly written line in any, and many many laughs. Perfect multi-generation viewing, nothing is ""R"" rated! And you just might learn a little history along the way!! Seeing Ian McShane as Lovejoy lets you appreciate his acting talents in Deadwood!

3250,Lovejoy," Unrivalled as a one - man - show until ""Mr Selfridge""......","Mr I.McShane in ""Lovejoy"" is the empirical example of the charismatic actor.With anyone else in the role it would be a mildly diverting series about an antique dealer scraping a living in the wilds of East Anglia one step ahead of the sheriff.But by sheer force of personality he drags it up several rungs,the result is a splendid example of mainstream English telly that you can now watch on ""Drama"" with the first series starting yesterday for what I hope will be a long run. One of the few perks of being old is the ability to watch daytime TV without feeling one ought to be doing something more meaningful. And with so many Freeview channels to choose from even this wet and miserable winter has become tolerable. Miss P.Logan,looking ridiculously young and carefree,co - stars as Lady Felsham,Lovejoy's partner in almost everything. Mister C.Jury,now in peaceful retirement in Norfolk,(at least from acting) has his one great TV moment as the prosaically named ""Eric"",McShane's gofer,and a typical man of the Fens so transparently honest and innocent that Lovejoy despairs of him. Mr D.Sutton is excellent as ""Tinker"",a genteel - poor ex army man who rescues Lovejoy from his own machinations. Some series are more consistent than others,new actors are drafted in that don't bring an awful lot to the party,but the first couple of years are a sheer pleasure to watch,and always,Mr McShane strides across the stage like a rather short Prospero,bringing everybody else to life whilst remaining a man apart.

3254,The Greatest American Hero, The TV gods had it in for this show,"The Greatest American Hero was an excellent action-comedy series from the early 1980s that unfortunately seemed to be a victim of bad timing and fate.<br/><br/>I'd say about 70-80% of the story lines were good to excellent, and even the mediocre or few bad episodes were carried by the strength of the charming lead actors. William Katt played a high school teacher named Ralph Hinkley who was given red power suit by peaceful aliens only to be teamed up with a neurotic FBI agent named Bill Maxwell played by Robert Culp. Connie Sellecca offered the human touch as Ralph's girlfriend Pam Davidson. Katt's character lost the instruction book to the power suit in the pilot episode, leading to a very original and hilarious version of the ever familiar superhero story. But right from the start this series was plagued with problems such as a silly lawsuit from DC comics, who asserted that Stephen J. Cannell stole their Superman character. Cannell won the landmark case, but many potential merchandising companies were scared off by DC and Warner Bros. studios who still held a grudge against GAH. Then mere weeks into the show's 1981 debut, President Ronald Reagan was shot by a would be killer named John Hinckley...it just so happened that the main character's name on GAH was Ralph Hinkley. The ABC network even went so far as to dub over ""Hinkley"" with ""Hanley"" in a couple of early episodes. Speaking of ABC, they were probably Cannell/GAH's worst enemies. The network gave the show late starts in all 3 seasons, while other shows began their season rightfully in September, GAH would be forced to debut as late as October or November. ABC also consistently pre-empted GAH with other events (like major league baseball) during the 2nd season. <br/><br/>ABC then put GAH in a hole that could never be dug out of, the network drilled into the publics mind that GAH was nothing but a campy children's series that wasn't worth bothering with. The network nearly always promoted the series with shots of series star William Katt being silly and crashing into walls. GAH did have moments of camp and silliness, but it was written on an adult level and played straight so it was by no means an Adam West type camp series. There was more to this series then Ralph simply being an inept Superman. Sometimes ABC wasn't even close in it's promo ads to the plot of an episode, billing it all as Saturday morning kiddie fare. The series never recovered from this type of grossly unfair advertisement. It seemed like a lot of people just never understood the concept behind GAH, and no matter how many times you valiantly explained the premise of this show to people, it simply didn't matter. The damage was done. This was seen as simply an idiot children's series by way too many folks out there. Unfortunately that was the nail in the coffin. No TV show was going to survive being up against such odds. After 3 very short seasons and 44 episodes, The Greatest American Hero was cancelled by ABC in the spring of 1983...only to be replaced with two flimsy sitcoms that received even lower ratings and ultimately bombed. GAH has earned a ""cult classic TV"" status over the years, which is quite an accomplishment for a show that has barely been rerun in the continental United States since the 80s. Yet GAH could have been even more then that had the playing field been not so ridiculously lopsided against the show. There's a much anticipated DVD release coming around the corner, hopefully it will finally give this series justice and the fair handshake it never got.",128 out of 134 found this helpful.,,9 September 2004
3255,The Greatest American Hero, heartwarming,"I can still recall, quite fondly, watching the pilot episode of The Greatest American Hero. It can be corny and silly at times... but it was also humorous, warm, and uplifting. A group of people suddenly thrown into a situation where they have to ""save the world"". And working together (more or less :)  )   they do it. From saving little kids, freezing in the wilderness to ""baggin' bad guys"" on the streets of L.A. My life is pretty dull and uneventful... oh but what I wouldn't do if suddenly &gt;I&lt; had a super suit. And while I'm old and getting gray now... I still dream, every now and again, of flying around in the sky... (and over the years I've gotten better at landing on my feet). Ralph wasn't the best... but he always gave it the old team try. You gotta love him for that!",57 out of 60 found this helpful.,,10 April 2004
3256,The Greatest American Hero, One of the Greatest American TV Shows,"If you aren't familiar with ""The Greatest American Hero"" you owe it to yourself to get the DVDs... you won't be disappointed. I used to watch the show as a kid and I loved it... they used to play it on Saturday mornings after the cartoons had ended and I never missed an episode. Flash forward twenty years and I'm amazed at not only how well the show has held up but at all I missed the first time around.<br/><br/>Ordinary schoolteacher Ralph Hinkley is given a supersuit by space aliens... when wearing the suit he has all the powers of a superhero. The trouble is he lost the suit's instruction book in episode one and has to figure out how it works as he goes along. He's partnered with crusty, by-the-book FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Culp) and gets lots of help from his gorgeous girlfriend Pam (Connie Selleca). If you think this is a broad, goofy comedy or kid's show you couldn't be farther off... if you think it's kitschy nostalgia you'd be wrong as well. The Greatest American Hero is nothing short of one of the greatest TV shows of all time.<br/><br/>The concept of the everyman becoming superman allowed the show's creators and writers to examine different aspects of human nature... there's so much going on in every episode that getting the bad guy is almost secondary. In one of the best episodes ""My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys,"" Ralph is forced to examine what it means to be a hero while Bill wrestles with having to arrest his OWN hero, a veteran police officer who has turned to a life of crime. The show was unbelievably human, and the three leads are a perfect triangle... Robert Culp grounds the show by not pulling any punches as the skeptical, impatient fed; his disbelief at the premise only serves to make the premise more real.<br/><br/>William Katt as Ralph is excellent, completely believable as a man trying to balance his roles as boyfriend, father, teacher and superhero. Connie Selleca is not just beautiful... she's a confident, funny actor, putting more into Pam than was on the page. This show is also wonderful as a time-capsule piece, a reminder of when TV could appeal to everyone and still be intelligent, dramatic, and FUN. (Today so many dramas open every episode with a corpse it's all but become the rule.) ""GAH"" is also one of the BIGGEST TV shows ever made... by that I mean its visual look and style of direction is grand, cinematic. If you get the DVD's you'll see that every episode is a mini-movie. You'll also see that it's one of the best transfers EVER done. The show, twenty years later, is more bright, clean and vivid than anything on TV today. And you also get the memorable theme song, which still gives old-time fans like myself instant nostalgia whenever we hear it.<br/><br/>In conclusion I highly recommend ""The Greatest American Hero"" to everyone... you will love it, your kids will love it, and it will stimulate your imagination, make you laugh and make you think. What more could you ask for?<br/><br/>GRADE: A+",61 out of 65 found this helpful.,,19 April 2005
3257,The Greatest American Hero, So much potential wastedwith one of the greatest American theme songs EVER,"`The Greatest American Hero' is a textbook case of a television show being a victim of `the powers that be.' I was in grade school during the time of its run, but I remember most of the behind the scenes drama. Though its initial debut was well received, it wasn't long before the show met an ill-fated course. First, it was an unfortunate victim of the 1981 Reagan assassination attempt, resulting in the horrific `Hinkley/Hanley' overdub. This event, followed by constant time changes, late season debuts, pre-empts, and the never-ending lawsuit with Warner Brothers and DC comics over its supposed `Superman-like' premise, kept it from reaching its full potential with viewers. Then, like those aliens in the desert, the show disappeared without a trace.<br/><br/>There are several theories as to why this show never reached its full potential. I personally think Warner Brothers and DC Comics made ABC executives nervous, hence the delays and time changes. While I can certainly understand their motives (the Superman movies were popular at the time) I considered each character to be a separate entity. I never thought William Katt was an exact clone of Christopher (or George, for that matter) Reeve's famous role. Superman (I thought) was a strong, supernatural hero from another planet who masqueraded as a human being. The Greatest American Hero was just an ordinary guy who stumbled upon good fortune and tried to utilize it in the best way he could to help mankind. It could have been anyone that night instead of Ralph Hinkley, for all we know (the lyrics of the theme song attempted to explain this). Katt simply provided a handsome, lovable example of the `imperfect hero.'<br/><br/>My mother and sister absolutely loved this show. I was the youngest, so I watched it mostly because they did! `The Greatest American Hero' did grow on me, thoughso I, too, have fond memories. I was in love with the theme song, however, from the debut! Even if you didn't like the show, you have to admit that the theme song, `Believe It Or Not,' sung by Joey Scarbury, is one of the greatest of all time. The earlier comments were correct. `Believe It Or Not' is awesome.<br/><br/>Absolutely awesome!",55 out of 61 found this helpful.,,7 February 2002
3258,The Greatest American Hero," The ""Katt"" was Cool!","I'll keep the review simple,10 stars! Loved it! Have nothing bad to say about this show! (Heck,I still have the 45rpm record of the theme song with the original picture sleeve and Joey Scarbury's album!)<br/><br/>I wasn't too crazy about the fact (at the time) that I had to watch the debut at a local hospital(visiting my grandmother ). I was still 12 when the show debuted and had looked forward to it's premiere and I certainly wasn't disappointed! <br/><br/>William Katt,a dramatic actor who got no respect from critics in the forgotten yet wonderful 1978 dramatic/surfing film ""Big Wednesday"",didn't get much more respect here but..to all of us who watched this show,he was cool and the ""greatest"". I'm sure he was just glad to be working...and with ""I Spy"" vet Robet Culp yet! Not to mention Connie Selleca. (Ralph must've used some smooth line to land her!)<br/><br/>Even though the ""green screen"" effects are obvious,it doesn't take away from the action one bit. I'll never forget watching Ralph stop a nuclear missile from being launched by simply holding it down with his hands! Pretty darn great effect for that time,not to mention just for TV! It makes me glad to see this come out on DVD,despite the fact there's no conclusion to the series.<br/><br/>I agree,it was unfair to call this kiddie-TV. This is a kind of satirical look at what would really happen if someone on earth got to be a hero. Wheather they asked to be or not. Not surprisingly,choose an earthling....lose the instruction manual! Get the DVD,you wont be sorry (unless you have no sense of humor.)",31 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,22 July 2005
3259,The Greatest American Hero, Warmth and 80's magic...,"The Greatest American Hero was one of the best concepts for a TV show that I have ever seen, and certainly the most unique take on the superhero genre. The show had charm, lighthearted fun, and was full of 80's magic. I can still remember watching this show back in the early 80's and when Ralph first tried to fly that red suit. He couldn't get it, and some little kid that saw him struggling gave him some advice. Now see, that's the kind of magic that TV shows in the 80's had. TV wasn't afraid of putting out a hero that got advice on how to fly from a goofy little kid. Ralph Hinkley (played by William Katt) was just a regular guy, a young high school teacher that wanted to make a difference. Then one night he is approached by aliens out in the desert, teamed up with a gung-ho FBI agent, and given a spectacular red suit styled in the classic superhero design of cape and longjohns. <br/><br/>Unfortunately poor Ralph promptly loses the instruction book to the suit, and must learn the suit powers through trial and error. Connie Sellecca played Hinkley's girlfriend Pam, I seem to recall later in the show they were married. I also remember that Ralph got another instruction book, only to lose it again. And if I remember correctly, this show was only on for a brief 2 years and had 3 seasons. I don't know why the network prematurely cancelled this series, the show sadly never got to live up to it's full potential. I think it only clocked in around 44 or 45 episodes because the network pulled the plug on it so soon. The low episode number is probably why we don't get the luxury of seeing TGAH on Sci-Fi channel, WGN, TBS, or TV Land. Even with only 2 years of episodes, this series is still fondly remembered by many as a part of 80's magic.",23 out of 25 found this helpful.,,25 May 2004
3260,The Greatest American Hero, Smart and Entertaining...,"I remember The Greatest American Hero, I adored this hilarious series about ordinary guy Ralph Hinkley getting a magical supersuit from aliens (little green-guys) back in the 80's. Conceived by the legendary TV giant Stephen J. Cannell, this is the kind of show that when you think back on it gives you all kinds of warm and fuzzy feelings inside. It just makes you feel good and reminds you how wildly imaginative and cool television was in the 80's. I'm glad to see I'm not alone in remembering this show that was cut down way too early. 2 years on the air just wasn't enough. The Greatest American Hero was made in the early 80's, when the trials and tribulations of the 1970's were still somewhat fresh on peoples minds. After the Vietnam War, high gas prices, Nixon-Watergate, and two more lousy presidents, the very idea that a man in underwear and flaky cape could run around saving the world like Superman or Batman was seen as a complete joke. This was an original and great idea to explore. One word to describe the way the series approached this idea would be ""smart"", like Star Trek this show seemed to have a definitive intelligent and creative force behind it. It was more of a human drama/comedy then a straight up conventional superhero show. What would happen to a regular person if they were given a magical superhero outfit? What would happen if they lost the instruction manual and didn't know how to use the goofy looking costume? The way people treated Ralph (they thought he was a nut) when they saw him in his super suit is probably the way people would react in real life if they came across a man dressed as a superhero. This series never seemed to get its just dues back in the early 80's, OK so The Greatest American Hero wasn't Mozart or The Great Gatsby. It was middle brow entertainment like many other crime and adventure shows, but it was very well made middle brow entertainment. It was smart and the witty dialogue in this show rivals any of the ""more adult"" TV shows from it's time. I do remember getting grief from my older siblings and cousins who never got the joke of The Greatest American Hero for liking it, they would purposefully sing the theme song 'Believe it or Not' off key to annoy me, ""Look at what's happened to me..."". I so wanted to hit my older sister when she did that. Ralph wasn't a wimp he was an ordinary man put into extraordinary situations, so he reacted like a regular guy would. Hence his screaming like a banshee would he couldn't control the suit in mid air. Others here have pointed out the many problems The Greatest American Hero had to put up with during it's brief 2 years on the air, one I would like to mention was it was constantly yanked around on its schedule. It may be cliché to repeatedly call ABC or any other network 'villains' when talking about how they shafted a particular TV series, but in this case it really is true. In the beginning the series was perfectly aired on Wednesday nights, but then for whatever reason the network moved it to Thursday nights, and then finally it was shifted to the death slot of Friday nights were it was beat up in the ratings by the real kids shows like The Dukes of Hazzard and Knight Rider. The Greatest American Hero was written with children in mind but was not soley targeted at kids. Without a teenage to adult audience to sustain it, the series died a quiet death at the hands of ABC. I hope that one day we see a return of The Greatest American Hero.",24 out of 27 found this helpful.,,12 September 2004
3261,The Greatest American Hero, Excellent spoof of the superhero genre.,"I remember 1981 well. My children were growing up, the youngest was 5 and the oldest was 12. One of the TV shows we always tried to see each week was ""The Greatest American Hero."" This was a time in American TV when shows were still ""light"" and the emphasis was on entertainment. TV shows focusing on crime or politics or ""reality"" were not even a twinkle yet in the producers' eyes. This show, ""American Hero"", was a spoof, or parody, of the superhero genre. What made the main character so endearing were his flaws. He was a mild-mannered school teacher. He was not strong looking, and his only ""power"" came to him when he put on his special suit which allowed him to fly like Superman. And, since he had not grown up with flying, and had no special training, his landings were always awkward, often tumbling into the shrubs or garbage cans to stop his momentum. But he had a good heart, he took his ""mission"" seriously, all which made this a delightful and entertaining show.<br/><br/>William Katt played the unlikely hero, Ralph Hinkley/Ralph Hanley (name change related to a real life Hinkley in the news). Co-stars were Robert Culp as Bill Maxwell and pretty Connie Sellecca as Pam Davidson/Pam Hinkley. Katt is somewhat of an enigma, he has made perhaps 40 to 50 movies since this series, and I don't recognize any of them. It is as if he purposely avoided being in any popular movie. That's a shame, because he was a very watchable actor.<br/><br/>The DVD of the first season is set to be released in February 2005, and Amazon has it at a very attractive price.

The funny part comes when Ralph loses the instruction book on how to use the suit, he keeps getting in trouble, because he does not use the power too well.

Together they and their friends attempt to solve crimes, protect the USA and perform otherwise good deeds. I loved the Sci-Fi angle as a child and now that I am a grown up Special Education teacher in a public high school I can definitely relate to the story premise. Sometimes I wonder when the alien spaceship is going to descend on me with my own suit. This show is marvelous fun for all ages and there is no blood gushing gore or otherwise raunchy lovemaking so prevalent in TV shows today. The theme song for the Greatest American Hero actually hit the Pop Top 40 chart in 1981 and always makes me smile when I hear it. I highly recommend this show and hope all who reads this enjoys it.

3264,The Greatest American Hero, A feel good TV series from the early 1980's,"This show did a great deal of changing over it's three year run. Starting as a spring replacement show, it starred relative newcomer William Katz as the tragically named Ralph Hinckley (I'll get to the tragedy in a minute), a high school teacher with lots of troubled kids in his class. Hinckley is in the middle of a custody suit with his exwife, and is falling in love with his lawyer, Pam Davidson (Connie Sellecca).<br/><br/>Things are looking OK for Hinckley until one night, in the California desert, he encounters aliens who give him a suit that endows upon him superpowers when he wears it. Then he loses the instruction manual. Nothing can throw a monkey wrench into your divorce/custody/employment plans like running around in what looks like red footie pajamas with a cape claiming you are saving the day. Ralph is instructed by the aliens to work with FBI agent Bill Maxwell (Robert Kulp), and this part is easy because Maxwell is there when the aliens give them the suit in the person of his recently deceased partner, who is going with the aliens but gives Bill the ""live long and prosper"" hand movement through the car glass window a full year before ""The Wrath of Khan"". Hmmmmmmm.<br/><br/>Thus Bill and Ralph form this sort of good cop/bad cop duo, except Ralph is no cop. Bill is the formal law and order type. Ralph is the give peace a chance type. For all of his super powers, Ralph didn't seem to notice that his son, who brought him and Pam together in the first place, disappears after four episodes, never to be mentioned again. Maybe this invisibility was inherited from the ex-wife, because we never see or hear about her again either.<br/><br/>The tragic naming of our protagonist that I mentioned? Well 12 days after this show debuted President Reagan was shot by John Hinckley. In a typical case of overreacting, the show had Ralph renamed ""Hanley"" or ""Mr. H"" for the rest of the first season, as though just being named Hinckley somehow made you an untouchable. Then, he magically went back to Ralph ""Hinckley"" at the beginning of the second season.<br/><br/>As for the ""bad kids"" in Ralph's class, among them there was Michael Pare in his first role, and apparently a role that got him noticed because he was making movies at a pretty frenetic pace for the rest of the 1980's, though he stuck with the show for the rest of its run. There was also Faye Grant as Rhonda, who is supposed to be a troublemaking rather loose girl.

3265,The Greatest American Hero, Season Three,"After a short first season, and a full length second season, GAH's problems stemming from a lawsuit with DC comics finally brought enough pressure to convince ABC execs to pull the plug.<br/><br/>The Greatest American Hero is one of, if not, the most underrated shows of the 1980's. Slapstick, family friendly humor, and a nod to the comic book crowd.<br/><br/>The third and final season DVD collection includes four episodes that were never aired on ABC (the show went to syndication in the early 90's, and FX did in fact air the four episodes) with guest appearances ranging from Andre the Giant, to Bob Saget, and a strong natural chemistry with William Katt, and Connie Selleca, as well as Robert Culp, who once played Kelly Robinson in the series I Spy.<br/><br/>GAH is highly recommended, not only for adults who grew up with the series, but also their children, it's a refreshing look back at the more wholesome family entertainment that dominated the 1980's culture.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,,27 July 2005
3266,The Greatest American Hero, Greatest American TV Series--Coming to the Big Screen?,"One of the most under-rated TV shows of all time. I keep hearing rumors about a new movie version. It seems to be in the early days of planning. The old series is now out on DVD (thank ya Lord...). Been waiting' for that for a long time...<br/><br/>Here is my take on who would be great in the new movie version:<br/><br/>Ralp: Steve Zahn. Bill: Billy Bob Thorton. Pam: Jennifer Conelly.<br/><br/>The series only ran from 81-83 and I guess there was a great deal of tension between Cannell and ABC over the creative direction.

3267,The Greatest American Hero, Very Underated,"This show took a comic book idea and made it real. For every guy who wanted to hide behind a costume and save the world, this series showed the pros and cons of superheroics and dual identities even if it had to use a UFO to do it. William Katt was basicly your All-American good guy with a gorgeous girlfriend played by Connie Selleca. Robert Culp was the gungho F.B.I. Agent, a role he played to the hilt. Supported by Faye Grant and Michael Pare, this show lasted a brief but memorable two years before we lost it. Even an attempt was made to pass the premise to a lovely young actress, but by then, the original appeal of the show had faded away.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,21 April 2001
3268,The Greatest American Hero, Got Better Over Time,"This was a pretty good show, especially when it got to its second season. This was a decent send up of all the super-hero shows such as Wonder Woman, The Six Million Dollar Man and the Superman movies.  The only thing that I didn't like about it was that during the first season it tried too hard to be a send up of those shows especially due to the fact that Ralph lost the instruction book and had to wing it.  However, by the second season it begun to hit its stride.  Ralph could even fly better, although he still had trouble with the landings.  Also, the chemistry between William Katt, Robert Culp and Connie Sellecca was what helped to make this a cult classic.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,,18 July 2003

Here is a man of conscience chosen by Higher Powers to right wrong who struggles to be a decent father, lover, friend, and inspire kids by his ""ordinary"" example.<br/><br/>My favorite episode is ""Lilacs, Mr. Maxwell"", where Emmy-winning writer Robert Culp reveals in the Season 2 finale the depths and intelligence of the Bill Maxwell character.<br/><br/>Cannell wrote the pilot in an atmosphere of the Iran US Embassy hostage situation and a cultural dearth of idealism.

This show is kind of a cross between Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Welcome Back, Kotter without the monsters of the former and the quipish nature of both. This is a show with a great central idea: What would an average person do with a silly suit that gives them super powers? The show was a hit, but died due to the network not buying into the concept. As the show goes on, the body count rises and the innocent feel of the first season is left behind. Also, The writers clearly ran out of ideas for the kids to be involved, making every other episode a field trip. William Katt(goofy), Robert Culp(Grumpy), and Connie Sellecca(Sexy) make an amusing trio when given the chance to work together.

He is divorced, going through a bitter custody battle for his young son Kevin. But these things are gonna seem minor. When he is lured out in the desert, then suddenly disgruntled F.B.I. Bill Maxwell drives up to him, and can not remember how he got there. Then the two see a flying saucer, and both become scared. But the aliens tell Ralph and Bill they must work together to make the world a better place. They also give Ralph a suit to wear, that possess amazing superpowers when Ralph wears it. But when Ralph unwittingly losses the instructions, he is left to figure out to work the suit. His Legal Eagle girlfriend Pam Davidson comes along for the ride.<br/><br/>William Katt is very funny as Ralph, an ordinary everyday kinda guy who is drawn in an Unordinary situations, at times he had a Peter Parker like complex, Ralph didn't really want to be a superhero, but then realized that with great power, came great responsibility.<br/><br/>Robert Culp and Connie Sellica were also great has Bill Maxwell and Pam Davidson.<br/><br/>I'm amazed on how the effects were so great, they didn't look cheap one bit.

3272,The Greatest American Hero, Great show. Every episode was a winner. Culp &amp; Katt perfect pair.,"This was one of my favorites. It had everything, drama, comedy, adventure and suspense. <br/><br/>A space ship landed on earth and left a suit with special ""super powers"" for William Katt. Robert Culp, the ""know it all secret agent"", is sent by the government to control this great new weapon. With secrecy of the utmost importance, Culp couldn't even brag to his fellow agents about his fabulous assignment. Part of his job was to keep the suit out of the hands of foreign powers. Because of his ""superior"" training, he felt he should be allowed to use the suit himself. He constantly projected ""senerios"" on how it should work and how William Katt should use it. This was high-lighted, in one episode, with Culp trying to use the suit when Katt couldn't. He then learned that the suit was a one man suit. <br/><br/>Katt was secretly proud of the job he did but his lack of confidence and fear of heights and flying caused problems. Though he was super, when wearing the suit, he couldn't keep from ducking bullets. If he lost his confidence while flying, he'd fall from the sky and crash into buildings. <br/><br/>Connie Sellecca acted as referee when the two went at each others throats during disagreements. <br/><br/>It's a great treat in my book. These are great actors with a great story line. Don't miss it.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,,16 January 2005

He was the co-star of The Greatest American Hero, and every couple of minutes his punchline is to tell William Katt that he lost the instructions to the magic superhero suit he wears. I have tried to like this show for 40 years. Everyone thinks it is so funny. I have never been able to watch more than five minutes of any episode.<br/><br/>William Katt flying into walls, while his creepy uncle character Robert Culp fights with him over who is in charge. William Katt does a good job in his limited role as a goofball who found a magic costume. There is not much in terms of the stories, plot, or anything else. Greatest American Zero reminds me of The Monkees, if there were only one Monkee. Robert Culp reminds me of Lurch from the Addams Family TV series.

3276,The Greatest American Hero, I really Like this show,"Since I was too young to remember this show when it originally aired all I had seen of it before the DVDs came out was the pilot episode my dad had purchased over the years on a VHS tape. One thing I can say is since the DVDs have came out and I have watched the first two seasons I do believe that those people of DC comics and Warner Brothers had some screws loose in their heads trying to accuse Stephen Cannell of copyright infringement on superman. The main thing that shows the difference between the two is Superman is an allien who looks like a human from another planet. This show has a normal High School teacher who is approached by an alien spaceship and is given a special suit with unearthly powers. Plus with the good it shows in the episodes of where the stop some crooks and how on one of the first season episodes it shows Ralph Hinkley using the suit to clear the name of one of his students. Then on the second season it shows how he has to deal with how some men are trying to hold Bill and his students hostage over a gold mine.<br/><br/>One thing myself I think it was dishonest of ABC to put it on at a time when people could not watch it. Compared to the garbage that ABC is airing on TV now in my area I think I would much rather see reruns of this show on instead of those stupid reality shows or all those courtroom shows that air between 7 P.M. and 10 P.M. eastern time. I would much rather have some of today's teenagers watching Ralph crashing while trying to fly around as to have them watching these bad shows that have some people only wearing minimum coverage clothing while trying to win money. It is bad shows like those reality shows like that survivor, fear factor and that big brother that are causing some of today's children to grow up being so disobident because of how they see grown ups acting so foolish with each other just over some money. When I grew up we had from 7 P.M. to 10 P.M. eastern time some good shows like this one and other good shows like Bill Cosby, Family Matters, Full House, and other action comedy shows like the original Dukes of Hazzard, Airwolf, and The A Team on instead of the garbage they are passing along as TV shows now. I say this show deserves to reair on TV so that people who can not afford the costs of the DVD players and Disk sets can watch the show again. Also this can prove that the younger generations might like this show better because i have noticed that children who are under 10 years old are liking shows their Grandparents grew up with in the 1950's better than the shows that are on TV now.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,14 July 2006
3277,The Greatest American Hero, Early 1980's Comedy With A Crash,"William Katt proved in this series he could act. His adventures with the suits are a group of mishaps &amp; plot twists without equal in super hero history. This show is definitely a time piece that is not for the younger kiddies now.<br/><br/>Robert Culp is amazing as Bill Maxwell. We know from his days opposite Bill Cosby in I Spy that he could do comedy, but his character here is an even funnier off-shoot of his FBI agent routine. He is always looking for help from those green guys.<br/><br/>Connie Selleca, even though she was pregnant during this shows filming, was eye candy &amp; easy to fall for. She always seemed to help set the mood for the shows she had a major role in. <br/><br/>The kids in the cast were just that, the kids. William Katts mom, Barbara Hale does a couple of guest shots along with June Lockhart. Some other notables guest starred too. <br/><br/>The best episode is called You Don't Mess Around With Jim. The plot is not only well thought out, a sort of Howard Hughes clone who dies under mysterious circumstances, but the show has a couple of great special effects stunts that make you wonder, how did they do that? This is by far the best episode. Sometimes, the writing on this show lacked sound logic.

All that's fine and dandy, I just wish we could leave out all the ""and if you like this awful show, you're a total moron!"" criticisms of each other.

It's difficult to even describe the series to someone who hasn't watched it in a way that even remotely encompasses what it's about. But the ultimate effect of all this? A sort of narrative alchemy that leaves me wanting more, even as I admit that I'm not entirely sure what it is that I've been watching.<br/><br/>The story of four people brought together by something that's larger than themselves. Granted, we don't know what, precisely, that thing is just yet.<br/><br/>All around, Dispatches from Elsewhere is brilliantly cast. Jason Segel is perfect for the character of Peter, who has been plugging through the doldrums of life and ""work stuff."" Eve Lindley's Simone gives us an entry point more laden with anxiety. There's Fred Wynn (Andre Benjamin), an awkward genius with an eye for clues and patterns, but no understanding of people or social interactions. There's Janice (Sally Field), a cheery retiree struggling to process her own problems .<br/><br/>It's a whole lot of fun to enter into this world.

""The Office"" struck a particular chord with me because I have spent most of my adult life in sales and they nailed the highs and lows of that career brilliantly.<br/><br/>Moving on then to their new offering; ""Extras"", I am happy to report that the observational skills have not deserted them. This time the central character (Andy Millman) is again played by Ricky Gervais, only, unlike his David Brent character, Millman is astute, caring and worth the time of day. Unforutnately, like Brent, he is also trapped in a spiral of underachievement.<br/><br/>Andy Millman is an film extra, a background artiste, who aspires to a real acting role and the central theme of each episode is his quest for a ""line"" in each film in which he appears in the background. Along side him is his (seemingly) only friend, a frustrated thirty something woman, Maggie Jacobs (superbly played by Ashley Jensen), whose sole aim seems to be to find a husband / longterm partner. Add into this mix a chronically crap agent (Merchant himself), a nemesis in the shape of another extra who seems to be getting lines and a liberal sprinkling of cameoing ""A"" list guest stars and you have a wonderful platform on which to build a spankingly funny series.<br/><br/>And wow... do they hit a home run! Every second of each episode is deliciously funny and acutely observed. Highlights to look out for are the Ben Stiller/Dodgeball opening weekend grosses scene - the Golly scene in Maggie's apartment - the ""Are you really a Catholic scene"" and, above anything you will have ever seen in a TV comedy, the entire Les Dennis episode.<br/><br/>Les Dennis will be lost on Americans but for those of us who have followed his plunging career, you can only weep for this superbly written and judged performance. Pathos doesn't even begin to cover it.<br/><br/>Also, anyone who can look at Kate Winslet again without thinking of that ""phone sex"" scene is a better man than me.<br/><br/>Please, please, watch ""Extras"". It may, for some, be an acquired taste but once you have that taste, its like a piece of Swiss chocolate - exquisite.<br/><br/>And no laugh track either - yay England.",122 out of 135 found this helpful.,9.0,28 August 2005
3304,Extras, First episode is highly promising,"Gervais had a big task on his hands with this project- The Office has now entered into comedy history, and people had very high hopes for his follow-up. The documentary style has been ditched, and Gervais has given his character just a little more dignity than he gave David Brent, so the comedy is a little less squeamish. The changes in direction and style are daring and pay off- the show doesn't feel like a desperate follow up or imitation of The Office. In fact, it's highly original.<br/><br/>It's a pitch black satire, which follows the efforts of Gervais's character as he attempts to progress from being an extra to actually getting a real acting job, or at least a line. The shows also charts his female friend's unsuccessful love-life, his deadpan agent and parodies a celebrity every week. This week it was the turn of Ben Stiller, who was mocked as an evil dictator of a man, who constantly reminds those around him of the box office of his movies and insists that kissing Cameron Diaz ""still counts"", even though it was for a movie. Stiller is a good sport for joining in, and has fun messing with his image.<br/><br/>Overall the show is gently paced, well written and shows extremely high potential for character study. Definitely one to watch.<br/><br/>STILLER: DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM!? GERVAIS: Starsky or Hutch- I can never remember. STILLER: Was that supposed to be funny?

3305,Extras, Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant do it again,"""Extras"" is another comedic highlight from the men who thought up ""The Office"". One might think that the success of their previous show put too much pressure on them to come up with a new project as brilliant and hilarious, but they pulled it off. ""Extras"" is every bit as funny ""The Office"". The humour is actually very similar with people talking themselves into uncomfortable situations all the time. I think that it's the new setting that turned off a lot of people who have written negative reviews. ""The Office"" gave us regular guys and something to identify with. A dead end job in a dead end town, gray routine and idiotic colleagues. To laugh about this all too realistic situation had a curative effect on audiences all around the world. With ""Extras"" it's different. I'm sure that this show is close to reality, too, but only the fewest people have ever worked as extras and can put themselves into the shoes of struggling actors Andy Millman and Maggie Jacobs. If you just accept that this show isn't ""The Office"" anymore and that there's no Gareth, Tim or Dawn, you'll find out that ""Extras"" has a lot to offer, too.<br/><br/>Every episode starts with a dramatic scene in Hollywood-style that's dismantled after a moment with someone yelling ""cut"" or Andy Millman's face popping up in the picture. Each episode also has a different guest star. With the success of ""The Office"" Gervais and Merchant (who plays a regular part in this series as well) managed to gather some big names for this project. Ben Stiller, Kate Winslet and Patrick Stewart all make very amusing cameos, but it's the British local heroes who really steal the show.<br/><br/>With only 6 episodes (so far) the first season ended way too quickly and I already long for the second series. This show still has lots of different ways to go. Hopefully Gervais and Merchant will explore the private lives of Maggie and Andy more as they did with the characters of ""The Office"" in the second series. Right now it seems as if everything those two brilliant guys touch turns to gold and I hope this streak of luck continues for a while.",29 out of 34 found this helpful.,8.0,18 March 2006
3306,Extras, Comical drama,"I think the genre of the movie is not clear to all... This is FAR from your normal comedy. It's borderline dramatic. You'll get to gigel and even laugh yourself to tears but the genius of the show doesn't lie here. It's the awkward moments and the depressing ones that make this show like no other. <br/><br/>I find myself sometimes wishing that Andy would find a new best friend, a new agent or at least a small break but the awkward comedy that follows always leaves me wanting for more, wanting to see how much he can take before he breaks. <br/><br/>The sadness that sometimes appears in Andy's eyes reminds us of all the unfortunes we had to go through in our lives. But he stands strong and so do we, just waiting to ""have a laugh"". <br/><br/>The ending fits perfectly with the theme of the show. ""Tea for the Tillerman"" offers a strangely thin comfort until the next time it will play, maybe under somewhat better circumstances (witch never really happens). I really think there is no better show to watch after a hard day at work. It always leaves you satisfied. So chin up Andy and do the magic that you do and maybe one day it will all be worth it!",31 out of 38 found this helpful.,10.0,6 August 2008
3307,Extras, A testament to one of the world's most brilliant comic minds,"What is it about irony that tickles us so? In some ways it reminds me of films that I find delightful in their atrocity: ""Doom"", ""DOA"", ""Snakes on a Plane"" are some recent prime examples of Goodness By Antithesis; films that are so brazenly and proudly bad that you have to like them. Irony, as we like to see it, is similar in that it is Humor By Antithesis: situations and events that are so mundanely tragic, so cringe-making and excruciating that we just have to laugh. It is a bizarre logic, it's a twisted logic, but it's also worth noting that it's a line so fine that only the cleverest and subtlest of writers can really make it work. America's Larry David is one. England's Ricky Gervais is the other.<br/><br/>In creating a follow-up series to ""The Office"", Gervais risked destroying a damn-near flawless career. It's hard to imagine there wasn't a niggling in his ear telling him to quit while he was ahead. What would really be the harm in letting the world remember him as David Brent? Apart from the nature of the character, the real harm in this would have been that to deny us Andy Millman would be to deny himself status as one of the world's most brilliant comic minds. ""Extras"" doesn't just further establish Gervais' incredible comedy prowess, it deepens it.<br/><br/>On the surface, the series patiently shows us the mundane and rather fruitless life of a working film Extra, Millman (Gervais), who fancies himself a ""real actor"" but has never gotten any real acting work. He bitches about this to his friend, confidant and fellow Extra Maggie (Ashley Jensen), who also shares her problems with him. Deep down, however, ""Extras"" is a deliciously satirical look at the ambitions of the human heart, the ironic overthrow of those ambitions and the emotional chaos of breaking the unspoken rules of society (such as 'Don't Lie To A Catholic Priest About Your Nonexistent Catholicism', and 'Don't Tell Your Best Friend's Colleague That Your Best Friend Said He Was ""Too Gay""').<br/><br/>Other reviews have called ""Extras"" a watered down ""Office"", and I think this is a fair observation, but not at all a bad thing. After all, despite sequential order ""Seinfeld"" is much more diluted than ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"", but the former is still a far superior show. Not that any inferiority between Gervais' shows is being inferred, of course. Where ""Extras"" is softer than ""The Office"" is not in humor, or intelligence, merely in character. Andy is really quite a nice guy; insensitive at times, but only in a mild, charming kind of way. Your pity for him is genuine, and not the result of a deeper emotion such as bewilderment or frustration.<br/><br/>The David Brents of ""Extras"" are not Gervais at all but the transient side characters, and often (brilliantly, fantastically) the celebrity cameos. In short, and this is said with no inflation whatsoever, Celebrity Cameos as a film/television device has its worth made and sold in ""Extras"". We thought we'd seen self-parody work before. We were wrong. The sheer reckless abandon with which Gervais and the gallant celebrity meat send themselves up (and up and up) practically creates fireworks. Ben Stiller, Kate Winslet and Patrick Stewart are not only the draw cards but the dazzling high lights. They are forever heroes in my eyes.<br/><br/>Maybe it's this ultimate irony that galvanizes ""Extras""' brilliance: the celebrity personalities who live the life Andy dreams of reveal themselves exclusively to him as being petty, irresponsible, greedy, insensitive, sexually perverted megalomaniacs, while he, the nobody Extra, cops all sorts of cosmic flack for, mostly, trying to do the right thing. Naturally, this kind of thing borders on cruel, but just before we begin to feel bad for laughing at his hopeless misfortune he lets us know it's alright by cracking a smile himself, telling a joke to Maggie and shaking it off. Then Cat Stevens washes us clean with ""Tea for the Tillerman"". Yes sir, Ricky Gervais knows how to make it work.",28 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,22 September 2006
3308,Extras, Sometimes laugh-out-loud funny,"I notice that the DVD of the first series is not available on Amazon, but it is here in Hong Kong and being an avid fan of the office and Ricky Gervais live, I bought it straight away.<br/><br/>I must say, I'm not disappointed. It took a while to forget Gervais' Office character, David Brent, but when you do, look at him as ""Andy"" in this series and note that he's got a little more worldly wisdom than Brent, at the same time as being somewhat up himself as was Brent (here, in his constant reference to himself as a ""real actor""). In all, though sufficiently different to be a new character - Andy, seeking through the series, that one line of dialogue that will make him the ""real actor"" that he continually claims he is.<br/><br/>His friend ""Maggie"" (Ashley Jensen) is wonderful, with a lovely accent and great comedic timing.<br/><br/>There were some real laugh-out-loud moments (for me, at least): Ben Stiller explaining why he's directing his movie, which appears to be a drama about a Balkan state: with references to all his comedic hits, is a great self-send up.<br/><br/>The scene where Andy advises Maggie on how to work up an excuse *before* someone asks you to a party you don't want to go to -- explaining that you need to say ""your sister's coming to visit; you're gutted, but sorry you can't make it"", then coaching her through it when the invitation duly comes -- priceless and very funny.<br/><br/>All the scenes of Kate Winslett suggesting to Maggie ways in which she could talk dirty on the phone with her boyfriend are simply wonderful.<br/><br/>There's another scene in the graveyard, with the ""Dullard"" in which Andy is pretending that a Jewish woman's grave, who died in 1953, is his mother's grave, making him ""at least 52"". Maggie helps him along.<br/><br/>All of the scenes with his hopeless ""Agent"" (Co-writer Stephen Merchant) are giggle-along funny, and worth a re-watch.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the series, and have watched parts of it twice or more, always the mark of good comedy.<br/><br/>I wonder what they will do for the ""guest stars"" in future?

3310,Extras, Why do people insist on comparing this with The Office??????,"Almost every review I have read on here today contains the words ""The Office."" Why can people not offer their thoughts on the quality of this programme as a stand alone piece? Ricky Gervais plays a different guy in completely different surroundings. He is limited as an actor (by his own admission) which is why some people have commented that it feels like they are watching David Brent. Gervais does not have the range to bring a completely new character to the screen and in effect plays variations of himself. It has a brand new cast supplemented by guest stars parodying themselves. Hats off to Ross Kemp last night, although Vinnie Jones stunk up the place a bit during his scene. This is a great concept which has been well written (so far) and I'm sure will grow into a firm favourite with regular viewers. Please give this a chance, it could be another classic.",38 out of 52 found this helpful.,,29 July 2005

What price comedic success, eh? Like everybody, I thought The Office was pure comedy gold. The premise was so strong that even the US offering couldn't fail. So, this time up, what has Ricky Gervais got for us? Well, more of the same only different. 'Extras' is in the same mould as The Office, there are those cringe worthy moments that we've all grown to love and expect...but there's a clever twist on the formula. The Gervaise character isn't the butt of all of the jokes this time around. Sure, the scene in the trailer with the crying eastern European reminded one of the fake sacking of Dawn and the scene towards the end at the party with the racial slurs was pure Brent, but more often than not Andy was observer and rye commentator on what was going on around him. This would simply have been beyond David Brent's self obsessed nature.<br/><br/>All in all, 'Extras' has what it takes and I await the next episode with great anticipation.",46 out of 67 found this helpful.,,25 July 2005
3312,Extras, Oh So Brilliant!,"Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant is the peerless comedy-duo whose brilliant eye for comedy and drama surprised and shocked the world a few years ago with the Award-winning The Office, who later transformed itself into one of TV-comedy-history's most memorable and successful series. This is their Difficult Second Album, and its such a fantastic volume two of their already stunning career. Gervais takes the role as Andy Millman, a pretty straight-forward everyday man whose situation finds him seeking for more to life as he and his friend Maggie (Ashley Jensen) both work as extras, or supporting artists if you like, and Merchant takes a supporting character as Darren Lamb, his literally useless agent.<br/><br/>Extras is such a fantastic show in every aspect, and the transaction between comedy and drama is purely class, the way you'll find the celebrity-parts (oh, it's just Patrick Stewart, Kate Winslet, Samuel L. Jackson, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, David Bowie and Robert De Niro to mention some) egoism and embarrassing self-awareness adds realism to it, and it's sort of every fan's nightmare to see their favorite actor/actress act themselves into embarrassing situations. 'Extras' is something very few artists can pull off, it's a follow-up that adds depth to something already brilliant by not only making the funny bits even more subtle and the gags even more layered, but adding emotional resonance with outstanding pace.

With each episode, Extras has gained momentum like a cartoon snowball.<br/><br/>You can call me crazy, but Ricky Gervais has merely channeled Carroll O'Connor's ghost, and made it his very own. The Gervais Merchant brand of humor likewise is more Norm Lear than anything else. We get the laughs from racial, ethnic, etc. punch-lined jokes because we are really laughing at the ignorance, insensitivity and gross stupidity of the joke teller, who is in the end, the ultimate joke. Every sacred cow topic or taboo joke in the book is conjured triumphantly on this show, and I sit and laugh I mean really laugh, right along with everyone else out there. Borat utilized the same principle. Unlike Borat however, Gervais and Merchant don't go overboard and falsely portray positive stereotypes. That lack of hypocrisy is what makes this show and The Office before it, far superior to Ali G, Borat and company.

Ricky's character is easy to sympathise with and the level of ""shallowness"" seems just right to me.

3315,Extras, You having a Laugh?,"'Extras' is an amazing stand out comedy from the the genius brain of Gervais and Merchant. 'Extras' focuses on the life of a movie extra and his best mate, Maggie who constantly have interactions with famous people. The cameos of the series are extremely funny, especially that of Daniel Radcliffe, David Bowie and Robert DeNiro. I enjoyed this show, I bought it online, the best way to watch them over and over (which I do and you will). The story lines are fresh and there is never a moment when I was wishing that it would end already. <br/><br/>The brilliance behind this show is the writing. The fact that the writers have dealt with the industry that they are making fun of makes the scenes sweeter. The Kate Winslet, which is one of the first episodes, is so spot on that I could not believe that anyone ever thought that ending this show was a good idea. The jokes that even the start (cameos) deliver makes me believe that Gervais and Merchant can get an way with anything. <br/><br/>The unique thing that makes Gervais and Merchant so popular is that they see the funny things in life and make them even more disastrous. I love how they can point out the insanity of the movie industry, while making a point to remind the viewer, that it is because of the public movie stars behave the way they do and get away with it. The transformation from movie extra to big star to fallen star is one that is the main storyline, but I laughed the whole way through...either I missed the point of the series, or I fully get it.<br/><br/>If you want to laugh-",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,30 March 2011
3316,Extras, The British are lucky! The y have funny and witty comedians!,"I've just watched pretty much all of the episodes on youtube, and I have to admit that this is probably one of the funniest and most sarcastic and at the same time wittiest TV shows I've seen in a long, long time. Ricky Gervais is a marvellous actor and just the last episode, the Christmas special, proved to me that he's not just a comedian but a really good actor, too. The scene in which he's on Big Brother for celebrities and just starts his short but astute speech against the contemporary media and their abuse of power just left me flabbergasted and gobsmacked. It felt as if he talked right from his heart and really meant everything he said. And I'd like to congratulate him on the risky decision to make the last episode not as funny as those before but instead giving it a less light-hearted touch. It moved me and I thought it was really deep.<br/><br/>So, you British people out there, consider yourself lucky for having such great comedians and comedies. You have no idea what kind of stupid comedies we're forced to watch here in Germany. Most of it is just a cheap spin-off of what you do. For example, we have a German version of the Office, which isn't bad, but it's still nothing but a spin-off.<br/><br/>Maybe the German language just wasn't meant to be funny.<br/><br/>So, good bye, and if you ever meet one of us: Don't mention the war!",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,6 January 2008

3318,Extras, Uncomfortable humor at its best,"Sascha Baron Cohen better look out: his current reign as King of Uncomfortable Comedy (thanks to ""Borat"") could be overthrown by Ricky Gervais in ""Extras"", this uproarious comedy that could be Britain's answer to ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". Gervais, the star of the British version of ""The Office"" (playing David Brent, later Michael Scott). ""Extras"" chronicles film extra Andy Millman (Gervais)'s quest to be recognized as a ""real actor"". So what if he's an overweight 43-year-old who only started the business five years ago? So what if he has an overinflated sense of self and a tendency to say EXACTLY what's on his mind? So what if his agent is a clueless prat who is absolutely no help? Andy's a real actor, dammit, and he's determined to prove it. His only real friend is fellow extra Maggie (Ashley Jenson), a sweet-natured but dim woman-child who has the same foot-in-mouth tendencies Andy does. Every episode follows Andy as he rubs elbows with real movie stars and tries to get at least one line in a movie. I have to applaud Gervais, who not only gets real actors to play themselves, but to play themselves in the most horrible way possible. Kate Winslet, for instance, plays herself as a shallow, sex-obsessed shrew who only picks roles she thinks will get her an Oscar. Ben Stiller plays himself as an insensitive, egotistical jackass who loves to remind everyone how much his movies have grossed worldwide. Even though the show tends to be formulaic, it's still a great comedy, albeit a rather melancholy one. ""Extras"" doesn't shy from topics such as the physically disabled, the frustrating life of a struggling actor, and the inherent sadness of being a faded has-been (the episode featuring Les Dennis borders on devastating). Still, the ever shallow and boorish Andy keeps things from getting maudlin, and somehow we love him for it. How often is it that the writers of a show create an unlikable character... and acknowledge that he's unlikable? We're always both sympathetic and gleeful when Andy fails yet again. Gervais is excellent, as is the rest of the cast. Jenson is a hoot as Maggie, who is a lot like a younger, Scottish accented version of Rose from ""The Golden Girls"". ""Extras"" is an exquisite show of uneasy humor. Watch it and be glad you're ordinary.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,,21 January 2007
3319,Extras, The voiceless world of an Extra,"In light of The Office's brilliance, our expectations are high for Gervais's new show, Extras. Gervais plays a struggling ""little 43 year old"" actor, who has for the past five years given his shot at acting. And failed. Desperate for even one line, the first show sees Gervais emotionally blackmailing a traumatised foreigner upon whose life actor Ben Stiller is making a film for a line in the movie.<br/><br/>Extras follows a very similar humour scheme to The Office, however, the flow of the script is raised slightly from the mundane, taking on a distinctly more energetic, punchline-based style...though this is neatly attributed to differing speech and humour types of each character. The awkward faux pas and stunned silences that made The Office classic are revitalised for Extras, played out in a relatively fresh manner. Unfortunately, a bit too much of the Office's material seems recycled for Extras. A strong element of David Brent is emitted from Ben Stiller, re varnished only with more arrogance and superiority. Stiller's climactic rant, chilled with a shocked silence from the crowd, in both style and camera-work is almost identical to Brent's at the end of Episode 2,04. Miscellaneous other lines seem vaguely re-iterated versions of lines from The Office, too strong to simply be classified as a reference. But having seen only episode 1 of Extras, it is difficult to compare it to the chain-success of The Office. <br/><br/>In conclusion, Extras seems liked a toned down form of the Office. While audience all over England could effortlessly relate to the mundane, soul-destroying atmosphere of Wernham Hogg, Extras shows us a world many of us are unfamiliar with, placing viewers in a position of spectator-ship, rather than immersing them in the world. Which is ironic, given that The Office followed a fly-on-the-wall approach, and Extras is shot in a standard sitcom/drama format. In spite of perhaps the ever-so excessive repetition of The Office's humour, Extras is still a fabulous watch, and it's inability to stand up to The Office (no mean feat!), does not prevent it from being a great new refreshing comedy that won't be easily forgotten; soaring past recent sitcoms such as My Family and My Hero.<br/><br/>All that remains is to see how the rest of the series fares. 8/10",33 out of 63 found this helpful.,,21 July 2005

3321,Extras," Season 1: A funny, awkward comedy that never gets close to The Office but is still funny and starry","Andy Millman and his friend Maggie Jacobs are both professional extras  ""actors"" who fill the backgrounds in film and television productions. Maggie seems happy with this but Andy always hopes for more; however his attempts at getting a ""proper"" acting job have yet to get him anywhere. Although they spend their days surrounded by stars, their lives are both much less interesting and they find more awkwardness than anything else whether they are dealing with Hollywood actors, partners, agents, TV stars or other extras.<br/><br/>Following on from The Office was never going to be an easy task and it was no surprise to find that this series has elements of the latter's strength but never manages to get as good. The series is quite episodic and fragmented without a great deal of development across the series. Each episode is essentially a comedy of human awkwardness with a different guest star each week. As such it is funny but never gets close to the painful human condition that The Office did so well  however it still manages to be quite funny. The awkwardness is funny and cringeworthy but it isn't convincingly ""real"" and is obviously structured to just be an episode rather than be about the characters.<br/><br/>Supporting this is the guest star aspect which is mostly well used but does occasionally make the series feel like an extended loads of cameos. The American names are impressive but have noticeably smaller roles than some others. The English actors send themselves up well  Kemp is hilariously self-aware, Stewart is fun but Les Dennis is the most memorable. His performance is spot on although I did wonder why he would want to lay himself as bare as he did here  he gets closest to the tragicness of life and he shadows anything else in his episode. The performances from Gervais and Jensen are pretty good  funny, realistic and fitting with the material. The one complaint I had was that I didn't feel for them or understand them anymore by episode 6 than I did in episode 1; they didn't develop their characters or find depth as well as I would have liked.<br/><br/>So naturally, this is not The Office  but then, what is? However this is still an enjoyably funny comedy of awkwardness with plenty of guest stars who at very least add interest (but mostly add a lot). It is funny and is a polished comedy series  just don't expect it to get close to the perfection of The Office.",29 out of 57 found this helpful.,,8 September 2005

The set-pieces are there, like 'The Office', and work very well, even though we're just getting to know the characters. Ben Stiller is *very* good as the self obsessed star director. I expect it's just good acting.<br/><br/>Gervais' character is a witty, clever-ish guy, who is, none the less, a loser. His friend Maggie shows potential as another grotesque creation; she just cannot hide her gut reaction to people and situations, so often puts her foot in it. A sort of Godber figure then, counselled by Gervais' Fletcher. I suppose that makes Ben Stiller Mr MacKay? I may have taken the Porridge parallels too far.<br/><br/>Thoroughly recommended.",18 out of 34 found this helpful.,,22 July 2005
3324,Extras, I actually prefer this......,"I've watched the first 3 eps and I have to say it's getting better. The first episode was relatively weak at the start but by the end (when Stiller starts his rant) it was above average. Last weeks ep was even better with Ross Kemp surprising me!! But last nites.........good god , I nearly bust something!!!!!!! I don't think i'll ever look at Ms.Winslett in the same way again! Filthy girl.....filthy filthy girl!! The prayer group scene was a funny 'look through the fingers' embarrassing funny (up there with the best of the 'Office') but then to follow it up with la Winslett miming a certain sexual action (and getting caught)...easily one of the funniest things i've seen this year. That coupled with her diatribe about 'holocaust' films, my opinion of Kate has shot waaaayy up.",20 out of 39 found this helpful.,,5 August 2005
3325,Extras, Merchant &amp; Gervais still have it,"'Extras' is a sitcom written by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant who had previously collaborated on the award winning 'The Office'. The show carried on over two series and followed Andy Millman, a movie extra trying to make it into the big time, the only problem is hes forty, overweight and not blessed with Johnny Depp's looks.<br/><br/>In the first series it follows Andy desperately trying to get a line to move a notch up the showbiz ladder although hes currently on the bottom rung. The humour is dark and a satire on the real extras business which is very shallow and humiliating, the style is changed completely from The Office and Gervais plays a different character, David Brent was arrogant but pitiful, Andy Millman is a nicer person and more relatable but still pitiful in his own right.<br/><br/>The gimmick of each episode is they have one or more celebrity appearing or cameoing in a 'twisted' version of themselves, usually highly self-deprecating, either they are rude, arrogant, ignorant, liars, racist, not entirely sane or a combination of all of them. Without a shadow of a doubt the best cameo of the first series is Les Dennis, the way he laughs at his own horrible situation where he was humiliated by his wife who has arguably gone onto bigger things (totally undeserved, she is completely talentless) is admirable. Other highlights include Ben Stillers appearance where he plays a tyrannical director, Ross Kemp's confrontation with Vinnie Jones, Kate Winslet's phone sex scene and Patrick Stewart. The only disappointment really was Samuel L Jackson, they just didn't have any funny dialogue for him.<br/><br/>Andy is very sarcastic and thats where much of the shows humour comes from, he can be very witty and quick on his feet but occasionally inexplicably talks himself into a hole and continues digging way past a man as intelligent and glib as he sometimes appears to be should allow himself to get which is one of my problems with Extras, Andy Millman just isn't very consistent as a character. His best friend Maggie Jacobs is another problem, sometimes to great comic effect, Andy uses her to try and make himself look good like when he tries to impress a new neighbour he fancies and asks Maggie to pretend to be a fan and ask for his autograph, inevitably she messes it up and makes Andy look stupid with cringeworthy results. The problem isn't Maggie's characters fault as she is written stupid but Andy continually puts Maggie in a situation where she is bound to make him look bad and he never seems to learn which again is inconsistent with his character. It gets to the stage where when he asks Maggie to do something to make him look good you're literally waiting for her to mess up and after a while it isn't funny just irritating. Also sometimes Maggie can be deliberately malicious towards Andy, she enjoys joining in when Andy is being humiliated and even laughs at him, she never seems to stick up for him which I found disappointing.<br/><br/>Extras two best characters in my eyes are the recurring agent Darren Lamb and Shaun Williamson or 'Barry off Eastenders' as he is usually called, who along with Andy is a client of Darren's, the only other client of Darren's it seems for he is surely the worst agent in the business. His CV for Andy sounds more like a charity appeal than a list of achievements and he even questions potential employers judgement for trying to hirer Andy. His part-time weekend job at the Carphone Warehouse just about sums him up. His sidekick Barry, who seems in even worse dire straits than Andy is desperate for work and quotes Shakespeare (horribly) on queue. These two are genuinely hilarious and deserve credit for some of the funniest moments in the show. Merchant probably doesn't get as much credit as Gervais does but those that listened to 'The Ricky Gervais Show' on xfm can attest that Merchant can actually be funnier than Gervais, his quick one liners are brilliant. Karl Pilkington deserves a mention as well, many of his quotes are ripped straight from The Ricky Gervais Show into Extras.<br/><br/>The second series follows Andy's rise to relative fame, except not for the great art he would have hoped and leads to more embarrassing situations featuring more celebrity guests who vary in their ability to send themselves up to comic effect. Overall this was a very funny show with some classic comedy moments but I'm glad it ended when it did, on a high in the hour-long special after the second series, which was in my opinion the funniest and certainly the most moving of the lot which was a good way to bow out. Probably not quite as funny and groundbreaking as The Office this is a very good second crack which can occasionally be disappointing after a major debut success.<br/><br/>8/10",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,8.0,5 March 2010
3326,Extras, Finally,"I was introduced to the BBC show Extra's almost one year ago. It is the most watched DVD in my collection. For those of you who have seen Gervais either in his stand up or his show 'The Office' (BBC), will already have an appreciation of his comedic genius. With Gervais and Merchants writing of the episodes of Extra's, the result is some of the best satire I have ever seen. Each episode has a 'star' host, keep your eyes out for my favorite with Kate Winslet. Most of the guest hosts play characters very unlike those for which they are typically cast, and they do a marvelous job. The casting of the 'extras' is perfect, the timing right on, the writing is so good it is painful. Literally you will want to reach into your TV and tell them 'Stop talking.....NOW' Hands down, my favorite DVD of all time.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,4 January 2007
3327,Extras, Simply brilliant - actually rivals The Office in terms of laughs!!!,"Ricky Gervais strikes gold again, with ""Extras"", which is just as funny as ""The Office"". Gervais portrays the lives of extras on a film set and how they are often treated like dirt, but it is about so much more than that!!!! It is in the brilliant discourses between the characters that this show shines, because in their inane, irreverent discussions do we see an honest insight into what really matters. Because that is what this show is - the lead character, Andy, is by no means perfect - he's selfish, self centred and overly judgemental - but that just makes him more human because he is not one of those cardboard cutout pretty boys in so many other shows. After seeing the first series, where he interacts with real stars in the hope of getting noticed, you will want to see more! The Samuel L.

3333,AJ and the Queen, Unexpected Awesomeness,"I went into this series with low expectations RE acting, just knowing it would be a fun romp with a sweet storyline (drag queen saves kid / kid saves drag queen). I assumed it would be enjoyable just based on the drag scenes, the time with Ru, and the cameos. Well I got all that, but surprisingly, the acting from the primary characters was high quality; tears were shed on the show AND in my living room. Excellent performance from Ru, who I thought would be campy throughout, but who delivered believable moments of sorrow, realization, laughter, affection and vulnerability that far surpassed anything she's previously presented. Great performances as well from Michael-Leon Wooley as Louis, and occasionally from Izzy G. as AJ (her angry outbursts need work, but she seemed to improve as the series progressed and no doubt has a stellar career ahead of her as she masters the craft).<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Drag Race, there's plenty here to get excited about beyond the core storyline. Cameos galore throughout, lots of drag performances, and in some cases, opportunities for your favorite queens to show off their acting chops.<br/><br/>There were a few glaring inconsistencies in the plot; for example, why would Ruby owe $100 grand to the credit card company - if she had been grifted out of her $100,000 savings, she'd simply have a zero balance... Also the continued chase of the villains although they already had their money didn't add up. But the explorations of LGBTQ issues, the healing power of drag, childhood hurt, and the struggle to become who you are despite hardship and loss, were done brilliantly and overshadow the flaws. It's infused with dramatic poignancy blended expertly with moments of well-written humor. Turns out AJ and the Queen is a must-watch (well done, Ru), and an absolute imperative for a season 2 (talking to you, Netflix).",40 out of 52 found this helpful.,8.0,13 January 2020

3335,AJ and the Queen, An Honest review,"First off, the pilot episode is not good example or representation of how cheeky and charming this show is. For a pilot, it's clumsy, awkward and filled with extended scenes of air. AJ is purposefully unloveable but without any redeeming qualities and a lot of screaming, it's hard to sit through.<br/><br/>However, Ru comes into his own and you can see his confidence coming through and by the end of the season, it's good tv.<br/><br/>It's cute to see a lot of the RPDR alumni popping up, ones you can see are clear soft spots of Ru's getting some great screen time.<br/><br/>My only gripe was that it didn't really hit the feels, I enjoyed the sassy one lines and the odd ball moments but the heart of the story just didn't hit the landing.<br/><br/>I'd be curious to see where season 2 goes but it needs a tighter story.

The other side of the coin was having her see, first-hand, how certain ""grifters"" prey on gay men or trans, whatevers. They're nasty. I cannot fathom living a day with that kind of sickness driving you to exploit another by charming them, then scamming them.

3353,Overlord, cool RPG style anime,"I don't have much experience with role playing games, so a lot of the references to moves, energy, strength, skill, etc. in this anime were lost on me. Although I have seen plenty of shows where someone gets trapped inside a game, TV show or movie, so it was still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Momonga is playing Yggdrasil (an online RPG I assume) and the game is shut down. Instead of logging out, he decides to stay and then realises he's trapped in this online fantasy world. Since his character was a Supreme Being (practically a God), things aren't so bad for him, as he has a handful of powerful guardians to protect him. Of course, being god-like, he doesn't really need them, since he's nearly invincible anyway. He then decides to conceal his true form (a skeleton-type dude) and go on the lookout for his previous friends (who were all Supreme Beings) by becoming a low-level adventurer who wants to spread his name (now changed to Ains Ool Gown?) by defeating as many powerful enemies as possible.<br/><br/>At first I wasn't into this show, but after a few episodes I was hooked. Watching Lord Ains defeat even the most powerful enemies thrown at him with ease was pretty cool, and they didn't shy away from the violence either. A bit rough for little kiddies though.

3355,Overlord," Fascinating, but far too brief","When you are trapped in a virtual reality game, the natural thing to do is to find a way out. But when your VR persona is that of the most powerful demon sorcerer ever, that's when things get interesting. <br/><br/>The whole show is carried on the shoulders of the title character, the Overlord. Satoshi Hino gives a terrific dual performance as the mage demon master Ainz Ooal Gown and as the human player Momonga providing a monologue and narrative. Ainz serves as the anti-heroic character who strives to conquer the world for his own desire, and Momonga is the simple player who only wishes to locate other gamesters like himself in the new world. It's a fascinating character and Hino does him great credit with his voice. <br/><br/>Beyond the Overlord himself, the rest of the cast are not as developed, but they get enough time and character to stand out; Yumi Hara in particular makes a lasting impression as a passionate demon who gets emotionally carried away frequently. The animation and music is also above average and complements the story well. <br/><br/>The show, however, is far too brief to tell its story adequately, and so is confined to introducing its characters and the world and only a brief space to show them off, and then ends on a cliffhanger. This is an incredible story that deserves more than 13 episodes, and its being cut off so early makes the whole fantasy tragically disappointing. Thankfully, the story is carried on in the manga that runs in parallel to the show, so if you want more you should check out that comic. <br/><br/>As brief as it is, the show is still a fantastic saga that deserves a lot of love and makes for a great watch.",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,7.0,2 March 2017

3360,Overlord," A good, if flawed anime.","I'll start by saying it's a good watch overall. While the whole ""being trapped in a video game"" thing is tired, this book adaptation does well in execution. The characters are well acted, the story lines interesting and complex (usually in a two-faced political sense), and most characters likeable.<br/><br/>Now here's where the show falters for me:<br/><br/>1. Much of the show (especially the second season) actually kicks Ains's story to the side to spends several episodes on side characters, building them up as their own protagonists, only to have Ains kill them off and never be
mentioned again, essentially wasting the viewer's time and emotional investment.<br/><br/>2. Ains's (the protagonist) allies, the NPCs him and his friends created, constantly worship him. It was humorous at first, but after three seasons, this gets very, very grating. Some scenes are literally just stroking the ego of the main character, who is in actuality a huge turbo virgin who never leaves his house.<br/><br/>3. To use a video game term, being a shut in and doing nothing but leveling up and getting the best items, Ains is way too OP (overpowered). The show only gets its value by expounding upon the backstories of its side characters that exist within the video game, the ones that aren't Ains or the NPCs who serve him. His fights are somewhat boring, because again, they only serve to stroke the main character's ego.<br/><br/>3. Ains is wholeheartedly, unapologetically evil. Something went wrong when he was trapped in the game and he lost any humanity he had. Sometimes the show will build up a character's backstory for several episodes only to have Ains or his NPCs kill them brutally and anticlimactically. Or have them tortured and then killed. Or enslaved. The show does a good job to make sure you dislike its protagonist, and root for his enemies. Maybe that's by design, but it's not for me.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,7.0,22 June 2020

3363,Overlord, Solid but wastes potential,"I read about the series online and thought the premise was kind of interesting, so I gave it a chance. As of now, I watched the first two seasons and up to episode 10 of the third season. The first season had a pretty tense ending, which I liked, but the second season and the thrid one so far were pretty boring. There are two big downsides in my eyes: First, the main character and his followers are so incredibly overpowerd that they are, except for pretty much one situation, never remotely in danger. They just smash everything that gets in their way. Unfortunately, there's not much getting in their way. So it's not an action-kill-fest and the few actual fights are boring. Second downside is the story. We get to know a lot about our main character and their old and new world in the first season, but this strongly declines after. Side characters are mostly one-dimensional and rather dull, though sometimes funny. Some parts of the plot seem utterly pointless, like five or so episodes spent on some lizzardmen, which does not contribute anything to the actual story. After those episodes, they are not seen again. This is especially sad because the episodes are pretty short.<br/><br/>So all in all, it has some good ideas, especially in the first season, but it rapidly declines afterwards. Episodes are short, but that also makes them easy to watch. Storytelling is too slow/unfocused for the short episode length. I read a little bit in the wiki and apparently there's lots of interesting stuff in the light novels, so we might get some better seasons in the future.",14 out of 24 found this helpful.,5.0,2 October 2018

3367,Overlord, A Good Adaption but for finer details read the Light Novel.,"The anime for overlord while having being worked on by one of the best animation studios. isn't perfect. The anime skips alot of the source material in the first season while in the second they stay more true to the source material but they don't include everything from it, as a perfect adaption would. <br/><br/>Animation wise, it's ok. Most of the scenes are either single a frame with barely any animation on it, especially the scenes with creatures without mouth movements. Or they are heavily animated scenes where even the fabric of clothing is being animated. This would be a good animation quality from any other studio but from madhouse, one of the best. You'd always expect to see living scenery and not still frames with barely any life in them. <br/><br/>If you read the light novel, aka the source material. You'd know the story already and you wouldn't be missing out any details other than seeing the animated form of the scenes from the book. If you haven't read the light novel though you'd be lost about certain thing here and there, like why did ainz decide to use ____ kinda punishment? or does ___ have any brothers/ sisters? or how did ___ find ____ ? and etc. You'd honestly be lost in those finer details as the anime does skip alot of the explanations for things and doesn't go into what each character is thinking, unlike the Light Novel.<br/><br/>As long as you read the light novels alongside the anime, you should be fine. But if you don't you'll get confused here and there. It's still enjoyable regardless though. So, I highly recommend it a watch.",6 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,11 February 2018

And in Season 1 you meet this girl who is supposed to be super strong and kills a lot of people and overlord comes in and chokes her to death after she kills a group of people whom you get to meet and learn a lot about...Of course they are killed off. The show also features with a 99% talking and inner monologue that is unimportant and boring to the whole story, along with information they repeat a million times for the low IQ people who enjoy the show and need to be reminded of things they have already heard and known since episode 1&amp;2.<br/><br/>This happens throughout literally the whole show, it's a huge waste of time and close to being the worst anime I have EVER seen.",15 out of 52 found this helpful.,1.0,15 April 2018

There is no ""good guy"" or ""hero"" like all the other animes out there. This show is about the absolute power and control the main character has, and more importantly how he uses it. <br/><br/>The animation is beyond exceptional, with great detail, sharp lines, dark colors, and smooth fighting scenes with vivid spells.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something new, edgy, interesting, and mature, look no further.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,9 September 2018

3377,Overlord," An ""eh"" Isekai","As the title implies: This is an Isekai anime (An anime where a character gets transported to an unknown world) where a guy gets trapped in his MMO character in a new fantasy world, with his previous NPC companions now gaining full autonomy (while maintaining an incessant undying loyalty to the guy). As a high level player, Ainz Ooal Gown comes to find out that he is in pretty much every sense of the word: invincible in the world that he now calls home.<br/><br/>While the concept was cool for the first season as the main character tries to understand the state of the world, his capabilities and his plan going forward: the series unfortunately suffers from the fatal flaw of making Ainz an omnipotent character. Even through the latest season: there's been essentially no character who's able to come close to the power level of even Ainz' inner circle. This leads to an exposition that relies more on overcoming abstracted political issues rather than some form of tangible villian which may or may not be an issue depending on your point of view. Much of what Ainz' does in order to overcome these tasks is less than savory and makes him seem more like a villian than a protagonist that we should care about too.<br/><br/>In short: while not necessarily a bad series: I feel like much of the potential was wasted in this one.

It reminds me a lot of ""Skins"", but lighter, not so much emphasis on drugs and sex, so if you like Skins, you will probably like My Mad Faty Diary. Also, it gives an insightful view on mental illness and different kinds of insecurities, which makes it easy to relate.

It focuses on a young teenage girl who after spending two months in a mental hospital is released into the world again, not only does it shows the girls sarcastic and witty nature as a defence but it manages to show her vulnerable and sensitive side too making it a really great watch.

It's insightful and portrays mental illness with respect and as a real issue, not a joke like so many other shows can. The characters were thought out and felt like actual people with a life and history's. I am no longer a teen, have not been for years; but I still related to the main character. I loved how realistic it was, her thoughts and reactions to things. It was not at all far-fetched, where the viewer has to remind themselves its a TV show, I actually felt like all the events were common and normal.

It is like a movie, you're not feeling like you are watching a TV show. And it gives you something. You can learn a lot from it.

I look forward to Mondays simply to see this.<br/><br/>Such an incredibly accurate portrayal of life as a teenager in 90s England, this show brings a lot back for me, good and bad. It takes many twists and turns, but our constant is Rae, insecure, sweet, broken, amazing Rae, she is so relatable it's almost upsetting at times, yet reassuring too.<br/><br/>A real life account of a battle with mental illness, while trying to fit in, trying to grow up, this show tackles issues few have tried to before and it works, seamlessly. I think we needed a character and a program like this, to highlight the demons that those with depression and self image issues deal with every day.<br/><br/>I don't really watch TV, but mine is on every Monday now at 10pm without fail, the music is awesome, the characters get straight in to your heart. It's hilariously funny, and yet gritty all at once. I love Rae's Mum, she is absolutely bonkers. It's perfection.<br/><br/>I simply cannot praise My mad fat diary enough.

3386,My Mad Fat Diary, Incredibly good and highly recommended,"My Mad Fat Diary is an incredibly good, well written and highly addictive TV BBC series, which only defect is that it has only 6 episodes per series or season. While the target audience of this show is definitely teens, it is so good, clever, and so down to earth with all the raw nerve exposure of what being a teen is that I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good piece TV and not gets all too fixated on the fact it's about teen life. Since the story revolving in the series is set in the 1990s, personally for me it works as some sort of time travel machine - bringing back all the good, bad, hilarious or somewhat tragic experiences of own teen-hood. Since the show is not afraid to take out the many skeletons and ugly things of growing up, such as insecurities, self discovery, and own body awareness among them, instead of just going for your usual and by now quite 'safe' route of so many other shows which is just about dating, drinking, and rarely anything more, it makes the series even more convincing.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 and the highest possible recommendation.",13 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,14 March 2014

3389,My Mad Fat Diary," Good first season, but...","Rae is one of the most unlikeable lead chracters that I've encountered in a long time. Majority of the first season was very good. Humor was good and I felt sympathetic towards Rae and her struggles, cause it seemed that she is genuinely trying to get better.<br/><br/>But during the second season it really started to go downhill for me. I've realized that Rae is actually self-centered, selfish brat, that sucks everyone in her problems like a black hole. And it baffles me how people around her put up with that.<br/><br/>Sure, being a friend/family/partner doesn't mean that you'll be there for them only when it's all sunshine and rainbows. Being there for someone means being there even when things get hard. But healthy boundaries must exist. And these folks don't have them. For me it really sends the wrong message, like you can do whatever and people will always be there for you. Or, your friends can do whatever but you have to be there for them if you are a good friend. It leads me to conclusion that maybe Rae's ""gang"" should actually work on their stuff as well (self-esteem etc.).<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think it is a bad show (hence 7/10), but I think it should have better message regarding having healthy boundaries.

And I hate Skins, so I really had no interest in trying MMFD. <br/><br/>But then the pilot showed up in my ""related videos"" on youtube, probably because of Killing Eve's interviews, and I decided to take a look at younger Jodie's performance. You see, the idea was to watch just a lil' bit to see Jodie and then bail out. Little did I know that I was going to get hooked right away.<br/><br/>This show is actually spectacular. It has a teenage set, that's right, but the themes are not teenage at all. Even though it's mostly a comedy (and a good one!), it gets really dark at times and makes you reflexive as hell. The first season not that much, it's lighter, but the second season came like a wrecking ball. I actually wish I knew a little more beforehand, because I was definitely not prepared for some of it. At the ending of the second season, I actually paused the show to cry, it was just too much.

What a talent - cheers m'dear! But the supporting cast are mostly excellent too - especially Nico Mirallegro (Finn), Claire Rushbrook (Rae's mum), Ian Hart (Kester), Jodie Corner (Chloe) and Turlough Convery (Liam).<br/><br/>'My Mad Fat Diary' is an unnervingly relatable story of a young adult struggling with mental health problems, on top of all the other issues teens have to go through. There are plenty of funny moments, including some wonderfully crude turns of phrase courtesy of Rae's inner monologue; and plenty of heartbreaking moments, especially as we see anxiety pile up on our protagonist.<br/><br/>It's not flawless. Series 2 didn't quite live up to series 1's high watermark, occasionally stumbling into more clichéd, American highschool movie territory.

Overall, the show conveys a powerful message that changed my perspective on life completely. I, too, struggle with low self-esteem, self-doubt, and coping with my demons. In fact, we all do. This series shows how even when life gets hard, there is still hope. You gotta stand up and keep pushing. Life is always going to have obstacles. That's how you learn and grow. <br/><br/>Also, it shows that having supportive people around you is important. But at the same time, it says that you should not be so dependent on them. Sometimes, you have to depend on yourself and only yourself. That's how you grow, and that's how you love yourself. <br/><br/>Rae is such a relatable character, and thankfully, she's not one of those skinny sexy Barbie blondes you normally see. She represents us chubby girls and how we are often looked down upon in society. This is what makes it even more real. Not everyone is a perfect-bodied, happy-go-lucky kind of girl. There needs to be more shows like this. I've never watched a show as relatable and realistic as this one. Learn from this, current television producers. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this show to anyone who has struggled with coping with life. It really sheds a light on hope! It made me look at life through a more positive lens, and showed me that, well, sh*t happens! And that's okay. However, it does have triggering aspects such as self-harm, so if you are really sensitive to that stuff I would recommend not watching it.",1 out of 2 found this helpful.,10.0,4 February 2018
3402,My Mad Fat Diary, Brilliant,"I can not praise this show enough. Firstly, The characters feel relatable as you can really feel emotions towards them and root for them (or against them) throughout each storyline. Secondly, this show portrays mental illness as realistic as possible. As a person who suffers from depression myself i could really relate to Rae's character, seeing her go though tough events and feeling self-loathing and thinking about suicidal thoughts it reminded me of myself going through such dark times. Finally, unlike a lot of teen shows nowadays portrays real teenage issues that a lot of teenagers go though such as bullying, homophobia, mental illnesses, deaths of loved ones, and loneliness amongst others.

3403,WPC 56," Z Cars is on... Put the kettle on, love!","The beautiful Jennie Jacques plays the lead role of WPC Gina Dawson. Although the series revolves around her there are many intelligently woven threads in the plot that give all the other players a good chunk of airtime, too. None of them disappoint, either. Things wind up nicely after five episodes but there's still a little wriggle room for another series and I, for one, hope that their is.<br/><br/>After all the time and trouble that the producers, cast and crew went to, to get this right I'm surprised that this was aired just after lunch during the week where probably not many people got the chance to see it. That was an extremely irresponsible decision by the faceless suits at the beeb who think they know something about television.<br/><br/>The story is well paced and intelligently laid out. The details, language and props were first rate and appropriate. The cast, photography and script were also all top notch. This is intelligent television drama... something the Americans are becoming good at and which we Brits have rather lost our way on.<br/><br/>Much, much better than that dreadful garbage, Prime suspect.",24 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,29 March 2013
3404,WPC 56," Good premise, Poor writing","Right off the bat, the show's premise presents several creative venues to pursue. You have a woman officer in a male dominant profession, allowing premise for critique of workplace sexism, assault, gender discrimination, and oppression. You can also tie with racial and socioeconomic issues and create a golden show. <br/><br/>This is where the first season starts, showing a lot of promise. But it quickly turns to cliches of personal relationships for the women officer. It is sad to see such a good premise being wasted in form of a one-dimensional character who is defined by her love life and the men in her life. The second season onward, this show is no different from any other gender-normative writing. I wish the writers rethink why they wanted to make the show in the first place. Personal lives are interesting, but it shouldn't define the character alone. Her ambitions, passions, inner struggles all could be explored, but weren't. Perhaps get more women writers and producers.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,6.0,7 September 2018
3405,WPC 56," Predictable, but the acting, plots, and details make up for that","The negative of the show is that much of it is predictable. The powerful men have to act macho and the woman is not respected as an equal. The woman has much better instincts as a copper than the men who've been on the police force for years. The worst of the coppers is, predictably, almost a 2-dimensional character, at least through the 2 seasons I've seen so far.<br/><br/>The positives include that there are some sensitive male characters who give Gina a chance. The supporting cast is excellent. The plots are interesting and appropriate to the times. And the attention to detail (sexism, racism, brutality, repressed sexuality, clothing, sets, hair styles, makeup, music, dialog) makes me almost believe it really is 1956 on the set.<br/><br/>Having lived through the 1950s (age 11 in 1956) I can attest that much of what we see on this show was very much like this. In many work places women were considered to be either eye-candy or efficient old maids who had no life outside of their employment, This continued well into the 60s until the women's movement had some clout. It would have been even more so for Gina who would have been about 10 years older than I was in 1956.<br/><br/>Gina's character has to be independent enough to take on a nontraditional job, tough enough to be a cop, yet still have a sensitive side. I think Jennie Jacques manages to pull it off well.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,22 December 2016

Senior police officers do not walk about with their hand in their pockets being churlish to other police officers. Remember most were ex military in the 50's. Those who wore helmets did not wear the chin strap under their chins but resting on them. Whistle chains were always worn, by men, in the top left hand pocket, so they could undo their jackets without undoing their chains. Guns were not that readily available for any PC. Corrupt sergeants existed but not as openly as suggested. The TV series ""SCOTT &amp; BAILEY"" have most of these things down pat, and the interviewing is well acted. This series is streets ahead of ""WPC 56"". By the way ""PRIME SUSPECT"" was also an excellent series. Factual?

3417,WPC 56, Precious TV series to take some break...,"The series is about Gina Dawson's, who is one of the first WPCs(Woman Police Constable), life as female police officer at precinct where dominated by male in West Midlands. Naturally She faces some difficulties as a woman because time is 1950s and it is the peak of the sexism and also awaking of the male protest. WPC 56's genre contains both drama and comedy and also beauty of the Jennie Jacques. There is an aspect, a thing thing that I can distinguish WPC 56 than other TV series. İt is not about the story telling or acting performance. Even I do like the both of them, there is an original shade in TV series. Both TV series focuses the female police officer's life and her life that is made difficult by her family, colleagues and dominant culture ideology of her community at that years, WPC 56 shows us and it take us an journey that how conditions of woman in business are in first. Also it offers us a compression about woman in the field that dominated by male between past and present. Consequently it is a great series to witness an era and discover how the woman rights and woman in business life comes far from past to present. I hope that there are more TV shows like WPC 56.

Words fail me to describe how absolutely awful this series is. The writing is monumentally crude and heavy-handed - imagine an episode of a third-rate soap opera, and then, if you can, think of something many, many times dumber and cruder than that. Just wallopingly dumb and over-done. And then there's absolutely no sign that anything was done in the direction to try to introduce any subtlety or intelligence. With writing and direction like that, it's really not fair to even try to judge the actors - I'd imagine with better material most of them would be thoroughly professional. I really just could not believe how absolutely dreadful this was. The production values are OK - they spent some money on costumes and props. But... could the writers and directors really be this bad? Or are they just cynics who believe that only dreadful, crude, heavy-handed trash will succeed with the public? I don't know.

The sexism and harassment was still up and running and it didn't matter what our position was, we still had to make tea. I'm disappointed with the ""romance"" between the detective and the constable.

3421,WPC 56, An extremely watchable and well made period drama.,"Can wholeheartedly recommend WPC 56. Originally screened on BBC1 between 2013 - 2015, it was one of several shows - along with LAND GIRLS, THE INDIAN DOCTOR and the ongoing (at the time of writing) FATHER BROWN - with which the Beeb proved it was possible to deliver quality period drama on a reduced daytime budget.
Set in 1956 in Brinford, a fictitious location in the West Midlands (the series is vague as to whether Brinford is a district of Birmingham or an entirely separate town on the outskirts of Birmingham), WPC 56 focuses on young recruit Gina Dawson (played by Jennie Jacques) the first female constable on Brinford's police force, and the struggles she faces due to her colleagues believing she's only there to make the tea and comfort distressed female witnesses and victims. In addition to the entrenched sexism of the period, the show also tackled the issues of racism, mental illness and homophobia, and predictably was accused of being 'too PC' by some viewers. But the fact is that to have been female, covertly gay (homosexuality being illegal at the time) or belonging to an ethnic minority, etc, during the period when WPC 56 was set would have meant being faced with such attitudes on a daily basis. Refreshingly, Gina wasn't portrayed as being too good to be true. Yes, she was intelligent, brave, resourceful, and could see past her colleagues' prejudices, but she was also naïve, inexperienced and had a disastrous habit of falling in love with the wrong man. And despite being made for daytime, the show wasn't afraid to go to some dark places, with storylines about rape, child murder, sex slavery, suicide, and - with WWII still being a recent event in 1956 - Nazi atrocities.
WPC 56 had problems keeping hold of it's actors. Practically the entire supporting cast changed between the first and second seasons, and Jacques herself left after Season 2 due to getting a regular role in VIKINGS. Her rookie replacement Annie Taylor, played by Claudia Jessie, was a very different character: whereas Gina was partly in awe of her colleagues and would often defer to them and be wary of speaking out, Annie came from a family of police officers (her father was retired from the force and both of her older brothers were policemen) and as she'd grown up amongst coppers and been around them her entire life, she wasn't impressed or intimidated by her Brinford colleagues at all, and was more than capable of standing up for herself.
I watched all three seasons of WPC 56 when they originally aired on BBC1, and had looked forward to further seasons with Jessie as Annie Taylor, but with the exception of FATHER BROWN, the Beeb's unofficial policy towards it's daytime period dramas seems to have been 'make three seasons, then stop.' Despite having developed a loyal fanbase and garnered highly favourable reviews (the TV critic in the Daily Mail even predicted that if WPC 56 had been initially shown at primetime, the BBC would have had another CALL THE MIDWIFE-sized hit on their hands), the show - together with LAND GIRLS and THE INDIAN DOCTOR - didn't return for a fourth season.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,8.0,9 January 2021

3424,Treme, Beautifully shot; very real.,"As a local who lived here during Katrina, I find this show particularly moving and powerful.<br/><br/>There have been so many films, documentaries, novels, etc. about New Orleans, and most tend to sensationalize or to give non-locals what they want or expect to see. This is the most real portrait of the city I've seen, and it does justice to the spirit of the city. Living here is a strange experience because it feels like a small town: you run into the same people again and again; people are always eager to show newcomers where to eat or drink or listen to music; people are very friendly; people do tend to cringe when visitors never stray from Bourbon (even though Bourbon is fun); people do have a fierce loyalty to local bars, restaurants, etc. Simon really captures all of this in the show. <br/><br/>I never saw The Wire, but I'm impressed with the style of giving snapshots of the city or characters to build portraits of the people and the atmosphere - particularly the second line parade, John Goodman's character reading the Tulane renewal plan (brought back some painful memories for me personally), the Mardi Gras Indian practice, the reaction of people walking into a house or bar for the first time since the storm and surveying the damage.<br/><br/>My main concern for this show: I have no idea how non-New Orleanians will feel about it. So much of my enjoyment of the show is rooted in seeing people I know and finally seeing a director do justice to some of the most wonderful things about this city. But I'm not sure how I would feel if I weren't so emotionally invested in it.",115 out of 127 found this helpful.,9.0,19 April 2010
3425,Treme, Treme....Another piece of American art work from Simon,"Treme is definitely not a show for everyone. And that is fine. Most likely, if you're a fan of David Simon's The Wire, you will probably have the utmost patience with this carefully and skillfully constructed character drama, realizing there will be a payoff down the line.<br/><br/>In the mean time, the viewer slowly, yes slowly, gets to know a wide array of characters as well as become totally engulfed in a post-Katrina New Orleans. It is often depressing and saddening. It is true that the first 3-4 episodes are slow. The viewer does wonder where the story is going, where the intrigue will come from, and what exactly is Simon going for. There are several scenes each episode where the music seems to go on too long and is filmed just for the sake of the music, not necessarily because it helps the story. In this way, it is not quite the equal of The Wire. Things are sometimes too slow and meandering.<br/><br/>But....please....if you're a fan of well planned character studies, if you appreciate the art and skill in a form of film that is unique and original, stick with Treme for the entire season. If The Wire was a ""slow burn"", Treme is a long smoldering fire left to burn after midnight, just to still be there in the morning. You think it's going to go out, but instead it just continues to build and draw you in. By episode 5 or 6, the contemplative &amp; intelligent viewer will be won over. By the end, you are completely riveted to the fortunes of the central 7-8 characters.<br/><br/>I cannot say enough for David Simon's ability to create something that is so different than 95% of what passes for drama and TV on the current airwaves. Every scene is crafted for a reason, every character is painstakingly created. Nothing is wrapped up in 55 (or 41) minutes, there are no shallow, one sided caricatures (other than maybe Sonny) that is the absolute norm on most network TV shows. CSI? Law and Order? The Mentalist? Child please....<br/><br/>Such episodic creations like CSI are for the average viewer who wants no challenge, wants a tidy ending tied in a bow, and who can care less for an artfully executed show. Treme attempts to reflect, and represent, true life as much as possible. Real life has an ebb and flow, very little is tidy, minimally is it black &amp; white. There are gray areas. Sometimes you do the right thing, sometimes you cut corners. If you require ease and tidiness to be entertained, please don't attempt this show....instead stick with David Caruso's Horatio on CSI: Miami, an absolute farce rife with simple and obvious one-liners that exist no where except in the festering pool of prime-time network TV written for the average viewer who is incapable of deeper thought, critical thinking, and patience.<br/><br/>To call these characters one-dimensional must mean that you've watched with one eye or ""didn't get it"". Almost everyone in the show exhibits admirable traits but also some traits that may be annoying, irresponsible, or questionable. I can say the same things about almost everyone I know in real life. No one is perfect, but most people strive to be the best they can. Wendell Pierce's Antoine Batiste changes and fluctuates throughout the 10 episodes, turning into a well-rounded human being with depth. The same can be said for Steve Zahn's Davis, who starts very clownish, but who slowly turns into a real person with a serious and sensitive side. I could go on and on, referring to The Chief, his son, LaDonna, Annie, Creighton, Toni, etc. Nevermind Kim Dickens' Janette, probably the most well-liked character that the viewer pulls for the most. She is incredibly multi-dimensional and deep, from her struggle as restaurant owner to her relationship with Davis. Also, shame on some posters that seemingly have ZERO knowledge about suicide, why it happens, how it effects the survivors, and how it often occurs with little warning, committed by an individual with a ""fine and normal"" life. There was nothing wrong with how Simon portrayed this un-named characters' suicide which served to represent the many people that took this route in the aftermath of such trauma.<br/><br/>As far as New Orleans itself, it seems to be a believable and life-like portrayal of it. I've been there 3 times ('04, '05, '09) for a week each time and can say its a place I want to return to often. The food, the music, the history, the people...are all unique and quite a National treasure. Any vitriol for the city or its people completely makes ZERO sense to me and probably reflects ignorance and close mindedness. What the city and its people have had to go through is amazing and something that 99.9% of us will never have to experience. This show attempts to capture this feel, this struggle, the identity of a city and it's attempt to resurrect itself. The characters all reflect, seemingly realistically, an aspect of this struggle, the effects of such trauma, what happened to its citizens, and what it takes to come back, and who/what may be in the way of such recovery. Obviously, if you've never experienced New Orleans, ""don't get"" the city, care nothing about music, you may indeed be behind the 8 ball when it comes to the patience and focus needed for this show.<br/><br/>Once again, it is not for everyone. It takes focus, it takes time, and it takes faith. Many people may need more explosions, more ""gotcha"" moments, more spoon fed explanations, and more clichés.<br/><br/>Bravo to Simon for another wonderfully and painstakingly created drama that only HBO would have the courage to stick with. The art, skill, and vision inherent in what he has done with this show, and The Wire, is truly an American treasure worthy of all the praise that may come its way.",86 out of 97 found this helpful.,8.0,12 January 2011
3426,Treme, A major artistic achievement from David Simon,"My first impression, from watching episode one, was that the writing did not have the flow of ""The Wire"" it was trying too hard to register the many characters and to quickly tick off the various ""types"" that make up New Orleans society. Bunk and Freeman were too firmly placed in my memory for me to make the leap to Antoine and Albert. As for the Steve Zahn character, I instantly took a dislike to him and found him unrealistic in the extreme.<br/><br/>By the time we had reached the scene with the Big Chief emerging from the dark, I had become hooked. The characters started to make sense. The generous helping of musical scenes produced what must be the finest portrayal of live music and musicians I have ever seen. I could not wait to catch episode two.<br/><br/>I have now watched the first two episodes twice and all my first impressions have been blown away. Once you get to know the characters and can watch their introduction again, things start to make sense. Steve Zahn? What a brilliant comic creation. Just watch the intro to episode two, his creeping around Elvis Costello, his first day on the job. Absolutely first rate, The shocking introduction of violence, suddenly alters ones perceptions of a major character.

Her performance is charismatic in the extreme.<br/><br/>I know that this series is not going to be to everyone's liking, but then neither is Shakespeare or Dickens. However, for those who enjoy a multi-faceted piece of work that can examine society in minute detail whilst never failing to entertain, this will surely rank as a major piece of American art.",66 out of 80 found this helpful.,10.0,25 April 2010
3427,Treme, Impressive. Its no wonder why all the good dramas are on HBO...and Treme is one of the best of the year,"The intense drama series ""Treme"" is one of the best shows out there.<br/><br/>And there is a good reason why some of the best dramas on television end up on HBO.<br/><br/>This is an endlessly rich series coming from the genius of David Simon,who has re-team with ""The Wire"" writer-producer Eric Overmyer to re-create New Orleans,a city in chaos three months after it was nearly washed away by Hurricane Katrina. Like his previous efforts on ""The Wire"",Simon's brilliant five-year epic about Baltimore was told mainly through the eyes of its most beleaguered(and beleaguering)citizens,""Treme"" teems with authentic life.<br/><br/>Simon doesn't coddle an audience,and landing in ""Treme"" is the artistic equivalent of landing in New Orleans itself. You're surrounded by people who know this city.....who talk about some of it's places, foods and culture and people without providing any background information to help you follow the discussion. They know the ups and downs of this city. And ""Treme"" delivers. As you'd expect from a Katrina story,the characters in ""Treme"" face myriad problems. But they have a sense of hope and resilience and a good-times-roll embrace of great food,great conversation,and so forth.<br/><br/>If the strong writing is a Simon hallmark,so is an impeccable ensemble that includes Wendell Pierce(""The Wire""),Clarke Peters(""The Wire""), Khandi Alexander(""The Corner""),Melissa Leo(""Homicide:Life On The Street""),and Nick Gomez(""Oz""),along with such widely known actors as John Goodman(""Roseanne""),and Steve Zahn. ""Treme"" sets up the characters and tells its story incredibly well and this maybe one of the best dramas on television,and it delivers.

3428,Treme, Treme Opinion,"The Wire was a great show. Rather than imitating the backdrop that made The Wire tick....homicide, drugs, corruption, David Simon has created a program with the same reality, different circumstances. I have enjoyed both episodes and am already a fan. Treme showcases the people of New Orleans. Not as victims but simply as a community that has taken a very hard hit and are attempting to move forward. As a side story, it also focuses on the musicians that provide the soundtrack for the city and their own ways of balancing life with art and trying to give the impression that, on the outside, they care as much about family as they do about feeding their primary goal, playing. There is a lot going on but there are a lot of characters, back stories and lives interconnecting. Eric and David are doing a very good job at the set up, providing glimpses at personal lives to act as puzzle pieces for the whole picture.",35 out of 42 found this helpful.,8.0,19 April 2010
3429,Treme," The mixed reviews were understandable - have patience, brothers and sisters","Yes, if you're a fan of David Simon you probably will be disappointed, but hold judgment until you've experienced both episode 1 and episode 2. In the first hour of the pilot there is a sense of the surreal. We feel a disconnect with the city and its characters. We catch glimpses of former New Orleans life but try as we might there is nothing drawing us in. New Orleans and its people are in a catatonic state. The city no longer has a soul. An hour doesn't seem that long but I must admit after sixty dreary minutes I was ready to pack it in, and then in the second hour the magic of Simon began creeping out of the cracks and crevices. It wasn't enough to convince me a compelling story would emerge, but it was enough for me to give it a second chance. A great story requires more of a setup than audiences are willing to give a writer these days. Thank god Simon never lets that influence him.<br/><br/>About a third of the way into episode two Simon had me. If you saw The Wire, that's probably the only criticism I had left. I can still see Bunk and Freamon. They were incredibly powerful characters and it's hard to dissociate Pierce and Peters from those parts. Wendell Pierce fills up a honky tonk stage as Antoine Batiste but aside from his trombone playing, I still expect him to wake up the next morning and head off to investigate another homicide. Same with Clarke Peters as the Indian. He's embraced his new role and already put his stamp on it, but in my mind he's still the recalcitrant Baltimore detective. I guess you could say that's pretty petty stuff. The new ensemble took over in the second episode and I can't wait for more. This is shaping up to be as good as The Wire.",53 out of 67 found this helpful.,10.0,20 April 2010
3430,Treme, A Great Slice of Life Drama,"This is definitely one of the best shows on HBO. It shows how New Orleans is coping with the disaster of Katrina with not only great scripts but with great characters such as Davis (Steve Zahn), Ladonna (Khandi Alexander), Antoine (Wendell Pierce) and ""Big Chief"" Albert (Clarke Peters). In fact, the character of Davis is truly a one of a kind character. He is both passionate and manic and you can truly feel his passion as well as his anger over the disaster that destroyed his adopted hometown. Also, this definitely captures the spirit of New Orleans, both good and bad and the true star of the show is the city of New Orleans itself with This definitely has a chance of becoming a true classic and hopefully the audience will continue to grow for this wonderful show.",29 out of 36 found this helpful.,,9 May 2010

I had caught a few episodes here and there and was immediately drawn in, obviously it was a great show. But in just a couple of episodes I find myself entirely drawn to this show. The depth and lengths they went to capture the true essence of New Orleans post Katrina is awe inspiring and goes without saying, eye opening. Steve Zahn and Wendell Pierce are their characters. They are standouts, but every character has a lot of depth to them, reeling from the different effects the hurricane brought to them individually and the city as a whole. And not to mention the music!! If you're a jazz or blues lover, the music alone is worth the watch. It's amazing. 10/10, HBO scores again.",36 out of 48 found this helpful.,10.0,25 April 2010
3433,Treme," A roller-coaster ride of a show, it started off slow but is now cranking into full gear now","HBO and David Simon.. Thank you!... This is truly one show about New Orleans i can fully say.. (IS NEW ORLEANS)<br/><br/>These episodes are leaving me with a feeling of ""being taking back there"" I don't know if you can get a better cast, (well you probably can)<br/><br/>I feel like this show was carefully done with love the way that there are some micro-stories that only exist in New Orleans are added, at the same-time you have to have ""BALLS!"" to be a director not from the city having various things in the script that take deliberate and constant swipes at the NOPD, the politicians, other cities and parishes, neighborhoods and people. Speaking on the micro-stories, a lot of people didn't know about the ""Black Creoles Versus the African American blacks"" existed, this story brings that out and i think it's going to come out even more as Ladonna character intensify her search for her brother. In a way it's almost a bipolar story, i feel like im on a roller-coaster ride thats never going to end.. Amazing, David Simon is the man and a genius!..<br/><br/>Last part of the 3rd Episode left me with a sick feeling in my gut and had to hold back tears, as the credits rolled i had to turn my head because i was soooooo upset!

3434,Treme, Feel more informed for having watched this,"That wasn't an attempt at being snide, in case you were wondering. I'm not from America so I have no idea what this series is to people who are from the States but not from New Orleans, but for me it was as fascinating look into a place and people I didn't know anything about going in. And while there can be said a lot of good about the narrative trope of having an outsider who works as a link to the audience by asking all the questions that they want the answers to, I personally enjoy once in a while being thrown in at the deep and watching characters going about their daily lives and routines and if there's something I don't understand I will have to infer the meaning or else just live with the mystery. Of course it isn't all colourful costumes and plastic beards. Most of the characters and themes like the story arch of the chef or the violinist could be told with any place as a background, but since it takes place here, we learn about New Orleans food and music through them. The stories of police brutality and corruption could also, sadly, have happened anywhere, but the hurricane made everything worse and more chaotic. In the end, this is a slice of life, where we follow a group of people in their home town, until we leave them, partly changed, partly the same, without any special conclusion or wrap-up. Some doors are closed other are opened and we could easily have followed them for four more years. New Orleans might be a special place, but the people in it are just people; human, fragile and endearing even with all their flaws.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,14 June 2015
3435,Treme," A masterful celebration of character, culture and community, a humanist look at life and death – and music.","David Simon's new show, a heartfelt ode to post-Katrina New Orleans and the spirit of its inhabitants, is the best thing I have seen all year. It's The Wire with music instead of drugs. Many found this very concept boring – no blood, no guns, no romantic gangsters. Too bad for them. Treme is about everyday people trying to get by, a group of flawed but beautiful characters so real that it's bordering on the uncomfortable. It's not Eastenders after the levees broke though – nothing is soppy or melodramatic about these people's lives: romance is doomed or pathetic; tragedy is latent and ordinary.<br/><br/>Wendell ""Bunk"" Pierce and Clarke ""Freemon"" Peters reprise slightly altered versions of their Wire persona, but this time as local musicians. Pierce still plays the gregarious man who's real good at what he does (used to be PO-lice, here it's playing the trombone) but likes earthy pleasures a bit too much (women &amp; booze, again). And Peters remains this charismatic, wise and brave old-timer (Morgan Freeman watch out!), as the Chief of a tribe of Mardi-Gras Indians. They are both great, but Clarke Peters once again steals the show: after transforming doll-house furniture building into a dignified past-time in The Wire, he pushes it further in Treme by making sewing pearls look like the manliest thing on earth.<br/><br/>The rest of the ensemble cast is on the same note, absolutely excellent. John Goodman is impressive playing the ungrateful role of the self- absorbed academic, who, despite having his beautiful house and life spared by the hurricane, lets his romantic love for the city draw him into a bleak depression. Khandi Alexander (yes, that sexy coroner from CSI Miami) redeems herself from all these years playing in that pathetic excuse of a show with her subtle portrayal of a bar owner looking for her missing brother in the aftermath of the hurricane. There is also the irksome but necessary figure of local white DJ Davis McAlary (played by the excitable Steve Zahn) who serves as a symbol for gentrification and the controversial issue of white appropriation of black music, also obliquely addressing the recurring criticism of David Simon as ""that middle-class white dude pretending to talk and care about the black underclass"".<br/><br/>Treme's pace is languorous, not dictated by the need to drive story lines or pile up cliffhangers. It's all about creating an atmosphere, getting a feel for the place. It is not, however, a sentimental postcard or a soppy mood piece: Simon's ambition is intact, layering the show with so many metaphorical story arcs (e.g. the great jazz debate between tradition and new jazz fleshed out by the feuding Lambreaux father and son) and socio-political observations, still pointing out the unfairness and contradictions of US society. In contrast to The Wire where institutions, like Roman gods, would crush the lives of the mere citizens, in Treme, no ones seems to care about institutions that are in even worse shape than the city anyway – symbolised by all that rotting, damp paperwork.<br/><br/>A quick word about the soundtrack: live music sounds like live music, and it's rare enough to mention – with sloppy notes, amp feedback, misunderstanding between performers, ego battles, failures to keep up, faulty equipment, etc. Whether you particularly like New Orleans jazz, southern rap, funk, second-line brass bands, Indian chants or not – the enthusiasm and freshness of the music will keep you interested (and there's a chance that you'll improve your iTunes library in the process).<br/><br/>In the long run, Treme could be considered superior to The Wire, as a masterful celebration of character, culture and community, a humanist look at life and death – and music. Let's hope Simon keeps it up with the next season.<br/><br/>ggendron.wordpress.com",13 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,19 February 2011
3436,Treme, The music alone is worth 6 stars,"I had no expectations going in with this show, as I'd seen no reviews or promo. What I encountered is a raw depiction of New Orleans with the good and bad so intertwined you'll never tear them apart. You sometimes can't even tell them apart!<br/><br/>I haven't enjoyed a drama series this much since ""Homicide: Life on the Street."" Baltimore was laid out for all to see in the same way, even though the editing style is completely different. I like the characters and actors, and they have a place on my DVR.<br/><br/>And NO COMMERCIALS!!! The ONLY reason I'm withholding one star is the overuse of profanity.

3437,Treme, A foreigner's perspective,"I've now watched quite a few episodes of this show, and I though it would be fun to give you a Swede perspective of it. Oddly enough, my own home town of Gothenburg has some things in common with New Orleans. In Sweden, Gothenburg is known as the place that is more relaxed than the rest of the country, and the inhabitants are thought to be different - almost a breed apart.<br/><br/>Luckily we haven't had the misfortune of nearly getting our town flattened out by a hurricane flood. I really admire the people of New Orleans for surviving this and beginning to rebuild their great city. They have a lot of spirit - that's for certain.<br/><br/>Treme contains a lot of music. This is both a blessing and a curse, in my opinion. My grandfather has a huge (I really mean this - its HUGE!) collection of jazz records - a lot of it is trad jazz. So in my family we have a kind of tradition of listening to jazz records. There's a lot of other evolutions of Jazz in the show like soul, funk etc. but even if I'm used to all these genres from New Orleans I don't find all the performances in the show enjoyable. During some episodes it becomes a drag to sit through music you just don't like that much. But I have to say I especially enjoy almost all of the second line, soul/funk and bounce stuff. Actually, this show led to my discovery of bounce - a style I really enjoy.<br/><br/>The story of Treme feels a lot like The Wire - it focuses on different aspects of life in the recovering city. I thought the video-blogging professor and the struggling chef were the most engaging story lines. Especially the restaurant business, in fact; it made me really want to try New Orleans cuisine. I think HBO should push for exporting this show to many other countries to bring probably much needed food tourism to New Orleans.<br/><br/>The Mardi gras indians remain inexplicable to me as a Swede. Are they some kind of mock indians? According to Wikipedia, they are... But I feel the whole thing feels stupid somehow - like a Swede dressing up in a freaky Same costume for some special holidays. I just don't get it. One also wonders what the Big Chief is actually doing for a living when he is not sewing on his costume. This whole Indian thing is of course a depiction of a certain expression of culture in New Orleans - I know this. But it seems a little too odd. what's the point? Mostly the indians remind me of lion fish.<br/><br/>It's a little unfortunate that both Det. Lester Freamon of The Wire and the Big Chief are heavily into handicrafts because it makes you associate the two... which brings me to Antoine Batiste - the trombonist. He is too much like ""The Bunk"" from The Wire in both appearance and demeanor, sometimes. But as the show wears on this gets better, I feel.<br/><br/>Despite the few negative things I have to say about the show, I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Don't be surprised if I show up looking for a special Treme-based tour of the city and the New Orleans people end up ignoring/tiredly staring at my stupidly gawking and sun-baked Nordic face as I am herded about by some tired guide...",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,7.0,6 March 2012
3438,Treme," Tried real hard to like this, but...","One caveat to this review: I've only watched about halfway into season 2.<br/><br/>I tried real hard to like Treme, but despite multiple attempts and a season and a half of investment I just couldn't. When this first debuted, I tried twice to get into it but couldn't get past the second episode. I recently started watching this on HBOGO after having watched The Wire again. With the same creator/showrunner I gave this show the benefit of the doubt, and while season 1 does improve a lot as it goes on until a brilliant final episode, the first episode of season 2 took a few tries to slog through and the improvement after that wasn't nearly as much in season 2 as in season 1 after the first couple episodes, which caused me to stop watching this.<br/><br/>The reason why it was almost a chore to get through the first couple of episodes wasn't because it was slow, which it was. Slow isn't bad by default, and I like shows that take their time layering their characters and stories. However, the problem with Treme IMO is that the characters are not likable or compelling.<br/><br/>By likable I don't mean the kind where the writers manipulate the audience into rooting for them. But there has to be something about them that either makes me care what happens to them, good or bad. Or something about their situation that makes me want to see what happens to them.<br/><br/>But what the characters that were presented to me after the first couple of episodes were: a part-time trombone player who tries to chump the people around him, an Indian chief/handyman who killed or at least tried to kill a kid for stealing his tools, an annoyingly outspoken musician/DJ who has an overblown sense of his entertainment value and a coke addict street musician who hits women when he's angry. Characters need not be nice or pretty on screen to be likable or compelling, but after a season and a half the way I would describe these characters is not that much different than the descriptions just offered.<br/><br/>The other characters are for the most part ones who you would like in real life but who, really, have no basis for being on screen. The closest characters to being having any dramatic basis or being likable/compelling are the bar owner who lost her brother in Katrina and who subsquently gets raped as a result of the dissolution of New Orleans, and an outspoken English professor/activist who then commits suicide that we surmise is from the aftermath of Katrina. In season 2 we are introduced to two new main characters: a carpetbagger from Houston who makes millions from the reconstruction and a police lieutenant who ruffles feathers in his department by caring about his city. Neither are stories that compelled me to watch further.<br/><br/>There are some great actors here, the directing and writing of each episode is solid, and the final episode of season 1 is a beautifully made collage. However, there is a reason why fictional TV shows and moviesdon't follow real life people: we're boring. Even the most most raw, gritty and realistic TV shows, such as the Wire or Six Feet Under, distill real life into characters and stories which are compelling.<br/><br/>Sometimes when watching this show I felt as if I were watching a show whose primary aim was to subsidize musicians who the vast majority of people have never heard of, or to help bring attention and revenue to a city in need of attention and revenue. While those are worthy goals, it simply does not make for good entertainment.<br/><br/>Also, Davis Macaleary, the part time musician/DJ, is probably one of the more annoying characters to hit the small screen in recent times.<br/><br/>Furthermore... if you're not a huge fan of jazz or blues, then be warned: in every episode there are multiple scenes of people playing music, mostly real musicians who aren't even characters in the story. The scenes are basically the camera watching them documentary style sans any drama. I like jazz or blues but after hours of watching people play with absolutely no dramatic purpose, combined with a lack of any likable or compelling characters/stories, I tuned off.",25 out of 41 found this helpful.,4.0,14 September 2012
3439,Treme, I wish you weren't allowed to write a review for a new show until after the end of the first season,"And yet here I am writing one anyways for the midway point of the first season. I must say after watching the first five episodes of Treme and watching the first five episodes of The Wire I actually like Treme better. In the first five episodes of The Wire only 2 main things are established basically crime and financial failure on a city wide scale. However, in the first five episodes of Treme a city at war with its self and its identity yet still trying to hang on. The cast was well picked and it doesn't feel like their acting it feels like their living trying to rebuild the city around them both physically and culturally. Already in the first 5 episodes you have rich character development. This is the best representation of what happened in the immediate aftermath of Katrina. I haven't even talked about the music yet because thats a whole other issue. I love the storyline with the chief! However, I am not wild about the storyline with the two street musicians (boy and girl), I just don't care where its going maybe because its the least believable part. I mean one junkie dude from the Netherlands and a classically trained rich chick who just decide to leave their comfortable lives in Europe and New York together only to find happiness in the squaller of Katrina? I mean I'm all for creative story lines but man it seems like their characters are just written in to get more white women to watch the show because their story is soooooooo romantic. By far this show has the best music I've ever hear of any non-animated series hands down. Love New Orleans jazz! Love it! By the way whats with the bad reviews from all the soar limeys? Do you not like New Orleans or just the fact that there isn't enough chalk lines? This show has the meat in it to match The Wire and maybe top it.

They infused great actors with local actors. They used local restaurants and bars, they named real politicians, and real musicians like Trombone Shorty, Kermit Ruffins and even the great Dr John!<br/><br/>The plot is that of post Katrina New Orleans and the rebuild, struggles, political corruption and resurgence of my wonderful city. They dramatized real events like the buying up of storm damaged houses at cheap rates knowing the government was going to build a hospital there and they'd pay a pretty penny for those lots.

Because that is the true nature of life, especially in places like New Orleans. A city where most of the folk are dirt poor, where the crime rate is going through the roof; and despite all the earlier promises of aid made to them following the devastation of their city by Hurricane Katrina, they have effectively been deserted by the Federal government.

I think too many David Simon admirers wanted to love this show just like ""The Wire"". It's a very different show in many ways. It's definitely watchable most of the time, but it's not great, and we shouldn't feel the need to expect it to be either. It gets much too pompous and self-important at times, I'm particularly tired of hearing how ""special"" New Orleans is and that we should all just accept it and bow down. Many of our cities have their own unique qualities and personalities forged over hundreds of years, New Orleans isn't unique in this way. My biggest problem is that I could overlook these misgivings if some of the characters were more engaging, but many I just don't have a vested interest in.

3444,Treme, Let's be honest.,"Let me start by saying that I don't hate this show. It just bores me to tears. I loved The Wire and it's pacing. This show tries so hard to duplicate it but falls painfully short.<br/><br/>Treme is not without its good moments and charm, but at least 20 minutes per 50 minute episode is just music with no content. Listening to Jazz music, dancing, and having a good time is awesome... especially in New Orleans. Watching people do it on TV gets old after about the 3rd episode.<br/><br/>Also, this show has an incredibly real feeling to it. You believe that all these characters really exist and they are superbly cast. There is one problem. Reality, for the most part, is mind numbingly dull. There are very few really dramatic moments contained in the show. Almost every story takes no figuring out. They all run the most boring and realistic course that you can think of. <br/><br/>Again, I don't hate it. I just think people need to be honest about how good a piece of work is before they start giving it a free pass because of who made it and that it's different from most of the garbage out there.",23 out of 44 found this helpful.,7.0,21 June 2010
3445,Treme, Another David Simon gem,"Watching ""The Wire"" made it mandatory that I watch ""Treme."" David Simon (The Wire and Treme's show runner) is a genius. We were in New Orleans when this was first being advertised - and I thought ""what a bore."" Just goes to show you how wrong first impressions can be. But you do have to hang in there with it.<br/><br/>Your initial introduction to the characters is not always positive, but by the end you love almost all of them (with the obvious exception of the unbelievably corrupt and sadistic New Orleans Police Department, and the opportunistic, corrupt developers, bankers and politicians.) At least Ray Nagin gets called as the ridiculous, corrupt crook that he was (and still is, as far as I know.)<br/><br/>Naturally there is Bush bashing throughout and even more predictably hysteria with Obama's election in 2008.<br/><br/>The characters and their stories take a while to develop, but once they arrive, they are compelling. The acting and writing is superb. Finally I have seen Kim Dickens in a role I loved as the N.O. chef who epitomizes the struggles that her city has throughout her career. (As far as I am concerned - skip her other roles - especially in the putrid ""Fear the Walking Dead."")<br/><br/>Kim, along with Melissa Leo (the lawyer who will not give up trying to expose corruption in the NOPD) and Khandi Alexander (a bar owner who has a world of trouble through the show) make a trio of the strongest and most likable women I have seen in a drama. This is achieved without a hint of political correctness - which was very much appreciated.<br/><br/>John Goodman has a short, but very impactful, role as Melissa Leo's husband. His short role in the drama had to be due to other acting commitments. His departure was a loss for the show.<br/><br/>Be prepared for a lot of music. The back story of ""Treme"" is certain residents' quest to keep the musical heritage and traditions of New Orleans alive in the face of government and business which are doing their best to rebuild N.O. in the image they want to see. The music plays a critical role in that story line - and in fact becomes almost a character in the drama. I do not like jazz, but after hearing so much of it on the show I have come to appreciate and enjoy 'New Orleans' jazz. The street musicians are especially engaging and entertaining. The other thing to be aware of is the vast majority of the songs written through 2/3 of the drama were about New Orleans and Katrina.<br/><br/>The cast of actors looks like a ""who's who"" from ""The Wire"" with seven actors crossing over. The best one is Wendall Pierce who played ""Bunk"" Moreland in ""The Wire"" and surpasses that role in ""Treme"" as Antoine Batiste. He is the trombone player who plays an important role with the young people in the high school band he leads and in his family. He becomes one of the key characters in the story and elicits great admiration, in spite of some of his flaws.<br/><br/>Although this is not for everyone, but if you give it a fair shot I think it will grow on you - it certainly is worth it.

3446,Treme, most enjoyment in front of the t.v. yet,"I first traveled to New Orleans in 05 prior to Katrina. I fell in love with the people, the music, the food, the history, and the list goes on. I have since returned 3 times and have observed the changes and spoken to many locals about the struggles they have encountered in reestablishing there lives. This series hits the nail on the head in this regards. The characters are real and I mean even the fictional ones. I know that many of the roles are based on real people and events. The emotional roller coaster that is Treme is an event that that no one should miss seeing. I enjoyed The Wire , The Sopranos,and other H.B.O. series but this may be the best.",9 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,16 June 2010
3447,Treme, Season finale elevates this series to GREAT,"I've enjoyed this series from the start. Of course it's been difficult to see the destruction of perhaps the country's greatest city reflected in the characters' lives. In spite of the effective use of music as the continual pulse of the show, I felt most of the middle episodes lagged. But the season finale catapulted the series, in my estimation, to the stratosphere. Incredibly moving and richly metaphorical, this is one of the greatest hours of television I've ever seen. Now,I can't wait for Season 2.<br/><br/>ALL of the actors are terrific, but Melissa Leo stands out. She's likely the greatest ""mature"" American actress working today.<br/><br/>But Khandi Alexander's scary plastic surgery froze her ability to express. Faces are the essential instruments of actors, and when you do facelift or botox or whatever she had, they no longer register as human.

3448,Treme," Not the Wire, But Worthy","It took me a while to warm up to Treme, but after watching all but the final episode, I must confess that it grows on you as you begin to care about the characters. Sure the annoying, but expected, meme about the disaster being Bush's fault is there, but Nagin and the rest of the endemically corrupt politicians and citizens do not get much of a pass. I even like Davis, though Steve Zahn's (does he play any other kinds of roles) arrested adolescent can be tiresome and is pretty much the epitome of the best and worst of NO. Love of fun and music, but no desire to do the unpleasant work necessary to pay for the party. The only character I detest is the greasy, selfish,no-talent Eurotrash Sonny. Every week I yell at Annie to kick his arrogant butt to the curb. I never thought I would love a David Simon character more than Lester Freamon in ""The Wire"" but Clarke Peters has made Albert Lambreaux an iconic American figure. A completely different man than Freamon, which proves how talented Peters is, Albert has the same core of integrity that forces him to take risks solely to stay true to himself. I hate summer and humidity, but I would go to the tavern and sew beads and feathers on his Chief suit in a heartbeat. Khandi Alexander, Melissa Leo and Kim Dickens play strong Southern women who would be cliché except that the writing and acting is so fine, they are real and will break your heart and make you yell, ""Go, girl"" at least once per show. Wendell Pierce exudes the charm of a scoundrel who would like to be a better man, but just gets distracted along the way. And John Goodman, a native of the city, does not seem to be acting at all. His profane rant that goes viral on Youtube is now a popular phrase in our house (we have no children). The music is sublime, and the NO Convention Bureau should include DVDs of the series when it comes out because the music and spirit that make the city the legend that it is are celebrated in every scene. The story can be extremely enraging, as the devastation and chaos and corruption keep thwarting the rebirth of this magical city, and the frustration of its citizens is palpable. But Simon does not let them off the hook, either. A contractor from Texas who comes to fix a roof that has been under construction for months with a local guy articulates the main problem in a nutshell when he says, ""no, offense ma'am, but y'all have a defective work ethic.""",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,,17 June 2010

I have enough of my reality show called life - I want to relax in front of a fantasy story where good beats evil and every bad person gets punished. Do not let these ""reality shows"" followers dictate what to watch in TV. I think the story is fresh and is a mix of Miami Vice, Body of Proof or Forever - which I loved also. Give the show a chance. The actors are really good and credible. The writers really wrote a good play. If you like mystery movies this show is for you.

3451,Rosewood," Rosewood, Give it a chance, it's a guilty pleasure...","I enjoyed this show because it is lighthearted, glossy and colorful! I watch plenty of darker shows, so this is refreshing with it's retro whodunit treatments. It reminds me of the show Glades, which may have been a little more or less cheesy, but it's very watchable, IMO! After watching Gotham, Quantico, Scandal, HTGWM, and shows on Netflix and Hulu like Tyrant, Ray Donovan, Justified, Hand of God (Amazon), and so many others, I can greatly indulge this show! I love Morris Chestnut, he did a great job on Nurse Jackie and the detective Villa plays nicely with his Rosewood (Rosie) character. The plot is by numbers, and the premise somewhat incredulous if you're seeking true crime reality-like TV. But, since this show is so bright and corny, I hope viewers continue to tune in because there's no shortage of dark TV or grisly shows or decent comedies. We're in another golden age of television, and the choices are awesome! I say this after cutting my cable cord, and have now watched more interesting and enjoyable television than I ever did when I paid for monster cable. Rosewood may not be for everyone, but it's definitely for those who want some silliness and escapism like myself (scenic views, the ocean, beaches, palm trees)!",44 out of 57 found this helpful.,7.0,29 September 2015

The overall content and dynamic are exceptional. Dr.Rosewood(M.Chestnut)would be an even better character if there are more episodes that would involve more background for other characters(Mitchie,Annalise,Etc.)would be great as well.

They don't just show the ""pretty side"", it is warts and all. The medical facts hold up, when you cross reference them to medical texts and facts on-line, things are not sugar coated to make it easier for the viewers to understand. Dr. Rosewood does that for you with a bedside manner I wish more doctors had today. I hope this show is not canceled, it shows both African Americans and Latinos in a truly positive light. It is showing that everyone can attain the goals they strive for, it may not be easy - but you can get there",11 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,8 March 2017
3457,Rosewood, The Hunky Quincy is a Dud,"I wanted to like Rosewood because Morris Chestnut is an actor who could carry a breezy police procedural, but this pilot was a drudge. A charming character telling people he's charming all the time isn't actually charming. Rosewood's love affair with himself, which included multiple times where he pointed to his own image on a gigantic billboard, left me feeling like the grumpy-pants cop played by Anthony Michael Hall.<br/><br/>I know pilots always lay it on thick when introducing the main characters, but Rosewood and Jaina Lee Ortiz's Detective Villa laid out their entire life stories to each other with the subtlety of a sledgehammer.<br/><br/>The crime solved in this episode was exceptionally bland for a pilot.

3459,Rosewood, Saccharine television...,"Rosewood is one of those saccharine series the US, in particular, does so well. <br/><br/>Its washed clean of any real depth of characterization. Instead, what you're presented with are bleached, politically correct, caricatures. <br/><br/>The main character Dr. Beaumont Rosewood Jr., a private pathologist is a pretty near perfect. He's smart, handsome and has very little in the way of the normal flaws, you would expect to find in a real human being. He's annoying upbeat and never phased. His only vice seems to be driving his bright yellow muscle car too fast. <br/><br/>For me this series looks a lot like the kind of aggravating nonsense politicians churn out around election time. You know the stuff, chirpy, irritatingly optimistic human stereotypes who love their mundane jobs and for some inexplicable reason get all excited about sleazy mainstream politics. <br/><br/>My advice, give Rosewood a pass. The acting is reasonable but its so constrained by the generally sugary tone of this series it really makes little impact.

The story line was shallow and predictable. This show came off as a marriage between a seventies disco documentary and a twenty first century forensic science field trip. Morris Chestnut played the stereotypical lead role well, unfortunately there was no way to develop the character that did not come off as banal and trite. Jaina Lee Ortiz was totally unbelievable as the ""tough cop with a chip on her shoulder"" kicking bad guy butts all over the place. The ""lively banter"" between the characters was sophomoric at best.

Amazing how incompetent other professionals are.<br/><br/>The attempt to generate sexual tension between the leads was just not there.<br/><br/>I doubt this show makes it past episode 4.

3463,Rosewood, This was painful to watch,"I like Morris Chesnut, but this show will most likely last one season, or be pulled after several episodes. First and foremost, it is not believable. A handsome single forensics Dr. and a beautiful single detective, both in Miami most likely does not exist in the real world. There is too many scenes that are playful. The gay couple is getting played out, not to mention a gay couple that is interracial; I guess producers wanted to cover all bases. It would have been more productive to have Morris play the detective, a muscular forensics Dr., walking around diagnosing marks on people and figuring out missing pieces to an investigation by looking at someone pour a drink, is not complementing his physique; he needs more action. Jessica Ortiz would have been better suited to play the forensics Dr.; I am not trying to be sexist, the storyline has to be believable, that's what makes it painful to watch.",29 out of 58 found this helpful.,1.0,24 September 2015

I hope the writers have enough material to get the plot going good enough to get the series renewed next season. The biggest gripe I have with the show has to do with the yellow Pontiac GTO on the show. Love the car but in episode 2 they said it was a 1969 GTO but it is actually a 1968.

3467,Rosewood, Typical but engaging and cool...,"I will admit, upon watching the trailer, I was skeptical of Rosewood, however, I was interested. I loved seeing Morris Chesnut in a role where he really shines. The fact that he's gorgeous is not relative to his character, an overly optimistic, happy-go-lucky pain in Villa's butt.I didn't feel like that was overly played, some viewers Posed his character as cocky because he mentions himself in quirky ways, but it's actually a play on his sarcastic comedy. The show in and of itself is nothing to write home about, a basic pairing of mixed gender characters with a love/hate relationship (that will more than likely veer into a romantic direction- let us all pray not) who want to avoid admitting the obvious fact that they work well together and are made for each other. This has been done repeatedly and frankly beat over viewers heads when mixed with the typical cop, CSI drama. However, the mixture of Villa and Rosie's characters are nice and their acting both together and individually is growing on me with every episode.I love the positive family atmosphere and feel that all the supporting actors do well with each other and at holding their own. I feel the show is a refreshing break from the dark, high-paced, slapstick comedy, reality hungry barrage of television we've been reduced to. It's clean, it's funny, it's cultural and it's light. That deserves a well done in my book! Personal hopes for the show: they keep Villa's and Rosie's relationship friendly. They bring back Nicole Ari Parker as his love interest (that was a lame excuse for a break up!), they continue to advance the cases they work on to be more interesting.",9 out of 16 found this helpful.,8.0,19 November 2015

This considering Morris is living with a very serious lifelong congenital disability; the young detective is recently widowed and captain is extremely unhealthy. And add to this a very supportive set of parents for Morris and his sister/coworker about to marry her same sex partner....Well, all I can do is wait for the next episode week to week.

3469,Rosewood, A GEM of a show!!!,"Not sure I understand why so many negative reviews. Rosewood has all the makings of a hit TV show. This stellar cast creates believable and lovable characters that are more than mere caricatures. These characters have depth and as the season goes on, they become more developed and you learn more about these dynamic people. <br/><br/>The play and chemistry between Chestnut's Rosewood and Ortiz's Villa is palpable and fun to watch. These characters are evidently perfect for each other, and I hope the writers will continue to have them play off of each other. Dennis and Konkle are simply a pleasure to watch on the screen. They provide this show with another meant-for- each other dynamic duo and it's great to watch smart, funny, sassy women like Pippy and TMI. The show is more about love and family than just our two leads. I cannot say how much I've enjoyed and laughed at Lombardozzi's Captain Hornstock. He's a true gem and a necessity on this show. As for Toussaint's Donna Rosewood, I simply adore this character and woman. She is the glue that holds them all together. <br/><br/>I am definitely along for the ride on this series.

3470,Rosewood, This series could have been excellent.,"I'm basing this review upon season 1. I don't have a TV and Netflix hasn't aired season 2 yet. Rosewood is a series wrecked by incompetent writing. It has an excellent cast and has the legs to be a very enjoyable detective/CSI-type series. Instead of going with and perfecting that good idea, the writers choked it with all of the attributes of a soap opera. They seem obsessed with Greek tragedies and saddle so many of the characters with nearly irrecoverable flaws that keep popping out of the woodwork.<br/><br/>Viewers didn't need to get involved with all of the on-and-off dysfunctionality of Rosewood's family. He didn't need all of those health problems, continually foreshadowing impending death. His company didn't have to be his family. He didn't need to hire another person in his field who was bright but kept up the immaturity of making inappropriate passes at women, and gay women to boot.<br/><br/>Worst of all was burdening the character of his police counterpart and potential lover with an inability to make up her mind and commit. She kept basing her relationships on her own prejudices instead of what others are actually feeling. Over and over, instead of asking what others think, she *decides* what they think and bases her actions on that deeply flawed process. That made the relationship ineffective and hurtful to both parties and continually frustrated the viewer.<br/><br/>The writers need to get their act together and decide what they want, a silly afternoon soap opera or a mature evening drama that does a good job with its plot and ignores all of the unnecessary complications.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,5.0,17 July 2017
