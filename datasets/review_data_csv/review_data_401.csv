0,My Name Is Earl, Jason Lee is perfect in this show and it was great!,"My husband and I are great fans of Jason Lee's movie roles. We were really looking forward to this show and it totally delivered. You know a show is good if the funniest jokes aren't wasted in the trailer. Funny, well-written with great timing and direction. I instantly set my DVR to record all episodes to make sure I don't miss a single one. I thought the premise was very unique and while Earl appears to be a stereotype, there are unplumbed depths. The peripheral characters are a hoot, the choice of music also elicited quite a few laughs.<br/><br/>I am hoping the rest of the season holds up to the extremely well-done pilot. I think this really could be a classic, besides we have the promise of 258 possible episodes!<br/><br/>12/27 Footnote: The show has exceeded all my expectations and I am happy to see Earl adding to his list - so we could have inifinite episodes - yippeee.",156 out of 175 found this helpful.,,20 September 2005
1,My Name Is Earl," Finally, funny TV!","I'm not much of a TV watcher anymore, as most stuff these days doesn't appeal to me, especially the whole ""reality TV"" trend. It's not often that a show comes along that is original in concept (or, at least in presentation!), and that makes me laugh all the way through.<br/><br/>Having said this, we caught this show on the TiVo, and it's just plain funny. It's more for mature audiences, and if you grew up in redneck USA (like I did) in the 80's, it'll leave you in stitches. Plus, there is a bit of a message presented as well. ""Do good deeds to others, and good things will happen to you."" In a sort of bizarre, twisted way, you could call this the ""Kung Fu"" of the 00's. <br/><br/>Lee does an excellent job of narration and acting, and the rest of the cast is pretty much perfect at their roles, even in the first episode. I had never really heard of him until his (quite good) performance in ""The Incredibles"", but his acting is really impressive.<br/><br/>It's funny. Best stuff I've seen in years. Watch it and see for yourself.",101 out of 112 found this helpful.,,23 September 2005
2,My Name Is Earl," pilot was fantastic, can it continue...","OK, it was only one episode, but it was very funny. Jason Lee, best known to me, from Mumford and most Kevin Smith movies, was perfect. His dumb brother, Randy, played by Kevin Smith alum, Ethan Suplee was fun as well. Jaime Pressly oddly was the best cast. ALthough I believed the brothers were redneck bums, down on there luck, house breaking into losers...Jaime was the best suited to her character. She was picture perfect as the just a little too old, old time beauty queen tramp. She was a blast. In fact all the characters had features of them that stood out. I'm marking Tuesday night at 8 pm on my calender. This show (if one show is any indication...) is a keeper.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 or better.<br/><br/>update...<br/><br/>Season One is just ending, and yes, the show chugged along nicely throughout the season. Too bad it's already changed nights (to Thursday opposite CSI) but that's a small price to pay for a funny show like this one. Here's to a great second season, cheers.",144 out of 164 found this helpful.,10.0,21 September 2005
3,My Name Is Earl, Finally something original,"I loved the show........but what I loved most was finally seeing something that showed some semblance of an original thought. Time will tell how good or bad this show is but I think it is off to a great start..Almost every show that debuts today is simply the repackaging of a previous idea or concept.My name is Earl is an obvious attempt to provide something different and hopefully far better than todays traditional boiler-plate sitcom model.Expect that this show will break new ground in television and someday will be mentioned with other shows like ""Married with Children "" or"" All in the Family"" that stretched the limits while showcasing the dysfunctional direction of family life in todays America.",87 out of 98 found this helpful.,,21 September 2005
4,My Name Is Earl, FINALLY! Been hungering for something fresh and new like this!,"I haven't gotten into anything new as far as a live action series since Seinfeld went off the air. Most comedy series are lame, not funny and predictable with laugh tracks.. Its like, ""Oh, I was supposed to laugh at that?"". Finally with ""Earl"" there is something new to get into watching again with an original idea. This show is very funny, has great characters, scenes, directing and doesn't prompt you to laugh with a laugh track. Jason Lee was on Leno a week or so ago pluggin his show and is really funny, and talks much the same as his character. Guess thats how he delves into it so easy. I hope this show sticks around for a while. After years of Reality TV and a bunch of played out stupid comedy series this is a welcome treat!",121 out of 139 found this helpful.,,2 October 2005
5,My Name Is Earl," Great new show! If you like the Coen brothers films, you might love this","I saw the first episode of ""My Name Is Earl"" last night, (9 p.m. on NBC) and I just had to plug it. I thought it was brilliant - wonderfully cast, written, and directed. I hope the show is a hit and keeps it up.<br/><br/>If the Coen brothers wrote and directed a TV sitcom, it could be very much like this show.<br/><br/>The premise is simple: Earl (the very likable Jason Lee, often seen in Kevin Smith films, and whose on screen demeanor sometimes reminds me of Chevy Chase in his youthful prime) is Earl, a small-time raggedy thief who snags a $100,000 winning lottery ticket. Seconds later he's mowed down by a car, and the ticket floats away in the breeze. While recovering in the hospital, doped up on morphine, he watches a TV show with MTV host Carson Daly talking about doing good deeds so that good things will happen to you...and he comes up with the the idea of repairing his mess of a life by making a list of all the people he's harmed in the past, tracking them down one by one, and making amends however he can.<br/><br/>When Earl briefly thinks of backing out on his plan, the ticket miraculously floats back seemingly out of nowhere..inspiring him to keep up the good work. Karma is a funny thing, as the tagline says.<br/><br/>The inimitable evil vixen Jaime Pressley (as his trashy ex-wife Joy) is part of a great supporting cast, and the superior writing and directing of the show gives it a comedic, quirky quality that reminded my husband and myself of Coen brothers' films such as ""Raising Arizona"". I hope the show can keep the quality up as the season progresses. The bar's been set pretty high with this first episode.<br/><br/>Anyway, ""My Name Is Earl"" is on NBC on Tuesdays at 9:00. Give it a whirl, and let's keep this one on the air, as long as the creators can maintain the quality of its premiere. As long as it keeps its sharp wit and avoids sinking into maudlin sentimentality, it should stay a winner.",142 out of 165 found this helpful.,,21 September 2005
6,My Name Is Earl, This Show is So Good That I Expect It To Be Cancelled,"I rarely watch sitcoms any more because they are normally both inane and indistinguishable from one another. This show may actually induce me to watch it on a regular basis. If you liked ""Raising Arizona"", you just might like ""My Name Is Earl"". After I watched the first episode I did an online search to find out who the creative forces were behind it. In doing so I stumbled into a review that described Earl as the illegitimate son of Nicholas Cage in ""Raising Arizona"". That just about nails the character. In In fact, while recounting the season opener to a friend who had missed it, I nearly called Earl, Hi. Catch it before it's gone. If you didn't think the first episode was brilliant, then this show is just not for you.",87 out of 100 found this helpful.,,26 September 2005
7,My Name Is Earl, One of this seasons Best new shows,"I am a Jason Lee fan and when I saw the advertisements for his show, I was a little skeptical. I thought it was going to be all hype and not funny. But,I watched the premiere last night and I couldn't stop laughing. You have to understand the humor to get the jokes, but it is so worth it. I think this is going to be a huge hit for NBC and Lee. The cast was awesome and a great combination. It is nice to see Jason Lee and Ethan Suplee on the screen together again.If you get the chance watch this show. You won't be sorry. It is also followed by another great show The Office. I think they work well together. Tuesday nights are better than they used to be.I hope that NBC keeps this show around for several seasons.",77 out of 89 found this helpful.,,21 September 2005
8,My Name Is Earl, good stuff,"This show was really funny. Jason Lee kills me any time anything comes out of his mouth in this show. His character is like Brodie from Mallrats all grown up. Ethan Slupe looks like he's shed a few pounds, but he's also GREAT in his role. These small town rednecks that everyone in town probably crosses the street when they see these 2 brothers walking their way on the same sidewalk. Wise cracks in true Lee style, with his goofy smile-almost as funny as the punchline to most of the jokes on the show. It's almost as good as if Kevin Smith himself directed &amp; produced the show himself I hope this show continues to be as funny as the pilot &amp; stays on the air for years and years to come.",66 out of 78 found this helpful.,,22 September 2005
9,My Name Is Earl, No Words to say!... Way beyond AWESOME!,"This show is way beyond awesome... <br/><br/>The Show has everything that a good show need... Comedy, Action, Suspense, Horror, Romance...<br/><br/>The best part is the suspense maintained throughout each episode from starting to end.<br/><br/>The cast chosen is perfect, their role is perfect, the acting is perfect.

10,My Name Is Earl, Wonderful show,"I began watching this show mostly for Jason Lee, who is a very talented and funny actor. I really thought that the plot would would only allow for maybe 20 episodes before the premise became used up. It is now on the third season and seems to be keeping strong. For the most part, the show sticks with its main premise. It is nice to see a comedy that doesn't all take place within 4 rooms like many shows on the air today. I think the constant introduction of new and clever characters really keeps it interesting. These are brought in order for there problems to be solve so that Earl can cross them off his list and move on to helping the next guy. It is unclear if the plot was originally thought up to allow a new character almost every episode, but it is really to its benefit, and the viewers.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,16 April 2008
11,My Name Is Earl, Simply Underrated,One of the funniest shows in recent years!! This show is severely underrated! Every episode had me laughing so much. Earl &amp; Randy are the perfect duo.

12,My Name Is Earl," A genuinely funny, surprisingly intelligent, and hectically chaotic ride through the streets of Camden County","If somebody were to tell you that My Name is Earl was a show about dim- witted people doing crazy things, well, they wouldn't exactly be wrong. But it isn't the whole truth, either. When you make a show that centres around dim-witted people in a small town doing crazy things to pass the time, the general conclusion people would jump to would be that the show would be cliché and stupid. Who could blame them, that always appears to be the case. But My Name is Earl isn't only not stupid and cliché, it is absolutely brilliant, charming, genuinely hilarious, and loaded with twists and turns worthy of M. Night Shyamalan himself. Nothing is ever what it seems, and just when you think everything turned out peachy, a bigger, much more dastardly problem arises for our fiend-turned-friend.<br/><br/>The premise of My Name is Earl is a show that takes place in the small town of Camden County from the perspective of a petty con artist, Earl J. Hickey, who finds himself in an accident after winning a hundred thousand dollars in a lottery. Waking up in a hospital, he reflects on his life and comes to an epiphany; in a word, Karma. Realizing that his life is terrible due to him being a generally terrible person, Earl plans to turn his life around and writes a list of all the bad things that he's ever done, ranging from little things like bullying some kids in his days in school, to huge, punishable-by-law crimes, and hopes to make up for it along the way.<br/><br/>It's a simple premise, but one that is full of possibilities, and Greg Garcia never ceases to surprise the audience through the course of the series. Mix the chaos that ensues with a never ending stream of colourful, charismatic, and most importantly, likable characters, and you've definitely got something. All the characters in My Name is Earl are hardly forgettable, and each of them have an interesting twist on classic clichés that let them shine with originality despite having a certain deliberate lack thereof. Even the least likable of characters, the ones whom the cast want you to hate, have an incredibly human side to them that you will soon discover as you watch the show that will make them carve a special place in your heart.<br/><br/>It also goes well with the acting, which, while it sadly won't win any Oscars (the acting is purposefully lack-luster), has a certain childish charm that really brings out the character in an almost theatrical light that will connect you with the stage that is Camden County as a theatre production may connect you with the characters of Shakespeare's work at a live performance. Jaime Pressly, for example, shines as an over-the- top, selfish, heartless ""dumb blonde"" that is Joy Turner, but there are more than enough times when with that same childish nature of the casts acting she shows a surprisingly massive level of depth beneath her otherwise paper-thin character, partly due to the sharp writing and character design, partly because of her enthusiasm for the role, and with it, takes the stage every time she makes an appearance in each episode. Each character in the cast is equally ""shallow-deep"" and likable, coating their enthusiastic role playing with a childlike nature that makes this show have you feeling young at heart, even if the humour can be a little... mature at times.<br/><br/>In addition to the unbelievable plot twist with each episode, the writing is sharp, witty, simplistic, straight to the point, and a little playful as well. Despite having an excellent sense of humour, My Name is Earl tends to have a few vulgar jokes in it, as well. But unlike a majority of the jokes in the later episodes of Family Guy and shows alike, no matter how vulgar it gets, it tends to be somehow tasteful, and never feels out of place, save for one or two per season. Even though most of the show seems to be a situational comedy which focuses mostly on events rather than the words being said, when Earl, himself, begins narrating and tries to make sense of the impossible events that occur to the best of his abilities, or when his loyal brother Randy interjects into a conversation with a ridiculous statement, hilarity is guaranteed.<br/><br/>My Name is Earl is, without a doubt, among the funniest and full of heart shows to ever air on TV, anywhere, and you'd truly be missing out by skipping this one. It's truly a shame that where other dime-a-dozen TV shows continue to overstay their welcome, My Name is Earl hardly had the chance to wipe their feet at the door before bidding ""goodbye.""",9 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,27 July 2012
13,My Name Is Earl, Looks like this show is going to have a good run!,"""My Name Is Earl"" is one of the funniest new shows of 2005! ""My Name Is Earl"" is about this guy named Earl (Jason Lee) who is a redneck and one day he wins $100,000 off a lottery ticket and then decides to make a list of things that he did wrong from his past with his new realization about how much his life sucks. So I think this show will probably be a hit and go for a few seasons since I'm sure that every episode is going to be where he is checking off his list and making sure that his life gets better.

14,My Name Is Earl, Great comedy!,"This, of all shows, deserves a renewal. I know time has passed, weight's been gained and age has set in, but it can be done.

15,My Name Is Earl," The oddest, most unexpected, and flat out best of a once-tired subgenre","""My Name is Earl"" has some unlikely ancestors. It belongs to a genre of television comedy/drama best described as ""Good works shows"". Popular in the eighties, when ""Highway to Heaven"" and ""Quantum Leap"" topped the charts, these shows concerned a normal, everyday guy or gal who, usually at the inspiration of some amorphous Higher Power, travelled from place to place attempting to make things Right. These shows drew their audiences in with their optimism, their conviction and their reminder that, however bad the world may seem, we have it in us all to make it better. Naturally, once the 90s dawned, they withered on the vine.<br/><br/>So now we're in the 2000s. How do you draw an audience jaded by the horrors around them back to the form? By taking the its conventions and completely subverting them. Instead of your average whitebread middle class straight edge, ala Scott Bacula or Patrick Duffy, you have Earl, a scuzzy, scummy lowlife with the kind of handlebar mustache that always makes one think of dead wives in the cellar. One day, realising that his life sucks, he decides to go on a quest to right all the wrongs he committed in his life. This is, as you might imagine, a fairly daunting prospect. Instead of God or some other vaguely Judeo-Christian concept, you have what Earl calls ""karma"", though it has little to do with karma as Hindus or Buddhists would understand it. It's more like the stalking Death in ""Final Destination"", only armed with a custard pie and a hand-buzzer instead of a chainsaw. If Earl does something good, he, and usually hordes of other people through a complex Rube-Goldberg unravelling of events, is rewarded. If he does bad, karma ensures Earl has a suitably slapstick comeuppance. Initially it seems to only idly look in his direction. But once Earl takes up his quest, the gloves come off. He is, as he puts it, ""karma's bitch."" At one point, having decided to neglect his duties in favour of romance, he finds himself at karma's mercy, crashing through a seemingly endless series of pratfalls before falling victim to a swarm of bees.<br/><br/>What makes this show work is that, while it never loses its moral compass, it isn't preachy or condescending. The characters inhabit the world we know, not some idealised, processed version of it. Not everyone, even white knight Earl, is necessarily likable. Earl doesn't get all virtuous about his job; he does it because he thinks it's the right thing to do, even if it means helping his repugnant ""family""- his loathsome ex-wife Joy (brilliantly played by Jaime Pressely), her layabout boyfriend and their two kids. Even Randy, Earl's endearingly dim brother, who acts as the Laurel to Earl's Hardy, (""I'm gonna ask the judge to smash this walnut with his judge hammer. I bet it explodes like a death star"") is given to moments of selfishness.<br/><br/>The scripts are wonderfully creative and have a knack for undermining expectations. In one instance, decides to apologise to the mustachioed girl he made fun of in junior high who he hasn't seen in years. When she opens her front door, cliché demands she be heart-stoppingly beautiful. Instead she has a full beard. ""I tried waxing,"" she says. That's what works. The characters are human. This show doesn't give us people to look up to; it gives us people we could actually be.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,29 June 2007
16,My Name Is Earl, Awesome show,"I watched the pilot episode of MNIE when it debuted and was hooked on the show ever since it.

Earl seeing Carson Daly on TV talking about karma and saying that good things happen to good people. So Earl determines to turn his life around. He makes a list of every bad thing he's ever done.<br/><br/>Other characters in the show are Joy who is Earl's ex-wife, crabman aka Darnell who works at the Crabshack and ends up marrying Joy and Catalina who's the housekeeper at the hotel that Earl and Randy live in and also a dancer at Club Chubby.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,5 February 2012
17,My Name Is Earl," Quirky, different, and excellent","At a passing glance, My Name Is Earl would look like a show about a group of criminal rednecks. But there is far more to it than that.<br/><br/>Earl Hickey is nothing short of a thug, who steals for himself and his brother, Randy. When he gets a lottery ticket from a petrol station, he wins $100000, but is promptly hit by a car. During his stay in hospital, he sees a television interview, where the guest talks about karma. Earl then writes a list of everything bad he's done, and sets out to make it all right.<br/><br/>My Name Is Earl, at a pass, would seem to be a low brow comedy, but it is far deeper than that. Earl's simplistic view of the world, which is slightly stereotypically redneck, is a clever way to look at social and political issues. All the characters are brilliantly written, and aptly played, each bringing their own to the story. The series does not drag on, despite its simple premise, through numerous plot twists, and obstacles in Earl's path to karmic realignment.<br/><br/>One of the best sitcoms of recent years.<br/><br/>8/10.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,16 December 2010

Jason Lee for starters is perfect as Earl, he is very funny and endearing all at once. All the other actors are engaging and have their chance to shine, but Lee was always the one to watch. My Name is Earl also had crisp production values, likable characters, interesting story lines and hilarious jokes and writing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a wonderful show and for a long time was one of my favourites.

I will admit that the show got more and more gross every season(like in the episode ""Nature's Game Show"", Randy devours undelivered human organs), but that's no reason to cancel such a great show. I guess they canceled it because the ratings were terrible. Typically, people have no taste in television; they'd rather watch all the reality TV crap. In my opinion almost all of the really good shows are canceled before their time, but, then again, if I think it's really good, I don't think it should ever end.

And of course since each show has Earl attempting to right a past wrong, we get to see just how depraved Earl was for most of his life.<br/><br/>The writers' creativity stretches far, for they have now produced a LOT of shows with fresh ideas and situations both funny and completely out of left field. How they come up with things like ""fish wings"" I'll never guess, and I'm not bad at coming up with funny stuff myself.<br/><br/>Is a lot of Earl ""low-brow"". Oh yes.

21,My Name Is Earl, Legitimately One Of The FUNNIEST Comedies Of It's Time,"My Name Is Earl has a very particular type of humor to it. I grew up watching this show, and thought it was fantastic then, and I still certainly love it now. The story is pretty great, and most episodes are incredibly memorable and quotable. The humor in these episodes of characters being unintentionally stupid is some of the greatest comedic moments I remember from it's time, and they are still hilarious to this day. There are some episodes and plotlines that drag a bit too much further into the show, but they never get unbearable or obnoxious. The cast is lovable, the acting is great, and it's a show that generally makes you feel good after/while watching it. The reason I give it a 9/10 is because of those few slow episodes and the fact that the show ended on a cliffhanger, thanks to the network axing it before it could have a proper sendoff. Even with this cancellation in mind, I strongly urge anybody and everybody to at least give this show a chance.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,25 June 2019

With FOX playing reruns I think that it has created more fans. It maybe smart to pick this one up. From the reviews I really think it could be successful. Give it a try. Please bring it back. Please. If not the need to come up with something because Abc has got some really great shows. It doesn't hurt to try. That network canceled it they maybe willing to sell the rights to it. Like some said the only problem I have with show is it was canceled too soon. My whole family loves it. Please try to bring it back to life.

23,My Name Is Earl, Probably the Most Feel Good Sitcom Ever.,"This is a show that doesn't just make you laugh... it makes you happy. Seeing Earl do good deeds and change people's lives is fantastic. Seeing the relationship Earl has with his brother is very touching as well. I'm a true sucker for a redemption tale. And this is most likely my favourite ever.<br/><br/>The basic plot is pretty simple, yet very effective. Earl, a pretty rotten guy who doesn't do much good gets hit by a car after winning $100 000 in the lottery. While in hospital his wife leaves him for another man. Afterwards he switches on the TV and sees an episode of Last Call with Carson Daly, where they are talking about Karma. Earl then decides that he has bad luck because he's a bad person, so in theory all he has to do is be a good person, and he will have good luck. So he writes out a list of all the bad stuff he has done to people, and one by one sets out to make things right. I think it is a great premise, but as I said before, I'm a sucker for this kind of thing.<br/><br/>Now onto the main characters. Every character has been casted perfectly, and every cast member gives their character soul. Casting Jason Lee and Ethan Suplee as Earl and Randy Hickey respectively was a stroke of genius. They work really great together. Jaime Pressley is hilarious at the white trash girl, Joy, and Eddie Steeples plays her new husband Darnell/Crabman really well. Also in the cast is the lovely Nadine Velazquez as Catalina, the cleaning lady at the motel where Earl and Randy stay, who is also the woman Randy loves. All the characters have great chemistry with each other. They are all very good characters who each have their own charms and faults.<br/><br/>This is a great show with lots of heart, and if you don't find yourself smiling.... See a doctor. There is a lot of character growth and you will probably find yourself liking the characters more and more every episode. I know I do.<br/><br/>Now onto the comedy part. It's fantastic. A lot of this owes to the way the characters interact, which is very believable. It also has a lot of great pop culture references, and just plain great comedy. The comedy is a little hard to explain, as most of it is in the delivery of the lines, which is always done well. The show has been made extremely well with characters appearing often instead of just once, as in many TV Shows. This makes Camden County very believable as a small county town.<br/><br/>In closing, this is not your regular comedy, it his held up by a strong and very original story, as well as great characters. I am not saying that other comedies aren't good. I'm just saying that this brings a whole new concept to the table.<br/><br/>10/10",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,13 May 2008

25,Oz," Do NOT pass go, do not travel down this ""Yellow Brick Road""...","...if what you want is the usual depiction that passes for prison life in a dramatic format. No SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION here, folks, no benevolent GREEN MILE guards or saintly supernatural inmates. OZ tells it like it is, and baby, it ain't pretty.<br/><br/>Using at times a sense of hyper-realism, (in the narrations of the excellent Harold Perrineau, who serves as the show's conscience and Greek chorus), OZ shows us both the profane and profound aspects of prison life that we good, law-abiding citizens don't like to think about. We have the ""authorities"" to take care of that, don't we?<br/><br/>Exceptional art, no matter what the medium, has the ability to move us, make us think, make us feel both things we embrace and things we reject. The power this show has to polarize viewers into two different camps--love it or hate it--is proof enough that Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, the forces behind HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, have fashioned something we haven't seen the likes of in a very long time.<br/><br/>I would strongly suggest that anyone who has not yet seen it give it a try, if you have HBO. Then I dare you to tear yourself away from it. It's rare television that makes you sit up, take notice, and actually care about even the minor characters in an ensemble such as this, no matter how heinous their crimes, or how street-and-battle-hardened their exteriors.<br/><br/>Augustus Hill, Simon Adebisi, Tobias Beecher, Vern Schillinger, Chris Keller, Jefferson Keane, Ryan O'Reilly, Kareem Said, Nino Schibetta, Bob Rebadow, Tim McManus, Warden Leo Glynn, Sister Peter-Marie, Father Ray, Officer Diane Wittlesey and all the others will imprint themselves on your memory and stay there, until you can't wait to find out what happens next.<br/><br/>A blend of black humor and outright horror, cutting commentary and the basest brutality, it is one of the very few shows being done now that can reveal the most majestic qualities of the human spirit. The ongoing struggle to resist surrendering to impulses and urges that cause the evil that men do, in the one place you would least expect to find any light--in a sea of human misery and darkness.",239 out of 260 found this helpful.,,2 February 2000
26,Oz, Truly tremendous - my favourite drama,"This is such a powerful show, superbly acted, that frankly I feel it's the best TV drama ever made. I know plenty of Hill Street Blues/NYPD Blue/Prime Suspect (etc) fans would enthusiastically argue this point, but I feel Oz is so well acted, so well realised and so darn entertaining that it's no contest. The characters are very watchable, the stories are gripping, and so much happens in each episode that the viewer has a lot of food for thought once the show is over. I'm currently at the 4th season being in UK, so I don't know the latest developments, but I got a lot of story to look forward to...<br/><br/>The fact it's also very satirical, particularly from Augustus Hill's commentary adds beautifully to the mix.<br/><br/>Nothing short of outstanding.",156 out of 169 found this helpful.,,23 July 2002
27,Oz," More genius from the creators of ""Homicide: Life on the Street""","OK, it's violent and bloody and vicious and cruel. It's also wildly creative, beautifully filmed, brilliantly acted (with very few exceptions) and has a great framing device. The stories are both filled with detail and minutiae, and also have overarching moral tales and ""big picture"" flow. At the end of almost every episode you'll probably find yourself muttering ""This is SUCH a good show!""<br/><br/>Although it is ostensibly the story of a prison and its many prisoners, 'Oz' can be viewed as primarily the story of one man, Tobias Beecher. Beecher has committed vehicular manslaughter while driving drunk. Because Beecher is a lawyer, the court decides to make an example of him and sends him to maximum security at Oswald Penitentiary. His journey through Oz is basically the rest of the series, and it's certainly no yellow brick road he follows. Everything that you could imagine happening in a prison setting happens, and probably a lot you wouldn't imagine. <br/><br/>He gets assigned to ""Em"" City (Emerald City), an experimental unit in Oz; the goal of Em City is to try a different living environment, one that might give the prisoners a chance at changing their lives and possibly rehabilitate them. Managed by a true prison reform zealot, Tim McManus, Em City is for many prisoners the only hope in their lives. The inmates of Em City are some of the most brutal offenders in the entire penitentiary - McManus insists that these are the prisoners to try to reach. McManus also picks newer prisoners, ones that don't have life sentences, to add to the mix and to give them a shot at rehabilitation. <br/><br/>Every episode has a storyteller - most of the time the storyteller is Augustus Hill, shot while killing a cop and now confined to a wheelchair. Because he is unable to be physically brutal anymore, because he is more imprisoned than even his fellow prisoners, Augustus is very insightful and is used to heighten and clarify themes for the audience.<br/><br/>The other inmates in Em City all have their own character development and story arcs - some are impressively vibrant but brief, others last for the whole series - but ultimately the writers always return to Beecher and his story. His friends (few), his enemies (many), his family, and his relationships with the prison staff.<br/><br/>Amid the worst that prison can dish out, the inmates struggle with the meaning of religion, with definitions of family, with the corruption of politics, with friendship, betrayal, and ultimately, survival. There are moments of sheer wanton destruction, unspeakable violence, shocking cruelty, and pure evil. It's prison! There is nothing glorified here; inmates do drugs to escape the horror of their realities, gangs murder each other over trivialities, inmates and guards commit rape just because they can. But how they manage to survive - and IF they manage to survive - keeps you watching.<br/><br/>Some key performances: The always perfect J.K. Simmons as Schillinger, the leader of the Aryans; Chris Meloni as Chris Keller (quite a different part than his character on L&amp;O: SVU!); Lee Tergesen as Beecher; Eamonn Walker as Said, the leader of the Muslims; Dean and Scott Winters (real-life brothers) as Ryan and Cyril O'Reilly; and Kirk Acevedo as Miguel Alvarez, a member of the Latinos. But honestly, the whole cast is excellent. Even most of the ""guest starring"" roles - new inmates who practically have an expiration date stamped on them - are good, and at least are pretty interesting.<br/><br/>It's coming out on DVD in dribs and drabs - rent it, borrow it, steal it, whatever. But watch it!",161 out of 175 found this helpful.,,20 July 2004
28,Oz, The most underrated show on tv,"On HBO, all the Emmy's for hard core drama go to THE SOPRANOS, and I dont' think that's bad. It is a great show. But Oz is better. It might well be the best thing on television. It doesn't get the press of the Sopranos. And the other people who watch HBO (those who don't like all the violence) whould much rather watch Ferris Beuller's wife in SEX AND THE CITY, which I will NEVER watch. Oz is amazing because almost every charachter in it's sea of people is in some way a terrible human being. But the magic of this show is that these terrible people become understandable. They do terrible things, but they are not all bad. Ryan O'Rielly, for example, is a cold-blooded killer. But when it comes to his brother and doctor Nathan, and more recently the priest he befriended, he is a warm and caring person who's pain you empathize with. Oz takes murderers, rapists, thieves, and even a rich lawyer who ran down a young girl in a drunken stuper, and makes them likeable and forgivable. That's incredible.  And this show is incredible. It goes off the air soon for good, and I wish it had gotten the respect it deserved.",45 out of 47 found this helpful.,,13 February 2003
29,Oz," Brutal, difficult, uncompromising, unpleasant, unsettling and utterly brilliant","In an innovation on the prison city, a wing called Emerald City is created with Oswald State Penitentiary.  With this wing prisoners are given more responsibility and better conditions.  Sleeping two to a pod, with clean facilities etc.  However the prisoners are no different and violence and crime runs the prison.  No one is above corruption and murder can come from the smallest events.  Drugs, rape and torture are weapons and no one is above betrayal and deceit as powerful partnerships are formed and broken.<br/><br/>Insomnia can be a wonderful thing.  I started watching Oz many years ago on Channel 4's `Later' slot in the UK.  I used to watch Homicide: Life on the Street and they relegated it to a 1am slot.  Because I couldn't sleep I used to stay up and watch it.  Oz was on after this and I got into that.  At first I couldn't believe how brutal it was then I got totally sucked in.<br/><br/>I'm on the fourth series now and am glad I started watching it.  The series has one major strength  the writing.  The plot is one of constant tension and drama as plan follows plan follows murder follows betrayal etc.  The storylines are always good and always brutal.  However one of the main drivers for me are the characters.  They change with time  they develop with events, they get killed  regardless of status within the series, they get killed!<br/><br/>The best example of what I mean can be seen in just a few examples  but on the whole it's true of most of the characters.  Beecher came into the prison as a normal guy jailed for drunk driving and killing a child.  The abuse he got from Schillinger has completed changed him  in fact 4 series on he continues to change.  Schillinger himself is compelling, despite being relatively one dimensional he is a powerful character.  My `favourite' character is Simon Adebisi.  In series two he became very passive, very submissive but it was revealed as an act and he has become his cruel manipulative self again.  I could list them all  obviously there's going to be characters who come and go, background extras who have only a few lines to say, or who move the plot along by getting killed etc. but most characters develop or play major roles.<br/><br/>In terms of actors the cast is mainly bit part players with no major lead roles under their belts, but to a man they all do good jobs when called upon.  It's hard to pick out any one actor who stands out as it depends on their characters, but it's worth acknowledging a few.  Tergesen (Beecher) has shone simply in the way he has convincingly changed his character over the years.  Likewise Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje has done great work as the monstrous Simon Adebisi.  These standout because they have shown how they can deal with extreme changes in their roles, however every other member of cast is totally convincing.  J.K. Simmons will only ever be Schillinger to me after this and a bit part black actor from the UK's `The Bill' shines in the role of Said (Walker).  I could fill this site with praise for the cast.<br/><br/>The programme is clever and intelligent (although many can't get past the brutality, violence and swearing).  The portrayal of the prison as not so much an integrated melting pot of races but a mixed room of races that all manage themselves first  much more like the real America.  The use of the brilliant Harold Perrineau Jnr as a character and as a sort of street theatre narrator is certainly different and allows each show to make a social point or a commentary without being preachy is really good  and often funny too.<br/><br/>It does of course have weaknesses.  Sometimes the brutality can be wearing and be too much.  Where they constantly bring in new characters each week just to kill them in the same show to move the plot along it gets a bit tired too  however this doesn't happen every week.  The plots themselves can only go so far  basically they all come down to violence and betrayal in some form.  My hope is that they will only make this for another series at most.  It's better if they end on a high rather than risking showing signs of fatigue or running out of new ideas.<br/><br/>Overall it's brutal, cruel, disturbing, violent and upsetting.  Why watch then?  Because it's very well written and made, it totally compelling, it has great actors and the storylines are rarely less than gripping.  It has an energy unlike anything else  like a car crash, you don't always want to see what's happening but you can't help but look.  After all isn't this how prison is?  Superb television but not to everyone's taste.",123 out of 135 found this helpful.,,27 June 2002
30,Oz," Not only the best show on TV currently, but one of the best shows of all-time.","Consistently well-written and acted, Oz is without a doubt the best thing on TV.  Quality wise, it's up there with the first 4 seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street as the most compelling hour of television drama. Presenting a harsh and realistic view of prison life, Oz is a wonderful mixture of superb acting and character development; all of which rides on a nuanced and erudite core (Foucault's Panopticon is the inspiration for Em City's design...and ultimate failure).  It is the only show on TV, that I can think of, that has presented characters who were intensely dislikable one moment and oddly empathetic the next.  That I am repulsed by, sympathetic with, intrigued about, and involved with every character that has lived, died or survived on the show, is no small feat.  Good TV exists. And, for my money, Oz is not only good TV, it is better than most films released throughout the year.",136 out of 150 found this helpful.,,4 December 1998

32,Oz, Oz is a fascinating depiction of humanity in it's strangest forms,"Oz is set in Oswald State Correctional Facility. It tells the story of confrontation, cruelty, violence, hate and survival at any cost. in a place like Oz, you have to have eyes in the back of your head.<br/><br/>This completely original, intelligent and compelling drama tells of how warped life becomes as soon as you step through the gates of Emerald City.<br/><br/>What is supposed to be a state of art correctional facility is in fact far from being such. The show brings to light some of the many flaws in the prison system, the underestimating of the humanity that cold hard killers are capable of still retaining, and the one true fact: The prisoners are the one's who control the prison.<br/><br/>This magnificent and somewhat surreal show teaches about the importance of every life and helps give an understanding to the reasons that most of the prisoners are there. This show may seem shocking at first but to truly tell it like it is, such a thing is necessary.<br/><br/>Oz is a great depiction of hell on earth and how such a place teaches you some of the most important lessons you will ever learn.",69 out of 79 found this helpful.,10.0,6 February 2008
33,Oz, Its influence will elevate the level of television drama for years to come.,"The stature of this program must be measured in the context of its format. These are not feature films, but one hour dramas, no different in concept or constraint from countless other network counterparts.  But, oh how different in result.<br/><br/>Oz is not for everyone.  It is violent, lurid, obscene, profane and controversial.  Oz us narrated dramatically by a ""Greek Chorus"" of inmates who make insightful observations not just about Oz, but applicable to the outside world as well.  The talent, none of it marquee, is nonetheless the finest assembly of supporting actors an ensemble cast could hope for.<br/><br/>In order to keep ratings up, the stories sometimes veer into the unbelievable, but the grit and reality are never gone for long.  Oz is also a bundle of irony.  Although it deals with homosexuality with insight and objectivity in every episode, it just as often bristles with gratuitous homoerotic overtone.  Despite the fact that it overflows with action and violence, it never mistakes kenesis for story.<br/><br/>Sometimes, Oz borders on, and crosses well into, genius.  Its often surreal direction elevates otherwise base events to sublime levels.  Music, pacing, convoluted story lines careening and intersecting in ways that are at the same time graceful and clumbsy, just like real life.<br/><br/>This is said to be the last season of Oz, and yet, only two seasons are on DVD.  With constant reruns and each episode being aired about a dozen times a week, you may be tired of this jewel anyway, but its influence will elevate the level of television drama for years to come.",72 out of 83 found this helpful.,,19 January 2003

I have to say, I have the hots for about 75% of the cast, hehe. Oz is definitely worth seeing but also it is not for the fainthearted. There is gratuitous violence, foul language, and nudity/sex.

40,Oz, Best show on Tv,"I ended up watching OZ as probably many others: I opened the tv on one monday-tuesday night and there was ""nothing on"" (really surprising: the clock was around 1 at night.)I wasn't instantly hooked: it took me couple of weeks.

So what's so excellent in the show? Everything. There is wonderful acting, GREAT srorylines, characters that are just perfect and of course the cold reality of the show. One thing I really like is this realism: There are no stupid heros that shouldn't be in prison. Everyone there's a criminal and deserves to be there. This doesn't mean they are some emotionaless robots: they also have feelings. Just watch the way ruthless killer Ryan O'Reily takes care of his retarted brother. Or the Beecher-Keller affair. This show can offer you a peek to the prison life,or at least as close as you can show on tv.Because it's done for cable you can say the f-word and show violence(it would be kind of stupid if the prisoners said ""oh darn"" or tried to solve their fights in a nice game of poker..)So the strong language and shocking deaths are justified, but may not be suitable for younger audience.

They don¡¦t want to feel for murders, drug addicts, for rapists. People don't want to put a face on those people because then they'll feel for them.

43,Oz, Arguably this was one of the best shows to ever come out of the mid-1990's and lasted into the next millennium,"The HBO series ""OZ"" was one of the best shows to ever grace the mid-1990's. Speaking of some of the great shows that came from that period like ""The X-Files"",""Homicide:Life On The Street"",""NYPD Blue"",""The Practice"",""Law and Order"",and so forth. For the six seasons that it ran on Home Box Office(HBO),producing a total of 147 episodes that begin with the opening episode of the series,the first episode on July 12,1997 to the emotional and astounding finale of the series on February 23,2003. This was a brilliant series in astounding detail that was superbly acted and exceptionally well written with some of the most grippest episodes ever conceived and it shows coming from the creative minds of Barry Levinson and Tom Fontana,the forces behind this show and there over successful venture ""Homicide:Life On The Street"",have fashioned something that was out of the ordinary and for one something we haven't seen the likes of in a long time. And to show it ""OZ"" was just that...a gripping and intensely violent drama that takes place within the walls the nation's penal system and the inmates and prison officals that control it. ""OZ"" was so successful in fact that it was nominated for two Emmys(twice)for Best Dramatic Series on Cable Television not to mention winning the ALMA,Cable ACE,Edgar Allen Poe Awards for Best Writing,The Writers Guild Of America for some of the best writing ever presented on television. For one ""OZ"" was something special that got people's attention: It was a rare series that made up sit up and basically take notice,and actually care for the characters in such an ensemble cast as this,no matter how heinous their crimes,or how street-and-battle hardened their exteriors were.<br/><br/>Another reason why ""OZ"" was so brilliant was that it took the level of television drama to another level which was something that you would never see on any of the major television networks,and it was only on HBO that you saw it the way it was meant to be seen,and let me tell you this: ""OZ"" was graphically violent and bloody,vicious,and cruel not to mention full of nudity and explicit graphic language. In other words,""OZ"" tells it like it is and believe me it is not pretty. It's realistic,frank and very controversial. It was also wildly creative,beautifully filmed,brilliantly acted with the grand and beautifully innovation of great storytelling. This was a show that was clever and highly intelligent(although many can't get past some of the brutuality and constant swearing not to mention the blood and gore)and since this was basically an adult show,made for adults. Some of the plots within the show are one of constant tension and drama as plan follows plan follows murder follows betrayal and so forth with some of the story lines exceptionally good and sometimes brutal in the aftermath. As for the characters themselves,especially with some of the inmates,and some of the guards too,they change with time-they develop within the events,they get killed and regardless of the status within the series' run they get killed off-one by one! New inmates are added and the same formula follows the same suit.

It has a certain relationship to soap opera in that something evil is always happening, and it is the unfolding of each instance of evil that fascinates. From my discussions with people who are actually in prison, it rings true. Every interaction has some machination working in the background. Behind every action, there lies a scheme, a plot to do someone else in. I like this series so much that it is one of the few TV shows I have bought completely, on DVD.<br/><br/>And, yes, I agree with the writer before me who commented that there are elements of satire in it. The character in the wheelchair who offers his jaundiced view of life does so with a certain bit of ironic humor.",13 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,11 February 2007
50,Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Makes you sad to be part of the human race,"There needs to be a rating choice of zero for shows like this. I have just watched the episode where they drag a homeless man off the street to ""play with"" and I have never felt so sad for these horrible people. The show is 100% pure car crash TV. The worst thing is that it is totally not ""reality"" and comes across as completely scripted, planned and faked.<br/><br/>Sadly it seems like any Joe can now grab a film deal and the once original Ozzy Osbourne format has now long gone. This show just sums up everything I hate about these type of people and watching it makes me sad to be part of the same race.<br/><br/>These shows must stop...but they wont...because they are designed for lazy viewing (couch potatoes) and lets face it...there are plenty out there to keep this sort of show on air :(",474 out of 534 found this helpful.,1.0,2 January 2009
51,Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Watch - and then thank goodness for your parents!,"Sadly, IMDb doesn't have a rating system under 1 to grade reality shows - and this reality program is a perfect example where zero should be installed.<br/><br/>No matter how long you may look at ""Keeping Up WIht the Kardashans"", it has no value in any category whatsoever - just another entry into the 'fast food' genre of reality programing - lots of calories, non-filling and quickly forgetful.<br/><br/>Here you have another twenty something ungrateful Hollywood raised female woman-child, in another typically ungrateful for celebrity-family with parents who are so self absorbed and ungrateful towards themselves, that you wonder how they can have time left to be ungrateful towards the children under their roof/in their lives. But oh, they find time.<br/><br/>So what keeps you watching? The 15 minute 'clinique' beauty of the twenty something self described ""socialite""? The little ""naughty-bits"" they sneak in of T&amp;A just under the radar of standards and practices? The self-absorption of the parents? The back-talk and snotty attitudes the children are allowed to give to these parents? The unruliness of a blended family? Or just the idea of taking a peek into the life of ""folks with celebrity"" and then taking a look at your own life and realizing that mom and dad ....maybe aren't SO bad.<br/><br/>The beauty of freedom is that there will always be something for everyone. And in that freedom, you can take a look and decide if it's good or bad. For me, this show is bad, meaningless. This is not to say that all TV must be 20 hours of ""Leave it to Beaver"" or the ""Brady Bunch"". That's unrealistic. We've got to be exposed to real family dysfunction to see that that the world isn't always sugary sweet and pristine perfect. Not parents, not kids, not even our pets.<br/><br/>But programs like this are getting to be a standard. There isn't anything warm or exciting about viewing the life of a young woman who's already hit her peak - mentally, educationally, sexually - and is heading downward fast. Or her mother who IS allowing it - even if it is only due to her own self-absorption. And a father who couldn't care less because he ISN'T her father particularly, just another man in a long line of men that the mother has luckily hooked her claws into. And the household siblings - the siblings to whom you have a bet going that they will either run out of the home screaming for real love, acceptance, stability, boundaries - or end up just like their older sibling on a YouTube edited soft porn segment or even worse - a real one.<br/><br/>Is this entertainment? Depends on you. It is a train wreck that you may stop to see for a minute or two - but there are so many OTHER train wrecks to see in ""reality TV"" these days from music television to classic television channels, why stick with this one? Even if its only for a minute? Well...maybe to hug mom and dad and thank them that you're not ever going to end up as dull, lifeless, and boring as this family no matter how much money, TV cameras or publicity there is in the world. This shows that fame, money -- the appearance of it or the chasing of it -- isn't all it's cracked up to be, but obviously will crack those who have it.",346 out of 411 found this helpful.,1.0,28 October 2007
52,Keeping Up with the Kardashians," Dumb, dumber, dumbest","This show can be so formulaic and stereotypical that it must be scripted--or improvised based on an outline the way ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" is. But while ""Curb"" ends up being painfully funny, ""Keeping Up with the Kardashians"" just ends up being painful.<br/><br/>I obviously have too much time on my hands because I have probably seen three or four episodes of this show. Having grown up in Worcester, Massachusetts, I suppose that I was intrigued by the idea of a show about an ArmenianAmerican familynot that the Kardashians much resemble any Armenian-American family I have ever known (other than that they are often big).<br/><br/>My hope is that the show is scripted, because, otherwise, these people are evidently incredibly shallow, and they all seem to suffer from an attention deficit. In one episode, ""Learning Self Defense,"" a vandal comes to their shop, knocks merchandise about, and frightens the salesgirl. The Kardashian girls first decide to take a self-defense class for about 10 minutes, which leaves them brimming with overconfidence until step-dad and former Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner shows them that he can easily defeat them with very little effort. Rather than dedicate themselves to further lessons, the girls abandon this scheme, much the way that Wile E. Coyote, in the old Warner Brothers cartoons always tries a completely new scheme when the last one fails to provide instant gratification. Kris, the mom, then suggests that they go to a shooting range and learn to use pistols; however, after ten minutes the girls give up on this as well.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone in the stupidity department, the girls' brother and one's boyfriend come up with a hair-brained plan to disguise themselves as armed robbers in ski masks and stage a fake robbery in order to scare the girls into hiring a professional security service. It never occurs to them to try verbal persuasion or that it might be kindly of them to hire an hour of a security consultant's time and have him talk to Kim at no cost to her. Good thing the girls hadn't decided to acquire guns or they might have filled these two pranksters with lead. On the other hand, that might have been good for ratings.<br/><br/>Finally, has anyone asked whether or not the producers of ""Deep Space 9"" had this family in mind when they created the aliens known as the Cardassians?

There is absolutely nothing special about this garbage, and I cannot see why anyone would find it the least bit enjoyable.

54,Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Exploiting the Active audience and making emerge a society obessessed with consumerism,"This show is more political than just entertainment. We need to question why are so many people watching this show which has no important message. This shows makes us think of a society that is obsessed with watching reality even though it has no educational or informative message. it is a culture that is obsessed with a narcissistic society as Pecora write about in the Surveillance Society. The Kardashians not only make it seem that it is important to publish their private lives and make it an entertainment but they also send a message that many must critically analyze: consumerism. They show their houses and talk about their brands in order to target young audiences and not only receive money from the show but also from their brands. It is the complete exploitation of the fan audiences. When done watching an episode, audiences walk out with a desire to purchase things and speculate about useless stuff like how kim lost a $70,000 earrings in the pool and cried about it. The Kardashians want to create realism and influence an ideology of consumerism. Even though it is blatant their show is scripted or might be manipulated at times in order to create social media buzz. For example, when Kim Kardashian recorded the conversation with taylor swift and Kanye West and published it on snapchat in order to humiliate Taylor and gain more snapchat followers. It is all done for profit and fame. The real question that show make emerge critical discussions is why do the Kardashians believe people would want to watch their private lives? Isn't that exploiting the audience by using their time for useless content? As well as to promote their brands? Every episode is pointless and had drama that we don't need to see such as the drama when Bruce Jenner told the family he wants to transition to a female. The whole episode was Kylie, Kourtney, Khloe complaining about how he has never talked to them about this even though he's been feeling like a woman for a long time. How does this narrative and plot affect the audience? It doesn't teach us anything other than being obsessed with reality TV.",66 out of 80 found this helpful.,1.0,30 July 2016

All the """"drama"""" on the show is so obviously scripted and so cringe worthily executed by a bunch of talent-less hacks that it is impossible to get invested at all in their lives. <br/><br/>Overall the show's success can be chalked up to the fact that it is the epitome of what makes reality TV bad.

Meanwhile, Scott believes that there is a Kardashian curse upon all males associated with the family. He goes to a psychic to find out. This was the stupidest thing I've ever watched. This show is all about irresponsible adults going through teenage drama (and I can say this, being a teenager under the age of 15), concerning themselves with affairs related to clothes, ex-boyfriend/ex- husbands, and Calcutta gold marble.

73,Keeping Up with the Kardashians, An experiment in how not to run a family,"I think everyone knows by now that reality television is not real. It was interesting news (I suppose) 15 years ago. I honestly don't understand why anyone cares anymore. With this in mind, I think it unfair to judge the real family based on what is seen. So when you see me make criticism, please note that I am criticizing the ""characters"" on the show, not the actual people. I don't know them, and for all we know, they could be lovely people.<br/><br/>This show is just another version of the Osbournes: spoiled ""kids"", a mother who clearly loves her kids but can't parent for crap, and a father whose given up all hope of ever having anyone recognize the value of his opinions. Bruce is a lot more like Dan Conner from Roseanne than he is Ozzy, but all three men seem to agree on one thing: the love of overbearing women. Disturbingly, in the likability contest, Roseanne seems to win out of the women picked. Scary thought, huh? Kris Jenner, as presented here, is a women who does seem to love her family. She is also one of the worst parents I have seen presented on a TV show in a long time. This is a women who harassed her daughter into posing naked for Playboy that clearly made her uncomfortable; a daughter who was trying to fight off the stigma of the sex tape. This is a women who gave out her daughter's private cellphone number in the middle of an argument because she criticized her (bad) management. This is a women who openly admits to living vicariously through her children (specifically in the Playboy episode).<br/><br/>The daughters are in their twenties, and are treated as if they were teenagers. Well, people rise to what is expected of them, so they act as such. Khloe's the only adult daughter that a normal person can relate to, and even she's a bit... scary. And then the two youngest children are pretty normal kids, but it disturbs me how often they are presented in an unflattering light. When they're in their twenties, are they really going to want to be remembered for playing on a stripper pole? Or mocking their sister? Or how about when the older one hit puberty, and they presented her as an angry little brat? Sure, that's how kids are at that age, but we should chalk at least SOME of that up to hormones and recognize that she's probably not going to want people to see her like that. When you're an adult, you get what you signed up for. When you're a child, someone needs to draw the line.<br/><br/>My other problem is that every episode has a adorable little moral and it's always pretty much the same: ""I'll never take my family for granted again... Well, I mean I won't take them for granted again until next week"". So they beat us over the head with a lesson that's never actually learned. At least when Full House did that, it was cute.<br/><br/>Is it entertaining? At times. But is it something I'd suggest to others? Not really, no.",54 out of 74 found this helpful.,,28 April 2009

100,"Beverly Hills, 90210", Love It Or Hate It - It's A TV Institution. . .,"It's easy to forget (or not even know) that at one point, Beverly Hills, 90210 (created by Darren Star who'd go on to Melrose Place before the phenomenon that is 'Sex &amp; The City') was the biggest teen-orientated show in the world. Yes - the world! One minute, it was struggling to survive and the next, the stars of the series inspired scenes reminiscent of 'Beatlemania'. And justly so because in those halcyon days of yesteryear, 90210's blend of drama, cheese, humour, pure unadulterated escapism, great scenery in terms of cast and location and strong characterisation was compelling viewing.<br/><br/>
The early years concentrated on the Walsh family - who promptly became the emotional core of the show - and their efforts to adjust to life in Beverly Hills after relocation from Minnesota. <br/><br/>Twins Brandon and Brenda (Jason Priestley and Shannen Doherty) befriend a diverse group of mostly-rich rich kids at West Beverly High: spoilt son of a movie actress, jock and joker Steve Sanders (Ian Ziering), persistently in trouble and always relying on Brandon to bail him out. Brainy (but not as affluent) crusader Andrea Zuckerman (Gabrielle Carteris) doomed to an unrequited love for Brandon. Ditzy, naive Donna Martin (Tori Spelling) - probably the most (in)famous virgin on American TV. Insecure, school DJ David Silver (Brian Austin Green), desperate to be accepted by the gang. Blonde bombshell Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) who'd go on to sleep with her best friend's boyfriend and also, her ex-boyfriend's best friend. And last (but by no means least), moody alcoholic Dylan McKay (Luke Perry) - the quintessential troubled teen.<br/><br/>From High School (Seasons 1-3) through to College (Seasons 4-7) and life after College (Seasons 8-10), they face a series of crises together ranging from the death of a friend to depression, drugs, physical and sexual assault and tumultuous love triangles.<br/><br/>The earlier High School years are undoubtedly the best; the original cast is intact, the strongest scripts are to be found within this time frame and it's the period that, to this day, defines the show. <br/><br/>However post-Shannen Doherty and with Tiffani-Amber Thiessen as vivacious, vampy schemer Valerie Malone and Kathleen Robertson as the acerbic, sarcastic Clare Arnold on board, 90210 remained very entertaining viewing right up to College graduation at the end of Season 7 - notable as the episode in which High School sweethearts (and future spouses) David and Donna finally consummated their long on-again/off-again relationship.<br/><br/>
Admittedly, the last three seasons are weaker than previous ones. A deadly combination of changes to cast and crew (it survived the loss of Darren Star, Shannen Doherty and Luke Perry in Season 6 but to all intents and purposes, the show ended with Jason Priestley's departure in Season 9. Not even Luke Perry's return could compensate for that), a more overt soap opera format and weaker new characters (embodied by the faux-Dylan imitator Noah Hunter ineptly played by Vincent Young) sounded the death knell for a series that had become a shadow of its former powerhouse self.<br/><br/>Still, in the cutthroat world of TV, you've got to have something very special to last ten years on an American network and that's exactly what Beverly Hills, 90210 did. It outlasted all its contemporaries such as the infinitely superior teen drama 'My So-Called Life' starring Clare Danes and Jared Leto, which only made it to air for a year, and it gave the likes of 'Buffy', 'Party of Five' and 'Dawson's Creek' a recipe for success to follow. <br/><br/>Love it or hate it (and I LOVE it) - Beverly Hills, 90210 is a TV institution.",144 out of 156 found this helpful.,,18 January 2003
101,"Beverly Hills, 90210", The classic of the teen soaps,"I did not watch much of the show when it was originally on TV. Now, about 25 years after it started I decided to watch something that ""is 90's"" and BH 90210 was the show that right away got into my head.<br/><br/>So I went through all the 10 seasons, now in my 30's and I must say I really enjoyed it. The fact that the actors were older than the characters doesn't bother one at this point anymore, actually it helped. It almost brought the feeling back of me watching the show about the older kids who are already in high school, just like it was back when I was 10 and caught a few episodes.<br/><br/>It is of course very cheesy, yet entertaining. One can see how Aaron Spelling started and set up the formula for the teen dramas that followed Beverly Hills. It is also great to see the 90's go by in their clothes and the things they live through.<br/><br/>I loved their high school years, but I enjoyed the show pretty much until Valerie left. After she was gone it went downhill for me, but by that time the show was almost over.<br/><br/>While Valerie was my favorite female character, David was my favorite guy. He was a sweet kid from the start, although he has done a lot of stupid things during the show. Most characters had their charm. But even though I liked the show pretty much until the end, when it came to the adult time most of the original cast has lost their charm. I liked Kelly at first, but in the final years of the show I couldn't stand her. Steve stopped being fun but an annoying guy who will have a kid. And when Dylan came back he seemed like an annoying parody of himself.<br/><br/>Still, the show is a classic for me. As somebody who once in a while likes to watch some cheesy soap, this was a good entertainment with a great cast that fitted the show very well and will always be the faces that I associate with the 90's pop culture.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,8.0,6 August 2016
102,"Beverly Hills, 90210", Three! Three!! Three Shows in One!!!,"While ""Beverly Hills 90210"" was making its ten year run, I never watched a single episode. The affairs of rich kids in Beverly Hills really didn't interest me; and, even though Jennie Garth and Tiffani Amber-Thiessan are real eye candy, that wasn't enough to tie me to watching a weekly continuing drama with what I thought would be such an uninteresting subject. However, when the Soap Opera Channel offered the show in sequence five days a week and my wife encouraged me to watch it with her, I reluctantly agreed. I'm glad I did, because ""Beverly Hills 90210"" is, in my opinion, the best written and produced continuing drama in TV history. Why do I say this? Because ""Beverly Hills 90210"" survived two radical format changes and remained consistently watchable for its entire 10 year run. Actually, ""Beverly Hills 90210"" is three different shows: an excellent ""high school teenagers in love"" show; a very good ""college kids antics"" show and a good ""Yuppies in love"" show. The creative talent managed to produce three above average shows with an amazing consistency of story lines and talent, using mostly the original cast. Nobody else has ever done this, at least to my knowledge. The producers are to be commended for keeping the cast remarkable intact, even down to the minor characters. To the best of my knowledge, only one character was played by two different actresses, that being Andrea Zuckerman's grandmother. Compare that to the more prestigious soaps, ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas."" On ""Dallas"" alone, two actors played Gary Ewing, Digger Barnes, Miss Ellie and Kristen Shepherd (who shot J.R.), and three actors played Jenna Wade, and all of these characters were more important to the show's plotting than Andrea's grandmother.<br/><br/>While all three shows are above average, the ""high school teenagers in love"" episodes are the best. However, I believe they were also the easiest to plot, since teenagers have more restrictions on their behavior and their problems are generally more direct, easier with which to relate and generally easier to resolve. This is only slightly less true for college students, but it's a whole different ball game by the time one gets out of school and into the ""real world;"" and, by the time these episodes were written and produced, the characters were no longer fresh. The loss of Shannen Dougherty (""Brenda Walsh"") was the series first major blow, and the series slipped badly her first season away (the fifth). However, after a weak start, Tiffani-Amber Thiessan (""Valerie Malone"") became a very impressive cast member. However, Shannen brought an inventiveness to the series which was never regained.<br/><br/>The second major blow the series suffered was the loss of Kathleen Robertson (""Claire Arnold""), at the end of ""the college years"". While other original cast members had left, including Gabriella Carteris (""Andrea Zuckerman""), Carol Potter (""Cindy Walsh"") and James Eckhouse (""Jim Walsh""), I felt the loss of Kathleen Robertson the most. Kathleen's ""Claire Arnold"" was a fascinating blend of three of the main characters; she exhibited Brenda's daring, Kelly's poise and Donna's madcap sensuality. The show lost a lot of it's warmth with Kathleen's departure, as well as the (unfortunately) correct decision to place less emphasis on the older adult cast members. This happens in life as well as young adults leave school and are out on there own. The show also lost it's innocence when Donna (Tori Spelling) lost hers to David (Brian Austin Green).<br/><br/>The final blow to the series happened over two seasons. The departures of Luke Perry, Jason Priestly and Tiffani-Amber Thiessan badly shook the show, but for very different reasons. Luke Perry (Dylan McKay) brought a lot of romance to the show; Jason Priestly (""Brandon Walsh"") brought a brash, crusading spirit; and Tiffan-Amber Thiessan brought a wholesome, mature sexiness that was sometimes at odds with the character she played. Worse, for their first seasons at least, the replacement characters, Vincent Young (""Noah Hunter""), Lindsay Price (""Janet Sosna""), Daniel Cosgrove (""Matt ) and Vanessa Marcel (""Gina"") while all fine actors, did not bring the missing ingredients to their characters. While Season 9 was clearly the worst of the season (due mostly to unconvincing plotting), Season 10 was a triumph, starting strong and getting better every week. Lindsay Price shed the somewhat dowdy image of his first season and a half and showed how beautiful and sexy she can really be (not to the mention, the best natural figure of the female stars). Daniel Cosgrove gained stature as ""Matt""; and, while never acquiring the ""Brandon brashness,"" certainly captured Jason Walsh's earnestness. Most importantly, warmth and romance returned to the series. I watched the last episode wanting more and that's a great testimony to any show.<br/><br/>Here's my rating of the series pilot and 10 seasons <br/><br/>PILOT  ** ½ SEASON 1 - *** SEASON 2 - **** SEASON 3 - **** SEASON 4 - *** ½ SEASON 5 - ** ½ SEASON 6 - **** SEASON 7 - *** ½ SEASON 8 - **½ SEASON 9 - ** SEASON 10 ****",59 out of 78 found this helpful.,,11 March 2006
103,"Beverly Hills, 90210", New wave prime time soap of the 90's that was a major hit.,"This series aimed at teenagers and young adults was a major hit during the 90's. Leading the pack was the turmoil-ridden saga of rich kids at West Beverly Hills High School who all faced the common problems of love, pregnancies, drugs and family crises subjects that are somewhat more common to youth and young adults. The best stories centered on the Walsh family, newly arrived in town, in particular fraternal twins Brandon (Jason Priestly) and Brenda (Shannen Doherty). The gang then included friends Kelly (Jennie Garth), Steve (Ian Ziering), Andrea (Gabrielle Carteris), Donna (Tori Spelling), David (Brian Austin Green) and moody Dylan (Luke Perry). Later other characters came on like Tiffani-Amber Thiessen while others had left. In the final season of the show most of the original cast had left the cast saw many changes during the ten year run.

104,"Beverly Hills, 90210", Guilty pleasure,"Several years ago, in 2016 I think, I was grabbed by some nostalgia and I started to rewatch ""Beverly Hills, 90210"". Of course, after three seasons it began to bore me and I moved on to something smarter. Since this month I was in total business and private chaos and I had neither the time nor the concentration to devote more seriously to films, I returned to it again. After the fourth season, I must admit it feels good. When you work from morning to night, seven days a week, this is the right choice to relax before going to bed. I think I'll definitely see it through all ten seasons. Maybe it has no value in an artistic and cinematographic sense, nor in terms of philosophical depth, but it has emotional and nostalgic value for us who grew up in the '90s and it is great for letting the brain out to pasture. And to be honest, it is very well made. Perhaps the stories are Utopian and with fairytale happy-endings, but they also make sense and point. The acting is quite solid and technically there are hardly any flaws. In this genre, only ""Heartbreak High"" beats it.<br/><br/>8/10",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,29 March 2019
105,"Beverly Hills, 90210"," Loved this show, but the ending wasn't satisfying","Beverly Hills 90210 was one of those shows you look back on knowing it defined its era. Along with shows like Saved by the Bell and Dawson's Creek, 90210 was one of THE 90s shows. It had an amazing ensemble cast, the music was great, it was generally fun to watch.<br/><br/>However, many people say the downpoint was when Shannon Doherty departed, but for me, the real loss was Jason Priestley's Season 9 departure. As Brandon Walsh, Jason was central to the show. A lot of things revolved around him, and he played as amazing a guy as he was a sexy teen idol of his time. Seasons 4-7 were amazing because it was the time when Brandon and Kelly Taylor (Jennie Garth) were romantically involved, and continued to love each other whether they were dating or seeing other people. I will forever disrespect the writers for what they do to Kelly/Brandon in Season 8. The whole calling off the wedding at the last minute when they were clearly meant to be together was pathetic and a huge letdown to fans who not only followed the show but followed their relationship through its ups and downs.<br/><br/>And worse still - now I haven't seen all of Seasons 9-10 because I couldn't bear it knowing Jason wouldn't be in it, but I know Luke Perry returned as Dylan McKay. And personally I never really loved the guy anyway, even though he had a huge fanbase. He was great... with Brenda, Brandon's sister, played by Shannen Doherty. But having him get back together with Kelly after all those years and after she had chosen Brandon over him for real in Season 7? This really is taking the fans for granted. And the characters, too. Because I don't believe Dylan was the love of Kelly's life at all, it was Brandon. And the only way I can make myself feel better about this is just by knowing had Jason returned for the finale, Brandon and Kelly would have been endgame.<br/><br/>So, unforgettable show it was, exciting and cool show it certainly was, but the way it ends? I'd rather forget. There are only two characters who end together like they should, David and Donna. And they didn't mean as much to me so that doesn't make the finale any easier for me to watch.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,5.0,22 December 2007
106,"Beverly Hills, 90210", Essential show...,"Well, growing up during 90210's run, I missed out on all the hype that this show received. Now, thanks to SoapNet, I can watch shows that were on while I was busy playing dress-up.<br/><br/>Let me be the first to say, that I never ever thought that I would EVER watch 90210, or get hooked on it. During a few weeks that I was grounded from my computer, I didn't have anything to do after I did my homework at 5 o'clock, so I turned on the TV. I normally would have put on Angel, but it was an episode I didn't care to watch, so I stopped on SoapNet and low and behold, 90210 was on. Immediately I went for the remote to change the channel but then I stopped and actually watched it. I was HOOKED. Mostly what hooked me was the romance between Dylan and Brenda.<br/><br/>Anyway, mostly what I remembered or heard people talk about 90210, was that it was all about drugs and sex and who was sleeping with who what week. (I don't know if that's true yet, but I have a feeling that it's getting to that point. I'm still in the ""high school years"".) As I watched more of the plot lines going on in the first, second and third seasons, things seemed really familiar. As I looked more at them, I really began to realized that 90210 curved the pathway for today's teen dramas like ""Dawson's Creek"", ""One Tree Hill"", ""The O.C."", etc. Without 90210, these show's most likely wouldn't have been created.<br/><br/>So, the question becomes, do I think 90210 is a good show? So far, yes. But I think it was essential to have something like this (at least in the first few years) on the air for teenagers to watch so that it could make a pathway for other shows of this kind.",57 out of 81 found this helpful.,10.0,4 May 2005

It's hard to say which episode was my favorite. It would probably have to be the one where Brenda (Shannen Doherty) has a fight with Kelly (Jennie Garth). However, I think it was always sad when friends fought. I always wanted to cry at that. It would have been nice if all the main characters stayed with the show throughout its entire run. It seems that no one stays with a show throughout its entire run. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong.

The new main actors were all plain like vanilla, like Vincent Young, Jamie Walters, Lindsay Price, Vanessa Marcil, etc. None of the new replacements excited me at all. (Daniel Cosgrove was not bad).<br/><br/>But, in terms of pure gold, the Brenda years, love or hate the actress, Seasons 1-4, were the best.

109,"Beverly Hills, 90210", Great show of the 1990's!,"Beverly Hills 90210 is one of the best drama shows of the 1990's! Especially since this show aired on FOX were most of the good drama shows air. This series is about the lives of a group of high school students living in wealthy Beverly Hills neighborhood, then in the later seasons of the show they move on to their college days as they got older. The kids become friends and enemies, fall in and out of love, and go through an endless series of crises as this small group somehow becomes personally involved in every newsworthy social issue from alcoholism to South African apartheid to pregnancy to AIDS. Jason Priestley was one of the coolest actors on this show and so was Ian Ziering! The best actresses on this show were Tiffani Amber Thiessen and Kathleen Robertson. Tiffani Amber Thiessen was also on another FOX series called Fastlane and Jason Priestley is currently on another good FOX series Tru Calling!

110,"Beverly Hills, 90210", This is one of the best shows you will ever see !!...,"This is one of the best shows you will ever see !! I remember the first episode, all of the characters being sophomores in high school, just starting to gain some identity . To me, each character is a fantastic representation of the different situation a teenager faces in life. You've got the girls Kelly , Brenda, Donna (the good girl) , and Andrea (pronounced ON-dreea), and the guys Brandon (won my vote for best looking!) Steve, nerdy David, and soon to follow cool hand Luke - Dylan . The gang is as close as a bunch of high-schoolers are going to get, but let me tell you why to watch . This show crosses everything - drugs, sex , abuse, you name it . The characters bring the topics into their own hands and show how it affects their friends, family and lives. It has actually taught me a few lessons as well . One being that you never know your friends, and don't be surprised by their actions . This show proves that you never really know anyone . 90210 doesn't hold anything back, it shows emotion, and best of all rescues<br/><br/>My favorite episode, well let's just say I don't have just one, because I happened to enjoy all of them, but I will narrow it down if you're looking into checking it out . One episode that you must see is the episode where Dylan's dad dies, I myself was sympathetic to the character . The next best episode was of the 97-98 season, when the gang takes a trip to Hawaii, love is in the air, and everyone for that moment is just happy, but until the end where Kelly is shot .<br/><br/>If you are looking for a reason to quit doing drugs and drinking, check out the episode where David is addicted to speed , or when Kelly's co-dependency leads to her addiction with cocaine. Watch the chain of episodes where Dylan is over his head in drinking . If you are looking for abuse intervention, tune into the episode where Brandon mentors a physically abused boy, or when Donna overcomes her battering boyfriend (ray).

111,"Beverly Hills, 90210", Of course I'm going to give this icon show a 10,"I mean, I grew up with this show and it was a part of my life for 10 seasons, and I owe this show a 10 rating. I was 10 when the show premiered but still watched avidly. Beverly Hills 90210 addressed basically every area of life in all of their episodes. They had episodes of homophobia, racists, underage sex and pregnancies, death in the family, true love, and the importance of friendship. Their episodes were very informative and I love the writers for addressing the common issues the world faces today. To be honest, I came to dislike Brenda's character. The first seasons were kind of cheesy but things heated up when Tiffani Thiessen joined the cast as Valerie. The show got better, and had more interesting stories. I do think that they overplayed the whole valerie hating kelly thing though. They made them complete enemies. It was very sad when Jason Priestly left the show and then Tiffani a couple episodes later. They brought in the beautiful Vanessa Marcil, (to bring in another bad girl when valerie left the show) as Gina, and she did a good job, but the last 2 seasons were not my favorite. I still enjoyed it though. I watch the reruns often, and even own the dvd set. I could watch this show a million times over and never get sick of it.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,7 June 2019
112,"Beverly Hills, 90210"," For 10 Years, they were MY family.","This is the show that helped me get through the 90's! From sophomores  in high school to college graduates, I was hooked to the entire gang. I  will never forget Brandon, Kelly, Steve, Donna, Dylan, Valerie, David,  Brenda, Noah, or Clare.   In 1990, Aaron Spelling (Dynasty, Love Boat, Charlie's Angels)  unleashed the FOX teen drama Beverly Hills 90210, a show based on the  lives of the rich, snobbish high school students of Beverly Hills. Who  would have known the show would last 10 years? New to California,  siblings Brandon and Brenda made friends with the students of West  Beverly High. Through high school, David witnessed best buddy Scott  accidentally shoot himself, Donna kept her virginity, Brandon and  Andrea became great friends, Steve was the sexed up prankster, and  Brenda found out Dylan and Kelly were together when she was in Paris.  After graduating West Beverly, the gang moved onto college. Donna got  involved with abusive musician Ray, Brandon and Kelly dated, Brenda  moved away, Dylan got married only to have his bride shot and killed by  his rival, bitchy Valerie moved into the Walsh house and made enemies  with Kelly, Kelly's druggie boyfriend Colin got arrested, and many of  the gang had already had addictions (Dylan, Kelly, David, Valerie,  Colin). After college, the gang got out into the real world. Brandon  and Kelly nearly married, Dylan returned, Valerie accused Noah of rape,  Steve met and married Janet after getting her pregnant, Donna's sister  Gina moved to Beverly Hills, and in the end, Donna and David got  married.   The memories will never be forgotten.   Kelly getting shot at LAX, Donna loosing her virginity to David on  graduation night, Dylan's father ""killed"" in a car explosion, Kelly  caught in a fire at Steve's rave, Brenda/Dylan/Kelly/, Valerie and  Kelly rivalry, Andrea sleeping with married man, Gina slapping Kelly,  and David and Donna's series finale wedding.

113,"Beverly Hills, 90210", Truly Amazing,"This is one of my favorite shows. I really Love Kelly and Donna. There great teens. Kelly has the most beautiful hair and Donna is such a true and nice person. Kelly had her fair share of drug problems but was helped out by her friends. And Donna deserved to be happy with high school sweetheart David. And i was so happy when Brenda (Shannon D) left, she was so selfish. The show watched the teens go through high school, living on their own, going to college, dealing with adult stuff, to becoming adults. It was such a good journey. Kelly and Donna remained best friends throughout the show. For me being a teen, it's a great show to know you're not the only one having problems",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,9 November 2012

I've always felt that the Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley) character was the heart, soul, and moral center of the series. He had his demons of course, but don't we all. The other majors characters were well cast, and really made you think about the years when we were in high school. But there's one thing that's bothering me, especially since I looked up the IMDb page when the show was finally being released on DVD. I've seen almost every episode of this series.

117,"Beverly Hills, 90210", A very good serial,"I remember seeing this serial in my home country, Russia, somewhere around 1996 or 1997. That was quite a sensation. A real American show, and about real American young people, like me or my pals. And what was the best thing in all that was that all those problems and joys that they had in their sunny California were very close and clear for us in colder Russia. We, men, soon fell in love with beautiful girls of the serial - Jenny Garth, Kathleen Robertson (who was especially cool as Claire Arnold, the rascally sweet daughter of President Arnold), Tori Spelling or any other lady in there. Girls went slightly mad (Do not bite me for this, I am just being kiddingly nostalgic!) with Luke Perry, Brian Austin Green or endearingly correct and always clean Jason Priestly. Well, all that the main characters had in the film was so clear and understandable for us - love, hate, school, money, family troubles, cowardice and friendship - no boundaries exist for such things. We followed each episode so closely and so attentively. Of course, the BH 90210 is not devoid of weaknesses - some roles are pretty shallow and some moments are way too sentimental. It seemed that each of the main heroes had to overcome all the possible and impossible hardships and ordeals in this life - drugs, sects, deaths, losses. Sometimes, it was too too much. Anyway, the serial still stands out well and still looks fresh and dear, which is a big asset of the film.",6 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,26 September 2006

Now, 10 years after it's entrance, after being put up against Dawson's and Felicity, the show has finally had to admit defeat.<br/><br/>In the beginning the show revolved around Brenda and Brandon Walsh who move to Beverly Hills, and form friendships with those who attend their school.

119,"Beverly Hills, 90210", I liked the show a lot throughout its entire run.,"I disagree with the comments that this show was not as good as it had been in the beginning after the High School days ended. I liked the 90210 the whole time it was on. But, I found that the show got a lot better once the characters were out of High School and cast changes were made. I personally never liked Brenda and was happy to see her leave the show. I was equally happy to see Valerie come into the cast. I was a huge fan of Tiffany Amber Thiessen and I was so happy to see her become a cast member and having her Valerie be so devious was a treat. The show needed a naughty character to balance all the goody girly girls on the show. Until, Valerie came along I thought the show was sappy because it was so preppy.  Valerie was a big refreshing change from the dull Brenda, who was a clueless bimbo. Valerie was a tough woman who was a mature woman of the 90s. I don't mean to put down the high school days, but I really liked the college and post-college years better. The story lines were better in those seasons, which were from 1994 to about 1999. Even when Brendan left the show was still good. Those years when Dylan left were good as well. In fact, I never thought that Dylan would return after he left. When he did I was surprised. I also was sorry to see Valerie leave at the end. But, by then I liked just about whatever the show did. Having Vanessa Marcil was a good addition too. I was a little disappointed with the finale episode but who isn't. I was just in college when this series ended, but that did not faze me from liking it. Kelly was my least favorite of all the original characters. She always seemed a little stuck  up loser. My favorite of the originally characters was Donna. I think she was awesome even if she was very preppy. However, Kelly always got what she wanted. Donna was just a sweet woman. So in summary, The high school years were okay. The years afterward were better.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,,22 November 2003

123,"Beverly Hills, 90210", ♥ The best TV show of the 90s ♥,"I have always adored Beverly hills 90210, since I was a kid. Brandon, Brenda, Kelly, Donna, Andrea, Dylan, David, Steve, Clare, Valerie &amp; co accompanied me through elementary school years, then high school, then life. This TV show is certainly the best of the 90s decade(if not the best ever!)and the new 90210 has nothing to do with it, really: it is just a boring, full of clichè and pale imitation of something that was almost flawless. The characters of the Original 90210 are so real that they manage to make us believe they really exist, somewhere in the amazingly beautiful Beverly Hills. We all feel we know deeply each of them, we all feel that warm sensation when we see their well-known faces on TV or on the page of a magazine: it is pure nostalgia. We all know by heart the amazing OST song and we miss them all now that TV shows characters mostly look like shallow, boring, selfish people with no ethic or good feelings inside, it is only a matter of ""appearing""; maybe that is the portrait of what we have become nowadays, and this is more than sad.

124,"Beverly Hills, 90210", A legendary TV series,"It's one of these series that have made history on TV, it's a legend and as the decades pass I feel that people will always talk about it. It's always interesting talking about its stories, its cast members, their characters and their off-screen lives and relationships.<br/><br/>All started when the Walsh family from Minnesota moved to Beverly Hills and siblings Brandon and Brenda became involved with a group of spoiled and coming from wealthy families kids. Actually I was never a regular viewer of the series in seasons 1-4. I wasn't into all these issue-based episodes and their morals in the first two seasons, although there were some good stories. And after that, the love triangle Brenda-Kelly-Dylan...OK. And let's go to the characters:<br/><br/>*Brenda, a selfish and rebellious girl who was interesting enough and was involved in some entertaining stories.<br/><br/>*Kelly, for some reason it was Kelly the girl I couldn't stand very much even if she grew throughout the show.<br/><br/>*Donna was always a foolish second-rate female character which I found funny enough.<br/><br/>*Andrea, who barely slept because she was too busy dealing with all her activities, most of the time went unnoticed for me.<br/><br/>*Brandon, the guy who tried so hard to adopt a cool way of walking and talking etc, a boring character who was involved in boring stories and fell in boring love with boring girls every now and then. Everything about him was so brandoning... sorry boring.<br/><br/>*Dylan, I always saw him as a junkie who caused me some kind of depression, the guy with the burned brain cells.<br/><br/>*Steve was Donna's male version but he never entertained me.<br/><br/>*David, the guy who rarely seemed in a good mood, barely smiled, dumped his best friend Scott to be with the cool gang of BH.<br/><br/>Maybe what was going on behind the scenes was way more catchy, Shannen Doherty behaving like a big-headed diva, her non-stop fights with Jennie Garth and all these onset troubles.<br/><br/>All of a sudden something changes in season 5 and guess what, Tiffani-Amber Thiessen arrives. I admit I had a huge crush on her and I still am a fan. Valerie, the sexy bad girl from Buffalo who came to fill the void after Brenda's departure, was the most interesting character of the entire show. Although she was the youngest of the cast members, she really brought some mature sexiness in the series (yes I know I'm not the first to say that). And Thiessen, the former America's sweetheart from ""Saved by the Bell"", was wonderful in portraying a charming multilevel character.<br/><br/>In the Valerie era the stories became much more interesting and although most of Brenda's fans stopped watching it, the show got better at least for the following three seasons. Kathleen Robertson's character Clare was also a good addition to the show. The renewed group of female characters, Kelly, Valerie, Donna and Clare was more appealing than the previous one with Brenda, Kelly, Donna and Andrea. I still wish I could watch Valerie and Brenda together though. Seasons 5-7 were the best for me and to be honest I could not wait to see the next episode. I didn't miss Luke Perry when he left, but Robertson's departure at the end of season 7 was a bit disappointing.<br/><br/>And then coming in the three final seasons, 8-10. Season 8 was still good enough but not as much entertaining as seasons 5-7. It was the beginning of kinda failed cast additions like Hilary Swank, Vincent Young, and later Lindsay Price, Daniel Cosgrove and Vanessa Marcil. I didn't like either of them. Furthermore, the show had the normal decline after so many years, but the major blow came in the beginning of season 9. At first we saw Jason Priestley, who seemed to me more and more boring, leaving the show. And then it was Tiffani-Amber Thiessen who left and that meant ""Beverly Hills, 90210"" was over for me. The episodes with both departures were season's peak in ratings and after Thiessen had left each episode was a new rating disaster until the end of season 10 and the series finale. Even Perry's return didn't help the show which was so deformed.<br/><br/>It's difficult to rate a series as a whole since it has its ups and downs throughout its running. But in my opinion I have to rate it according to its impact on me at least in a certain period that I was a regular viewer. My favorite seasons were 5-7 and they made me such a huge fan of ""Beverly Hills, 90210"". Even now I am always interested in everything around that series and I feel lucky that I'm part of that generation that grew up watching the most famous TV teen drama.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,5 November 2015
125,Scorpion, This show operates in it's own reality. That's not a good thing.,"Just watched the pilot of /Scorpion.<br/><br/>If you're thinking of doing the same, don't. I beg you, don't.<br/><br/>I'll just start with the plot:<br/><br/>*Four or five ""Geniuses"" with personality disorders (you can't be smart and well-adjusted, duh!) are recruited by the government to solve an impossible problem: LAX air traffic control software has crashed.<br/><br/>I call this an impossible problem not because it's tough to solve, but because it's impossible for this to be a problem. Air Traffic Control software *does* crash, and there are procedures, including manually-operated light signals, in place at every major airport around the world to handle situations exactly like these.<br/><br/>Oh, well, why don't they just patch the software? Because the company that made the software went out of business twenty years ago. (Yet somehow they just released an auto-update? And they didn't provide the source code to such critical infrastructure software in a software escrow deal, as is standard industry practice for infrastructure applications?) So, they have to get a copy of the old software from a backup.<br/><br/>Oh no! It's about to backup again! Our intrepid team has only five minutes to get into the backup datacenter to pull the hard drive!...Because nobody has ever heard of differential backups. They literally only have one backup of this critical software, and they write over the same tape every day. Again, any IT professional should be pulling out their hair at this -- this is a textbook example of what DOESN'T EVER HAPPEN because only someone as stupid as a /scorpion writer hasn't considered the possibility of a backup failure.<br/><br/>So, half the team heads to the datacenter to retrieve the backup hard drive before LAX -- which is completely dark, and doesn't have communication with any systems -- somehow uploads it's software backup and overwrites the 'good' version of the software. Yes, they're blacked out from communications, but still have a link to their off-site- backup center. And they can't pull software from it, they can only send. And they can't just unplug the line to the datacenter, they have to go and rip out the hard drive.<br/><br/>*Sigh*<br/><br/>Still with me? It actually gets worse.<br/><br/>So, a car audio speaker that's in the car being used to transport the hard drive -- physically -- back to LAX managed to wipe the hard drive, because magnets. Possible? Yes. Plausible? Not unless you decide to store the hard drive on top of your subwoofers, instead of, oh, I don't know, maybe your LAP?<br/><br/>So, our team is screwed. But wait! There's another chance! If they can get one of these 777's to fly low enough, they can wirelessly ( I thought that was broken?) transmit the software on the plane to ground control. This plane flew from a different time zone! It still has the old software!<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Yes. We're supposed to believe that planes carry the same software that LAX uses for Air Traffic Control, and that it's small enough to be transmitted in a fly-by. Oh, wait, that doesn't work, because of the ""Speed differential"" of about ~200mph. Those are some slow freaking radio waves, that's all I'm saying.<br/><br/>The obvious solution? Hotwire a random Ferrari 458 sitting on the tarmac. Blow the roof in dramatic fashion. Get the Ferrari up to 200+ mph on a 4000-foot runway. (For reference, the 458's reported top speed is 201mph. It takes a lot more than 4000 feet, though.)<br/><br/>But that's not all! The 777's pilot must descend to 8 feet off the runway, and rather than land, download the software, and sort everything out, they decide that the best course of action is to send the co-pilot down into the wheel well, open the well at 200+ mph, and THROW A FREAKING ETHERNET CABLE INTO THE FERRARI.<br/><br/>I SWEAR TO GOD.<br/><br/>I couldn't finish it. I had to turn it off. (This was the climax, so I only missed the ending. Frankly, I feel I was generous.)<br/><br/>This is a show for dumb people. It is a show for dumb people to feel good about themselves because all the ""smart people"" in the show have weird personality disorders, and say things that dumb people think smart people actually say. It's a show for people so completely devoid of rational thought that they can look at this show and not see the swiss-cheese style plot holes.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this show. In 100 words, the premise sounds good. In production, it's so bad that it's actually offensive. It's like the writers are deliberately trying to make the show this bad. The acting was as good as can be expected. The action was very action-y. But there was no rational or logical explanation for the bullshit in the script that the writers are trying to pass off as a television show. A fourteen-year-old could write a better show than this.",607 out of 849 found this helpful.,1.0,23 September 2014

Being in my position I also see it in every other show or blockbuster movie. They don't make anything to be 100% believable. They make it to be fun and entertaining. I would like to see them get a technical consultant to help with this problem, but I don't feel it takes away from the shows entertainment value.<br/><br/>With the obvious aside lets talk about the show itself. Four socially awkward genius's. Yes it does follow the role that smart people cant be socially engaging, but it does add the to entertainment value.<br/><br/>The first episode drops our main characters into a very stressful situation. This lead to great character development that most shows take half a season to reach. After one episode I felt I knew and could relate to each character personally.

What's up with that? <br/><br/>* The butthole genius leader responds to every damn question or comment with, ""Don't worry, it'll work... maybe"" or ""It's OK, you'll be safe... probably"" or ""Of course I'll follow his orders... mostly"".<br/><br/>* The writers completely misunderstand that KNOWLEDGE is the accumulation of information but INTELLIGENCE is the ability to organize knowledge to synthesize solutions, explanations, understandings, etc. The genius characters are all data banks of insanely diverse information (sure, I know top-of-head how to break into and start a filthy expensive sports car I've probably never seen in real life and which has a complex encrypted RFID transponder anti-theft circuit) and other minutia that they instantly recite. But they do no actual problem solving.<br/><br/>* Lame stereotypes like the genius man-child who get so wrapped up in his math that he forgets to pay the utility bill. They have many other geniuses loitering together but none of them is smart enough to say ""set up automatic online bill payment"" or ""put a Post-It note reminder on the toilet, you'll be sure to see it there"".<br/><br/>* The butthole genius leader tried to do a rapid file exchange by connecting to a jet's wi-fi signal as it flew low over the control tower. But if he was such a genius why didn't he calculate the less-than-a second time span the jet and tower wi-fi would be within range of each other, or the Doppler shift, or the time the wi-fi would take to handshake and connect? Or set up a Pringles ""cantenna""? Or better still, why not USE THE FAA AIR-TO-GROUND PACKET RADIO DATA LINK THAT ALL U.S. JETS HAVE? <br/><br/>* Pairing the starched, straight-laced Homeland Security agent with the devil-may-care genius who plays by his own rules is the same kind of ""oil and water"" TV buddy pairing that died with the 1980's and stayed dead for good reason. I can't believe someone brought it back.<br/><br/>* Where did the butthole learn high-performance high-speed driving in a car he's probably never touched before let alone ever driven? <br/><br/>* Why would a passenger jet have such a long ethernet cable on board? <br/><br/>* When the butthole driver tells the waitress to hit the roof release button, why did she slam the roof off with her hands? What part of ""button"" was hard to understand? <br/><br/>* Why did the flight office have to climb down on the landing gear? Couldn't he have tied the cable to a metal coffee pot or something and just drop it out the hatch? <br/><br/>* At 250 miles per hour, wouldn't the unweighted ethernet cable have been whipping around wildly in the wind? <br/><br/>* If they were in a car that could match the speed of the jet, and could get 20 feet away from the jet, why didn't the butthole try the wi-fi again now that he was in better, faster range? <br/><br/>* How the Hell was a laptop dangling from an ethernet cable able to relay thesoftware package to the tower by wi-fi that was somehow faster than the ethernet cable, then install the flight control software, poll all the tracking sensors and radar, and update the flight status displays, in less time than it took to brake a high-performance car going at 250miles per hour? <br/><br/>What the Hell... the 1960's Batman TV series was more realistic.",138 out of 220 found this helpful.,2.0,27 September 2014
134,Scorpion, Ridiculously Stupid,"I just finished watching the pilot and was so infuriated by how dumb the show is I made an account just to make a review. For an episode that involves technology and hacking, you would think the creators would at least run the premise by someone with a basic understanding of computers or you know, common sense. Lets list a few of these dumb things:<br/><br/>1) LAX Air Traffic software update goes wrong and communication is down. Solution: Call your system administrator. You don't need FBI to track down someone with an IQ of 197 to tell you to recover your software from a backup hardrive.<br/><br/>2) What kind of world class data center that stores air traffic controller software is unmanned!? <br/><br/>3) An audio speaker demagnetizes a hardrive? I think they are a little more sturdy than that.<br/><br/>4) Backup hardrive is dead, game over. Oh wait, good thing every plane has an EXACT copy of the software used by the air traffic controller. Yeah that makes total sense...<br/><br/>There are so many plot holes in this pilot I can't believe it made it to TV. Don't waste your time watching this.",215 out of 351 found this helpful.,1.0,22 September 2014
135,Scorpion, Stupid plot,"This was disappointing. I liked the characters and the show's premise had potential. The plot however, was so contrived and so divorced from reality that I had to stop watching after the 10th time I shouted ""That's not the way that works!"" at the TV.<br/><br/>Everything from computer and network technology gaffes to a basic misunderstanding of how radios work between aircraft and from ground to air, and the fact that airliners have the ability to divert to a different airport if their original destination airport is shut down... for *whatever* reason -- including snow storms and other bad weather. This actually happens on a fairly regular basis.<br/><br/>Once you realize that pilots can make intelligent decisions and land their aircraft with or without air traffic control help, then the whole ""airliners gonna fall out of the sky"" problem goes away.<br/><br/>I'm not demanding total realism from a TV show.

Warning: There be spoilers below.<br/><br/>Comms at LAX are out, and we have no way to talk to planes that are in route. Fix it now or people die. I said, maybe it'll get better, but here's a brief summary of other stupidity.<br/><br/>They had to go to a restaurant to get wifi. They use an off-site backup system that apparently goes to an unmanned data center. Their backup system has no concept of history. If it backs up again, it'll overwrite the previous backup. They grabbed the backup by yanking one of the drives out of a RAID array. Uh huh. Ferrari meets plane. Nuf said. The plane has 50 foot USB cable just laying around. Know how rare a 50-foot USB cable is? Just go try to find one at Best Buy! The plane itself has a USB port. You can beat a Grandmaster in eight chess moves. The landing software running on planes is the same as the software that runs in the airport. Not the same brand. The same exact software, so you can just copy one from the other. And it's downloadable via a 20 MB/s USB connection that you only get for 7 seconds. So... That means that the entire software is &lt;140 MB. Uh huh.<br/><br/>This is just what I can think of off the top of my head.<br/><br/>All it was missing was the sharks.",179 out of 294 found this helpful.,1.0,22 September 2014

I am not an expert by any measure, but I find this TV show extremely entertaining :) There's suspense where you need it, romance where you need it, the characters are well-built with their own persona and backgrounds, the plot is understandable, easy to follow, and the actors are very believable (yes, I think so!!). Also, FINALLY a TV show with no blood splatters and no visits to the morgue (such a deja-vu lately), just fascinating brains at work...so refreshing!

138,Scorpion," Beyond bad, the anti-CSI","Let's compare Scorpion to a show like CSI. CSI has an intelligent script, is well acted and generally keeps the viewer immersed in suspense. CSI has a feel to it that adds a layer of depth. There is some humor and the characters are varying degrees of like-able. <br/><br/>Scorpion does not have an intelligent script. It's like the writers have zero technical understanding but decided to write a techno- thriller anyway. The characters are not like-able. Bad acting, embarrassing script, laughable at best. The casting decisions were off by a solar system. Should have taken all that money spent on advertising and put it into the show. This is what you get when people with below average IQs try to write a show about geniuses. <br/><br/>As far as the characters go Elyes Gabel/Walter O'Brien: There is not a lot to like about this guy. While they try to write him as unable to be emotional and awkward, they also try to write him as a genius stud with regard to some of his interactions. It did not work. Picture Jesse Eisenberg from ""The Social Network"" as your watermark. Perfectly written, perfectly acted. They did not try to make him something he's not. At the same time, Eisenberg's character was actually like-able in the movie and you find yourself rooting for this guy who is a tremendous jerk. If Eisenberg is a 10, Gabel is a 3<br/><br/>Katharine McPhee/Paige Dineen: The biggest positive I can think of is she was named after an excellent hockey player. Other than that, she is not believable as a mother, especially as a mother of a child with developmental difficulties. She has too much bounce and not enough protective instinct.<br/><br/>Eddie Kaye Thomas/Toby Curtis: It's Finch from American Pie! This guy might have the highest ceiling on the show but some of the writing for him was ridiculous. The whole premise of the backup drive scene killed anything he had to offer to it. His acting on the show is not bad at all.<br/><br/>Jadyn Wong/Happy Quinn: Eesh. I don't know if they re-dubbed her but in the beginning her voice didn't match her mouth. It seemed like that happened a lot. She might just not have the ability to project and when she does it sounds like she's forcing her lines out. Any line she delivered made my girlfriend and I pause and look at each other wondering how just about anyone can get on TV these days.<br/><br/>Ari Stidham/Sylvester Dodd: I liked the guy the most out of the cast. The writing for him was not awful and he seemed genuinely delighted to play chess with the young boy. At the same time, some bad writing decisions, (the scene at the chalkboard is kind of a stretch, not the result, the ""order of the pieces"" discussion). <br/><br/>Great premise but failed to deliver. This is officially off my record list. I am guessing it won't last over eight episodes. Seriously? A hard line into a computer from a jet? A twelve year old might write that.",156 out of 266 found this helpful.,1.0,22 September 2014
139,Scorpion, Don't be fooled - this is awful.,"I see a lot of reviews here saying ""It's just television, it doesn't have to be realistic, just entertaining"" - as if that was an excuse for bad writing. But there is no excuse for the mindbogglingly awful writing exhibited in the pilot of Scorpion.<br/><br/>There was a time when thriller writers realized they couldn't just keep making stuff up as they went along, but actually had to do their homework. This was some time in the 80s - last century, folks. If you write about something, you'd better know the basics. Yes, it's fine to sacrifice realism for drama and entertainment. All good shows and movies do that. But the good shows do something else also: they play by their own rules and make it easy for the viewer to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>Scorpion does neither. The writers of this series clearly don't know the first thing about most of the stuff they're writing about. They don't know about aviation, they don't know about information technology, they constantly change and break their own rules, and as a result, we have a plot with holes so big you could fly a 777 through them.<br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead)<br/><br/>Am I really to believe that LAX does not have any sysadmins? That their most crucial piece of software was made by a company that went out of business 20 years ago? That that same software from the same company suddenly and without warning got a software update nobody knew about? That all planes in the world run the same software? That they store their backups in an unmanned, unsecured data centre somewhere in the boondocks of L.A., in what looks like a garage complex? That they have only one backup that gets overwritten every 12 hours? That the IQ 197 geniuses can just simply deduce by the pricking of their thumbs which hard drive that backup sits on, out of a choice of, well, thousands? That they can just rip out this one hard drive and connect it to a random laptop to retrieve the software? That you can hover a 777 8 feet above a runway long enough to throw a conveniently long ethernet lead down to a Ferrari driving below them at 250mph, to hook up to a laptop and download the software, which at the same time gets transferred via Wireless to a nearby control tower and from there to LAX tower, which, for all intents and purposes, is incomunicado?<br/><br/>I'm sorry. This pilot episode was nothing but a load of hogwash. Suspension of disbelief broke after ten minutes. From there on it wasn't entertainment any more, it was just annoying. Don't be fooled by the currently high ratings. This series has had an awful start, and one star is still too much.",82 out of 136 found this helpful.,1.0,1 October 2014
140,Scorpion, Really?,"Who writes this stuff? This was the worst plot and story line ever. No technical advice seemed to be present. Dumbest show ever. That's not how aviation or airlines work. That's not how communications in the real aviation world work. Where did these writers come up with this fantasy garbage? The problems go on and on with the writing on this pilot episode. Additionally, the electrical box? Really? A train switching station? Come on writers. Do a little homework. Hire a few consultants. It's every bit as bad as snakes on a plane. Stupid, stupid stupid. The female a actor who plays the electrical genius has no acting skill. The message of poor geniuses is also tired and run out. Your choice of math genius is pathetic. Is this the best that CBS can do for the new season?

141,Scorpion," No summary here, because you should watch it before you read the review. ;)","I love this show! Why? Because I can enjoy something without having troubles about the car hifi magnets deleting a hard drive. OK the scene with the Ferrari and the plane was ridiculous but fun. But as somebody here are complaining the problem wasn't that radio waves aren't fast enough to get the plane. It was that the connection between plane and laptop has not been stable long enough because of the distance between plane and laptop. ;) But that is not the point. I love that show, because I can see it grow over that ridiculous Ferrai vs. plane or magnets vs. hard drive writing. I can see the relationships between that lovely crazy people grow. I like to think that someone cares and understands these kid whose own mom doesn't get it, because it is not 'normal'. I was emotional attached in the scenes were the characters try to fit in but don't, because that's live. Everybody wants to be special, but mostly specialty comes with a price. And the price mostly is to not really fit in. So they are a bunch of underdog geniuses with great minds, great hearts but also great normal social behavior problems. I will give it a chance to put the science in order and be a nice watchable show.",86 out of 145 found this helpful.,10.0,26 September 2014

The basic idea was good. I like the actors. However, the script wasn't worthy of a junior high school student, and the science wasn't worthy of a 3rd grader. The special effects were overdone and completely unreal (but I guess that is now the Hollywood standard).<br/><br/>Really, really bad. It gets a one because the rating system doesn't go lower.

Further-all, when you are a genius, not per se you have to be a weird out of the world person that cannot communicate with anyone, this series is truly insulting the autistic community. All the characteristics they display really get on your nerves and is crossing the line of insult.

I can't give up Justified, I like it the way it is, even though it does require my suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>I read one review that made a statement that CSI was real, come on Crime Scene techs, interviewing witnesses, getting into gun battles? I am not down on that show; it goes for the same thing as Scorpion, interesting people doing the impossible and being fun to watch. <br/><br/>For me, the characters are the thing, they are likable, we get to know them and their issues, they are fun to watch as they interact and make mistakes, and yes, do things that could never really happen. <br/><br/>I like myth busters as much as anybody, (well, I did until they got rid of my favorite people on the show), but these shows are not meant to be real, just fun, with enjoyable and watchable characters, and here it succeeds.

145,Scorpion, Don't listen to the haters-Scorpion is fantastic!,"To all the 'genius' critics who think they are so smart, pointing out all the flaws in Scorpion like some sort of scientific professors of TV shows, commenting that it is unoriginal and cliché---Please take a look at all the negative reviews of this show and try to differentiate yours. You can't, can you? Your pretentious reviews are just as cliché as you think Scorpion is. I bet you are extremely impressed with your enlightening review in which you discuss how the show is unbelievable- because I for one TOTALLY didn't notice that a girl standing up out of the roof of a sports car holding a laptop connected to a cable coming from an airplane flying a foot above her head was unbelievable. So thanks for pointing that out for me.<br/><br/>WHAT I AM SAYING IS, I don't think this show is MEANT to be very realistic. Pretty sure the writers are aware of the content within their own scripts. Most TV shows and movies ARE NOT realistic- that's not the point of entertainment! DUH! If you want realistic, watch a documentary, or hey, even more realistic: watch some paint dry. I've read some people comment on how CSI is way better than Scorpion because it is ""realistic""Um.I'm pretty sure that the actors on CSI do that exact same thing where they type 800words/minute and the computer magically solves every crazy problem, hacks into any system, and they are able to zoom so far in on security cam photos that you can see the criminals pores. The point is, you watch entertainment and shows like Scorpion for the action, the likable characters, the entertainment factor, and Scorpion has ALL of that. Plus, it's fun, friendly, and can appeal to a wide age range. My younger sister (10), my dad(an old guy), and myself (18), all LOVE this show.<br/><br/>In each negative review, I'm seeing 'premise good &amp; execution bad'. Yes, the premise is excellent, but the execution is excellent as well. The only thing wrong here is. a bunch of bitter reviewers.<br/><br/>Of course you are all entitled to your own opinions, as am I, and I'll stop the bashing now. I'd like to thank all of you negative reviewers for helping us dumb folk out there realize the flaws that you assume we failed to notice while watching our show.

147,Scorpion, A Mission Impossible for the 21st century.,There really is a Walter O'Brian . And he really does have a IQ of 197. And he does have a company called Scorpion that helps people. But there the facts and fiction take a different path. Like the Stuntman who called himself the Human Fly and dressed up like a superhero. His real life and his reel life had to take a different path. The human fly dressed up like a superhero does not mean he fought supervillans like MArvel comics had you believe.<br/><br/>The Real Story of Walter O'Brian may or may not have made for a good TV show. But the fact that he might've done a few interesting things along the path to heading up his own company is Not what's important. The Very words used at the beginning are this is BASED on the life of Walter O'Brian . It does not state that it's a accurate portrayal of Walter O Brian's life. The people who don't get that should just give up watching TV.<br/><br/>Like the Show Based on Colonal Greg Pappy Boyington's black Sheep Squadron that was fiction.<br/><br/>Anyways the premise is that Walter O'Brian is a genius with a IQ of 197 . He uses his genius to help the department of homeland security to solve crimes and take down bad guys when conventional means do not apply. The premise to me actually plays out like a Mission Impossible for the 21st century. Walter has his crew of Misfits/ genius who work for the company he started called Scorpion. Along the way we meet them. There is Happy a woman who is brilliant at machines and cars and tools not so good with people. There is Toby a psychological genius who can read people amongst other gifts. But he is a addictive personality. Slyvester a man who is simply a master of numbers and has a photographic memory. but is scared of life. Alongside their handler Cabe they are the ones you call on when things are too baffling and homeland security is on the line.<br/><br/>Now I enjoy the show for what it is. a hour of escapism and adventure nothing more. The chemistry amongst the cast is the strongest I've seen all year. That alone makes the show compelling TV because you get to care about them. When a single mother Kate brings her genius son Ralph to Scorpion to help her understand him. Kate's job is to provide a link to Walter and the rest to reality. while they help her understand her son better. KAte and Ralph provide a good strong grounding point here which is to say it gives this show it's humanity. I like this show a lot simply because it's not a cookie cardboard cutout. It's a show that's trying to use a brain with its heart. A rarity these days.

Sad, because I do like some of the actors who are involved.<br/><br/>I won't delve into spoiler land, by listing all of the places where I laughed out loud, as I suspect many others were doing the same thing (and, if they weren't, then maybe there is some sort of audience for this craziness).",240 out of 458 found this helpful.,1.0,22 September 2014

When has anyone ever managed to connect to a Wi-Fi network in under a second, let alone download something from it? Fine, maybe the writers of this show don't have a Wi-Fi at home, but they've probably been in a Starbucks at some point in their lives (writing terrible teleplays, no doubt).

You may like it, or you may not believe that you're watching something like this, but either way, it will somehow get to you.<br/><br/>The story lines are focused around SpongeBob, an energetic sea sponge who lives in a pineapple under the sea. Each episode focuses around him and his misadventures with other people in his town known as Bikini Bottom. His best friend is the dopey starfish Patrick, his other best friend is the land squirrel who lives in a submarine home, Sandy. Other characters in the show are SpongeBob's drowsy neighbor, Squidward, his boss at work, Mr. Krabs, the evil Plankton, and the driving school teacher Mrs. Puff. There are a bunch of other characters in the show, but most episodes are focused around them. <br/><br/>These days, Nickelodeon hasn't been doing so well. Most of their new shows are spin offs of old shows, and most of the new shows aren't good at all. SpongeBob is very reminiscent of older Nickelodeon shows. Elements like quirky humor, annoying neighbors, fun plot lines, slightly dark humor in a few episodes(not as much as the old Nickelodeon shows), mishaps at work, worst enemies, and mishaps due to SpongeBob's antics all make this show great. There are times when this show can become stupid, as a matter of fact, every episode uses stupidity in a certain way. Some episodes are smartly written, and in odd ways, certain episodes have a message in them. <br/><br/>There is nothing in this show that should make parents feel uncomfortable. In most episodes, there is some type of adult humor that adults and teens will find to be funny. <br/><br/>Everyone should see this show.

This show is set in the small town of Bikini Bottom (a town under the sea that is home to many sea worthy creatures)- including a spontaneous sponge named Spongebob. He lives with his pet snail, Gary, next to two neighbors- a grumpy clarinet playing octopus- Squidward, and his best friend who is a starfish who couldn't tell his hand from his foot- named Patrick. He also has a friend who lives in an air dome, and she's a Texas native squirrel named Sandy, who got bored with life above water, so she moved to the ocean. Spongebob works at the Krusty Krab along with Squidward, a popular restaurant owned by the greedy Mr. Krabbs. And there is Plankton- a microscopic sea creature who owns his own restaurant- The Chum Bucket- a very unpopular restaurant, that hasn't gotten a customer since it's opening- so, of course, Plankton is always out to steal Mr. Krabbs' secret Krabby Patty formula, causing trouble for the krusty krew.

While teens and adults will enjoy a lot of adult and more witty humor that passes over little kids heads.<br/><br/>The show takes place underwater. The main character, SpongeBob, is a talking sponge, who works as a fry cook for Mr. Krabs, the greedy owner of the Krusty Krab. He also works with his depressing and more sophisticated next door neighbor, Squidword Tentacles, who is constantly annoyed by SpongeBob's crazy, stupid antics. SpongeBob's other neighbor and long-life best friend, Patrick Star, is a talking pink starfish that maybe the most stupid character ever. There is also Plankton, a tiny but evil character that is jealous of Mr. Krab's restaurant and always is trying to steal his formula for the sacred Krabby Patty, but he always ends up failing miserably. Then there is Sandy Cheeks, a squirrel that for some reason lives underwater in a space-suit. Sandy befriends SpongeBob and Patrick and loves to do exciting things with them. are these not the most ridiculous characters.<br/><br/>You might be thinking, this sounds stupid. Well it is stupid, thats the beauty of the show. The premise is so ridiculous that anything can happen. None of the episodes ever continue the story and plot of the previous episode. Its a cartoon. Every new episode starts a new story. And the story lines of the episodes are just sometimes ridiculous, but the characters in the show are so good that everything works. Squidword is a great straight-man for the comedy. He seems to hate his life because SpongeBob and Patrick are constantly ruining things for him. Not on purpose, SpongeBob and Patrick are just stupid. Especially Patrick who is my favorite character. The show at times seems to make a point on how stupid he really is. Sometimes Patrick seems mentally retarded. But he is good at heart along with SpongeBob. Mr. Krabs on the other hand is just plain greedy. His character amuses me because he is so cheap that its ridiculous. He'll do anything to save a dollar or make an extra penny. And Plankton is the worst one of them all. Plankton comes up with these Genius plans to steal the Krabby Patty formula but he has one problem, he is an 8th of the size of everyone else. all of these characters make for great comedy.<br/><br/>There is stupid comedy in SpongeBob, but there is also a lot of jokes and situations that only adults can understand. There is dark humor and even some witty jokes. Sometimes you will even see some references to pop-culture events. Kids will enjoy the silly stuff when adults and teens will enjoy some of the other jokes.<br/><br/>This cartoon is unique because its a kids cartoon but all the main characters are full-grown adults. Yes there sea creatures but they are grown-ups. But SpongeBob and Patrick act like little kids. Thats what I find charming about the show.<br/><br/>Watch SpongeBob Squarepants! Any age can find humor in the show.",71 out of 88 found this helpful.,10.0,22 August 2007
155,SpongeBob SquarePants, The Best Cartoon Ever!,"Spongebob Squarepants is a sea-sponge. He is shaped in a rectangle, and is in the form of a common household sponge. He lives in a pineapple under the sea, in the town of Bikini Bottom. <br/><br/>He is often found to be annoying his cynical neighbor Squidward, the grouchy Clarinet playing squid next door, who definitely thinks the sea is half empty. <br/><br/>Next to Squidward is a large rock, where dwells a starfish with about as much intelligence as his home-sweet home. He is Patrick Star, neighbor to Squidward, but lifelong friend to Spongebob. <br/><br/>Over yonder lives a 'land squirrel' by the name of Sandy Cheeks. Her hobbies include the search for the 'Hay in the Needlestack', to biking in the Industrial Park. <br/><br/>Finally there's Mr. Eugene H. Krabs, penny hugging/pinching proprietor of the Krusty Krab; Spongbob's beloved workplace, and the home of the Krabby Patty.<br/><br/>On the subject of the Krabby Patty, that brings us to the esteemed Sheldon Plankton, arch-rival to Mr. Krabs, and generally very evil. His constant attempts to steal the Krabby Patty make for very funny episodes.<br/><br/>In Summery, this show can be summed up with a single word: Brilliant. It is witty, smart, extremely funny, with timeless characters, appealing to all ages.<br/><br/>10/10 A Classic!",118 out of 155 found this helpful.,,23 February 2005
156,SpongeBob SquarePants, I love Spongebob,"I first discovered Spongebob square pants while I was on holiday in Florida. It dawned on me when I got back to England that we could get it on Nickelodean so I started watching it all the time and loved it! It's basically a kids show although sometimes it does have some jokes that are obviously intended to go way over children's heads. And I love it for that. Loads of my friends love the show and we're all surprised that we could be so entertained by a small yellow sponge who lives in a pineapple! Oddly enough though, my favourite character is not Spongebob. I love Squidward and Plankton and their bitter bored outlook to life. They seem remarkably cynical for Nickelodean which is why this show is a breath of fresh air and hugely popular.",60 out of 76 found this helpful.,,9 August 2005
157,SpongeBob SquarePants," Loved seasons 1-5, 6-9 were just bad.","This show has to be one of the greatest shows of all time, if your not counting seasons 6-9, I know most people say either seasons 1-3 were the only good ones or 1-3 were amazing 4-5 were OK, but I think season 5 was good it might just be nostalgia talking but there were definitely good episodes in seasons 4-5.<br/><br/>Lets face it all the episodes in seasons 1-3 were amazing (even though Gary takes a bath still creeps me out) and there were definitely good ones in 4-5 such as: Dunces and Dragons, Krusty towers, Have you seen this snail?, Partick smartpants and I could go on for hours but those are some in my opinion. There are also good episodes from season 6 and a couple from 7 like: Spongicus, SB vs The Big One, Dear vikings, Sand castles in the sand, Truth or Square and Pineapple fever and yet again I could go on and on, good ones from 7 are: Spongebobs last stand, That sinking feeling, Krusty dogs and enchanted tiki dreams.<br/><br/>I think it is time to end this amazing show though.

158,SpongeBob SquarePants, Great show for all ages,"I have been watching this show since I was about 9, and I am now almost 14 and I still find it hilarious. It doesn't contain profanity or harsh language, so it's appropriate for all ages. Even though I also enjoy shows on MTV, I believe that Spongebob Squarepants is a great show for all ages. Even my mom enjoys it. When I first saw the plot line, a story about a sponge who lives undersea, I thought it would be stupid. But I've been watching it for 5 years so obviously it stuck with me. Spongebob wouldn't be anything without Patrick Star, Spongebob's dumb neighbor and best friend. Spongebob Squarepants can teach you lessons, it can make you laugh, it maybe will even make you cry. Even though Spongebob is supposed to be an adult, it shows that you're never too old to act younger than you are. Spongebob is a great show no matter how old or young you are.",85 out of 116 found this helpful.,,4 September 2005
159,SpongeBob SquarePants, The best cartoon ever?,"I've only just started getting into cartoons again after not watching them for so long. I heard about Spongebob Squarepants and decided to check it out. Now I watch every episode religiously! It's amazing! I don't think I ever seen anything as surreal or as funny in a kids show as this! The show takes place in Bikini Bottom, an underwater town. Spongebob Squarepants (voiced by the amazingly talented Ton Kenny) is a sponge that works as a fry cook at the Crusty Krab, run by one Mr Krabs (voiced by Tom Clancy who many people will remember from Shawshank Redemption). Spongebob is a kid at heart and a little stupid, but gets up to the most amazing adventures. Alongside Spongebob are his best friend Patrick Starfish (Bill Fagerbakke) who is even more stupid than Spongebob, Sandy Cheeks (Carolyn Lawrence) a squirrel that lives underwater for some reason, Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass) Spongebobs moody next door neighbour, Mrs Puff (Mary Jo Catlett) Spongebob's driving instructor and Plankton (Mr Lawrence) a very tiny sea animal with a Napoleon Complex.<br/><br/>What makes the show so funny is the situations that Spongebob and his friend Patrick get themselves into. They are both very stupid and child like, meaning that they get into trouble on a regular basis, which makes for exciting episodes. There are some huge laugh out loud moments and some of them stuff that they get up to will make your stomach churn with laughter. All the characters are amazingly put together and they all work. Each have their own personality which allows them to carry on the story and let Spongebob interact with them all.<br/><br/>One of the funniest stories is the send up of Batman and Robin where Spongebob and Patrick try to bring out of retirement their two favourite heroes. Mermaid Man (Ernist Borgnine) and Barnacle Boy (Tim Conway). Anyone who's ever watched the classic Adam West Batman will appreciate the humour of this episode! All in all, a very funny cartoon. It's insane enough for kids to enjoy, but also so funny that many adults will enjoy it (as long as they get the humour). Take it for what it is. Don't' try and analyse it. Just watch and enjoy.<br/><br/>Oh and one more thing. In one episode, the background music is provide by metals most greatest heroes, PANTERA!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>10/10!!!!!",64 out of 87 found this helpful.,,26 June 2005
160,SpongeBob SquarePants, Someone needs to take a stand and end the show before it is degraded even more.,"Once upon a time, Spongebob Squarepants was the largest jewel in Nickelodeon's crown. It was charming, clever, and genuinely hilarious. It was a huge part of my childhood. My friends and I recite lines from the old episodes all the time, and we still laugh at them! Then, the movie came. Oh, don't get me wrong; the movie was pure gold! But since then, the great Stephen Hillenburg left the show and allowed it to rot away.<br/><br/>Nowadays, our favorite undersea sponge has been cut down, degraded, and utterly destroyed. That obnoxious, overly-emotional yellow square in the newer episodes? That is not Spongebob. It can't be. I really feel that kids should not be allowed to watch him anymore. It is a widely-known fact that kids imitate what they see; and believe me when I say that you DON'T want them imitating ""Spongebob."" He is far too emotionally disturbed. One minute he is unbearably and obnoxiously ecstatic for no reason, and the next he is screaming and crying like a particularly difficult baby. And he doesn't cry for a few seconds in a funny way, he cries for minutes on end like an unfortunate soul burning in hell; meaning that it is mentally painful to watch. Yeah, no one should let their kid mimic this kind of behavior. On top of all that, his voice has become incredibly high pitched and nerve-grating. Maybe Tom Kenny's overused the voice and now he's losing it. Whatever the reason is, it doesn't change the fact that it is incredibly annoying.<br/><br/>And speaking of annoying, the show itself has simply lost it's touch with the humor. The old episodes were incredibly witty, and appealing to all ages. I still laugh at the jokes to this day. But then, one day I decided to watch a newer episode of Spongebob. I was horrified at what I saw; there was no actual humor, just attempts at humor that fell extremely flat. None of the jokes were funny! I found myself sitting there, trying to FORCE myself to laugh. But nothing at all was even a tiny bit amusing. The verbal jokes were incredibly lazy and dry, and many times felt forced. The physical humor was not any better. The writers for the show were running out of ideas--I could tell.<br/><br/>I also have a few things to say about the animation. I don't know what happened, but I think the older episodes looked a lot better, and more rugged like other cartoons such as The Angry Beavers (great show, by the way). The newer episodes' animation features brighter colors, rounder, thicker characters, and obnoxious details that really should have been left out. Spongebob's face, for example, conveys far too much happiness and ecstasy, to the point were it gets a tad frightening. In fact, all the characters express far too intense emotions at times that are either very annoying, or borderline scary. In summation, if the look of a show is important to you, maybe you should stay away from the newer episodes of this far too long-running TV series.<br/><br/>Someone needs to take a stand against Nickelodeon, for subjecting us to watch this garbage that used to be gold. If this show had stopped after the movie was released, every individual who grew up with Spongebob would have been a lot happier. Please, only watch the old episodes. The new ones are so awful, it actually fills me with pain to think about them. Also, keep your kids away from the show. Spongebob has become a terrible emotional influence. Unless you want your kids to become horrible bipolar monsters, STAY AWAY FROM THE NEW EPISODES. Only let them watch seasons one through three. Nickelodeon needs to end the reformed Spongebob's reign of terror.",34 out of 44 found this helpful.,,8 February 2012
161,SpongeBob SquarePants," Masterful, perhaps mis-targeted, surreal stream-of-consciousnessparody","""SpongeBob SquarePants"" is an hilarious and often unpredictable cartoon series aired at this writing on Nickelodeon.  Its regular times are Saturday &amp; Sunday mornings, with occasional marathons and a semi-regular feature on Nick's Friday evening U-Vote feature.  The massive amount of hype surrounding its release in mid-1999 suggests that the Nickelodeon staff really likes the show.<br/><br/>The series is clearly for adults, in the same sense as ""The Simpsons"" and ""Beavis and Butthead"" are.  The marketing, however, is quite child-oriented, and somehow, the series has become associated with other Nickelodeon features which actually offer redeeming social value for children, viz ""Wild Thornberrys"" and ""Blue's Clues"".  I don't mind, personally--I enjoy watching SpongeBob with my toddler-age children, although I do find myself answering lots of interesting questions (""Why is Squidward dancing like that?  It's scary."", ""You can't put fake arms on like that, can you, Daddy?"", ""Why is Patrick so dumb?"")<br/><br/>The show features the voice talents of Tom Kenny (a perennial supporting voice in cartoons) as SpongeBob, Rodger Bumpass (another voice talent veteran) as Squidward the, well, squid, Bill Fagerbakke (""Coach""s Dauber) as Patrick the Starfish, Carolyn Lawrence as Sandy Cheeks (SpongeBob's love interest, a squirrel with an air helmet), and Clancy Brown (""Buckaroo Banzai""s Rawhide) as SpongeBob's employer, the tight-clawed Mister Krabs. I have noticed in many features that ""Mr. Lawrence"" is credited as a writer; I suspect a husband-wife team, given that Sandy Cheeks gets some great dialogue--but that's pure conjecture, and I heartily welcome correction or corroboration alike.  There have been several celebrity appearances, most notably Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway as the voices of fictional superheroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.<br/><br/>I like the damn show.  I was hooked on it for at least a year, from the Clutch-Cargo-flavored introduction to the United Plankton logo at the end of each episode.  The plot lines' continuity is above average, with a well-developed cast of supporting characters who populate Bikini Bottom, SpongeBob's home.  There are the obvious suspension-of-disbelief requirements, such as the watery environment's inexplicable tolerance for electricity and exhaled air, but this is easily counterbalanced by the whimsical misusage of jargon (SpongeBob, in a desperate moment says, ""I'll use the Shell Phone!"").<br/><br/>Classic episodes include ""Bubbles"", ""Moon Rocket"", and ""Home Sweet Pineapple"".",47 out of 65 found this helpful.,,3 January 2001

165,SpongeBob SquarePants, It's just not the same show anymore...,"Been a Spongebob Squarepants fan since 1999, and quite frankly, I am very disappointed of how much this show has changed over the years.<br/><br/>Here's a brief summery of it:<br/><br/>Season 1 (1999–2000) — The early classic episode years: When the show first started, it wasn't bad. Yes, there was less humor, and the stories were slower-paced, but they were strong stories, and (crucially) the characters were funny, likable, and identifiable. (Despite being roughly drawn.)<br/><br/>Seasons 2 and 3 (2000–2004) — The later classic episode years: Pretty much all Spongebob fans would agree that you can't get better than these years. The writing team was at its absolute best and the stories were all fresh. Most, if not all, of the greatest episodes came from this period (""Band Geeks"" ""Chocolate With Nuts"", ""Wet Painters"", etc). In these days there was no such thing as a bad episode. There wasn't a single episode that did not make you laugh non-stop for 11 minutes.<br/><br/>Seasons 4–5 (2005–2007) — The poor episode years: Season 4 marked the beginning of the gradual decline of Spongebob Squarepants. It was the first ever season to have bad episodes. Yes, there were still some goodies (such as ""Skill Crane"" or ""Krusty Towers"") but some really poor ones were there in the mix, too (""Good Neighbors"", ""Funny Pants"", ""All That Glitters"", and — worst of all — ""Karate Island""). And by season 5 (when most of the original writing team had left), we had episodes that weren't just poor, they felt like a completely different TV show. (Episodes such as ""Ghost Host"", ""SpongeHenge"", ""Banned in Bikini Bottom"", etc). We were all thinking that the show was going through a rough patch, but this was only the beginning of what was yet to come<br/><br/>Seasons 6–now (2008–present) — The crap episode years: Ever since seasons 4–5, Spongebob Squarepants episodes had always been somewhere between excellent and occasionally poor. Then, in season 6, they began making absolute crap. The Spongebob as we've known and loved was all but dead. Some of the worst offenders were: ""The Splinter"", ""Professor Squidward"", ""Pets or Pests"", ""Dear Vikings"", and many others. But probably the one moment when every Spongebob fan realized — for certain — it was no longer the same show, was when Mr. Krabs becomes obsessed over a penny that SpongeBob finds in ""Penny Foolish"". This episode had absolutely no humor or plot. It concluded with Mr. Krabs selling out thousands of dollars he had just to receive one darn penny. The writers might as well of had him selling out the entire show's fanbase, while at it. From here on, the crap episodes just kept coming more and more and these days you can go almost an entire season without finding a good one. <br/><br/>So in conclusion, I'm rating the show 5 stars for the first 3 seasons and the semi-decent 4-5 Seasons. However, I can't give the more recent episodes even the slightest praise.",34 out of 47 found this helpful.,5.0,20 November 2012
166,SpongeBob SquarePants, Gone from gold to crap,"Spongebob Squarepants used to be Nikelodeaen's signature series. All the characters were good and the plot lines had meaning, and the show had talent. Nickelodean said in 1999 (when the show was created) that they would do three seasons and then do the movie. and that was it. until after the movie in 2004 the show boomed with popularity. so nickelodeon renewed the show for a forth season. After the movie, series creator and creative writer Stepen Hillenburg basically left the show and Paul Tibbit basically took over everything. This is when the show started going down hill. Then more rookie writers were hired and gave the plot lines dry, stupid humor. Everything that the first three seasons and the movie had set in stone was then defied and questioned in the past three seasons. all the characters have just became stupid. Spongebob has become high-pitched and annoying. Patrick is just oblivious to anything, now. Sandy is too smart and is overused. Mr. Krabs has become TOO cheap and his cheapness has been reused in too many episodes. Squidward has become too sarcastic and obsessed with himself. TOO many plot lines involving Plankton trying to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Spongebob has just become a whiny baby. If people thought he was gay when he came out, they should look at him now! It isn't funny any more. All of the plot lines are extremely predictable.(Plankton tries to steal the Krabby Patty formula, Mr. Krabs pinches a penny, Spongebob cries.) Nickelodeon is just bleeding this show dry, such as what FOX is doing with the Simpson's. They know people will continue watching it and they will keep on bringing in the MONEY. They will sponge off of this show for as long as they can.(pun intended) The show used to be for adults and kids alike, now it should be put on Nick Jr with Dora and Deiago. I would have given this show a ten star rating for seasons 1-3 and the movie. Now a one. I 100% recommend seasons 1-3 and the movie(especially season 1) Spongebob used to be the Coupe De Ville of Nickelodean, know it's just like the rest of the shows nick is limping out to the barn with.(Mighty B, Penguins of Madagascar, Back at the Baryard.)",57 out of 87 found this helpful.,1.0,18 May 2010

After watching the first episode, I was impressed. Granted, there was a lot covered in the pilot, but that's how it is: they have to introduce everybody and what their story lines are in the first 60 minute episode. The ""too much"" feeling will undoubtedly calm down as we get wrapped up in individuals instead of the mass family group.<br/><br/>Each individual family deals with their share of parenting problems, including Grandma and Grandpa, and they hit every single parenting problem right on the head.

It is so good it will probably be taken off the air so that we can be exposed to more of the trash which makes up a lot of todays TV. I also think the brother and sister interaction is great, they can be mad and blow off steam without it becoming a federal case. The marriages are real as well, with different definitions of a good marriage and whats involved. My favorite part though is the relationship between the aunts and uncles and the kids, you treat your own children one way while watching out for the nieces and nephews.

178,Parenthood," One of the few shows ever I'd class as ""authentic""","A new show with Peter Krause and Craig T. Nelson in the cast demanded at least a look, though if it weren't for the DVR I might have passed on it since it's on at the same time as the excellent ""The Good Wife"". Fortuitous indeed that I did because it strikes me as pure genius in writing and casting.<br/><br/>This show makes me laugh. This show makes me weep. Most important, it makes me smile in recognition of so many scenes that I recognize as things that happened to or around me. Of particular note along this line are the times in family ""discussions"" when everyone is talking and no one is listening. I don't recall another show that has done this, and it's sooo true to life.<br/><br/>The casting matches the writing so well that I can't imagine another actor in any of the parts.

179,Parenthood, Well worth watching,"I wonder why this program hasn't received the Emmy or Golden Globe nominations it deserves. The family members aren't perfect, which is one reason I love this show so much.<br/><br/>Even the ""good guys (or gals)"" make mistakes, just like we all do in real life. Each of the story lines is interesting, and every week I wonder where the writers will go with each story.<br/><br/>The younger actors in this series are impressive. Their acting is often subtle, which must be difficult for those who are so young to accomplish. The way they are portrayed is realistic, in that they are all likable in some way, but not so likable in others. As a mother, I appreciate the parenting difficulties which come along in this series, but I can also relate to the teenagers as they try to make sense of life. The character ""Max"" is truly remarkable. <br/><br/>Others who have commented have mentioned the high quality of the adult cast. I agree that they are all good, but I particularly like the work of Dax Shepard.<br/><br/>Stick with this show.

180,Parenthood, I hate that Ron Howard,"Actually, that's not true. This guy seems to turn anything into gold, and he does it with subtle style and class that you just do not see very often. This show is classic Ron Howard. It's very difficult for me to really ""get into"" a new show. Usually takes me several episodes or more. I was hooked on this show from the very first scene. The cast is just incredible. The acting is just as incredible. These actors seem as if they've been doing this show for years. You know how it is. Sometimes they have to ease into it together. Not so here. Or if they ARE easing into it, I can't imagine what's going to happen as the show progresses.<br/><br/>The plot is somewhat typical. Family matters. Adults moving home. Kids behaving badly. Or sometimes very well. Some tragedy. Some comedy. Lot's of people dealing with everyday problems from all different angles. I do not want to give anything away. All I can say is that if you watch this show, you are going to fall in love with or find you hate some of the characters right away. I already started hating one of them. But now I'm not so sure.

181,Parenthood," ""I Want to be a Braverman""","Every Tuesday night, after the conclusion of Parenthood, my wife says to me sentimentally, ""I want to be a Braverman!"" NBC's mildly successful drama, Parenthood, utilizes its larger-than-normal cast (15 recurring characters) to create a realistic atmosphere that explores the deeper realities of being an American family. Each episode beckons the viewer to identify with one branch of the Braverman family tree. Do you see yourself as the successful oldest brother, Adam, who everyone in the family looks to for support and advice? Are you the single mother, Sarah, who is overcoming a failed marriage and the repercussions of the children's absent father? Or maybe you're Julia, the successful lawyer who's climbing her way up the corporate ladder, but all the while wrestling with the cost to her family? Then there's the black sheep Crosby, whose fear of commitment and settling down are challenged by the confident, aspiring mother of his child, Jazmin, whom he has fallen deeply in love with. Or, perhaps, your children are raised and now, as the patriarchs of your family you find yourself in Zeek and Camielle's position of watching your children parent and navigating the complexities of having an adult child (not to mention grandchildren) living with you in your home.<br/><br/>The story lines and issues dealt with in Parenthood bring the audience into the midst of some of today's most challenging issues. In its first two seasons, Parenthood has empathized with its audience's struggles in an incredible number of real life situations: job loss, Asperger's syndrome, raising a rebellious teenager, raising a teenage boy with his father absent, midlife crises, financial stresses after retirement, the reality of peer pressure, unexpected pregnancies, balancing your career aspirations with those of your spouse's, biracial dating, and infertility.<br/><br/>What has become a staple of Parenthood is the argument scene. Episodes of Parenthood regular contain two to three scenes of one of the families engaged in a loud, discussion/fight with multiple characters yelling at the same time. The argument scene seems so chaotic, confusing, loud . . . and realistic. Any family that has had their share of arguments will find a kindred spirit in the Bravermans of Parenthood.<br/><br/>In the end, Parenthood is about, well, just that . . . parenthood. The unique flavor that this particular show has brought to prime time is an honest look at the many dimensions of parenting - from the decision to attempt to conceive, to the toddler and primary school years, through the incredibly challenging teenage years, to the years of adulthood and being a grandparent. Parenthood has dealt with infertility to preschools to high school graduation and everything in between. Parenthood is about family. Through the all challenges mentioned above that come the Braverman's way, the one stabilizing force is their family.<br/><br/>One of the casualties of the postmodern quest for mobility and a borderless reality is the family. How very uncommon it has become to meet an extended family who all live within a short distance of one another! Parenthood offers the Braverman family to help calm that longing in us all. Zeek and Camille's house serves as the calming presence throughout the series. No matter what difficulty besets the family, when they are ""home,"" everything seems right. It is difficult to imagine any of the Braverman's ever moving far from home.<br/><br/>While the verdict remains out on whether or not Parenthood has the legs of a lengthy run or not, it's first 35 offerings have proved to be a welcome addition to contemporary social commentary on the American family. While some of the specific challenges have certainly changed, at the heart of the Braverman family we see the same soothing presence that so many have seen in the past in the Huxtables, the Keatons, the Bradfords, and the original American family, the Cleavers, not to mention a host of other American television families.<br/><br/>Alongside my wife, we will strive to be Bravermans. Our family hopes to learn from the Braverman family as they seek to be the safe and reassuring base for everyone facing the challenges and shifting of life.",29 out of 37 found this helpful.,10.0,25 April 2011

Although they have some similarities, it does contain the spirit. It's just a charming and funny family drama. I relate to the circumstances between the siblings. Reminds me of the challenges my sisters and their kids go through. This group of actors have incredible chemistry.

183,Parenthood, Great Show!,"It's loosely based on the 1989 film, Parenthood, with Ron Howard and Brian Frazer. They previously tried to make it into series when it first came out. The show has a lot going for it like casting veteran actors and actresses like Lauren Graham who I saw in Guys and Dolls. She plays the unemployed, divorced daughter Sara who returns home with her two teenage children Amber and Drew. Amber's played by Mae Whitman who was great in ""Thief."" Craig T. Nelson and Bonnie Bedelia play the parents and grandparents. They once played husband and wife in a television movie almost 30 years ago. The rest of the cast isn't familiar to me but they're doing a good job. They've changed the family's location from the Midwest to Berkeley, California. I like the Asperger's storyline where the ideal parents must accept and learn to cope with their son, Max, who wears a pirate costume and has unusual habits. The scene where Max's parents must come to terms with his Asperger's Syndrome was memorable. The comedy and drama are mixed together and it's a bit more realistic. I would hope this show does well in it's Tuesday night line-up.",30 out of 45 found this helpful.,9.0,13 March 2010
184,Parenthood, Maybe THIS time...,"The other reviewer (RobNels2000) needs to do his homework. ""Parenthood"" was originally conceived as a TV series, became a movie and then became a TV series! The 1990 series (Ed Begley Jr., Jayne Atkinson, William Windom, etc.) didn't work despite having some great talent behind it (Ron Howard and Brian Grazer plus at least five others credited as executive producers). Now it's back...new cast, same situations. Three generations and lots of subplots. A truly great ensemble (Craig T. Nelson and Bonnie Bedelia, Peter Krause and Lauren Graham, etc.). Many people are going to compare this to ""Modern Family"" but ""Parenthood"" was around first...as a movie and TV series. Lauren Graham is doing very well stepping in for Maura Tierney...she got her training on Gilmore Girls. Craig Nelson, having been an military pilot, football coach and police chief, now gets to play a tough dad/granddad (although my dad could've given him some lessons). The venerable Bonnie Bedelia (many movies and TV series) has aged well to play the mom/grandmom. Add in Peter Krause (""Sports Night,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" and "" Dirty Sexy Money"") and there's four solid actors right up front. The big difference between ""Parenthood"" and ""Modern Family"" is that ""Parenthood"" is more drama than comedy. Ironically, I've never been a parent myself but grew up with parents similar to Mr. Nelson and Ms. Bedelia. Let's give this series a few weeks and see where it goes. One suggestion...if and when Maura Tierney gets better, bring her on in a guest role as another daughter. I gave this a 10 for the ensemble and the plot lines!! NBC can go home again!!",37 out of 59 found this helpful.,10.0,9 March 2010
185,Parenthood, Miles Heizer is a hidden jewel among an outstanding cast,"Miles' portrayal of Drew, the disturbed teen on Parenthood, is right on the mark. He conveys so well the hopeless frustration of trying to deal with the well-meaning but insensitive, self-centered adults who cluelessly control his life and frustrate his ability to value himself as a person. I look forward to his performances, so I was disappointed that he did not appear in Episode 7 (April 13) and appeared only as a silent observer at Jabbar's party in Episode 8 (April 20). I wish to commend Jennifer Lare and Camille H. Patton for their brilliant casting of this fine show, and would like to encourage them to make more use of the untapped talent of Miles Heizer as his family forges boldly into an uncertain future that they may live up to the name they bear, the Bravermans.",14 out of 20 found this helpful.,10.0,23 April 2010
186,Parenthood, Family at its finest,"Parenthood is a great view point of the modern family committed to doing life together. Everything is not perfect, but they stick together. This series is not shy about tackling touch issues. Each episode is a roller coaster ride of emotions. Kleenex's should be kept near by. <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes of this past year was when Victor was adopted. The 2 parents were scheduled to meet with the judge and Victor, but instead the entire family piles into the judges office. Not only is Victor becoming a part of this immediate family, but he is fully being brought into a much larger family and each member has a special loving thought for him.

Peter Krause is good just like he is good in everything he is in. Craig T. Nelson is just as good. Dax Shepard is pretty good along with the rest of the cast. The plots they come up with are mildly engrossing, but I am watching it because I like the characters.

Trying to listen to the over talking all the time can't make a successful show. I don't understand why anyone would want to listen to this non stop fighting. I feel the show could be so much better if there wasn't constant yelling. Especially several cast members yelling at the same time.

They're all tightly wound, jittery, lugubrious sourpusses, who persist in talking over each other so that every conversation rapidly escalates in stridency until it ends in a shouting match. The dialogue is like fingernails on a blackboard. Where do they live? Pasadena? What, do they caffeinate the drinking water out there? And that kid Max. Enough with the acting out already! He makes you want to give him a good swat upside the head.

192,Parenthood, Annoying,"I have been a member of IMDb for about 14-15 years. I almost never write a review/comment about a movie or a show. My wife enjoys watching this program and I might enjoy it too if it were not for a couple of things. The music. Stupid folk songs apparently are meant to bring some sort of emotional response to make the viewer feel better about the show or something. It brings an emotional response to me. I have to bite my tongue to avoid screaming at the TV to cut the silly music so that I do not interrupt my wife's enjoyment of the show. Shaky cam. Too many shows use it and this one seems to use it quite a bit. Shaky cam does not make the show edgy or more real. It make the show more annoying on top of the silly folk music. I also find shaky cam to be a substitute for creativity and imagination from the makers of the show. God, the show is on now, Craig T. Nelson is talking, and there is some dumb guitar music in the background. Aaarrrggghhhh.<br/><br/>Although he has been dead for over 30 years, I feel that I owe John Belushi's character in Animal House an apology. I always thought that the scene where he grabbed some beatnik's guitar and smashed it was an over-reaction. Listening to the folk music on this show makes me want to do just that. So, sorry, Bluto.

Good grief, get over oneself and let life continue! If I were in such a family, I'd file for divorce from the lot!!! I truly like the actors individually, but as a group...I had to stop watching, as it's almost as nerve-wracking as the prevalent mattress-hopping on other series. The day to day situations DO reflect a lot of what transpires in many families. Our house had a widowed Mom and children ranging from 4 days to 4 years. Talk about crazy! I wish I had kept a journal, as it would have been quite the tale. Thinking on it, many would probably question the writer's grasp of reality.

It has real life situations that families have to encounter so its easy to relate to and serious but funny at the same time. It is very entertaining and has a lot of twists that you don't see coming. Dax Shepard's character is really funny and plays a serious role at parts. The slight humor each character brings to the table makes the serious aspect of the show even better. It's only on its first season and I hope it continues after this season. In a way it reminds me of my crazy family and family is such an easy thing to make into a TV show because they can vary so much and have so much wrong with it but still fun at the same time.

More recently, I have repeatedly tried to watch episodes and inevitably must turn the channel because of the manner in which the characters now interact with each other.

197,Parenthood, Quality all over,"This is only my second review on IMDb. I rarely take the time to write them, but this show really deserves it.<br/><br/>It is not your typical family drama. I know, it might seem like it. You read that Lauren Graham is one of the characters and you get sceptical, if you see a couple of minutes of it here and there it also might seem like all the other bad family dramas you've watched. But it's not.<br/><br/>I really don't get why this show is being so neglected. I've never seen more brilliant performed drama. And yeah, I've watched all the most popular and critically acclaimed shows: The Wire, Six Feet Under, Mad Men, Sopranos etc. Loved them. But neither of these shows has the same degree of realism or the same emotional range (they have a lot of other huge qualities though). The acting is excellent. Superb in every way. The characters are multidimensional, they make mistakes and they go through their everyday problems. You will not see car explosions in this series, and people wont get killed every other episode. Every event builds up real slow, and maybe the biggest dramatic highlight in an episode is that one of the kids have trouble getting friends at school. But that's the beauty of it. It's in the little things.<br/><br/>You might not love it after one episode or two. But like all the best television series it develops best over time. This show has many of the best character developments I've ever seen. If you like quality drama - please give it a try.

198,Parenthood, Third go-round is a charm,"I saw the 1989 film that started this. When it was turned into a series for prime time years ago, it did not quite gel. This time, it works quite well. The actors for the first series actually work well in the roles they play. Each generation of the Braverman family is going through some sore of public or private crisis where secrets reveal themselves as in real life. I can state for a fact that the dynamics are not unlike real families that I know, or for that matter, my own experience comes to mind.<br/><br/>The grandparents played by Craig T. Nelson and the lovely Bonnie Bedelia are going through their own marriage woes. The younger son, perfectly portrayed by Dax Shepherd who was hilariously ignorant in the Tina Fey film 'Baby Mamma'. Here he is the son who gets a wakeup call to grow up when he discovers he has a young son, product of a tryst with a ballet dancer. It seems the child has been asking about his father and the young mother decides she needs to finally introduce them. It is awkward but the child is so sweet that the father and son eventually bond. Meanwhile the other Braverman siblings have their own emotional baggage, Peter Krause is the eldest who is struggling to come to terms within highly-functioning autistic child and a rebellious teenage daughter. There is Laren Graham who returns home with her two troubled teens after her marriage fails, and then there is Erika Christensen, the workaholic, over-achieving lawyer who is missing out on raising her daughter. Some may fault the show for being frustrating and slow but isn't that the way family life is? It's hard and frustrating but as, in every family, the spurts of warm and fuzzy moments are always welcome at the end of the day.

The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do.

Lots of technical data are gathered using ""special"" cameras and sensors and biometrics, not to mention the psychological profile from browsing habits and social networks, and are used (supposedly) to predict how a juror will vote for a verdict.<br/><br/>Despite all the data though, in the pilot episode, Dr. Bill (played by Michael Weatherly) is ultimately using his gut, to lean the scale in favor of his client.<br/><br/>Anyway. This TV series is faaaar from scientific, and a little bit on the stereotypical side (especially with all these hackers who can penetrate anywhere). And in such cases the question is, if is it really entertaining...<br/><br/>...Well judging by the pilot, not so much. I like Michael Weatherly. I think he could shine in a comedic role but, despite the efforts from the producers (including Steven Spielberg), his character isn't that much interesting. He isn't so sure about himself and it seems like he struggles to find his place in the picture. His actual personality is vague. Not a proper build for a TV hero and a titular character.<br/><br/>Overall: Too soon to tell, but it doesn't look promising. Dr. Bull isn't such a strong character as his producers wanted to be. The (pseudo)science of the show is overwhelming and not up to the hype. Not really a comedy and too light for a serious drama.

I've liked Michael Weatherly, but will admit to not being a fan of Dr. Phil, who is both the inspiration for the title character and was a co-writer of the pilot. Dr. Phil: don't quit your day job. The show is simply unbelievable. A multi-million dollar high-tech office, with dozens of staffers, yet no apparent source of income for any of that. The pilot dialogue, to acknowledge Dave Barry's phrase, seemed to come from the wooden dialogue generator. All of the characters are relentlessly hip: there's the now obligatory knit cap wearing techie; a fabulously dressed wardrobe consultant; Bull relieves tension by hitting a tethered baseball in the office, while replete with his oh-so-cool two or three days' of beard growth. None of the characters are people you feel empathy with or care about. Early on, this show has benefited immensely from the prime time slot following ""NCIS."" I will be very surprised if it holds the early ratings as the season goes on. Maybe not the best career move for Michael Weatherly.",87 out of 162 found this helpful.,1.0,5 October 2016
234,Bull," Trials, Philosophy, and Bad Guys, Oh my!!","Don't listen to the Naysayers, and cynics on this review status. This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace  and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. <br/><br/>The premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential.

A far cry from NCIS, as excellent as that show is, you will not see DiNozzo in this show. Weatherly plays a mega-intelligent psychiatrist who puts together juries to win.

Neither side can ""stack the jury.""<br/><br/>In the episode I watched about a female pilot sued for crashing a plane, the defense attorney was portrayed as an unscrupulous miscreant who had to be outed and dismissed by Dr. Bull (natch), Bull sat behind counsel table unshaven and with no tie (try doing that in any courtroom in this country), during the trial counsel asked questions of the jury and requested they raise their hands in response (that never happens) and ""mirror jurors"" sat in the courtroom with biometric watches to evaluate the testimony (like driverless cars, that technology may someday exist but I have never seen it to this day). OK, it's TV, but at least let's get the basics right- there is no ""guilty or not guilty"" in a civil case. A defendant is ""liable"" or not liable.

243,Bull, Simplistic and boring formula,"This show started with an interesting premise (trial science) but after a few seasons it's become a simplistic, formulaic and predictible and feelgood legal drama. Basic formula is (1) A client has an issue; (2) Bull's team select a jury; (3a) Bull's team noisily express exactly what's happening inside every jury's head with 100% accuracy; (3b) Bull's team struggle and look like they're going to lose; (4) New and compelling evidence is miraculously discovered by Bull's team, frequently showing Police/FBI/etc to be incompetent investigators (although this is not directly addressed); (5) Bull's team wins case while Jason Bull commentates his lawyer's brilliance in whispers.<br/><br/>It's a very simplistic show, which might appeal if that's what you're after, but could also be really annoying. For example, time scales are completely fictional. Bull's team is always urgently gathering evidence during a trial. They frequently break laws, hack computer systems, and invade people's privacy. ALL of these actions are brushed off as inconsequential and a justified means to an end for their client. His team made up from former employees of the FBI and Homeland Security are idolised as if those organisations are faultless.<br/><br/>Earlier episodes spent considerable time talking about juries, but there's no detail... just someone in a room staring at screens and expressing what are supposedly 100% accurate explanations of what each juror is thinking. Uncertainty is very rare.<br/><br/>I'm not very familiar with trial science but it's hard to imagine that it hits this degree of formulaic perfection. Maybe a disinterest in looking at that is why what is meant to be the main premise of the show is brushed over so superficially. If a show had to be based on trial science, there would be so many interesting things it could focus on: accuracy, ethics, just getting it to work, the list goes on. Bull doesn't.

And let me make it clear that I ain't no fan of the real Dr. Phil who is the actual model for the fictional Dr. Bull. (I find Dr. Phil's overbearing personality a little hard to take.) The sad truth, however, is that real jury consultants and ""hired-gun"" expert witnesses charge such high fees that they can only work for big corporations and wealthy clients.

Every person in her personal life, her father, her son, her dead husband and her new boyfriend are or were self destructing in some way. And her mental health issues they are depicting. I don't actually know how she is able to do the work she needs to as, those psychological problems are debilitating.<br/><br/>Second problem is that she is never actually seems to be working, she spends some time on the cases but mostly cleaning up or trying to keep together her personal life. In the first season she does spend some time in the morgue and does do an autopsies but by the second season she is hardly in the office. If the writers had her doing what she is supposed to be doing professionally this would have been a far better show.<br/><br/>I recommend Body of Proof similar concept but was far better than this.",24 out of 36 found this helpful.,3.0,6 March 2020

258,Coroner, Not disappointing at all,"This series is turning out to be quite gripping, and I'm already hoping that a second season is in prospect. The CBC can be a little timid about renewing its drama shows (the excellent ""This Life"" was cancelled after just two seasons), but this one deserves better. Contrary to an earlier opinion on this site (I strongly suspect that, when a reviewer starts off a negative comment about gay characters with the phrase ""I'm not homophobic, but..."", he very probably is just that), it's good to see that Jenny Cooper's son is not merely your everyday moody teenager. His being gay is another thing that she has had to accept in her life (quite successfully in this case, it would seem), and I don't see how showing him in a caring relationship can be objectionable. The number of television shows down the years in which non-heterosexual characters were simply non-existent far outweighs the number, at present, in which they are shown to be part of the world. All that said, it does seem up to this point that Jenny spends more time outside of her lab than any other coroner in memory...",29 out of 49 found this helpful.,8.0,25 January 2019

260,Coroner, Wasted potential,"There was an opportunity to make an intriguing series out of this. Instead the producers decided to use it as a bludgeon for promoting their social justice agenda.
1) Every white male is incompetent, cynical and/or spiteful and hostile (chief pathologist, prison guards, white trash father). For example, the obnoxious and hateful chief pathologist with 20 years of experience is bewilderingly aggressive and seemingly proud of his lack of attention or care in carrying out his duties and is quickly replaced by his bright, steadfast and confident black assistant
2) Every person of colour is competent and virtuous, especially if they are women
3) All young people, even those in the juvenile detention centre are wise beyond their years, loving and caring. The protagonist's teenage son appears at the right moments to give his mother back rubs and say exactly the right things at the right time. The kids in the detention centre are all misunderstood youths, brimming with potential who rally around the opportunity to produce ""Romeo and Juliet"".
It's a shame, because the cast is generally good, the production values are good, and the premise is good, but the show is virtually unwatchable because of the hamfisted social messages constantly thrown in the viewers face.",83 out of 166 found this helpful.,3.0,12 January 2019

The trailer implied this would be the quality of Silent Witness unfortunately it doesn't live up to this at all.<br/><br/>I agree with a previous review that the casting is good. All actors are talented and doing their best, unfortunately the writing is pretty unbelievable at times. The first few episodes it was small reactions that seemed wrong for the lead. It's almost like she has a split personality. Here is a woman intelligent enough to become a coroner and confident enough to fire someone her first week. She has the ability to read people and interact with them when the story requires it to move forward but is completely naive about people at other times, because that then moves the story along.<br/><br/>Still I decided not to take it too seriously and did kinda enjoy the 1st few episodes. However I may have just lost patience for this series. The end of the latest episode saw her find an unconscious girl.

265,Coroner, Spoilers !!! I tried to give this a chance. but............,"As a big fan of British and Scandinavian crime dramas, I was keen to see this new series on CBC. Cardinal on CTV was pretty good.<br/><br/>I have not read any of Matthew Hall's books, so knew nothing about the story or characters. But I did read a bit about the author and the books today.<br/><br/>I really struggled to finish the first episode of this new series, and I only did finish it once I decided that I had to write a review.<br/><br/>The story and characters are unbelievable (as in unrealistic). Jenny Cooper, a mid 30s physician (played by 35 yr old Serinda Swan) becomes (is appointed) a coroner in Toronto after working in ER? Jenny has a son Ross, who seems to be at least 16 or 17 (played by 21 yr old Ehren Kassam of Degrassy), so she would have been around 20 or less when he was born. So, how she completed med school and became a physician with experience and qualifications to be appointed a coroner (apparently for the whole of the city of Toronto) boggles my mind. And I'm not saying that because she is woman, imho would be odd to have a man of that age in a similar position). However, it seems she's quite senior, as she is the boss of a long-time pathologist. Actually, in reality, the Chief Coroner of Ontario is in charge of appointing (and I assume dismissing) coroners in the province, and likewise, the Chief Forensic Pathologist, is the boss of forensic pathologists.<br/><br/>Apart from the character's name, her apparent anxiety issue, and the death of two young adults in custody, Jenny's character and the story bear no resemblance to Matthew Hall's books on which this new series is allegedly based - oh, sorry, 'inspired by'. Something that I could not see in the credits, but is mentioned by the CBC Media Centre.<br/><br/>Matthew's Jenny Cooper is a lawyer, and after a traumatic divorce, her son is living with her ex-husband. There is also the minor detail in the first episode that she was appointed to her new position after the from the recently deceased Harry Marshall contains neglected files hiding dark secrets and a trail of buried evidence.<br/><br/>Plot / procedural issues abound - the forensic pathologist, performing the autopsy, was a weird duck, which, could be true in real life. But I extremely doubt that his new boss can just suddenly fire him on the spot, in the autopsy lab, no matter how much he may have deserved it. Neither we nor Jenny know anything about him, and there is such a thing a due process in Canada.<br/><br/>There are several other things about this show that disturbed me, but I'm not going to invest my time detailing them here (such as it's so slow, boring and has a horrible script). I mentioned already that Matthew Hall wasn't even credited in the first episode, yet his website has information of this new series. What's that about CBC ? .I wonder if he has any idea what has been done to his books ?? I'm thinking ""inspired by"" (per CBC) and ""based on"" (per the author) have hugely different meanings, both practically and legally ?<br/><br/>All I know is I certainly won't be investing any more of time in watching future episodes. And if this review saves anyone (who loves British crime and Scandi Noir like I do) from the pain wasted time of watching it, that can only be a good thing :)",42 out of 84 found this helpful.,1.0,12 January 2019
266,Coroner, I expected this series to fly high but it turns out to fall very flat,"""Coroner"" 5/10 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
I dated a woman who passed away that could've been the doppelganger for Serinda Swan. So the first time I saw her on a episode of ""Chicago Fire"" I immediately became a fan. She's a very talented actress and I have no qualms about the cast for ""Coroner"" but just from judging the pilot I didn't watch anything that would give me the urge to wanna see more episodes. It came across very predictable and kinda boring. I also felt some scenes were kinda awkward like when her son is giving her a shoulder massage, or when she was crying and the detective just starts singing in her passenger seat instead of asking her if she's Ok. Maybe the next episode will pick up some steam but if she's a coroner it seems very odd to watch her also play detective talking to various people who knew or were related to the victim. So for that reason I give it a 5, It could of been worse but it also could've been a lot better.",34 out of 67 found this helpful.,5.0,9 January 2019

275,Elementary, Intelligent and quirky Thursday night viewing.,"I didn't want to watch this because I adore the BBC Sherlock. However, after denying myself for weeks and weeks I decided to download the first 8 episodes and get to work watching them before I made a full opinion. <br/><br/>I was surprised at how easy it was to fall in love with Jonny Lee Miller's Sherlock and Lucy Liu's female Watson. Both actors brought their A-Game and succeeded in bringing viewers in, despite the un-original procedural aspect to the show. <br/><br/>The crimes of the week are lackluster and pedestrian at the very beginning, a typical trait of typical procedural dramas on broadcast networks. However, thankfully this did not continue for all the 12 episodes that have been aired. Somewhere along the 6th episode is when I assume the writers got the full season pick-up and felt the support of CBS after being given the coveted Super Bowl episode slot. <br/><br/>Now the crimes are interesting and layered. The best thing is that the characterization of Sherlock and Watson is the best thing I've seen on a drama in years. Lucy and Jonny have a platonic chemistry which brings angst, sarcasm and wit to the show that is very enjoyable. <br/><br/>The character scenes are the best in every episode, and you can't deny the acting skill involved to breath fresh air into an over used double act such as Holmes and Watson. Miller and Liu make you forget about the other interpretations and fall in love all over again with the crime solving duo. <br/><br/>I suggest everyone watches before passing judgement, and be open minded. You can like all Sherlock Holmes adaptions, there is no rule against liking another.<br/><br/>Elementary is going to be a fantastic series, and I hope it lasts a long time on CBS. It's refreshing and adds vitality to a very old network. Great show!",314 out of 381 found this helpful.,10.0,18 January 2013
276,Elementary, Brilliant! All the way through Season 6,"Just finished the season finale season 6 and have been a faithful viewer throughout. I worried that this could be the series finale, and am very grateful it isn't. Keep watching people! What I find brilliant about this series began at the first season. That a character in modern day as sensitive and intelligent as Sherlock would become an addict makes perfect sense if you think about it. And we meet Watson as the unwelcome sober companion former surgeon hired by Sherlock's father to keep him sober who also has an addiction to solving crimes. The development of relationships and character arcs throughout the years has been a delight to watch. The crimes, the interface with the NYPD with great actors (that didn't have enough to do), Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill, and watching them all affect each other through conflicts, betrayals, along with other great actors playing various supporting roles from the incredible idea of a female Moriarty as nemesis, it all seems almost unworkable until it becomes incredibly workable and fascinating. I find I welcome such an inventive version of the classic. I've enjoyed Jonny Lee Miller's work since ""Eli Stone,"" backtracking his career which got me into British Drama much more. So he is the reason I tuned in to this version, and I love what he's done with the character. His body, the way he holds and moves it, his facial expression, none of which show off his real handsomeness, is amazing. His character is hard to like almost, and the character doesn't care, but does. In this season finale we see a side of Sherlock he hardly ever shows. So much depth and layering of the character that seems like it can keep revealing as he keeps growing. Great writing along with the acting. Lucy Liu who I loved in ""Ally McBeal"" and have also followed is a great foil and partner to this character as Watson. Both these actors can handle comedy and musical comedy straight. but, sadly, there's not much comedy here. There's little excellent television, especially in American tv. Really good shows get cancelled and tripe gets a following. It's mystifying. This is one of the few really great series available to us. I've watched seasons more than twice and it still holds up as great entertainment, provocative, surprising, in depth, great storytelling. It makes you squirm at times, highly uncomfortable as people go dark, even the heroes. What happens to people when the pain of living with what we do under certain circumstances gets acted out. It's great to have a show taking us into these places with characters that look like they may not make it through it, even break, and where and how recovery happens, how they find their way. There's a real dark twist to Sherlock's recovery in Season 6. All the actors carry it all off extremely well. Well envisioned, directed, set, designed, lit, sound tracked, everything about the series is well done. It doesn't miss a beat.",58 out of 69 found this helpful.,10.0,19 September 2018
277,Elementary, I could never have predicted this!,"Years ago, I remember reading the publicity for this show before it was released, and pouring scorn on the idea of a modern Sherlock Holmes, set in New York and with a female Watson. ""How pathetic!"", I sneered, ""They must be really desperate for new ideas, to come up with this pile of rubbish!"" And when it showed on British television, I only sat down to watch it so I could pull it to pieces. <br/><br/>I could never have guessed that years later I would be watching old episodes, while I impatiently wait for the fourth series to be broadcast. All the people involved have obviously worked very hard to create this intelligent and entertaining show, which has fun with the original stories and characters, while still showing respect (in my view) to the books and the author, Arthur Conan Doyle. Oh, and while I like Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock, I think the actors who play Joan Watson, Captain Thomas Gregson and Detective Marcus Bell deserve a special mention, as they have the more restrained and therefore difficult roles to play, as his sidekicks. <br/><br/>Thank you for making and releasing ""Elementary"".

It's an adaptation that puts intelligent twists to the original story and yet established itself as sufficiently well crafted to stand on its own as one of, if not, the best television series around at the moment. The acting is superb with Jonny Lee Miller, Lucy Liu, Aiden Quinn and Jon Michael Hill carrying the weekly load, with appearances from the likes of Rhys Ivans, Natalie Dormer, Sean Pertwee and even Vinnie Jones to bring some variety. The stories are dramatic, mostly unpredictable with touches of humour and draw on aspects of the modern day as to make them very interesting. I love how they explore the relationships between the characters on both sides of the law and how they deal with their demons both past and present. I find that many episodes explore the fringes of the modern world through topics covering science, computing, art, finance, etc. and this adds to the richness of the plots which, along with the writing, are the strongest aspects of the series.

280,Elementary," A different spin on a classic, A great show on its own merits","Like many people, I love BBC's Sherlock and overlooked Elementary for many reasons. I recently decided to give it a chance and was pleasantly surprised to say the least. First off, don't make the same mistake I did and dismiss it for some of the rather odd sounding changes, it's intended to be a different spin on the classic and does so very well.<br/><br/>Jonny Lee Miller plays a great Sherlock. He's more human and flawed, where the original Sherlock was almost cartoonishly strong at times, but he still has the same confident eccentric brilliance that makes Sherlock Holmes so interesting. He's a recovering addict aided by Sober Companion Watson, a modern politically correct spin on classic Holmes drug use that feels tacked on and out of place at times, but helps drive the character development of both Holmes and Watson.<br/><br/>The new Watson angle was a big factor in what made me pass on the show at first. In addition to the Sober Companion job, it sounded very generic Hollywoody to find an excuse to shoehorn in a pretty female co-star, but Lucy Liu is very good in her role. She doesn't play a shallow sexy distraction from the story, rather just a different sex portraying the same inquisitive, intelligent, adventurous companion that Watson should be. And (as far as I am in the series - fingers crossed) there's no pointless romantic subplots between her and Sherlock, just a straight played female Watson. Hats off to Lucy Liu for making a tough character change that I was prepared to dislike so likable and real.<br/><br/>The best part of the show however is the writing. Writing good mysteries is a fine line to walk. You can either give too little information and blindside the viewer, leaving them feeling shut out and just along for the ride, or too much information delivered too overtly and ruin the fun of following step in step with the details. The truth has to be there somewhere for you to see but not too soon. Elementary manages to walk that line very well. There have been times when something was too obvious or too unpredictable, but much more often the truth is cleverly masked until just the right time - a little before it's revealed, if you're sharp. <br/><br/>I went into this series with low expectations but very quickly fell in love with it. Whether you like the different spin on Arthur Conan Doyle's characters or not, Elementary does mystery right, and it's worth a watch based on that alone.",96 out of 124 found this helpful.,9.0,7 December 2013
281,Elementary," This is entertaining television, not an aspiring pledge to the purists at heart","I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes in practically every medium... from the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to Basil Rathbone to Young Sherlock Holmes to Robert Downey Jr. and even the episodes in Star Trek TNG. <br/><br/>It isn't that I am a purist, far from it. I enjoy the utilization of the Holmes and/or Holmes/Watson meme in the form of deductive reasoning and systematic or logical progression. Of course that combined with the occasional last minute twist, the first minute twist or even the w.t.h. or out of nowhere type of twist that was completely missing from the storyline that keeps writers in business and viewers in front of the TV watching isn't it?<br/><br/>Now as to this show? I am in fact entertained for many reasons, and none of them have anything to do with the purism of the title character nor for the particular crimes that are solved. What entertains me is the inner sub plots that are brought to the characters by both Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu, and I like Aidan Quinn as well from way back as The Hitchhiker.<br/><br/>I am entertained because I see the kind of s.o.b. attitude that I miss from not having House on the air any more, I am entertained because I have the hots for Lucy Liu sure... but there is something more important than. <br/><br/>I am intrigued at her playing a 'normal' person... not an action hero, not a bad-ass, not a cop with an attitude... she is playing a former professional woman that has taken on a compassionate role and has to deal with a very unprofessional man and I find that particular aspect fascinating.<br/><br/>Anyone could find easily half a dozen reasons not to like this show but I prefer to focus more on what makes me want to watch instead.

283,Elementary, Love it!,"What House was to medicine, Elementary is to investigating. The writing is clever, fast paced and smart. Our eccentric lead ""Holmes"" instead of having a drug dependency for his gimp leg like House, is a recovering drug addict who is being observed by ""Watson"" to keep him clean. They writers really make an effort to spell out the deductive-reasoning details, and for the most part, its plausible, IMO. The plots snake thru twists and turns at a feverish pace and Holmes dedication is relentless. You get the feeling he behaves this way to keep him mind from allowing his addiction to regain control. Lucy Liu , who I love, is curiously restrained in her role to offset Holmes's incessant espousing. Her deductive skills are far less than Holme's but she brings medical expertise to the table. They have a unique but likable chemistry. It seems obvious to me that at some point Liu's character will be developed more and eventually Holmes is going to have some sort of relapse. I can only hope this show maintains this level of intensity without sacrificing credibility, but for now, IMO, its one of mainstream's networks finest.",96 out of 148 found this helpful.,9.0,4 November 2012
284,Elementary, Keep it so that only Holmes and his keen logical mind could have solved the crime otherwise its pointless.,"As long time Sherlock fan of books/ Rathbone films and even BBC Sherlock, I was a little skeptical of this NY incarnation. Especially with the gimmick driven female Watson. Having watched the first few episodes however I am pleasantly surprised. The show is carried and carried well by the charisma and scruffy charm of Johnny Lee Miller, who convinces as the eccentric mental powerhouse who has his fair share of weaknesses both socially and physically. Watson does better as a woman than I would have thought and Aidan Quinn is just as brilliant as a police chief in this as he was in the undeservedly canceled Prime Suspect.<br/><br/>However, I did notice a worrying trend in a recent episode of lessening his deductive powers and in essence having him just follow clues as any normal detective. I hope with all sincerity that this series doesn't cheapen into a regular detective show with gimmicky moments highlighting his powers. i.e. Solving the crime as anyone would through normal police procedure and filling the gaps with inane deductive showcases.<br/><br/>Keep it so that only Holmes and his keen logical mind could have solved the crime otherwise its pointless.",101 out of 157 found this helpful.,8.0,7 November 2012
285,Elementary, Good characters,"Okay, so this is not an American version of the Doyle classics. But it satisfies my first requirement of a good show--I like the characters. Holmes is a man struggling with his inept social skills while simultaneously reveling in them. Watson is a woman whose job has become a hobby and more. As they adapt, this could lead to more interesting interactions. The police characters are skeptical and protective of their turf, yet open to help. They grudgingly admire Holmes' results.<br/><br/>Holmes is also a man who has no love of conventions. It is interesting to watch him navigate his way through a society that tries to force everyone to comply with its standards. In this process, Watson acts as liaison and interpreter. As she gains more information about Holmes, she becomes more useful to him and, perhaps, more of an annoyance to him. He wants to remain an enigma so that he can keep his secrets and demons to himself. She tells him it is good to talk of one's feelings, but he will do so only if forced. One can only hope that the writers eventually create a background for Watson that is equally engaging, though she is somewhat damaged from her experience with a malpractice case. This is only the first season, so there is time for more layers to be added.<br/><br/>Regarding Holmes' crime solving techniques, they are best when he interacts with suspects or witnesses. He has an eye for the truths they reveal when they are trying to hide them. Can he see his own truths as well? Wlll he find the time to deal with his own issues when the world offers so many interesting diversions for his curiosity?",46 out of 70 found this helpful.,8.0,3 February 2013
286,Elementary, Muttering,"The lead actors are serious actors. But Jonny, seems to my aging ears, mutters a lot, buries his words in his head voice, and not all his dialogue is easy to hear. I wonder if that is part of the recording process and I sometimes have that problem with Lucy as well on this program.Then to make it worse, even in early segments, there is unrelated music in the background adding nothing dramatically, but compounding the muttering problem. CBS seems to add this music on other shows as well while other broadcasters do not, to their benefit. Since much of the drama of the show is Jonny Lee/Sherlock's thought process, and that is at the heart of the character's intrigue, this loss of vocal clarity is self-destructive.

287,Elementary, A rare treat from the USA,"This purports to be a take on Sherlock, migrated to modern New York and it does this very well. Sherlock is a true eccentric, Watson equally and entertainingly odd with the NYPD reassuringly stereotypical, adding balance. Jonny Lee Millar gives consistently outstanding performances full of quirky finger movements, twitches and sudden changes of direction - mental, emotional and physical. Watson is a bewildered soul mesmerised by Holmes, resentful of his offhand treatment of her, intrigued but unable to escape. Irene likewise is outstandingly good - another flawed character, riveting to watch. This series is a revelation, worth watching for JLM's performance alone. Worth 10/10 were it not for Watson's quacky delivery and Holmes' mumbling when thinking out loud but don't let this affect your enjoyment - just see if you agree.

However, a preview of ""The Elementary"" was not attractive for me.
Somehow this show makes me feel awkward.
I mean setting is not in London, Watson is not a man, Holmes is not smoker.
When I watched, Setting in NY, a female Watson, which turned fantastic spices, brought me recommendation.
Audience feels empathy for each character.
Holmes is a struggling with his inept social skills while solving crimes.
Watson is supporting Holmes as a sober companion besides she is combatting with her trauma while she used to be a doctor.
Holmes, Watson and the police characters are developing a strong bound step by step.

291,Elementary, The incomparable Jonny Lee Miller leads this outstanding series,"As an avid Arthur Conan Doyle reader who owns all books/movies/TV shows relating to Sherlock Holmes, I was incredibly skeptical of this show's premise when it was first announced.<br/><br/>At the beginning I asked - is this a cheap investment in the much cherished canon?
At the end I answered - simply put - definitely not.<br/><br/>This show achieved 7 seasons of the most exquisite platonic character-arcs I have ever witnessed.
Salutations to the original canon surface across all seasons. The rest is CBS's original procedural take.<br/><br/>The one glorious reason this show exists and works is the emotional, psychological, cerebral power of Jonny Lee Miller's performance.<br/><br/>It is baffling how he constantly renders exquisite performances and has astounding versatility and yet the world doesn't seem to realize this. The likes of Cumberbatch (whom I certainly love and admire) seem to effortlessly claim this fandom of adoration, and so many have been quick to compare and wrongfully allow a shadow to fall upon JLM's serious talent. This is a major flaw in their judgement. Both Sherlocks are very different. As they should be.<br/><br/>JLM and BC's shared masterpiece Frankenstein with the National Theatre proved they are on par with each other. Styles and interpretations, different though they are, both pierce through and access the poignancy of each of their characters with equal greatness. An Olivier Award was bestowed. A truly deserved honour.<br/><br/>Truth be told, of all the wonderful Sherlocks that have their rightful place - JLM's Sherlock is the only Sherlock I would love to meet in real life. His arc is real. His struggles are never shrugged away or simplified to lighten the load. He has his imperfections and his genius and he works to learn and appreciate that this struggle and genius means nothing without the friendships and connections he initially fought against in the past. Each person on the team has their worth and can solve issues and offer wisdom and solutions - not just Sherlock. This is refreshing.<br/><br/>JLM's emotional depth is incomparable. No-one should miss this performance.
It is a tremendous shame an Emmy, a Golden Globe among other awards were not bestowed except a second Satellite Nomination.<br/><br/>If you like an intellectual procedural that has an exquisite lead, this is for you. It is a procedural show and it is unfair to use this to undermine its true underlying value.<br/><br/>I love BBC's Sherlock and people love it because it is flamboyant, melodramatic and heavily concentrated in its story delivery.
Yet, with Elementary you get a staggering number of episodes, a high turnout of entertaining story-arcs and cameos, and a relationship between Sherlock and Watson that is exceptional and rewarding to the very end.<br/><br/>It was incredibly difficult to see this show end.
Definitely worth your time.",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,9 May 2020
292,Elementary, Your Typical Quirky Detective Show...,"This show isn't ""Sherlock Holmes"".... and I don't say that because of any ""reimagining"" or creative license taken with the character.<br/><br/>This is nothing more than your typical Hollywood detective show that features a quirky guy solving crimes with his straight laced sidekick. It's been done millions of times on US television. Monk, Psych, Mentalist, Lie to Me, Perception, Endgame, The Finder, Life, etc.. The list goes on and on.<br/><br/>This is a very mediocre show... The characters are weak, the stories are weak, and the crimes are mundane. Halfway through the second episode I found myself already solving the ""mystery"" and spent the rest of the episode wondering why this Sherlock character isn't able to see something so obvious.<br/><br/>Furthermore the character doesn't ""deduce"" anything important and at least half the deductions are more like dumb guesses, they add little to the character or the story.<br/><br/>The use of ""Sherlock Holmes"" here is nothing more than a hook to get people to watch the show. In the end the ""Sherlock Holmes"" character is mere window dressing to your basic quirky detective show. One that isn't even as good as the other quirky detective shows.<br/><br/>The show does absolutely nothing to capture the essence of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>If you really want to watch a modern take on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character then you really should watch BBC's Sherlock.<br/><br/>Elementary tries to be like BBC's Sherlock, but other than having a guy with a British accent, it fails miserably on all counts.",223 out of 453 found this helpful.,4.0,6 October 2012
293,Elementary," It really is elementary, but it's not Sherlock","The often unpleasant comparisons between British TV and American is just that, and it should be noted from the start that this show makes no attempt whatsoever to be the current American version of Sherlock with Cumberbatch and Freeman. The real question therefore is, what is it trying to be? The answer to that isn't simple because it's pilot episode received generally favorable reviews and seemed to be more thoughtful than some of the genre shows that it will be compared with as the series develops. The acting was good enough and there was a plot working, but the show never seemed to get it's legs. Miller and Liu never spark together. Though both have their moments of intensity they don't show us any proof that this is going to be a work in progress.<br/><br/>Sherlock is an unpleasant surprise for Watson and not at all what she's expecting when she shows up for her first day on the job. It seemed to forced and actually trite when Sherlock goes out of his way to make things very personal and distasteful for her when a man of his supposed intellect would readily deduce that she is not the bad guy, not the Judas goat for his interpersonal difficulties with his father. He's rude and demeaning to her, and when we see the very obvious vulnerability in her character it's not done in a very sympathetic light.<br/><br/>We should revile Sherlock but Lui never comes across as a person we want to empathize with or support. Blame Lui, the writing or both, but it's a key factor in the chemistry between these two characters. When Sherlock finally relents and sees the error of his behavior it's rather flat and anticlimactic. That's a fatal flaw.<br/><br/>This is a strange mix of canon and revision and it could turn into something really interesting but certainly the pilot episode wasn't charming, witty, or thoughtful. Perhaps this is a show that will have some appeal to some demographic but it's definitely a strange fruit at it's beginning. It's a sad fact with today's TV scheduling a show which could have potential might not make it because of a rocky start.<br/><br/>Networks want blockbuster ratings right from the start or else they cancel a show. Viewers are often left holding the bag emotionally if they invest themselves in liking the show or the characters only to find their new interest has been suddenly cut off. This leaves a frustrated and short attention span set of viewers and that's just not a good thing for anyone. It seems unlikely Elementary will be one of those that goes the distance unless the cast and crew can tighten up this show in very quick order.",73 out of 143 found this helpful.,9.0,30 September 2012
294,Elementary, CSI: Sherlock,"I love Sherlock Holmes; from the original Doyle books to Basil Rathbone to Benedict Cumberbatch. When I heard that they were going to do an modern American version I thought ""hmmmm"". We have to admit that the Americans do not have a great track record when it comes to remaking British television. With Elementary they continue this tradition of ""not getting it"". Why didn't they just name this series ""CSI: Sherlock""? They have reduced Sherlock to just another mindless, formulaic American melodrama. Sorry but I will not be watching another episode of this. I will wait for the next Benedict Cumberbatch episode. Three episodes a year of the Benedict Cumberbatch series is better than 20 of Elementary.",152 out of 319 found this helpful.,3.0,6 October 2012
295,Elementary, Sherlock Holmes in name only,"I don't have cable, so I'm unsure whether this show is 'doing well'. I came here out of curiosity and to figure out if it was overall well-received. I know a lot of people that don't like it, but I was surprised to find so many that did. I can only assume that the people that like this show must not be familiar with Sherlock Holmes lore or if they are that they must lack basic understanding of the very mechanisms of what makes him who he is. I'll watch just about anything involving the concept of Sherlock Holmes and I do watch Elementary. In fact, I've watched every single episode since the show began, perhaps with optimism that it would improve. However, I believe I am watching it at this point only out of morbid curiosity.<br/><br/>The show is so far removed from what Sherlock is meant to be that I can only see it as a detective drama where the characters happened to share the traditional names of Sherlock and Watson. In that respect, I suppose watching it as a fun crime show is understandable, but is there anyone that watches this that is an actual admirer of the works of the original stories? I'm not sure it's possible to be one and like this show.<br/><br/>Simply because the characterization of the man they are calling Sherlock on Elementary behaves in exact opposition of the very essence of this man's nature. I am not talking about portrayals, or moving the flat, or making Watson a woman. These are all things that are creative to change and are good to re-hash into something new to keep interest. But I am talking about things that this character does that undermine the core of Sherlock Holmes and therefore he can no longer be himself.<br/><br/>I began noticing these things right away. Sherlock Holmes, as originally written can certainly be referred to as a drug addict. For those unfamiliar with the works it is referenced in the book that to keep his mind from becoming painfully unused he often used cocaine, sometimes for weeks on end during periods where he didn't take a case. In a sense, he is an addict. He is addicted to the feeling of solving cases. When he is not on a case, he is not happy. He is always waiting for the next case to come and when there is not a case, he turns to drugs to fill the hole of his addiction. This is a fundamental character trait and what fuels this man in every thing he does.<br/><br/>It's hard not to notice that in Elementary they removed this component entirely. Yes, Sherlock's drug addiction is a very strong plot point of the series and though the drug his choice has changed, that is not my issue with its presentation.<br/><br/>My issue is that the reasoning behind his addiction is because of a woman. His supposed loss of Irene Adler is what weakened his mind and spiraled his life out of control and into addiction. This is so fundamentally wrong. To take a character that is essentially a human computer, who has one of the greatest brains ever known, and to take him down to the level of addiction because of the loss of a woman (something he disdained) is so horribly incorrect. From this specific point, you have made this a regular crime drama about a man and his lost love. Sherlock does not have a lost love. He has developed his methods and powers of observation through shutting out all emotions. It allows him to see things that others don't. Simply put, he would not waste himself away on drugs because of a simple base human need. I am so disappointed in this fact, that it does not seem that this could be the same character because it directly conflicts with his computer-like brain.<br/><br/>Recently, the character of Moriarty was introduced. This is Sherlock's absolute adversary, because they are at exact opposite ends of the spectrum. One is the ultimate observer and one is never observed. These two concepts are so strongly opposite that they eventually align perfectly and destruction must come upon one of them simply because both cannot exist. Even though I had given up on the show, I was ashamed to admit that I was still looking forward to Moriarty's appearance, who in my mind represents the greatest opposing force ever designed. Needless to even write, I was pretty disappointed when right away he was mixed up with Irene Adler, essentially using her as a pawn to toy with Sherlock's emotions. Which, of course, once again shifts the focus of the show away from intellect and into emotion. Because Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock was all about emotions, right? Right...<br/><br/>In conclusion, I suppose for a mainstream television show, there would be less interest if relationships were not the driving focus. The average person is simply not interested in watching a great mind work. They need the boy meets girl storyline. I am just sorry they had to force that very basic (and trite) concept upon one of the best stories ever written.",91 out of 186 found this helpful.,1.0,14 May 2013
296,Elementary, Writers Need Help!,"I have no problem with the cast, and though this Sherlock does not compare to BBC's Sherlock, I'm getting rather fond of the neurotic, twitchy character. Lu is wonderful, as always. What I think this show needs is better writing, before the writers destroy what could potentially be a fabulous series. This is supposed to be Sherlock Holmes, the ultimate in mystery series, and I managed to figure out the entire plot in the first 20 minutes. ""Murder, She Wrote"" and ""Castle"" had/have better writers.<br/><br/>If someone out there knows the writer of this series, please tell him to stop drawing focus to the murderer(s).<br/><br/>""SPOILER ALERT""<br/><br/>I have just watched ""The Angel of Death Episode"". The elevator scene where Sherlock apologizes to the janitor is unnecessary. As I watched this I was wondering why they would focus on such an insignificant character, just so that Sherlock (who is an egomaniac) would apologize to him? Then you have the whole bit about Watson not being a doctor anymore and I KNEW the janitor had to be the killer. If they left the elevator scene out, we would still have seen the janitor and remembered what a jerk Sherlock was for spilling that water, so when he connected the obvious, that a janitor could have been a doctor, and revealed the killer, we may have been surprised. Then there was the part in the interrogation, when the janitor is convinced the young woman was terminal. An interesting twist, but who could have done it? The only other person that comes to mind is the crazy doctor with the God complex. There are NO OTHER suspects. Mysteries are filled with other suspects!<br/><br/>The greatest of mystery writers always say that they have no idea who the killer is. They write about the murder, populate the scene with character and at the end of an interesting story they pick the least likely character and then rewrite a clue into the story for the big reveal.<br/><br/>The reason they do this is because when you are writing knowing who's done it, you cannot help yourself but write in obvious clues. The clues have to be something tiny that the audience or the reader would not pick upon as they watch or read the story.<br/><br/>So, please for the future scripts give us more suspects, think of a crazy, non obvious scenario and a reason why a murder could be done, and pick the least likely suspect. If you cannot write a mystery (one of the hardest genres to write--that is why Christie and Doyle remain crime royalty) find someone who can and give them a job; even a co-writer who can write mysteries would help.",63 out of 127 found this helpful.,5.0,2 November 2012

300,Star Wars Rebels, Great addition to the Star Wars Universe,"I really dont get why so many people gave bad reviews for this show?
This is a fantastic show with great characters and amazing plot lins which just get better with every season.<br/><br/>This show is about Ezra Bridger, a young force sensitive boy who joins a rebel cell with cool new characters like Kanan, Sabine, Zeb and Chopper and we see the early beginning of the rebellion between episode 3 and 4.
And I love some of the new characters, especially Zeb, Chopper and Ezra and they have such chemistry together and it is lovely to see how they evolve and how they interact with each other.<br/><br/>I must admit, that I dont like the animation style as much as the Clone Wars style, but it is ok and you get used to it. I get when people call it more kid friendly but still, there are cool plotlines and a good laugh arent something bad in my opinion and I think it gets more adult friendly as the show continues. Ok, there are some filler episodes that arent really relevant and of course there are some stupid episodes, but almost every show has moments that you dont enjoy, but the majority of the episodes are really fun to watch and the bring something new to the World of Star Wars and they expand the Canon.
That are the only negative things I could think about and I dont believe that they are really bad or are hurting the show.<br/><br/>What else I really like is, that we get a new look on older Characters like Darth Vader, Maul, Ahsoka Tano, Captain Rex, Princess Leia, Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Bo-Katan, Hondo Ohnaka and others and they do their part in delivering some cool plotlines.<br/><br/>On top of that we also get some more new Characters integrated into the Canon, like Great Admiral Thrawn, Agent Callus, The Bendu or the Inquisitors. And all of them bring something new to the world and it is nice to see how the characters evolve over the seasons.<br/><br/>The only reason why Rebels only gets a 9/10 instead a 10/10 is simply that it isnt integrated as much into the overarching Star Wars Story as for example The Clone Wars and Rebels stands on its own for the most part and even the ending didnt really get a final conclusion and is still left open.
But of course that can change in the near future with the second season of the Mandalorian where Bo-Katam and Ahsoka should make their Live-Action debut and maybe we even see other characters returning. And maybe even there will even be some connections to the upcoming Obi-Wan show or the Cassian Andor show. And if that happens and Rebels will have a bigger impact on the entire Franchise, then I am sure I will lift this up to a 10/10.<br/><br/>Still I would recommend it to every Star Wars fan, because it is an amazing addition to the Canon and you should build your own opinion about the show",24 out of 25 found this helpful.,9.0,4 June 2020
301,Star Wars Rebels, Surprisingly good,"When I finished Clone Wars I asked if watching Rebels was worth it, and many people replied that no. They said that the show was very childish, with no memorable characters and that the animation was worse than in CW. Anyway, I did it and after finishing it I can say that it's as good as Clone Wars, in my opinion.<br/><br/>It's true that the first season isn't so good, you can even skip some episodes because nothing at all happens (There's a guide online showing which episodes you can skip), but after that the series really does get better. In season 2 many characters from Clone Wars return and there's plenty of references to stories from the previous show. Not only that, but the new characters evolve in a realistic way as the show progresses. It's funny how in the beginning I didn't symphatize with any of the main characters, but later I ended up liking all of them.<br/><br/>In Star Wars Rebels the stories are shorter than in its predecessor, usually of just one episode instead of the 3 or 4 episode arcs of CW. This is both a good and bad thing as the stories aren't so complex as we could expect and even sometimes feel rushed, but they're still pretty good. And since it's in the Imperial Era, it feels more like classic Star Wars movies. The worst part of the show is the animation, it's been downgraded from Clone Wars.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Star Wars Rebels is a very good show. If you like Star Wars you should watch it. The first season isn't good but later it gets really good and you won't regret watching it.",45 out of 50 found this helpful.,8.0,18 April 2019

303,Star Wars Rebels," A handful of essential arcs, rest is mostly solid Star Wars.","After The Mandalorian reignited my love for the universe, a week later The Rise of Skywalker took it all back. Looking for some good Star Wars I watched The Clone Wars and loved it. Sure, it had it's series of stinker episodes, but it's highs were some of the best Star Wars stories told. The prequels are still AWFUL movies, but The Clone Wars actually made me enjoy the pre-Empire era of Star Wars and see fantastic stories can be told in it. It made me care about Anakin, and Ashoka became my favorite character in the universe. After finishing The Clone Wars, it only seemed apt to continue the story with Rebels.<br/><br/>Rebels is an easy recommendation for any Star Wars fans, but overall I don't think it quite reaches the same quality as The Clone Wars. Honestly the best parts of it were the stories that related to the Clone Wars series, like Ahsoka, Maul, and Commander Rex.<br/><br/>A big part of the reason I never felt as strong a connection like I did to The Clone Wars was because of the main cast of characters. Ezra is essentially the lead character of the series. A continual focus is his journey to becoming a Jedi and finding out who he is supposed to be. As a character I just really never got into him. A big part of his appeal is probably more relatable to younger viewers who dream of becoming a Jedi. He grows, but he is just a cocky teenager the whole series which usually was just annoying.<br/><br/>The rest of the Ghost crew are fun and enjoyable to watch. Sabine and Hera are probably the strongest out of them, but I just never felt as strong about them like I did to the cast of The Clone Wars.<br/><br/>There's just only a handful arcs that I consider essential Star Wars stories here. For sure the Ahsoka/Vader reunion (which includes Maul),the leftover clones, and the Mandalorian arc. The rest of the series is full of fun to watch episodes, with none of them really being essential. Thrawn's inculsion elevates the last two seasons and he is a fantastic villain as Vader is really only in a few episodes. The first two seasons for sure lacking a strong foil as Callus is a weak villain and the Inquisitors are throwaway evil guys with lightsabers.<br/><br/>The only real bad aspect to the series is some artistic choices with the character designs. The art style for sure is just passable, and really lacking compared to the Clone Wars. For some odd reason most human character's skin texture are all covered in freckles. Clone Wars' painterly textures looked great and fit well. Rebel's just doesn't work a lot and the freckled texture just look bad. The art style of some characters just don't look good.<br/><br/>It's a series that's enjoyable to watch. The only real memorable arcs are ones that incorporated Clone Wars story aspects. There are a handful of episodes that are just downright boring and too simplistic with it's story. If you don't have the time to watch the whole series, but are a Clone Wars fan, for sure watch the Clone's, Ahsoka's and Maul's episodes. The rest of the series is good, though with some weaker than others, but most of isn't essential if you don't have the time.",12 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,26 April 2020
304,Star Wars Rebels, Delight,"For me, as a fan of ""Star Wars"" since childhood, it was a real gift, even a surprise, because I did not expect that I would get to the show.<br/><br/>What can I say: the series is ""episode 3.5"" - the plot is located between the ""Sith Place"" and ""New Hope"". In the first series, the creators have saturated the plot with the atmosphere of a ""distant-distant galaxy"". Every now and then, the imperial storm troopers and their commanders step on the screen, and this instantly causes nostalgia for the very first film of 1977. The atmosphere is just as gloomy, the characters are completely new (unlike the animated series ""Clone Wars""), but this should not prevent loyal fans from enjoying a pleasant feeling. In addition, one of our old acquaintances, and possibly even two, has penetrated the premiere series.<br/><br/>The protagonist who hates the Empire, the boy Ezra, is an orphan who survives by theft. By the will of fate, he encountered a small group of resistance, which does everything to annoy the despotic Empire. This group is the rudiments of a rebel alliance (in the series the famous symbol of the rebels flashes), and this meeting will forever change the life of Ezra ...<br/><br/>The pilot ""Rebels"" is a story about friendship and a difficult choice, as well as about the sense of duty. This is 44 minutes, allowing you to plunge again into a familiar atmosphere (there was especially a musical accompaniment, similar to the creation of maestro John Williams), that already goose bumps are provided. Beautiful, eye-pleasing graphics remained at the same level as in Clone Wars. The action will be enough: chasing motorcycles (by voice acting and by drawing this scene can be called a reference to ""The Return of the Jedi"") and classic skirmishes on blasters, which so likes, which Han Solo trusts. In general, the pilot of the ""Rebel"" turned out to be very sound, memorable, interesting. And most importantly - the desire to watch has arisen after the first series (although in some serials, retraction occurs through several episodes).<br/><br/>So I'll watch a new chapter of the ZV on, those more, I've been waiting for her very much.

305,Star Wars Rebels," Ignore the poor, heavily biased, and purposely manipulative reviews.","If you happen to view any of the other ""reviews"" here you'll find that many have given abysmal ratings for the show because of trivial reasoning; many because they're still rather perturbed over the status of the Expanded Universe, others seem like attempts at trolling, and many are spiteful simply because they don't agree with the concept of the show and cannot accept that the Expanded Universe isn't coming back. One even seems to have gone the full-on melodramatic route and declared Star Wars to be dead and that they won't be showing their younger siblings Star Wars at all due to this horrible tragedy.<br/><br/>Should you view the individual ratings given to the show you'll find that the general opinion is favorable with votes generally increasing the higher up the ratings you go, save for a rather blatantly obvious discrepancy. The ratio of ""1/10"" reviews compared to the others has been grossly blown out of proportion by people whose anger seems to have overcome them.<br/><br/>The characters are perfectly fine, the animation could have been better I will admit, and the pacing for the premiere was quick and could have taken more time to breath but when all has been said and done the show has learned from the mistakes made during the early seasons of The Clone Wars and has applied those lessons much the same as the latter seasons did.<br/><br/>People talking about how the designs or appearances of things are off haven't been paying attention to the development of the show, as the creators have on numerous occasions cited the reasoning behind the changes and additions. The Imperial's equipment has taken a design cue from Kenner's classic line of toys adored by children who grew up on Star Wars, fans, and collectors alike. The show takes places five years before ""Star Wars"" and as such they wanted everything to feel extremely familiar while being off just enough to give the feel of this being a different time period. The TIE Fighters have shorter wings, the stormtrooper's helmets are more bulbous and their blasters have a small hump along the spine, and the REX droids from Star Tours serve as pilots on spacecraft. The camera remains static and far less dynamic to mimic the movement of the original movies while even switching to mimic 70mm film during space sequences. The lightsabers flicker and are flatter, green light cracks whenever two blades meet, and pulling out a lightsaber feels special again. Every single detail has been carefully considered and crafted to capture the feel of the Original Trilogy Era and movies.<br/><br/>It's Firefly meets Star Wars with a ragtag crew running around the edge of civilized space trying to get by and hitting the Empire whenever the chance is presented. It's classic Star Wars and exactly the kind of thing you'd like should you be a fan of Star Wars at all.",240 out of 349 found this helpful.,9.0,5 October 2014
306,Star Wars Rebels," It's About Family, the Heart of Any Great Star Wars Story","Season One (2014) There's a familial heart to this first season which makes it immediately appealing, centering on building a strong foundation in the relationships of our main cast and giving us an idea how tightly knit they would become over the series. The first season flounders a little when it comes to properly conveying the threat of the Empire, a flaw which is rectified very efficiently by the arrival of Grand Moff Tarkin; and it builds to a bold and satisfying resolution that lets the audience know that, like Clone Wars before it, Rebels is not afraid to push boundaries and embrace the Darker Side of Star Wars stories.<br/><br/>Season Two (2015) Where the first season placed a lot of focus on Kanan and Ezra, the second expands that focus to envelop the entire crew, taking their small weekly victories and allowing the events of the series to greater influence those on a galactic scale. It builds on the familiar and begins to dabble in new and darker ideas, opening the story up to unimaginable levels of potential; and the raw emotion at the heart of the season's climactic finale, an epic confrontation years in the making, gives fans the duel they never knew they wanted and makes them pay for it tenfold in heart-wrenching tension.<br/><br/>Season Three (2016) By far the most stylistic and best looking the series has ever been, the third season deals heavily with the consequences of the previous two, moving the story forward and making our heroes pay for every small victory they have achieved. Though a thorough and calculated slow burn to the finale, we are rewarded with some of the most visually stunning sequences in Star Wars animation; building toward a conclusion so rife in tension and nail-biting action as to be worthy of Grand Admiral Thrawn's inclusion to the series.<br/><br/>Season Four (2017) The fourth and final season is by far the strongest and most coherent of the series, blending the classically episodic nature of previous seasons into one long continuous story that grows and evolves week on week. But even through a season of some of the best action and most revolutionary additions to the mythology, the heart of the show is still its family of central characters and their powerful bond; forcing them to choose between their allegiances to the Rebellion and their relationships with each other as they face their hardest challenges and most tragic losses ever.",19 out of 23 found this helpful.,8.0,5 January 2020

With Season 3 being the only consistently great season, and Season 1 being terrible at times, I can't say this is anywhere near the Clone Wars, but it does continue some stories from that show which I'm thankful for.

308,Star Wars Rebels," Good, but makes me miss Clone Wars","I'm gonna level with you I did not want anything to do with this show when I heard it was coming out, I thought that the idea of the show wouldn't be that interesting, given that it's called STAR WARS, and they were only a small team just messing with the empire. The characters themselves are likable but not great (except for Hera). Kanan isn't that compelling, Ezra is a total copy of Luke, Zep is one-dimensional, Chopper is no R2-D2, and Sabine is a Mandalorian artist (an artist, really). <br/><br/>My biggest gripe with this show is the animation, it looks primitive and the characters are oddly shaped. And don't get me started on how the lightsaber blades look, they look like glowsticks in the shape of toothpicks. You can also see some details look like they are drawn in with crayon. <br/><br/>However, everything changed when I heard Ahsoka and Rex were coming to this show. I fell in love with those two characters in the Clone Wars, which is an AMAZING series that not enough people gave a chance. So I instantly caught myself up, and so far the story is just mediocre. When I got to season 2 and seeing Ahsoka there, I had hope, but they are completely underutilizing her and Rex, that may change as the show goes on. <br/><br/>To put it frankly, this show is piggy packing itself from the greatness of the Clone Wars; Kanan was a padawan, Sabine is a mandalorian, Hera is the daughter of a character from the Clone Wars, and they are using story lines first used in the previous show. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong this is an enjoyable show, but the Clone Wars is better by leaps and bounds. Each episode was different, one could be epic, one could have you at the edge of your seat, one could be boring, and then one could have your jaw dropping to the floor. Rebels is just using the same premise over and over again. <br/><br/>And my final thoughts, Rebels is a good animated series, with some lackluster animation; but to its credit it has a lot to live up to after the amazing series that was the Clone Wars.",44 out of 71 found this helpful.,6.0,9 December 2015

It follows the group of rebels and their fight against the empire while building the rebellion as we know it.

Ezra ends up joining a small group of rebels in their fight against the rebellion while he is trained in the ways of the Jedi.<br/><br/>If you were disappointed that The Clone Wars ended with a lot of unanswered questions. Then you will be happy to hear that a lot of those questions are answered in this show. While also bringing up some new questions.

311,Star Wars Rebels, It is a very good and nice show - I don't understand all the hate,"I love Star Wars - the basic premise of an epic universe, battle of good vs evil, classic take on characters and their traits and promoting clean and pure values...Most of us love (or have loved) Star Wars for those reasons.<br/><br/>Now, do you think kids and younger teenagers will want to watch 30 year old movies and will be susceptible to the story and its values despite the ""prehistoric"" graphics and effects? Unfortunately, most of them won't be attracted and will watch it if you make them and look at it through that lens to some extent - and that is reality.<br/><br/>So if you look at ""Rebels"" as a new branch in that universe, fresh content promoting the same types of characters, similar story lines and the same values - can it not be only positive that it exists? To attract today's kids and to provide content of this kind to them, instead of them watching Game of Thrones, Dexter and alike?<br/><br/>I understand that, as a die-hard Star Wars fan of 30 or 40, you can disprove the lack of originality, the relative crudeness of animation and what not - but, hey - this is Star Wars, just the same as it always has been - if you loved it before, there is no reason to hate it now, in this form.<br/><br/>So I would understand reviews of 6+, but 1? That's just lame.<br/><br/>As a 31 year old, I found it interesting and entertaining and a nice watch. Worth my time and certainly worth your kid's time.

I'd also like to make it clear that Lucasfilm Animation has done the work, not Disney as so many silly fans have come to believe.<br/><br/>Now then, Star Wars Rebels: Spark of the Rebellion has proved itself to be a fantastic beginning to the new series. It's a much better first impression than the terrible 2008 Clone Wars movie. The characters are likable. Ezra is sneaky and charming. Kanan is cool yet mysterious. Hera is kind and motherly. Sabine is crazed and wild. Zeb is bullyish and violent. Chopper doesn't seem to like or care about anyone. Even the main villain of this episode, Agent Kallus, proves to be a badass, hellbent on capturing our heroes. Not only are these characters so entertaining to watch interact with each other but the story is loads of good fun. It never becomes too childish for adult viewers or too graphic for very young viewers. It's as well balanced as the Original Trilogy that first started back in 1977. It's funny, clever, actiony, and intense at certain moments. It all feels like Star Wars. More so than any other Star Wars show that's ever been on TV. The interesting characters, fun story, and balanced tone make this totally worth you're time for future episodes.

The only problem I have with this really is the wookies, they look like the old action figures. But that being said this is a great first episode, much better than the clone wars and instead of using old characters they're using new ones, which is fantastic. I do see this show evolving on the way that the Clone Wars did. Also Obi-wan had a cameo, which was brilliant and Clone wars fans will lose their pants over it. The overall story is quite interesting, the rebels have to try and free a bunch of wookie slaves, however before hand they run into Ezra who screws everything up for them.

318,Star Wars Rebels, Better then imagined and only getting better,At first I was very skeptical of the new Star Wars canon after removing the old EU from canon. The pilot was not as good as hyped but still was very close. After that it only seemed to get better. The show seems to flow seamlessly from episode to episode. I know that I can not speak for the rest of the series but at least in the first several episodes there are great character development and interaction. This show feels like Star Wars and give me the feeling I had when I first saw Star Wars for the first time. I think that Lucasfilm made a good move in creating new characters that we have not had exposure to yet and makes for a better show. If Episode VII is as good as this show it will be great but hoping for better.

Star Wars Rebels replaces the last three Star War films as the continuation of the original vitality and brilliance that brought us New Hope, Empire, and Jedi. If young Anikin were of the age, personality, and vigor of Ezra (the primary character of Rebels) Phantom Menace and the other Star Wars prequel movies might have had a chance. Rebels is scripted wonderfully, the animation is lively and beautifully lighted, the music is gorgeous, and the characters are just about perfect. The whole show is all the more a delight because it was a surprise to me. I expected another silly, weak product with the Star Wars name slapped on it. But this show is just the opposite.

320,Star Wars Rebels, I've totally changed my opinion of this series...,"About a week ago I wrote a comment that ranked ""Rebels"" as a 3 of 10 after watching all but the last episode on the 1st Season. <br/><br/>Well I stuck with the series and am about half-way through Season 2 and I gotta admit that the characters are really starting to grow on me. I'm even starting to love Chopper (the overly emotive astromech; think R2D2 on emotional steroids). <br/><br/>Maybe it was the appearance of Darth Vader, or maybe it was Ahsoka, or maybe it was Agent Kallus, or the Inquisitors, or all of the above, but I went from disliking this series to almost loving it. It's not up there with ""Clone Wars,"" but I'd say it's a good, solid sequel. <br/><br/>So now I'd rate this series as 7.5 of 10.<br/><br/>Below is my previous review (I withdraw it).<br/><br/>What a huge disappointment...<br/><br/>A coworker of mine bought me a 3-month Netflix subscription card this past Christmas. So I'm checking out all the possibilities and I see the animated series ""Star Wars - Clone Wars"" and I think to myself: ah, sure, why not?<br/><br/>Well I got to tell you, that was an excellent choice! I absolutely fell in love with that series. I love the characters (especially Ahsoka Tano), the animation, the plot lines, the dialogue. It's an animated series for adults, with complicated plots and complex moral dilemmas.<br/><br/>But I finished watching the six seasons and felt a need for more Star Wars fare. Then I noticed that there's another animated series, ""Star Wars Rebels"" that takes place about 15 years after the conclusion of Clone Wars. I was super excited, but Netflix doesn't offer it, so I decided to buy the 1st season DVDs off Amazon.<br/><br/>That was a huge mistake.<br/><br/>A few minutes into the very 1st episode I realized that this is a children's cartoon -- totally different maturity level from Clone Wars. I'd say the target demographics would be children, maybe tweens, or early adolescents, but nothing beyond 16 years old. <br/><br/>Everything about this series is such a letdown: the characters, the silly dialogue, the ""god-mode"" invulnerability of the six Rebels themselves (no matter how many storm troopers or tie fighters are blasting away, none of the Rebels even suffers a scratch, while all of the Imperials are taken out of action -- with the exception of a newly introduced Dark Side character -- will not mention the name). He is actually a pretty cool antagonist, but he's not enough to make up for all the many, many shortfalls in this unworthy sequel to Clone Wars.<br/><br/>I'm struggling to get through episode 12, figured I spent the money, I should at least watch all 15 -- but it's a tough slog.<br/><br/>Rebels is so awful that I actually miss Jar-Jar Binks, and I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd type that out onto the intertoobs for all the world to see (or at least the world as represented by IMDb).<br/><br/>3 out of 10.",17 out of 31 found this helpful.,7.0,7 July 2016

325,Taboo, A dark tale of dark passions; beautifully shot and acted - and utterly unique,"Imagine a man with the shaman-like charisma and borderline madness of Jim Morrison (at least as he was depicted in Oliver Stone's film 'The Doors') but equipped with the vicious fighting skills of Wolverine. Add to that the intellect and strategic talents of Francis Underwood from 'House of Cards' as well as a - very large - dose of trauma induced mental problems (especially mother issues; well: some sister issues as well) – and you've almost got James Keziah Delaney (Tom Hardy), the central character of the new show 'Taboo'. And let me tell you: he just so happens to be one of the most compelling and original protagonists I've seen in a TV-show since Ian McShane blessed us with the character of Al Swearengen in 'Deadwood' (ok, there was that other guy from that cooking show, you know: 'Baking Bread' or something like that - he was pretty singular too).<br/><br/>'Taboo' is certainly not an easy show to describe - it's simply too unique for that - but let me have a go at it anyway. As with all my reviews, this is supposed to give you an overall impression of the show, so you won't find any plot details here, although some very minor spoilers are possible. Please bear in mind that I'm a hopeless screen junkie who has long lost the ability to properly use language unless it's in the context of film, so forgive me for constantly referencing other films and TV-shows in order to describe this series. If this grave condition of mine bothers you, you might want to stop reading now.<br/><br/>Still here? OK: imagine the dark, brooding atmosphere of 'True Detective' (I'm talking about the first season, of course) and transfer that mood to the city of London in 1814, at a time when the war between Britain and America is still going on but slowly nearing its end. Now further imagine that time period (candlelit rooms, horse carriages riding over cobblestones, fog rising from the river Thames and creeping through dark streets and busy docks) captured through the breathtakingly beautiful cinematography we usually find in a Ridley Scott film. Are you with me so far? Good. Because now that we've established the tone, mood and look of this show, we can explore the world of James Delaney a little further.<br/><br/>The end of the Anglo-American war is in sight, and as peace negotiations between the warring parties are secretly taking place, there's a third major player involved who is scheming to protect its influence: the East India Company, one of the first - and perhaps most powerful - corporations in history. It's this fascinating time of upheaval and secret battles for power in and around the New World which provides the backdrop for 'Taboo', and the show does an amazing job at transporting the audience to that era. This series features some of the best production design I've ever seen in a show (or a feature film, actually); everything looks lived-in and genuine; whether it be ships, houses, clothes or landscapes; every grimy cobble stone in every dimly lit alley virtually oozes authenticity.<br/><br/>When we first meet Delaney, he makes an entrance worthy of the Count of Monte Cristo. In case you don't know the story, that's the guy who was framed for a crime he didn't commit and then locked away for so long everybody eventually thought he was dead - only to return one day, rich beyond imagination, and with an elaborate plan on how to take revenge on everyone that had wronged him. This theme of a guy returning from the dead with unexplained riches but a mysterious plan on his mind is sort of the starting point for 'Taboo' (but it's only the starting point, so this isn't a spoiler). As we soon find out, Delaney's actually more like the Count of Monte Cristo's disturbed, savage twin, for he does things Edmond Dantes (that's the Count's real name) probably couldn't conceive of in his wildest dreams. Through his return - and by carrying out his plan - Delaney puts himself in the impossible position where he's not only up against the sinister forces of the East India Company, but also against the British Crown as well as the Americans, and it will take all his cunning and every dirty trick and violent skill at his disposal for him to stay alive and protect his interests.<br/><br/>Thanks to Tom Hardy's charismatic screen presence (and great writing), watching Delaney as he plots, threatens, kills, steals and hallucinates his way through this deadly game of chess is a thrilling joy and never less than compelling. Hardy creates the chilling portrait of a man who is haunted by the ghosts of his past; a man who seems to have one foot already firmly rooted in the afterlife and who communicates with the spirits of the dead - yet at the same time he's a relentless force of nature who pursues his goals with unwavering determination. There are many reasons to enjoy 'Taboo': this dark tale of dark passions - and even darker secrets - is beautifully written (by Hardy Sr., Hardy Jr. and 'Peaky Blinders' creator Steven Knight); it's gorgeous to look at (it was produced by Ridley Scott and shot by Scott's frequent collaborator Mark Patten), and it features great performances by such prominent British thesps as Jonathan Pryce, David Hayman or Stephen Graham - but make no mistake: this is 100% Hardy's show. The role of Delaney is tailor-made for him, and I honestly can't imagine 'Taboo' working with any other actor.<br/><br/>So to sum up my review: I highly recommend 'Taboo' to every Tom Hardy fan, but anyone who likes their tales dark and twisted and doesn't mind a somewhat deliberate pace (I'm talking to you, 'True Detective' fans) is equally well served - especially fans of original material.

Though I don't want to diminish any of the other actors, as literally each one of them are all doing a very superb job. Taboo literally has the best all around acting in a television show that I've ever seen. At the end of every episode, it is unbearable to think that I have to wait another week to see what happens next.<br/><br/>The time period for this show, for me personally, sets the entire mood. It REALLY gives off a sort of Old London, Jack the Ripper feel while watching it. I'm not sure how else to describe the mood of the show, but that feels right.<br/><br/>Tom Hardy's character commands the screen. When he's on, you don't want to miss a single word or grunt. Taboo also has some great dark humor to release stress build-up at crucial times.<br/><br/>I apologize if I'm being vague, but I don't want to spoil a single thing.

Everything is so detailed the costumes, the sets, the locations , the music, the characters. You can't expect more from a TV series. <br/><br/>There's nobody else who can play James Delaney better than Tom Hardy. And who wouldn't want to see Tom hardy every Saturday, eh? The guy can deliver some mad roles. Based in 1800s Taboo shows the dark tales of James Delaney the protagonist of the English series.

330,Taboo, Not everyone's cuppa but what a fine cuppa it is if you're into tea,"Apparently Tom Hardy lost a few million on this one. I find it hard to believe. Perhaps the person who did the calculations only took into account how the show did on its mother channel on TV in the UK. But that's just the beginning of its story, I would say, because there is streaming and DVDs and foreign sales... A lot of people prefer to stream stuff because it's more convenient. A fixed TV time isn't always a good time to watch something. I'm pretty sure Hardy knew what he was doing, and anyway, it's just not freakin' possible that this show isn't gonna do amazingly well around the world. NO WAY.<br/><br/>It's a period show and not everyone is into those, but if you are, man, what a story. I have so much respect for Tom for being a great actor who just can't make a bad movie - and now he also created 'Taboo'? What a talent this guy has! You gotta love his approach to acting and storytelling and you can see he is only after the best quality in everything he does. 'Taboo' is yet another example of this. <br/><br/>The story line is very intriguing, it's cooking slowly but keeps you hooked, and all the characters are great and very colourful. There is so much attention to detail here, especially when it comes to historical accuracy, but not only that. It's easy to watch a show and say 'it's amazing', but take the time to stop and think about how much work went into designing this, and into the filming. It's not just the clothes and the places and mannerisms, etc., but the many different characters too, each of whom has their own story and personality. And then there's the whole main story and the many twists and turns, with James Delaney always being on top of things, always having an ace up his sleeve. How does one simply write such a show 'just like that'? We watch it and enjoy it, but the work - the work! Think about it every step of the way and you will truly be amazed at what Hardy achieved here. You'll see a perfectionist behind every frame. <br/><br/>I like all the actors playing all the different parts, they make it seem like this is happening for real. It's uncanny. And of course, Tom Hardy himself, the cursed James Delaney, who you know is a very bad man but you still want him to succeed. Hardy has outdone himself for sure, and hats off to him for always getting better and better, and doing it so easily. You can't take your eyes off the screen watching this. You just can't. <br/><br/>I wonder why there are only 8 episodes in this season. I was expecting something around 20 because this became my new favorite show. Now it looks like there might not even be season 2? If there's a petition to keep this show alive, just tell me where to put my signature. I'll sign with both hands and feet.",134 out of 167 found this helpful.,10.0,1 March 2017

332,Taboo, Highly recommended,"This excellent series mixes elements of ""Heart of Darkness,"" ""Benito Cereno,"" ""Legends of the Fall,"" and ""One Hundred Years of Solitude,"" with Native American and African magic and myth. In 1814, during the War of 1812, between England and America, James Keziah Delaney is the prodigal son returning to London to see his ship-magnate father, whom James senses is ill. James has been in Africa for ten years, with no contact, and is thought to be dead, by most everyone who knows him or of him, in England.<br/><br/>During those years away, James Keziah has crewed on an illegal slave ship that shipwrecked, was enslaved by African tribesmen, then rescued by a tribal shaman, with whom he apprenticed to learn the ways of African magic and sorcery. All of that is told in flashbacks and glimpses of James's memories.<br/><br/>In London, James finds that his father is dead, a coin on each of his closed eyes, and that he has inherited a place named Nootka Sound, a natural harbor on the west coast of Vancouver Island. There, some thirty years before, James's father bought Nootka from the (Kwakiutl or Klinget?) natives, and also took a Native American wife, who then gave birth to their son, James Keziah. Now, The East India Company, as well as King George, want Nootka Sound because it is a strategically perfect port, a gateway to China and Asia, its tea and its other riches. They will kill to get it. Americans and their spies, in London, are also after Nootka Sound, for the same strategic reasons as the British, it lying on the proposed border between the U. S. and Canada. They are also after gunpowder for their ships' cannons and for their guns.<br/><br/>But James refuses to sell Nootka, for his own reasons, and therefore must cope with the wrath of the East India Company's hired killers and scoundrels, who go after a ship that James has bought, as well as come after him to try and murder him. A fat and sloppy King George, and his treacherous advisor, also come after James, and he suffers the consequences of going against the crown.<br/><br/>Along with all of this are combined many taboos--incest, jealousy, greed, duels, stolen diamonds. We also meet a host of ciiminals and scoundrels from the docks, among them a tattoed Maori, all hired by Delaney. The espionage and betrayals here are as complicated, convoluted and compelling as a Le Carrré or a Hammett novel.<br/><br/>It seems to me that most good fiction is based on a mixture of truth and lies, those added to make the story more concise, and simply better. Very often, it is more true than ""truth."" This telenovela is not for the feint of heart, or the squeamish. It is a wonderful and amazing eight episodes of film making, for intelligent viewers of film and readers of great literature When finished watching these episodes, one hopes to soon see its proposed continuation, as James Keziah Delaney and his ragged crew, head for America and Nootka Sound, by way of the Azores, where James has more ""business with someone,"" with whom he has ""a use.""<br/><br/>RJZ",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,22 September 2020

It is the best written and acted show I have seen in some time. The writing is superb. I am hooked. Hope this gets renewed and not just a one season show. We don't watch primetime and always look for something ""smart"". This show is just that. It draws you in with the history angle but the back story and the current situation make you root for James Delaney. As his life went awry from the start, his experiences in life have molded him into the person he is today. A man who is completely undone, yet cunning and smart. A planner. A doer. A man who is determined to get what is his at all costs and make others pay. Thank you!",66 out of 82 found this helpful.,10.0,24 January 2017
335,Taboo," ""I have a use for this series""","Finally I came to see this Gothic gem from the BBC and I am not disappointed - quite the contrary is the case.<br/><br/>In 'Taboo' the set up of the world and the creation of a very dark and at the same time tender atmosphere as well as the nicely arranged spectrum of taboo-motifs (like sexual transgression, the grotesque and strange, overwhelming violence etc.) kept me from being bothered by the fact that I didn't feel one jot more sympathy for its main character than for its antagonists. James K. Delaney is an intriguing mysterious character attracting us in a depraved way. But he is also an individual of extreme moral reprehensibility we eventually cannot go along with. <br/><br/>The series makes very good use of Gothic- and Dark Romanticism writers' style to build up the gloomy atmosphere of a depressed 1814 England still anguished by the loss of the great colony. It is no coincidence when Delaney claims at some point in the series:""The ravens told me"". We find lots of Poe here either in theme or characters. Madness wanders through the world of 'Taboo' and at least at the dip of the hem this madness is always caused by the East India Company, the Crown or Delaney. Curiously all the characters except Delaney himself are appearing so vulnerably and fragile that their indulgence (to be helpless and lost in this made up society) arises a counter-part to the unforgiveness of the room they live in. <br/><br/>'Taboo' also declares the downfall of the classic adventure genre. There is no space for nostalgic explorers or discoverers in the plot lines, Delaney is a broken man as he returns from Africa, even if he is not willing to admit this. It's rather a farewell to the exotic, the story takes place after the alleged adventure and mainly stays at the well-known. Interestingly the series manages it to combine some accounts on slavery shifting the story to an international level (not many historic series/ movies do this, they mostly remain in the domestic frame).<br/><br/>Further the actors do a very nice job. Particularly Tom Hardy, Jonathan Price and the reoccurring Mark Gatiss play exceptionally good. However I have to say that there was no huge character development, which I wished to see. The characters are not uni-dimensional, but they do not alter in their facets. The series tries to offset this flaw with new secrets and confessions in every episode pretending these to be a change, whilst it is actually only about the introduction of new information. A very common writing technique, I think. <br/><br/>Overall I can highly recommend 'Taboo', especially for fans of Gothic, Grotesque and the 19th century England.",30 out of 35 found this helpful.,8.0,22 May 2017

There are just enough supernatural fantasy elements to make it interesting and mysterious, but not so much to be over the top.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, especially Tom Hardy's character. His characteristic grunts and other non verbal communications play so well with his role.<br/><br/>The British East India company is historically intriguing, and lives up to the intrigue in this show. It's interesting to see such a portrayal, one of the primary players in the foundation of modern capitalism as an antagonist in this show.<br/><br/>Very enjoyable show.",79 out of 102 found this helpful.,10.0,29 January 2017

The depiction of 1800s Great Britain in all it's steamy vulgarity and corruption is intriguing and mesmerizing. Ridley Scott and Tom Hardy are at their outstanding best. The production quality and scenery is first rate. The acting throughout is of a rare quality in today's market. Tom Hardy does not disappoint in his character portrayal as the lead character. Mystery, treachery, intrigue and darkness are present in abundance in the first three episodes I have watched thus far. The reach of the East India company with its unscrupulous pursuit of power and wealth by any means has me drawn in. I cannot wait for the next episode!

343,Taboo, Great Georgian Drama,"This is a great series to watch and enjoy. The sets are authentic and mostly from Hatfield House. The ladies' dresses I thought were underdecorated and too plain for the time. Someone has suggested that it is an educators mightmare whereas I think it would well be used as a learning vehicle and fun to do.
The contessa's ball for example - there are too few men in uniform, whether or nor they were overseas fighting and winning the last phase of the Napoleonic War.
None of the fine houses seem to have any house servants. The master of the house or mistress would never see people out of the house after visiting. There seem not to be any people waiting at table or preparing food.
Nonetheless there are some really pleasing points to see. The American agent is in St Bartholomew's Hospital and historically Benjamin Franklin hired part of the cellar of Barts the Great for business before he emigrated. The outside of the house he has inherited from his father is overgrown and in disarray that matches the state of his affairs. Cholmondeley is based on Faraday who gave public lectures on science. He was at the Royal Institution and not the Royal Society. A great majority of scenes are candlelit, These are luxuriantly lit to give colour contrast - in fact the servants would be given candle ends to use up and would be doing it one at a time. There are far too many times when a room is left unwatched but full of lit candles. Corridors have candlebra but no one walking down them. Fires are kept in after everyone is in bed. The Prince Regent is referred to as Prince Prinny however the 'Prince' is unnecessary. His suite at Carlton House now pulled down was well represented. His costumes well conceived. Delaney wears his had inside buildings - completely wrong. Delaney is waterboarded in the Tower - preposterous - torture was not used after 1650 and waterboarding is 200 y too early.

Of course, what James appears to be, a ruthless trader on the make and what he really is, may not be the same thing. <br/><br/>This is a superb series.

346,Taboo," A lot to like here, but ultimately lacking where it counts.","Ok, let's get a few things out of the way. Tom Hardy is as fierce, committed and compulsively watchable as ever. If you're a fan, you get what you expect. Jessie Buckley, though lesser known, has a zesty charm and intelligence wherever she goes, and the same is true here. She's a highlight in a show that could otherwise have defaulted on cliched female characters. Set design and cinematography is decadent, dark and high budget... like a deeply sinister Dickens adaptation meets Black Sails from hell. Truly awesome. Sometimes passages of dialogue have the trademark Stephen Knight superiority... if you're ever going to be stuck in an elevator or on an island with someone, any one of his characters would be a fine choice.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Taboo suffers irrevocably from intensely bad pacing, among other things. The first two episodes establish only the bare external minimum, and are much more dependent on personality than progress. Still, without this initial momentum of progress character suffers too, even as plotting eventually picks up after about 4 eps and James vs. The East India Company gains twists and turns and little reveals. Hardy's character is distinctive, but only in distant shades and biting one liners. What he wants and why can be told by the external, as later on various action-y clever plots unfold to his ends, but going forth he remains oddly opaque even as the script attempts flashes of spiritual/ mystical perspectives on his part. At this point it is very difficult to buy into him a genuine mystic in any way. He just seems insane and his connection to the mysterious mother transient rather than profound. Is that the point? I don't know. However, he is not nearly the closed book that the sister/ former lover is. This character and her portrayal is so insistently cold and confounding, that even by the end it is unclear what went on here, and who wanted what out of this particularly odd connection. If you are thinking Lannister siblings, you certainly aren't going to get that here. The siblings here have an intensity that is manufactured, rather than built from narrative building blocks. I still have no idea how she fit into the story, or his motives. Or if she even harbored genuine motives of her own.<br/><br/>The character of James also has an opportunity to connect with an audience via his estranged young son, who he now intersects with for the purpose of this story. Yet the two continue to have the dynamic of a boss and a young employee played by an extra and it is too easy to forget that the son exists. This puzzled me the most. Even absence of interaction itself could make a big part of story. This subplot could have been the heart of the story, and I hope there are plans to make this such in the future. The dynamic with the step mom came closer, and by the last two episodes that FINALLY picked up the pace, was a highlight. She stands to force James to become easier to understand as a character. Characters like Godfrey the drag queen and Atticus the clever, rough sidekick eventually played well into forming a bit of a ""tribe"" for James... but too little too late. Again, pacing is the death knell here. I'm still not sure what I think about the outrageously over the top royal and all the scenes he took up. I appreciate that humor was attempted here, regardless of how dark, but I'm not watching because I want more of this guy.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the impression is that Taboo is cool and has a sharp, esoteric tone, but that no one has thought about a deeper purpose aside from Tom Hardy outdoing some old white guys over some land. That stuff is needed, but should be secondary, or you are forced to redo the essence of your character each time you put him against a brand new nemesis or in a new context. He will sound and look the same, and be as clever as always, but his arc will be unmoved and he will lack a theme for true motive from season to season. People may argue with me but in passages (and to a much smaller degree) I feel like Peaky Blinders, Knight's other and hugely lauded show has the same problem, at least with its main character (not so much the secondary scene stealers who have no matching counterparts in Taboo). You're better off just watching that one. There is less to scratch your head over. And if you already have, then I recommend passing on Taboo unless you're ready to watch one show's problems greatly compounded, not improved upon, in another.",30 out of 44 found this helpful.,6.0,1 December 2018

Beyond that
This is truly entertaining, EXCELLENT and certainly in the top 5% of Great Stuff!
However
I just wish these great writers could write more decent parts for women. It seems like to get a place at the table female characters have to be as wild and weird as possible and or to be a stereotype, ""prostitute with a heart of gold"". In this production the lovely trans or crossdressing folks got the good lines, which is ok, too; but that meant the writers KNEW HOW to be funny and irreverent and multifaceted, just somehow weren't for the few women in this.
The writers really missed huge potential opportunities for levity, depth, and connections with female viewers.
In conclusion
Generally, I conclude that this series was written by men for men. And that they didn't know how to write for women characters because there are so few good ones written. A self fulfilling pattern.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,7.0,20 November 2020

I must recommend this TV series to all the fans of historical series, especially those who are interested in the happening of the West India Company. The characters are also all so humane that you can see the faults and the mistakes of each of them, without them being glorified by the development of the scenario. A warning though is necessary as the show contains some inappropriate language and graphic scenes that include sex. It is inappropriate for children under the 12 maybe 15 years old.

All non-believers have to do is watch a few episodes: the timing is deceptively shaggy yet perfect, the characters believable, their predicaments immediate. Fully realized by Roseanne herself, who never let her real-life chronicles get in the way of the show. The writing is continually sharp, with dialogue that frequently evokes whole lives, such as in the episode where Roseanne sits in a coffee house after hours talking to a tired waitress who confides about her late husband, ""I miss him. It's so quiet. Sometimes I'll turn a football game on, turn it up real loud...and I hate sports. But what'ya gonna do?""

351,Roseanne, A true and hilarious slice of life,"I must say that ""Roseanne"" has got to be by far one of my all-time favorite television sitcoms. I watched it for its entire run on ABC from 1988 to 1997, and still watch it in reruns on Nick at Nite. It was a welcome departure from most family sitcoms of the time (i.e. Full House, Family Matters, The Cosby Show). While interesting and diverse (I watched them sometimes), these shows often lacked the portrayal of the typically less than ideal realities of everyday life. ""Roseanne"" was different in that it showed, to the extent possible, people as they really are. It proved that working class people and families can make you laugh. They don't have to be rich, blond, and thin to be funny.<br/><br/>Roseanne Barr plays Roseanne Conner, a hard-working, sarcastic, but lovable wife and mother who is never short of ""telling it like it is."" John Goodman plays her husband Dan Conner, tough but lovable to mom and the kids. Oldest daughter Becky is the most rebellious and loves boys. Middle child Darlene is the tomboy, and takes after Roseanne with her sarcastic wit. Youngest child DJ takes after his father. Along for the ride is Roseanne's younger unmarried sister, Jackie, played by Laurie Metcalf. While intelligent and well-meaning like Roseanne, Jackie is much more naive and gullible. Other characters include Crystal, who later marries Dan's father Ed. Roseanne and Jackie's mother Bev, the domineering, passive-aggressive guru, is a recurring character. Among many others, we also have Becky's boyfriend and later husband Mark, Darlene's boyfriend David, friend Nancy (Sandra Bernhard), and Roseanne's boss at the restaurant, Leon (Martin Mull). Jackie later gives birth to son Andy, and Roseanne and Dan have a son Jerry.<br/><br/>Over the years, Roseanne and Dan face many challenges that keep them on their toes. They bounce from one job to another before landing modest steady employment. Becky challenges them the most, especially when it comes to Mark. Darlene is similar when it comes to David. DJ keeps somewhat in the background in the early years, but becomes more prominent as he gets older. Jackie has many different careers and relationships, sometimes bizarre. The Conners lose more than they win, but through it all they ""get by."" This is why I enjoyed the show so much. It showed that life does not always go the way we want it to, unlike a lot of other shows, and we have to deal with this. But somehow we get by too!<br/><br/>While I did not enjoy the last season as much (it was too far removed from it's original objective), it still ranks up there on my list of favorites.

352,Roseanne, Just great,"""Roseanne"" is a milestone in TV sitcoms.  It shows a lower class family realistically and the problems and issues they face.  It dealt with (for the time) risky issues that you didn't see on TV often.  I still remember quite a stir when two separate episodes dealt with one of the girls ""becoming"" a woman and the son of the family discovering how to ""pleasure"" himself.  Also it had episodes dealing with abortion, gay characters, alcoholism, drug abuse, premarital sex, workplace and sexual harassment, how to deal with elderly parents...  None of the characters were squeaky clean or perfect...they all had huge flaws and faults.  But all of this was done with realism, great acting and a strong (if sometimes caustic) sense of humor. You saw the characters grow and change over the course of the 9 years it was on the air.  It totally fell apart during the last season (egos were going out of control on the set) and ended horribly but the previous eight seasons were just fantastic.  And the Halloween episodes were among the funniest ever done for a TV series.  Just great all around.

354,Roseanne, Comfort TV,"Having watched all seasons aired in the UK the first time round, this show became like having a surrogate family on tv. The characters are well rounded, some relatable, all entertaining. Like many sitcoms, it got a bit weird towards the end, as all shows are victim to the 'we're losing ratings so let's shake things up to get 'em back' ethos of panicking writers which eventually killed it. The first 8 seasons are well worth revisiting if you're able.

355,Roseanne," This show is absolutely, positively, by far the best sitcom ever created!!!!","I watched it in the 90s when it originally aired faithfully. And yup! I still watch it everyday! I have every season on DVD, and I've had them for many years! I SWEAR I could never get sick of this show!! I think my favorite thing about it is the way the Conner family are like a normal American family with problems that most of us struggle with ourselves. They don't make them so rich it's ridiculous (except for when they win the lottery of course, but that was all part of Roseanne's book anyway, right?) They weren't afraid to challenge society. The some of the issues the characters faced were considered taboo back then but it didn't matter. Honestly I think this is one of the shows that opened the door for future sitcoms, allowing them also to add spice into them. The only thing I can say that is not positive is that I was and STILL AM TOTALLY BUMMED OUT ABOUT ROSEANNE BEING KICKED OFF THE SHOW!! IDK WHAT PEOPLE SAY, I STILL ADORE HER AND I ALWAYS WILL. SHE'LL HAVE MY SUPPORT FOREVER..

357,Roseanne, Original and hilarious,"A highly original take on the tired genre of the American family sitcom. At the time, the gold standard was ""The Cosby Show"" and ""Family Ties"", both upper-middle class and completely unrealistic. ""Roseanne"" was the first high-quality sitcom since the Honeymooners to focus on working-class families. This show took the idea of the 80s family show and stood it on its ear.<br/><br/>It took risks and chances that other shows were afraid to take, discussing subjects like homosexuality, child abuse, alcoholism, and teenage sexuality not just as one-show ideas, but as recurring themes. And though it wasn't successful all of the time, most of the time it was hilarious. I'd rather see a show take tremendous risks and fail than take the safe course and receive middling success.<br/><br/>The last couple of seasons were less than stellar, and the very last season was terrible and marked the first time that Roseanne hadn't been in the top 10 (or top 20) in the ratings consistently since it started. But overall, it had the guts to change its situation every once in a while (Roseanne had, I think, ten separate jobs in nine years) to shake things up and add new elements.",31 out of 49 found this helpful.,,15 April 2000
358,Roseanne, One of the Best,"Roseanne should be considered one of the best sitcoms in television history as every classic show is a reflection of the times it represents. Roseanne has been off the air for about a decade now, and when I have a chance to watch it in syndication, I am always entertained. Even the last season, which was a disappointment, has its moments. It's also interesting to see how the characters evolved and changed over the years. I could be wrong about the following comment, but it seems somewhat obvious when Roseanne Barr was going through her divorce to Tom Arnold. Her performance on the show was more biting than usual during that particular season. Maybe it was the media, expectation, or something else. Either way, a new dimension to the show was added due to Barr's transformation (I believe it was Season 4 or 5).<br/><br/>What really makes Roseanne stand out and keeps it in good company with other classic sitcoms is its blending of comedy and drama, often displayed in one scene. Elementally speaking, it reminds me of All in the Family, Maude, and Good Times, shows that defined showcasing dramedy in the 70s. Also, the performances were terrific. John Goodman was outstanding and underused as Dan. I look forward to when he is on screen. Sara Gilbert delivered a consistently excellent turn as Darlene, and then there's Roseanne Barr. She made her mark and did it well. Estelle Parsons was fantastic as Beverly, and Laurie Metcalf had some scenestealing moments as Jackie. These are talented performers giving us quality television to remember, along with the writers, director(s), producers, and everyone else involved in the project. <br/><br/>Anyone who finds Roseanne insulting, repugnant, and/or basically not worth watching may be missing the point of the show and the writing itself. Watch it again and really listen to the dialog. The characters are actually quite decent  they are simply not idealistic in a society that craves moral fortitude yet has difficulty maintaining a core foundation these days. Ozzie and Harriet they're not, but then again, a classic show is a reflection of the times it represents. Hence... Roseanne. The show would fair even better today with our present economy.<br/><br/>Thanks to ABC for giving us Roseanne. We are the richer for it!",25 out of 39 found this helpful.,9.0,20 July 2008
359,Roseanne, Nothing's changed and that's a good thing!,I think the show is hilarious and nothing has changed and I am glad. However I would like to see what happened with David and Darlene.

360,Roseanne, A True Television Masterpiece,"I was twelve years old when ""Roseanne"" came out, and vividly remember it having such a huge impact on my family, as well as society as a whole. For the first time, middle-class families could identify with characters on a sitcom, and enjoy real life issues and problems being handled with utmost care and realism.<br/><br/>What made ""Roseanne"" unique was its utter lack of vanity, superficiality, and unrealistic idealism. In the age of ""The Cosby Show,"" and ""Family Ties,"" Roseanne stormed in as an overweight, screaming mother who didn't always keep her house clean, didn't pay the bills on time, didn't always have the answer, and didn't keep her sexuality hidden. From the very first episode, viewers got to see a messy house, screaming kids who don't always listen, and parents who struggle with money, menial jobs, and weight issues. Finally, a real family on television! Can you think of another show where the female lead walks around the house with an xxx-large bright pink bathrobe, rollers in her hair, and can still be taken seriously? Whatever you might think of Roseanne personally (in terms of her public behavior), she never let it effect the quality of the show. The show benefited from WONDERFUL writing, a fantastic cast, and a pitch-perfect blend of comedy and drama. The show had some incredibly funny moments, combined with profoundly touching scenes that really played well on television; the show was never sappy, and stayed true to life. In my opinion, virtually every episode during seasons one through six, with rare exceptions, played out like thirty minute masterpieces. By seasons three and four, the show had reached perfection.<br/><br/>Roseanne acted her heart out on this show, and got better every year. She could always deliver a sarcastic one-liner like no other, but as the show progressed she managed the dramatic scenes with perfect accuracy. She managed to infuse her strong, sarcastic exterior with an incredible dose of heart and generosity. John Goodman had exceptional chemistry with Roseanne, and turned Dan into a hard-working, loving father that we all wish we could have. Laurie Metcalf's Jackie was, perhaps, the shows most complex character, and, in my opinion, the best actor of them all. She could take even mundane lines and turn them into hysterical comedy. Metcalf turned Jackie into a cool, sympathetic character you always wanted around. The sister relationship between Roseanne and Jackie was perhaps the most realistic ever portrayed on TV.<br/><br/>The kids of the show were also exceptional. I remember watching Darlene when I was a kid/teenager, and thinking ""finally, a realistic depiction of a teenager."" The iconic Darlene was a tomboy, depressed at times, and certainly not your typical happy, popular, beautifully perfect character. She had many challenges, emotions, and Gilbert pulled them all off with complete ease. Darlene was a hero to anybody who felt like they didn't fit in. Becky was the whiny, spoiled brat of the bunch, played beautifully by Lecy Garonson; she never hit a false note. Sarah Chalke, on the other hand, was sub par, and really should never have been cast as a replacement. Even DJ, the youngest of the bunch, had some incredible one-liners, and managed to be completely real.<br/><br/>Overall, this show goes down as a masterpiece; it's exactly what a TV show should be: Hysterically funny, profound, insightful, relevant, and, above all, completely entertaining.",27 out of 43 found this helpful.,10.0,29 May 2009
361,Roseanne, Roseanne and her show - two parallel universes,"Season 1 - You can see Roseanne and the cast struggle in the first few episodes trying to get accustomed to ensemble comedy versus her stand-up routine, however the show improves very rapidly and has some great individual episodes.<br/><br/>Season 2 - This marks the first of the very best seasons of the series, with the acting and writing in all episodes being top-notch. A big theme in this year's show is Roseanne trying to find stable employment after she walked off of her factory job at the conclusion of season one. I especially like how this season handled the real-life issue of what happens to a person like Roseanne who has only a high school education when she loses a factory job that does not provide any experience in doing anything that another employer would find valuable.<br/><br/>Season 3 - Season three of Roseanne doesn't revolve around any particular overriding story arc, but the kids are definitely beginning to grow up. The late Glenn Quinn first appears as rebel and smart-mouth Mark Healey in ""Becky, Beds, and Boys"". I liked how Mark was portrayed in these early seasons when he was ""Rebel Without a Cause"" as opposed to the last three seasons when he was transformed into ""Rebel Without a Clue"". <br/><br/>Season 4 - Season Four of Roseanne has some of the best individual episodes as well as the best overall storyline of any of the show's nine seasons. The season opens with the Conners having opened their motorcycle shop on their own after irresponsible friend Ziggy ran out on them at the last minute last season. This season probably does the best job of combining great comedy, hard-hitting drama, and highlighting situations that should look familiar to any member of the middle class. Although this is not the last of the good seasons of Roseanne, I would say season four is the last of the golden years of that series, and definitely worth viewing.<br/><br/>Season 5 - The season starts out on a very morose note that corresponds to the deep recession the country was suffering when these shows aired in 1992. Dan's motorcycle shop is failing and will have to be closed in order for him to salvage the mortgage on the Conner home. Rodbell's, the diner in the mall where Roseanne has worked for two years, is closing too, due to business in the mall being so bad. Becky elopes with boyfriend Mark and moves to Minnesota, since with the closing of Dan's shop, Mark is unemployed too, plus Becky's college fund has been depleted to pay household bills. This opens up a crevice in Becky and Dan's relationship that takes months to heal. I compliment the show for incorporating the very bad recession going on in 1992 into the storyline. However, the Conners' troubles came on very suddenly and were resolved with a very pat answer. <br/><br/>Season 6 - Although this season has some excellent episodes, and overall is a five star season, we begin to see the start of some of the trends that eventually becomes the downfall of the series. It seems that this is the beginning of a trend in ""Roseanne"" where men tend to be disposable. Jackie becomes pregnant by one of Dan's coworkers - ""Fred"" - who is never even given the courtesy of a last name, and Mark, previously depicted as an independent-minded and able mechanic is now portrayed as someone who can't even make passing grades in trade school.<br/><br/>Season 7 - Season 7 still has enough good episodes and even some great ones for it to be worthwhile viewing, but it is definitely the beginning of the end. Roseanne begins one of the longest pregnancies in the history of television this season - thirteen months plus the time Roseanne has been pregnant before she announces the news. The whole issue of the broken romance between David and Darlene and its resolution is one of the best parts of the season. One of the worst parts of the season is the Thanksgiving episode when Roseanne's pregnancy looks like it might be in trouble. She screeches at both DJ and Dan every time they offer an opinion as if they are trying to tell her what to do instead of the possibility that they just want to comfort her and lighten the load. Jackie tires of Fred, whom she married less than a year before, and promptly disposes of him. After a few obligatory appearances in Season 8 he disappears entirely as though he had never existed in the first place.<br/><br/>Season 8 - This season you have to really pick through episodes full of fantasy, inane slapstick, and politically correct undertones to get to the truly good blue collar slice-of-life episodes that made up the majority of episodes in prior years. The biggest problem with season eight is that Roseanne never did fantasy episodes well during any season, and this season is full of them. It was particularly sad to see what became of the Halloween episode this year, always a Roseanne staple. Gone are the outrageous costumes and the clever pranks of previous years. They have now been replaced by a circus of the absurd and the bizarre.<br/><br/>Season 9 - Many people did not like the ninth season of Roseanne, but in its totality, I found it fascinating. The main problem was that it was clumsily written and directed. You have to look at this season in the context of Roseanne's actual life. By 1996, Roseanne herself had not been living a blue-collar lifestyle for over a decade. It was probably much easier for Roseanne to do something she knew - play a woman with a blue-collar background who comes into sudden wealth. Just prepare yourself for more than a few cringe-worthy moments of TV viewing.",18 out of 27 found this helpful.,9.0,17 April 2010

363,Roseanne, Sad/Disappointed about the unexpected cancellation.,"I grew up with the original show, and fully welcomed its return. (And thank you OnDemand as my VHS recorder is no longer. :) hee hee!) What I am overly sad about with this unexpected cancellation was that I truly wanted to see the development of the characters' storylines - all the kids (DJ, Darlene, Becky). Furthermore, I loved seeing Roseanne, Jackie, and Dan all together again - as well as all the previous characters...it just made it so nostalgic and ""home"" again.<br/><br/>I am clearly, CLEARLY disappointed with Roseanne Barr's actions because I just imagined how the cast and crew had to take the news...immediately after a very successful revival.<br/><br/>I wonder (and, likely, it is a long stretch) if ABC will consider an alternate approach to mitigate the impact to the cast and crew, for example:
(1) Remember how ""Valerie"" became ""Valerie's Family"" then ""The Hogan Family?""
(2) The Netflix revival of ""Full House"" to ""Fuller House?""<br/><br/>In both cases, the approaches were a true ""moving-on"" from the original series.<br/><br/>The show will be missed because there was magic among the cast. If it does come back, I bet it will be where Dan will wake up seeing an empty space on the bed.<br/><br/>Sigh....<br/><br/>Forgiveness will take some time...so disappointed in the recent events...",13 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,29 May 2018

The show was ALWAYS political, so of course the new season is NO EXCEPTION to that. It was done in a way that is not one sided- which is great. In fact, Tv shows, movies, etc have always been political so I don't know why people are just now realizing this. I love the diversity of the show and its characters... and the subjects discussed so far. Much more emotion this time around. I was worried about how the new season would be, but it was great!! I'm a big fan of reboots, especially shows from my past. The next couple of episodes after the premiere were less political and still funny. I had to put my political feelings aside so I can enjoy one of my favorite shows from my childhood.

I recommend avoiding the last few years of the show; they're so maudlin and idiotic that they seem more like a (boring/stupid/insulting--take your pick!)parody of themselves than anything else. The actors sleepwalk through their lines as if they're fully aware of how stupid and poorly-written they are, and the last episode is ironically one of the WORST half-hours on TV! (Sort of mirrors the downfall of the Simpsons, really--why can't these wonderful shows just quit while they're ahead?)

Roseanne's acting seems entirely forced the whole first episode, which was cringeworthy. The fact that the Connors are apparently poor republicans with a conservative slant does not fit the Connors established in the first series. Apparently Dan feels the need to tell his 43 year old daughter how to deal with her body, and basically forbids her to be a surrogate mother using her own egg. Ridiculous. Goodman is a great actor, and his acting was great, but the change in character was unbelievable and doesn't fit the narrative that was established years ago. I think Sara Gilbert was spot on as Darlene, and she and her sister had great chemistry. In fact, the new reboot should have involved Darlene and her sister and aunt Jackie, and had Dan and Roseanne appear in limited episodes much like Roseanne's mother did previously. The story of a poor family trying to make it in america is now gone and replaced with constant political jabs and references to issues surrounding gender identity. <br/><br/>Here we are yet again, watching them try to resurrect a show that is no longer relevant to the time period we live in rather than move forward and create something new.",55 out of 111 found this helpful.,2.0,28 March 2018

I decided to watch the first few episodes to see for myself and I hate to say it but there were large parts that are cringey, contrived, or just boring to watch. In my opinion, Jared Harris is miscast as Absalom - it didn't work for me at all. The specific comments about the lack of chemistry between Bloom and Delevigne are not over exaggerated initially.
HOWEVER...you start to see the chemistry growing eventually, especially in the later episodes. I was really feeling it between them by the end. You start to realize that Philo is a ""broken thing"" and he's shutdown to a lot of the world which explains Blooms approach. Unfortunately things get started clunky and slow and many critics only watch the first few episodes.
Outside of the two mains, there are other relationships that have easily guessed but fun storylines to watch, especially Imogen and Agreus.
By episode 6 (which is definitely very late in the season) it felt like a lot of things were starting to click.

A lot of the twists were obvious, but I didn't care because the journey to the answers was just so damn cool. There is some heavy language, nudity, and violence, but it is not gratuitous and just adds the fudge topping to this unique take on a ""what if"" dimension.
The make up work and CGI are almost flawless. The horns on the pucks looked so real and great care was taken to avoid the prosthetic ""wobbling"" that sometimes happens with such large head attachments, which a sci-fi nerd like me really appreciated.

388,Carnival Row, Not enough,"I'm not going to wade into the political argument, other than to mention that immigration and racism are key to the plot, and there would be no story without some exploration of the theme. I watched the entire first season and suggest that viewers wait to judge the series until viewing all episodes.<br/><br/>Filming is way too dark. I tried watching on two different TVs and my computer screen, and felt that I missed plot elements because I couldn't see what was happening.<br/><br/>The leads are suggested to be involved in an epic love affair, and yet their actual screen time together is distressingly minimal and their chemistry is lukewarm, which seems to be a difficulty in writing more than in acting. The writers are so busy trying to create an entire universe in one season that they have done a disservice to the plot. Characters drop into scenes fully developed, with obvious complex backstories that are unfortunately not revealed to the viewer. Most of the major characters have very strong agendas and yet we have very little idea of what actually motivates them to action. Instead of becoming emotionally involved with the characters, I often felt like I was just watching action for the sake of action.<br/><br/>The plot establishes early on that there are at least three competing societies - the Burghe, the Pact and the Fae. The Pact wanders off after a while, and we never do know why the war with the Burghe began and if the Pact is ""evil"" and the Burghe is ""good."" From what is shown on the screen, the Burghe is not a nice society and I'm not sure why I am expected to care about the story of the Burghe. And yet there is not enough history of the Fae to make me feel that I should be entirely supportive of their story line either. The writers draw on tropes used in Game of Thrones, but without taking the time to develop either the characters or plots.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to another season, and hope that questions are answered, but without a lot of confidence in the writers' abilities to propel the story forward satisfactorily.",46 out of 83 found this helpful.,7.0,2 September 2019

391,Carnival Row, Like waiting for someone to tell you the end of a knock knock joke in slow motion.,"The writing is basic and obvious, that's the most painful part. Every character and plot setup is like waiting for someone to.tell u the end of a knock knock joke in slow motion. It leaves you mostly just thinking, ""I know the whole thing, why am I still waiting to hear it?"" Because it looks good is the answer. It's simultaneously overly imagined and yet not at all thought out. There's no depth, there's lots of silly attempts at it though, which kind of peak your interest and then leave you with things like, right, so... The Irish are all faeries and the Scots are all half sheep and the underlying theme is, 'racism is bad'.... Okaaaay. But the world is an often lovely and well imagined steampunk fantasy. Although not as fanciful as the leads love affair. The whole thing is hollow. I want to like it so much but they just won't let me. Maybe they're trying to fit too much history and plot into each episode and that's why it comes out so thin and empty... Although it feels like a slow march. I generally don't bother with these reviews unless it's in defense of something mischaracterized but this is just such a shame.",88 out of 170 found this helpful.,5.0,11 September 2019

It just works for me and while it doesn't already have world famous book as a source, like for example The Witcher has, it doesn't make as blatant mistakes. There is a certain disharmony for lack of a better world from time to time, but I would still put it far above most shows, fictional or not.

There's a noticeable change in both pace and visuals from 3rd episode onwards. I guess it may be just the combination of all the things that feel better, but the acting and believability feel like they too are in a completely new level.<br/><br/>The plot was interesting from the beginning, but it too really builds up as the show goes on. All the minor resolutions as well as the major one feel satisfying enough. The big plot ""twist"" was probably hinted at a bit too much, I'm usually the one who doesn't get the mysteries in movies and shows until they make it clear, but here it was built up to be fairly obvious from the get-go. It didn't feel flat though, it felt satisfying even if it wasn't a big surprise in the end.

399,Carnival Row, There Seems No Reason for This Story To Be Told in a Fantasy Setting.,"This is an odd series. There seems to be no reason for it to be set in a fantasy world. What we are presented with is costume drama that revolves around the displaced people of a war that seems like a turn of the 19th century conflict. None of the fantasy elements play an an irreplaceable role. The war feels like it could be WW I. Likewise the city and it's architecture seem like London of that era. The manner of the people, their dress and their prejudices are strictly Victorian. The 'evil creature' that lurks below the city could easily be replaced by a Jack the Ripper type. 'The Fae', a faerie people, who have fled to live in the city might as well be gypsies or any other displaced minority that was looked down upon at that time.<br/><br/>In order for a Fantasy to be fantasy it has to have at least one fantastic element that is essential to the story. No such element exists, here. 'The Lord of the Rings starts off with magic ring and gets more fantastical as we go. With 'Carnival Row' we get incest, family intrigue, prejudice and a rigid class system, all elements that could be told in conventional setting. It very much feels like this was a story that wholly written to be about some early 20th to late 19th century European culture. It was like Guillermo del Toro said, 'I need a fantasy series for Prime Video!"" And somebody took a spec script they had sitting around slapped some wings on some characters and some horns on others and said, 'HERE! I've got one!"". Maybe del Torro had some sort of massive rewrite in mind but he left the project and we're left with this, a fantasy in search of the fantastic.",112 out of 224 found this helpful.,5.0,11 September 2019
400,The Bay, Enjoying it so far,This is my first review but felt the need due to the criticism of the accents/dialect of the character's. Here in the UK we make programmes and films covering a wide range of accents and dialect. We don't adapt these especially so that none UK residents can understand them. They are what they are and represent the whole of the UK. So to slate a programme for the accents of the actors who are representing a particular part of Britain is rude in my book.

413,The Bay, Killing on the dock of the bay,"A single-parent cop with difficult kids gets embroiled in investigating a small-town child-murder. Paired with a new partner of the opposite sex, it's not long before sub-plots involving their offspring and naturally the immediate family of the victim rear their heads over six episodes before all is resolved one way or another, but not before a pageant of suspects is presented before the one what done it is surprisingly revealed. Sound familiar? Possibly the broad church of clues provided above will help.<br/><br/>Certainly it started dramatically if unbelievably as lead cop, local girl, Morven Christie loses her head at a girlie night out and gets intimate down a back-alley with the guy who soon enough becomes the prime suspect in the disappearance of his own step-children that very night, which then sees one of the children turn up dead. After arresting her one-night stand for murder, she then erases the CCTV of their tryst while still trying to exercise impartiality in the investigation, but her troubles are only beginning as she not only is forced to take on a green, if willing young male as her new partner but under her nose her daughter is falling into the clutches of a local drug supplier and her son into an on-line dare craze which soon escalates out of control.<br/><br/>There was a lot of unbelievable coincidence and cliche to swallow and I'm not sure the drama depicted was quite good enough to make it all seem even slightly credible. At least I didn't guess the perpetrator but the reveal was hardly climactic, far less cataclysmic and not really worth the wait. Some of the casting choices I found unconvincing, like the young cop Med who Christie initially sidelines and who can't put a foot right before he unsurprisingly comes onto a blinder later in proceedings or the young black cop profiler who barely looks out of school, never mind police training college.<br/><br/>Some of the acting was okay, like Jonas Armstrong as the errant fisherman with a port in every storm and Daniel Ryan as Christie's boss but these were the only two to really stand out from the cast.

It is a rough and gray view of mob-crime in a dystopia Italy, but even though the setting is the same ghetto as the movie ""Gomorra"" the social-realism of the movie is toned down by the producers, in order for a more character-driven narrative to emerge - that is good. This is a brilliant authentic-Italian and promising series, that recalls Sergio Leones ""Once upon a time in America"" just without wide angel and widescreen.

Once you start watching Gennnaro Savastano (played by Salvatore Esposito) you will be addicted. The macho man of all macho men, he looks like he could burst you with one right hook. As if one magnetic actor wasn't enough, along comes Salvatore Conte (played by Marco Palvetti), a suave slickster with an instantly addictive accent and way of expressing himself. The action is constantly moving at perfect pace, the settings are beautifully contrasted. Everything about this series is brilliant, even the bit-part players are magnetic, one such character brilliantly named Tonino Spiderman.

I'm 52, and I've seen a lot of movies, series and theatre/plays in my life. Hundreds. Thousands maybe.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I am convinced that S3E12 is the best piece of acting, cinematography and screenwriting that I have ever seen. By far. I'm aware this is a matter of taste, not a fact, but I just have to share this, hoping to convince readers to go with Gomorra's flow and let it blow you away. For days or even weeks after watching it.<br/><br/>I won't share the (essential) spoiler in the season 3 finale. In the episode's final 15 minutes, the dark side of mankind, deep compassion, unbelievable cinematography, death, deep hate and love come together... I can't find the words. It's even erotic in a disturbing way. Have watched it a dozen times now and I just have to watch it again and again. Can't get it out of my head.<br/><br/>Have seen all four seasons (and the fourth season is a bit weaker than the previous three, therefore 9 out of 10) and all 48 episodes are outstanding (seriously), with the 36th as the series' magnificent highlight. Can't wait for the fifth season. I wish I could thank the creators and actors in person.

Both are excellent, but I feel the series is quite different and is perhaps only loosely based on the original source material. But that didn't bother me; this is a superb series. I found myself so immersed in the characters, the setting and the whole world that I had to keep reminding myself while I was at work that I wasn't a Neapolitan gangster. Every episode of the series is different, the characters are all so compelling and some of the twists and turns are gut-wrenching. Every episode ends perfectly and each one makes you feel differently - one made me weep with sentiment, another took me to such a dark place that I considered not watching any more because I realised ""even the good guys are really really bad guys"". But I'm glad I continued watching because the end of the series is phenomenal and makes me hungry for more. I have been truly blown away (excuse the pun) by this series and can pick no faults with it at all...and if you don't agree with me, I know some guys who know where you live and might be able to ""change your mind""!

433,Gomorrah, It's Ruined TV,"A good friend of mine said to me, 'it was the best thing he'd ever seen, and it would change my life'. I'd never even heard of it, so that was a big statement. Turns out, he wasn't lying. Me and the wife watched all 4 seasons and then the movie in less than 4 weeks and now that it is finished, I am gutted. It's left a big hole in our TV life.
It has completely ruined TV for me because nothing else comes close to how good it is. We put 'Gangs of London' on straight after it, hoping it would fill a hole. We barely got to the end of Episode One, it was pathetic. Good if you're a 12-year-old boy who thinks one man can kill 15 hardened Albanian criminals in a pub like a cockney Chuck Norris!
Gamorrah has none of that rubbish and is really realistic. No fighting or over the top car chases- just a bullet in the chest. The acting is beyond brilliant, the grim backdrop is dramatic, and the characters are encapsulating. I've been told by an Italian mate of mine that the area it is set in falls into the top ten of most dangerous places in the world. The programme does it justice.
It is brilliantly and cleverly written; teasing you to like a character and then snatching them away from you. No one can be trusted, not even family.
I've been pining for it so much since it ended that I've even been watching youtube interviews in Italian!
The subtitles can sometimes be difficult to follow because the dialogue moves so fast, but it is never overly important. It is way beyond anything I have ever seen. Pure brilliance.

434,Gomorrah, Virtuoso,"At the end of each episode there is a music track which announces the end of that show and it's a hypnotic piece of music which alerts the viewer, not just to the end of the show, but that this drama goes on; the simple melody and beat makes that clear, and in the phrase that Kurt Vonnegut used in ""Slaughterhouse 5"" , which was 'so it goes', it is a sigh, a refrain for the madness of human action, and for the terrible waste of their lives.<br/><br/>This quality is exemplified too in the exteriors of the series: the Giorgio de Chirico exterior spaces, the dogs barking, the ugly 1960s architecture intended to make their lives better, but which is like a brutalist prison for them. No nice tree lined suburban streets for them. For the characters their daily drama is pointless and savage but its their only way to make something of the little they have.<br/><br/>To say this series is 'dark' is an understatement; it breathes the worst of human behavior, but the manner is not to exploit, instead it shows the extent of what people endure. In this sense it is akin to 'The Wire' and its journey through Baltimore's underworld.<br/><br/>To seek a character to 'root for' is to misjudge the value of drama: it is not a simple parable in which we can attach our aspirations to one character. If it was, Greek drama and Shakespeare, and much more besides, would have no value and most of the dross that mainstream TV and movies serve up would be the paragon of good writing. And it is not.<br/><br/>This series may seem to glorify the savagery but it does not: it makes it clear as to the losses suffered, the moral failures, and the social divisions exposed. In this way the writers have done great work as they have with the characters.<br/><br/>This series is quite remarkable in all the obvious production areas: it has a distinct look, the actors are all excellent without a miss, the casting choices have a reality too, and the dialect is a real pleasure too, though very hard to follow, it adds texture and depth.",32 out of 37 found this helpful.,9.0,24 July 2017
435,Gomorrah," very realistic , maybe better than sopranos","I have just watched episode 2 and I am addicted. Was not sure what to expect, I had not heard of the book or the 2008 film of the same name. After 10 minutes I could tell it was going to be well made, the setting in Naples in Italy ,the home of the camorra crime family,(changed to Gamorra by the author) and the base of the story came from a book written by Roberto savino , who lived in Naples. I say lived because at the moment he has had to move away with a bodyguard for all the fuss he has caused. His book was a best seller but that did not go down well with everyone especially the local mafia he wrote about. According to Savino the camorra nor dwarf""s the mafia of Sicily.In the first episode we get to meet the crew and family and are soon in the backstreet""s where deals are done and beatings are dished out. The story keeps you hooked ,although everything is spoken in Italian with English subtitles I instantly got into the show and remarked to a friend it was like watching a documentary rather than actors.The second episode carries on the excitement mixed with excellent acting and a strong script.

436,Gomorrah," Gomorra: Highly Original, Gritty with Great Locations, Actors, and Dialogue","Make no mistake, Gomorra is no copycat version of some other gangster film or series; it is the evolution of the genre, something we haven't seen perhaps since Un Prophète (2009) by Jacques Audiard.<br/><br/>Gomorra makes The Sopranos look as phony as Happy Days. With the feel of a filmed-on-location documentary, in this Italian series everyone looks exactly like who they are supposed to be. The locations in Napoli are grimy and gritty—hardly the Under the Tuscan Sun vision of Italy and definitely not the invented suburban fantasy gangster-land of The Sopranos. The gun battles have an air of realistic mayhem seldom seen in movies and almost never on TV. Gomorra is desperate shootouts, filthy prisons, and a penetrating look at the Southern Italian underworld. What more could you ask for? <br/><br/>I didn't mean to disrespect The Sopranos because this series borrows heavily from that American original as well as the works of Tarantino. In the first scene there is a banal conversation between two hoods as one of them complains about his daughter's obsession with Facebook, a matter the middle-aged hit-man and parent knows nothing about. Even in this mundane and seemingly innocuous bit of dialogue we get a glimpse of the vision of Ciro, a mid-level thug. And off we go into the night, both literally and figuratively.<br/><br/>Gomorra doesn't fall into the black hole like The Sopranos of going into the lives of the family members, a mistake now made in countless new TV series in what I call the Meadow Soprano Effect. The mafia guys all have families, as we are shown, but they don't bother much with the details and good for that. If I wanted to watch a show about family life I wouldn't be watching a crime series. In addition, there are no half hour blocks of boredom like when Tony talked with his doctor.<br/><br/>My big regret is that I don't speak Italian, or whatever version of that language these guys speak in the streets of Napoli. Instead I had to get by on French subtitles. Thankfully, my street French had already got a big shot in the arm with the French series Braquo.<br/><br/>The series avoids the gangster movie clichés and instead invents of few new ones which will probably soon be repeated by other filmmakers. Centering on Ciro, the mob boss's top henchman, we get an insider's view of the daily operations of the crime world of this city, sometimes glamorous, other times mundane, but always fascinating.<br/><br/>Whoever was responsible for the locations needs a place in film heaven. The portrayal of the family life in the mob is done well without the annoying side-tracks of The Sopranos with episodes dedicated to their tedious children. Just enough for verisimilitude and that's all.<br/><br/>Constructive Criticism. I won't back down from my rating of 10 because the series deserves that just on appearance. It looks so real and few movies I have seen come anywhere close to the verisimilitude of Gomorra. With that said there is little or no exposition for most of the violence portrayed. There is simply a paroxysm of gun blasts and someone (or many people) is dead. There is little in the way of ""why"" for a lot of the action sequences. I'd rather have a lot less violence with a better story to explain what is there. <br/><br/>In addition, there needs to be someone approaching the part of likable, someone we actually care about. I gave up on Ciro after the murder of the young girl.",36 out of 46 found this helpful.,10.0,18 June 2016
437,Gomorrah, One Of the Best TV Shows Ever!!,"This is the first time I've written a review on IMDB but I just had to tell the world how amazing this show is.
If you have even a passing interest in crime drama, the Mafia or just good quality television and you are not squeamish, then you owe to yourself to watch this show.
I have watched all of season 1 and 2 and every episode has been outstanding.
It has everything.....
An amazing story, full of twists and turns. 
A very realistic and incredibly gritty setting, nothing like the American gangster films or TV shows. 
Outstanding acting from every cast member, you will grow to love, hate and mourn.
Beautiful camera work and cinematography.
It reminds of me of The Wire, in it's realistic depiction of drug dealing at the street level. 
Like The Wire, it is not for the faint hearted. The violence is brutal and realistic but that is the nature of the beast.
If you do decide to watch it, please watch it in this original Italian, the performances are too good to be spoilt by watching a dubbed version.<br/><br/>A big thank you to everyone involved in the making of this series. Amazing work.",27 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,6 February 2018
438,Gomorrah, So good it doesn't seem Italian,"For a pure casualty it happened I've watched this TV series just after I've finished a marathon of The Wire (five season in about a month). I can say the Authors of Gomorra have surely studied The Wire and the narrative in Gomorra in sometimes freely inspired to the BAltimore gangs. The POV in Gomorra is focused from the side of the Savastano Clan, missing the police work shown in the Wire. But Gomorrah offers a deeper experience of how a large criminal organization works, showing the tentacles of the Kraken shaking society, politics, enterprises and elections in the Naples area. The shooting technique is modern and thorough: it is quite evident the shooting crew hadn't all the money involved in a USA or UK serial, but the results are impressive anyway.",58 out of 81 found this helpful.,10.0,24 November 2014

440,Gomorrah, The Best Crime Series Of Its Generation,"Simply put: Gomorra is fantastic.<br/><br/>Gomorra is a tale of monsters making money &amp; more monsters. It shows the curse of Naples in as true a light as it has ever been shown. <br/><br/>Naples has the best of Italy, but without doubt also possesses the worst of Italy in abundance. Neapolitans are some of the kindest &amp; funniest people on the planet, they remind me a bit of Glaswegians &amp; I know they are embarrassed by the corruption prevalent in Naples. I wouldn't give a Neapolitan official my pish as it would end up in his bank account or some thug's pocket &amp; therein lies the story of this show, as it is about the dark-side of this city.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, there are no hams insight. The storytelling is sublime (although it does have lots of source-material, nevertheless, converting that to the screen is no easy feat). I can't praise this show enough. It holds no punches &amp; doesn't glamourise the life of those it portrays, which in-part, is key to its success. They kill &amp; torture everyone, men, women &amp; children &amp; the series shows this.<br/><br/>Well done to everyone involved. There are only a few countries in the world where a show of this uncompromising quality could be made &amp; thank God Italy is one of them.

448,Gomorrah, Simply Superb,"I just finished watching Season 2 of Gomorrah, and it is just as good--if not better--than the excellent first season. This has the potential to be as great as Breaking Bad and The Wire, if the next two seasons sustain the dramatic power of the first two.<br/><br/>The cinematography, production design, and script of Gomorrah have been justly praised here by other reviewers. But I don't think there have been enough plaudits for the cast, who are uniformly excellent.<br/><br/>I am thinking in particular of the end of Season 2 showdown between Ciro and Don Pietro. WOW! I don't know how actor Marco D'Amore did it, but his thousand yard stare and flat, dead eyes were able to convey Ciro's total devastation with a power that chilled me to the bone. His ability to express so much emotion without a single word of dialogue reminds me of the greatest actors of the silent era, and that is high praise indeed.<br/><br/>I feel compelled to point out that if you are this kind of viewer who enjoys having ""a likable character to root for,"" Gomorrah is most definitely NOT the show for you. But if you love great writing, directing, and acting in service of a decidedly dark drama, you will be rewarded with one of the best TV series ever made, bar none, if you give Gomorrah a try.",15 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,16 September 2016

450,That '70s Show, A beautiful series with an ugly ending,"I grew up watching That 70's show on nickelodeon and recently started watching the series again and I fell in love with the show again. The actors were incredible, the show was creative and the writing was amazing. This started to change from around series 4-5.<br/><br/>What I first loved about the show is that it wasn't the typical American comedy. There was a strong love story, but unlike many other comedies, the love story between Eric and Donna felt so real and you could relate to their relationship so easily. They were unbelievably convincing and you could feel the love between them both. <br/><br/>However this series did start to turn for the worse. There were cheap jokes and poor story lines. I think the writers were starting to run out of ideas, which does happen. I just wish the show had the beautiful ending it deserved, leaving us wanting more. Ricky Gervais made just two seasons of the UK office for this reason exactly. He didn't want it to lose it's touch and what it was about. In my opinion The UK version of the office has had the best ending of any comedy series in the Christmas specials. <br/><br/>I wish That 70's show ended in a similar way (and it had a very good chance) with Eric and Donna getting married. Throughout the whole first 4 series Red had always been so harsh on Eric, playing the hard dad and when he finally came round the the idea of letting them get married I thought this was the perfect way to end. Eric and Donna happy, their friends happy for them and Eric also winning round his dad for the first time. <br/><br/>I loved the moment in that last episode of season 7 between Red and Eric where the two of them hug for the first time. It had the same emotional feel that a lot of the earlier seasons had. Season 8 however...I won't go into season 8. I read another review and I would like to mirror one of the points made that the show is about Eric, Eric's first love, Eric's parents and Eric's friends so the fact that they made a series without Eric is quite hard to believe and it feels like a sham. Just some more money for the producers. <br/><br/>I didn't mind the love story between Hyde and Jackie as it showed character development (mostly on Hyde's side) and also went quite deep into his character which I loved. He is another character you wanted things to go well for as he didn't have the best of upbringings. <br/><br/>This review may sound critical but that's only because I feel let down by the creators of the show.The earlier seasons were unbelievable however and the show still remains one of my favourites. I'm sure like everyone else, I fell in love with the love story between Eric and Donna but I just wish it ended earlier with that happy ending we deserved.",66 out of 72 found this helpful.,7.0,5 May 2015
451,That '70s Show, This show is absolutely hilarious.,"I didn't start to watch ""That '70s show"" until about a year or so ago and I sure wish that I would have started tuning in a lot earlier.  This series is really funny, really different, and has an amazing cast.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is one of the best casts assembled in a long time. Everybody makes me laugh (especially Eric and Fez).  All of the characters are likable and each actor puts in that little something each week that is needed to make a television series survive.  Topher Grace is really great and I still can't believe that he didn't have any acting experience prior to this show.  That's one of the best things about this show - all of the actors really had no acting gigs and just fell into the roles immediately.<br/><br/>The writers are extremely funny.  Although the writing is simple at times, it's unpredictable the next, and that's what I like.  Each episode has good scenarios/plots and always makes me laugh.<br/><br/>Everything about it is good and it's not the same as all of the other shows that are currently on TV.  It stands out with an excellent cast (and an excellent theme song.  That thing gets stuck in my head so easily.)

452,That '70s Show, Most Underrated Sitcom,"This was one of the funniest and greatest sitcom to hit national television. Its unfortunate that the show is not placed amongst great sitcoms where it truly belongs. The actors did a superb job and seasons one thru six were the show at its peak point. Although season seven was not as great when compared to the previous six, it was still funny. Season 8 was the real problem kicked in. Without Topher grace or Ashton Kutcher the show simply fell apart. Not too say, the other actors weren't great if any of 2 main characters had left such as Danny Masterson, Wilder Valderamma Kurtwood Smith, Debra Jo Rupp, Mila Kunis and Laura Prepon ( Don Starks and tommy Chong are great too) left the show it would have the same affect. And the inclusion of Randy ( Josh Meyers) didn't help either because he was not well received by the shows fans. I believe if the show ended a year ago it would have certainly gone down in history as one of the sitcom greats. Season 8 was a little dull but the finale was excellent.

453,That '70s Show, the '70s...those were the days,"I guess that one might say that ""That '70s Show"" is to the 1990s what ""Happy Days"" was to the 1970s: a look at how cool things were twenty years earlier in Wisconsin. And they do a great job with it. The characters are: Eric Foreman (Topher Grace), a sometimes clueless high school student; Donna Pinciotti (Laura Prepon), Eric's strong-willed friend; Michael Kelso (Ashton Kutcher), a complete imbecile; Jackie Burkhart (Mila Kunis), the vain, egotistical member of the group; Steven Hyde (Danny Masterson), the cynical member of the group; Fez (Wilmer Valderrama), a foreign exchange student who always tries to be cool; Red (Kurtwood Smith), Eric's hard-ass father; and Kitty (Debra Jo Rupp), Eric's jolly mother.<br/><br/>Tommy Chong occasionally appears as Hyde's stoner boss Leo. Throughout the series, the circle of friends comes across all sorts of situations, which usually end up accentuating Kelso's stupidity or Hyde's distrust of authority. Oftentimes, they assess everything through popular culture (namely disco or any TV show that had existed up to that point). But no matter what happens, it's always safe to assume that Red will threaten to kick someone in the ass, or at least call someone a dumb-ass.<br/><br/>Either way, it's a great show.

456,That '70s Show, What eighth season?,"Over the years, we've seen a lot of preposterous things done by writers when the show just had to go on no matter what, keeping ""8 Simple Rules"" going after John Ritter died comes to mind, but this is probably the first time I cared. The idea of having ""That 70's Show"" without Eric or to a lesser extent Kelso is ridiculous. They tried to cover it up with a comeback of Leo and increasingly outrageous story lines, but it always felt like why bother when you don't have a main character anymore. It just didn't really connect, it was a bunch of unrelated stuff happening that most of the time wasn't even funny. The last season felt like the season too much for every single character, simply because Eric used to take a lot of screen time and now we'd be smashed in the face by how stale and repetitive the rest of the characters were. Focusing on the gimmick that is Fez was thoroughly uninteresting and the character would simply stop working, because the whole deal was that he'd say something weird from out of nowhere, and you can't say stuff from out of nowhere when every second line is yours. They also brought in the standard cousin Oliver, only this time it just wasn't a kid. Whenever you heard somebody knock on the door, you started praying it wasn't Randy, please let it not be Randy. The deal with Randy was that he'd do really awful jokes, usually as Red would say, smiling like an ass and totally screwing up delivery and Donna would be in stitches. I think more than half of the last season was Donna pretending to be amused. The problems had started earlier though: what once was a truly great show with an equally great concept that for once wasn't about a dysfunctional family slowly got into the territory of soap opera. Everybody started being in love with everybody, emotional scenes were dragged out at nausea, with just one usually lame joke placed somewhere to divert attention that we were watching ""As The World Turns"". I'm guessing this was character development, but come on that was written almost as clumsily as the moral lessons from ""Family Matters"". To be fair, the last episode, also because it had a cameo by Topher Grace (a cameo in his own show), was really good, even if not that funny either.<br/><br/>By the way, yet more criticism on Season 8: what the hell was with the opening theme? Not only did they use the same joke twice (a character not singing), Fez scared the hell out of me. Dude, don't open your eyes that far.

With laughs.","How does an usual day start in Point Place, Wisconsin...<br/><br/>First of all, Red, the tyrannical father of the Forman family and a WWII veteran, sits at the kitchen table and reads his newspaper while his overjoyed wife Kitty serves breakfast. Then comes their skinny son, Eric, he sits at the table as well, and his father starts his daily yelling, usually involving placing his foot in Eric's behind if (insert reason here). If his promiscuous angel-faced sister Laurie is at home, she comes along, then Red stops yelling and kindly talks to her, making Eric feel left out of the family.<br/><br/>Once this daily (painful) ritual is over, Eric rushes down to his basement, where all his friends are already hanging out. And when we get to see them, it becomes obvious Eric and his redhead tomboy girlfriend, next-door neighbor and childhood friend Donna Pinciotti are the sanest people around. Meet Steven Hyde, the conspiracy theorist who hates disco and doesn't really care about what's around as long as it's not funny to watch; Michael Kelso, the kind of guy who thinks that he will get through his life only by his looks and that carrots grow in trees; Jackie Burkhardt, the one who thinks of herself as the prettiest girl around, spoiled kid of a rich father, and, of course, cheerleader; and Fez, a naive but oversexed foreigner who loves candy and can't keep a secret. At first they simply hang out, gossiping and making fun of Kelso, but then they all sit in a circle and let the real fun begin... before going out doing something they'll regret later.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Red goes out and meets Donna's weirdo parents, Bob and Midge. He's rude, but they don't mind, as they think he's joking. Somewhere around is Leo, an aging hippie, who's constantly confused and makes word plays without even noticing.<br/><br/>Did you imagine that seemingly peaceful neighborhood with all these awesome characters?

460,That '70s Show, A winner for FOX,"This show is one of my favorites.  I just started watching it last week when Fox aired an episode every night of the week.  I cannot believe I've been missing this show!  It's one of the funniest shows I have seen in a long time.  Tho, I'm no fan of the 70's as a decade, the show makes me wanna go back and live it all again...wait I was born in 1978, so forget that idea.   Anyhow...the show follows the lives of a group of 17 year- olds in the 70's and everything they do is hilarious.  I love the character of Fez, who happens to be foreign, and he's sorta the dork of the show.  He tries to be cool and catch all the fads of the time, but he never seems to get it right, and he's always after Jackie, played by the beautiful Mila Kunis.  As for Jackie, the relationship between her and her boyfriend is classic.  The guy is a total idiot, and she's almost as dippy as he is...As for Eric, who is the male lead, and Donna- his girlfriend, they are so sweet together...if I do say so myself.  They are the perfect couple on the show, and I'm shocked they're acting, they do the couple thing so well!   The show is like a lot of comedies, but it's got an edge most shows don't. I love the shots where the camera rotates around the table, showing all the guys talking...it's a staple of almost every episode.  Check this show out if you haven't had a chance, or chose to ignore it!!",103 out of 136 found this helpful.,,1 October 2000
461,That '70s Show, My favorite show but not the last season,"Has anyone want to talk about Jackie and Hyde relationship? Season 8 really has poor writing. I know it sounds harsh but why they left hanging the Jackie and Hyde situation? They were such a perfect couple. Jackie made Hyde open up and be a better person. Jackie seems to be nicer when she's around him. Why they don't have ""the talk"" about their relationship after Hyde saw Jackie and Michael together. The last season really sucks because this show changed the writers at the last season. Plus, literally everyone in the last season left. 
I really like the other seasons though. Different kind of comedy, great friendships and Red Forman. Seriously never get tired of dumbasses and foot in your ass jokes.",8 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,23 August 2018
462,That '70s Show, Funny indeed.,"This is a really funny show indeed. The script is good and never fails to deliver new ideas. After seven seasons, the show hasn't got boring and that credits must go to the writers. There are some very interesting and funny characters like Red Forman, Fez or regular guest characters like Leo. The actors are quite good, especially Danny Masterson or Wilmer Valderrama (he got a fabulous accent) or Debra Jo Rupp. At first Mila Kunis was really bad but she got better as the show advanced. It is good that the story advanced really well along these seasons. And I like the way they capture the '70s atmosphere, like through the references of the movies or music.<br/><br/>And the title song rocks.",57 out of 73 found this helpful.,,12 May 2005
463,That '70s Show," Started Strong, Ended Weak","Loved most of the cast and could relate to most. However the one consistent character/actor I couldn't stand was Donna/Laura Prepon. The combination of her bad acting and forced relationship with Eric annoyed me every episode. She would laugh at every line or would take things a little too seriously. They should've just fired her. Then there's Randy/ Josh Meyers. Ugh. I understand the writers trying to replace Eric's character but this was a bad idea. He was as funny as warm milk. He just goes to the Grooves shop, gets a job, and that's how he's introduced. He then started dating Donna, again another forced relationship. At this point of the show (Season 8), it should've just never existed. After the two main characters left, the studio clearly focused more on profits rather than just ending on a happy note. Eventually Hyde, Fez, Jackie, and Forman's parents were all that kept this show moving on to the bitter end. By Season 8, the main characters were either moving out , getting married, getting jobs, in other words, they grew up. The story went from kids growing up in the 70's to average middle class adults in the 70's. Once again, was great in the beginning, but once the two top characters left, they should've just cashed out.",37 out of 46 found this helpful.,6.0,28 May 2015
464,That '70s Show, The only show I'll watch...,"Along with reruns of ""Seinfeld"", of course, and maybe some ""Friends"" reruns.<br/><br/>We all know the plot by now: life in the 70s. My mom says that some of the characters actually remind her of people she knew when she was in high school then.<br/><br/>Lots of great pokes at the decade here, from disco to streaking to Star Wars to Charlie's Angels (and yet no jokes about TV's ""M*A*S*H""), and all the usual coming of age jokes (men VS women). The beautiful red haired, deep voiced, 5-foot-10-inch Laura Prepon, who plays Donna (and was also the main reason I started watching this show), is probably the most normal character on the show (the only time she ever really got colorfully bent out of shape about something was when she found another woman's underwear in Eric's car, which is understandable for any woman, only to find out that her mom and dad were back there one night) with Topher Grace's Eric in second place. Danny Masterson is great as the dead pan conspiracy theorist Hyde. I don't see what's so great about Ashton Kutcher, but I will give him credit for giving his all in the role of the male bimbo, same to Mila Kunis (who's finally making the transition from simply cute to actually being beautiful) as the self-absorbed Jackie and Wilmer Valderamma (or however you spell his name) as Fez. However, this show has ruined my ability to enjoy the 1987 hit ""Robocop"" because I've come to enjoy Kurtwood Smith so much in the role of Eric's cranky dad Red Foreman that I can't stand to see him as the evil Clarence Boddicker who helps mutilate Peter Weller's Murphy in ""Robocop"". It's a shame they had to replace Lisa Robin Kelly as Lori, even though the new actress Christina Moore is prettier.<br/><br/>I will say this though: the show has now exhausted and run all good ideas, and yet it's still more endearing than TV's ""M*A*S*H"". Here's the rule for watching the reruns: if Donna's mom Midge (former Bond girl Tanya Roberts, who rallied a few other former Bond girls together for an episode) is there, you're good. However, if Eric and Donna have broken up, change the channel immediately (it's just not right, those two not being together) or if Donna is sporting blonde hair, or if Eric and Kelso just aren't there at all, also change the channel. The fifth season shows where Jackie starts dating Hyde are pretty much reliable. But all in all, it's a great watch, certainly a lot better than current ""Friends"" and ""The Simpsons"".",70 out of 99 found this helpful.,,6 January 2004

466,That '70s Show, 70's Rock,"As the title suggests, this comedy takes place in the 70's (one of my favorite musical decades). It revolves around a group of friends which are all late teenagers and covers all of their daily hassles with friends, parents work and love. There is a variety of different and real characters here, plus the one that no comedy can work without it seems: the incredible dumb-ass. In this series this person is Kelso (Ashton Kutcher). Then there is Eric (Topher Grace), whose basement is the place where the main characters usually hang to avoid their parent and Erics sister. Eric is an OK guy, whose girlfriend Donna (Laura Pepron) lives in the same street as he does. The relationship between the two is very well worked out and they behave in a way I think is appropriate for serious couples of that age. The rest of the crew are Jackie (Mila Kunis) who is really self absorbed and not one of the favorite's of the group, although she belongs there. Then of course there's Fez (Wilmer Valderrama) the foreigner, who is thinks very highly of himself at times, but who is also naive and shy in a way. The crew is completed by my favorite character, Hyde (Danny Masterson). The reason I like him so much is that he is very easygoing. Plus he is extremely cool, I mean when he cracks a joke or makes a remark it always strikes a chord, whether it is a wise or a mean statement. Overall this is a good show with some great and some standard comedy characters (of which not all are mentioned here). <br/><br/>8 out of 10",66 out of 97 found this helpful.,,10 November 2002
467,That '70s Show, An awful decade to be young ...,"... and the series lets you forget all that. I am about three years older than the kids portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage, and got my first post-college graduation job during the second gas shortage in 1979. The 70's were a truly dreadful time to be young - inflation, competing for after-school minimum-wage jobs with laid-off thirty-somethings, dreadful music, worse clothes.<br/><br/>The funny thing is, this series doesn't ignore any of that and still manages to make the 70's look fun, even for those of us old enough to know better. It manages to look the 70's directly in the face - complete with time-authentic clothing - and yet fill the show with the hopefulness of youth and the things that make the high school and college years both the best of times and the worst of times. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers in the show - Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti - truly have dreadful parents with the best of intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward although they are conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 60's finally reached the suburbs during the 1970's. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960's to show up their whole lives in order to give their weirdness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso, and Jackie round out the group representing nerdiness, well-meaning incompetence, and snobbishness respectively. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a show about the suburbs, but he largely represents someone who has to play the cards he was dealt even when those cards are dealt by largely absentee and negligent parents. I highly recommend all eight seasons even though season eight does lag a bit due to the absence of Eric.",15 out of 20 found this helpful.,9.0,21 February 2010

472,That '70s Show, Look a Little Deeper,"Over the last month or so, I have watched the entire series. The show was well put together with actors that filled their roles very well. The main storyline, the life of teenager Eric Forman, is engaging enough to keep you interested and entertained. I felt that the show stayed true to what life as a teen was like. We all had that first kiss, first time, first heartbreak, our handful of friends we did everything with, our experiences with things like alcohol, drugs, and interest in all things relating to sex. We were all a teenager once. This show takes you on another ride as a teen. <br/><br/>Where this show hit me was in showing the way times change us as a Country. Over the course of the series you notice that things Americans held close to their heart, such as patriotism and religion opening up to newer concepts such as, interracial couples, open marriage, and homosexuality. If you watch the series, sure you become attached to the characters, that's why you tune in, but at the end of the finale, what I felt wasn't a joy for Fez and Jackie, or hope for Eric and Donna, what I felt was a loss of our way of life. <br/><br/>We can't have a Kelso, our kids aren't allowed enough freedom to be that adventurous. We can't have an Eric, our kids aren't allowed to be an underachiever in anything. We can't have a Hyde, our kids aren't allowed to be free thinkers. We certainly can't have a Donna, our children are not allowed to stand up and fight for their beliefs. We've turned all of our children into Jackie. They have been taught that they are all special, and perfect, and deserve everything handed to them right when they want it. If a neighbor were to simply pop into our home unannounced today, they'd be met with a bullet, not a friendly hello. Do you even know the neighbors on both sides of you and across the street? After the finale, I thought of my kids, and I felt sad for them. I felt ashamed that they cannot experience a real childhood. I felt the loss this Country has had, but hasn't seemed to notice... I felt the loss of trust in one another. The show is great, and if you pay attention, you see a bit more than the experiences of a 70's teen, you see the end of an era.",11 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,25 September 2011

475,Private Practice, Give It A Chance,"This is one of those shows that has been discredited by many viewers as a simple spin-off. Think it not a spin-off, but an extension. Before simply saying, ""I have to make a choice between Private Practice and Grey's Anatomy. I can't watch both."" Give Private Practice a chance.<br/><br/>The all-star cast is incredible. And Kate Walsh is even better now that she is in her element with actors and characters who are her age, and act like it. Grey's Anatomy's story now seems immature, and repulsively similar to high school in comparison to Private Practice's adults in their late thirties/early forties who are fed up with the crap of relationships. These characters have been divorced, been broken up with, and are looking for something of substance and meaning to add to their lives.<br/><br/>Yes, the individual episode format of medical conflict is similar to that of Grey's Anatomy. But more than just surgery plays its part in this show; therapy, alternative medicine, pediatrics and simple family medicine can be just as complex as surgery; often more-so since the patient is conscious and often fuels the issue with their personality problems.<br/><br/>So give this show a chance. The cast is great and the storyline is much more mature than Grey's Anatomy. If you don't try it, you won't know if you like it.",103 out of 121 found this helpful.,7.0,4 October 2007
476,Private Practice, Worth Watching,"This is not Grey's anatomy. I think one of the most important you have to do in order to appreciate this show is to not compare it to Grey's Anatomy.<br/><br/>This show had a bad start when the pilot within the two hour special Grey's was hated by many fans and critics. However, now that this show has became an individual show with its own time slow, it has improved dramatically. The first episode was a huge step up from the two hour special. The second episode was even better than the first. This show has the potential to become a hit, if only people would give it a chance.<br/><br/>Kate Walsh, Tim Daly, Amy Brennemen, and Paul Adelstein all deliver great performances every episodes. The group itself contain a lot of chemistry and whenever they work together, it makes you feel all buddy buddy. Though i don't particularly like them, Taye Diggs and Audra McDonald gives decent performances weekly.<br/><br/>Just give it a chance, and if you stop comparing it to Grey's, its actually a pretty decent show with a chance to thrive.",62 out of 82 found this helpful.,9.0,4 October 2007

I kept watching to give it a chance, &amp; I'm glad I did; the writing is still not ""great"", but it's getting better each week, &amp; I like the fact that the characters are older &amp; more mature (mostly) than on Greys. You shouldn't try to compare this show to Greys Anatomy too much though, as it portrays a different style &amp; atmosphere- less surgery drama, different types of medicine &amp; treatment of patients, less ""hosptial"" &amp; more of an ""office"" atmosphere (obviously), etc. Mainly I like it because it seems to deal with issues that aren't only about ""who's sleeping with who this week"", although there are potential hookups for the future... I am now liking Private Practice more than Greys this season; the actors are great, &amp; the writing is slowly getting into the groove...

480,Private Practice, Doesn't have what it takes,"It looks like the brilliant team of Shonda Rhimes outsourced the writing of this one somewhere offshore, maybe to the MediocreLand? ""PP"" reminds me any one of the many tedious, promising at first but predictable within 1 season David Kelly flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases they get are so outlandish, they barely evoke sympathy or sadness. And that's what actually makes good medical dramas tick - dramatic situations you are afraid of, ""This could be me"" sentiment. They are not funny either.<br/><br/>The actors are quite good, but the plot lines are dead and cannot be brought back to live. I'm a therapist, and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the most unbelievably incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Whoever writes her stuff flunked the ethics and the transference/counter-transference courses in Stanford. Somebody should give them a Code of Ethics to read (the episode with the nose-bleeding wife and the therapist's involvement in it). No therapists are that bad.<br/><br/>Women yearning for men who have moved on - had been done to death, we've all graduated ""Sex and the City"". Addison in her youthful aggression towards the guy she likes - very age-inappropriate, looks so unnatural on a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress doesn't believe it herself and doesn't deliver it very well.

Nothing about it reminds me of Grey's except for Addison's character, who was great on Grey's and even better on this show. Not cheesy or over the top like Grey's can be, it reminds me of House but w/ more likable and interesting characters and better stories.

482,Private Practice, Private Practice time factor,"It gets much, much better with time. Lame cliché, but true. Why is that? you may ask, well, first because it's getting a distance from GA. It's technically a spin off, but it's truly not. It's a brand new show with a character that USED TO BE on GA. Huge difference. Which, unfortunately, made the pilot/episode of GA almost un-watchable. It was really bad because we got a bunch of new characters tossed at us in two hours with a: this is the new show, like it! Almost impossible in those circumstances seeing as they are extremely different shows. So the first episode on it's own made me go: huh! better than I remembered. So distance: good.<br/><br/>Secondly, the characters are getting more interesting. Not only are the actors obviously... getting to know who their characters are, but so am I. Violet is getting past the stalking thing. She now has a personality that doesn't involve stalking Allan (big plus). Cooper is getting over having sex with women of dubious nature and becoming a very caring character who wear wings to discover the source of little girls illness (major plus). Dell is passed the surfer dude stage, gotta love the happy pap! And so on. I'm not sure I'll ever get to like Charlotte though I do have to say that the urge to hit her over the head with a large stick has mostly passed... So, they are getting past their starting point and I like that.<br/><br/>Thirdly, and final point, the writing is better. It's directly relating to second point, and the story line are interesting. They do only have two patients an episode, so not a whole lot of medicine, most of the time not even Addison's, but it doesn't matter cause they are good story lines. And they are getting explored now. They use more of their potential and that's very nice. It seriously makes for an enjoyable watch.

483,Private Practice, An Hour of Your Life Wasted,"Boredom can drive us to many things, and one of them is watching Private Practice. A so-called medical show, this is an hour with some very unpleasant, unlikable, annoying rich people who sleep with each other because no one else could tolerate them. So badly written, this show could fall into the comedy category for the Emmy's though one suspects the writers take themselves very seriously. Very seriously. Every week, this medical facility is faced with moral challenges that bring out the worst in one another, beginning with the truly absurd Dr. Naomi Bennett. Completely without a hint of charm or likability, this actors job is is to perpetually snarl at the daughter and the ex-husband, and now, the best friend. Second in line is Dr. Charlotte King, a character born out of the imagination of a sober Tennesee Williams. When she isn't spraying her female musk, she is chopping balls off her new husband, the docile Dr. Freedman. Even Taye Diggs character has recently entered into annoying territory as he ponders ethical and moral questions, usually shirtless. The real issue with this show is how bad the characters are and how as an audience, we could care less. At night, these horrible people retire to their beach-front Malibu properties to drink Chardonnay and engage in a game of sexual tick-tack-toe, only to wake each day and pretend they are doing something useful.

484,Private Practice," Boring, unrealistic, irrelevant","Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. Just by watching House, I ""solved"" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...<br/><br/>Second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? Is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your ""friend with benefits"", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed ""drama"".<br/><br/>And I won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey's Anatomy... On a sidenote, don't you think it's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, PhD or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle?

The comparisons and the instant haters or those that just want the character back on Grey's Anatomy means instant less viewers. You gotta keep an open mind for this show on how Addison, the beloved GA character, turns to a new leaf and is indeed not going back to Seattle.<br/><br/>Another great thing is this show is sandwich in between Pushing Daisies and Dirty Sexy Money, that makes for a good 3 consecutive show run.",16 out of 27 found this helpful.,8.0,4 October 2007

488,Private Practice, It's pathetic,"And the title of this review is actually giving it a chance. The characters are blunt, yet overdone. There's no compelling storytelling, you lose interest 5 minutes into an episode and everything feels artificial. You can't connect with any of the characters because they are cheesy and beyond fictional. The actors feel plastic too, just like their characters. I do not understand how does one make a character driven drama and makes the characters boring and uninteresting. And to think that Off The Map was canceled (I am not a fan, it wasn't that good, but at least it had a good location) and this thing tortures people for 5 years. I can't possibly imagine how this thing survived for 5 seasons??? Who watches this thing? And what kind of a hospital is that? They sit and talk all the time, no one wears a white coat, but everybody is dressed like they are going to a wedding. I gave it a 2 only because I consider it the worst rating.

489,Private Practice," Interchangeable, predictable, now boring and sub-par","I WAS a fan of Grey's and this show, and really wanted to be of ""Off the Map,"" but the formula that was initially great is now predictable and boring. I disagree with those who believe there is any ""difference."" Other than the locale of ""Off the Map,"" there is none. On the plus side for this show is a great cast, with little exception. Negatives--the story lines are no better than daytime TV (that's SOAP OPERAS), and the moral pontificating tedious. The series has so many unnecessary sub- plots (the ""Busy,""/""Captain""/lover-maid idiocy, with STUPID characters no less.) <br/><br/>Could have been great, Kate Walsh's character could anchor a GOOD series. It no longer does.<br/><br/>Since this is a Private Practice review, I have avoided the other two, but they are interchangeable, other than the fact Ellen Pompeo/Pathetico turns any script into manure.

490,Private Practice, Great Actors but they can't save the show on their own,"I have been watching since the back door pilot, which should have warned me how the show was going to be. Even so there are such good actors on the cast that I ignored my initial impression of the slow, dragging storyline of Private Practice and watched anyway. I loved Amy B on Judging Amy and Kate Walsh was enjoyable enough on Grey's. I'm also a fan of Taye Diggs. Still there's something missing from the show. Its most upsetting for me to see Amy playing this sad woman, Violet? I'm not sure I enjoy that very much. This season's premiere just proves that even the best of actors can't make do with a so-so plot line. I know Shonda Rimes means well but I'm not interested so far. I guess I don't know where she's going with this. I'll still be watching and expecting more but only to see the actors I love suffering in their roles.

491,Private Practice, Mindless fluff and not in a bad way,"OK it's got the depth of a puddle and the nuance of an angry 15 year old girl. But that's the demographic sweet spot. I'm sure it's fine in that sense. You can't judge trash by the standards of anything other than trash and this is pretty good trash. OK so all the men are women and the women are insane. But only in that high school chick movie way. In the real world you'd run screaming for the doors if any of these borderline narcissists came at you with a scalpel or medical help. Assuming of course any of them could pull their respective genitals out of each other long enough to see patients. But so what? Oceanside Wellness careens from one improbable medical disaster to the next. And it always ends well or tragically. Which is the same as ending well. I feel that the only moral dilemma they left out was having a suicide bomber show up demanding to be artificially inseminated with the sperm of dead cloned Rabbi so she could go off and detonate in a glorious spectacle of female empowerment. Maybe they did that one. I forget. At any rate, give it watch. It's stupid mindless fluff that will leave you asking the TV whether they're retarded or you are. And the answer does not matter.

492,Private Practice," I want to like it, but it's just not good.","""Private Practice"" is being spun off the fairly successful and well written ""Grey's Anatomy"". The cast is fabulous. The premise might even work. But the writing is just terrible.<br/><br/>The pre-pilot disguised as a Grey's Anatomy episode should have been my first warning. The plot was just blah. I thought maybe it was a fluke. So I set the DVR to tape the pilot and all other episodes.<br/><br/>As I was watching the pilot, I just kept wondering how a show with such a cast of fine actors could put together a boring pilot. The pilot is supposed to suck people in and keep them coming back for more. There's supposed to be excitement, flash, great writing, intriguing storyline with a cliffhanger that needs to be answered throughout the rest of the season. Amazingly, this show had none of that.<br/><br/>Thinking it was a fluke, I just watched the second episode hoping for the best. And although marginally better, it doesn't come close to what it needs to be interesting can't miss TV.<br/><br/>I just scrubbed this show from my list of shows to watch.

493,Private Practice, This is just crap,"Is this to show how women suck at work? Cause if this is it , they made a good job Private Practice is supposed to be a medical drama. So I guess my biggest complaint is the lack of originality in the medical story lines. Just by watching House, I ""solved"" two (out of nine) medical mysteries before the doctors did. Boooring. Seriously, if you are a lazy writer, why not copy some cases out of older ER episodes or some obscure Brazilian medical soap? House is recent and popular - recycling their ideas is hard to get away with...<br/><br/>Second biggest complaint: these people are supposed to be forty-somethings, right? Then why do they have to behave with the emotional maturity of 15-year-olds? Is three weeks (ie. three whole damn episodes) of intense thinking really necessary to understand that if your best friend doesn't want to be your ""friend with benefits"", it's maybe not because he wants to hurt you, but because he doesn't want to risk your friendship? The character doing all the thinking is a psychiatrist by the way - the whole storyline is just so unrealistic that you can't really buy into the supposed ""drama"".<br/><br/>And I won't even start complaining about what the show did to everyone's favorite Addison as we got to know her in Grey's Anatomy... On a side note, don't you think it's funny the way Addison ends up lusting after loser Pete (sorry, but everyone who tries to cure insomnia with Mozart's Requiem is a loser, PhD or not) and Derek ends up entangled in a relationship with whiny, irritating Meredith miles away in rainy Seattle? Apart from that little fling with Mark, they seemed to be perfect for each other. Sometimes I think Shonda Rhimes' subconscious is trying to tell us that in relationships, our first choice is often the right one...",12 out of 22 found this helpful.,1.0,29 October 2013
494,Private Practice, Morally repugnant &amp; unrealistic,"I've watched a few episodes of this show and have found certain elements of it to be rather interesting, considering medical facts that can be learned. But this is totally upstaged and wrecked by the neverending immoral relationships of the show's characters. Everybody seems to have slept with just about everyone, even during office hours, which is ridiculously unrealistic. There doesn't seem to be one solid, lasting marriage or relationship in the entire show - everyone is broken up and on the prowl - hardly a true reflection of all Americans. Indeed, there is a total lack of respect for marriage or monogamy and it's truly fulsome.<br/><br/>Then we are presented with endless little moral 'dilemmas' and they're generally solved in such a way that belittles anyone who doesn't agree with the all-knowing degenerate management and staff of the private practice. For instance, in one of the latest episodes we're presented with an exceedingly rare situation of a baby who is born with an uncertain gender and Addison absolutely refuses to perform the surgery because we're supposed to let the baby decide his gender later on. Anyone who disagrees with this is portrayed as immature and stupid.<br/><br/>And I think that anyone opposed to abortion would be offended by the way the show treats pro-lifers. Addison made the comment that no man was allowed to have an opinion on the issue and only one black character was given dignity for opposing abortion on moral grounds. The general feeling was that if you opposed abortion, you're a freak - hardly the popular sentiment in the US. Two of the main characters in the show nonchalantly mention that they had abortions when they were younger and had no apologies or regrets, in spite of the fact that research has shown women can undergo intense depression. What's more a young girl comes to the clinic for an abortion and then thanks the staff on the way out and someone talks about it as how they were helping this young person and it was like something to exult in. The script could have been written by Planned Parenthood.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a cheap show that lacks much of a future unless it decides to present more real relationships rather than just totally unbelievable soap opera relationships and far-fetched medical situations throughout the whole show.",16 out of 33 found this helpful.,1.0,15 March 2009

The story is going faster with new characters and interesting patients. <br/><br/>My advice: Don't compare it with Greys anatomy. And in the end you will love it.

504,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina," Please season 4 writers, I'm begging you, fix this trainwreck.","I love this show. I love the characters, the gothic themes, the humour, clever dialogue, the sexual innuendo, mystical spell casting etc etc.<br/><br/>But this one was just all over the place. I agree with a previous reviewer that I feel bad for the actors. I think they all do a great job, and gave their performances every effort with a frightening storyline/script. The musical element at the end of Season 2 was fine...because I'm a big opera fan.<br/><br/>But with the subsequent musical scenes... especially with cheerleading - watch 'Bring it on' before attempting something unrealistic and cringe-paged (I also doubt that 'new cheer girls' would get centre stage, I know it's Sabrina, Queen of Hell, but the rest of the school doesn't know that.) I had to warn my partner in advance that there would be some painful singing coming up. If you're going the musical route - do it properly so that it's entertaining to anyone i.e. so the 'non-musical' folk are not silently gagging.<br/><br/>The season's 'drama' was too much. It completely desensitised me when I should have been awed and nervous. When you go too hard too fast, you lose effect i.e. When you keep up with the 'end of the world' 'everyone dies forever' 'the devil isn't all that scary', you lose impact and power over your audience. I was justifiably terrified of 'The Dark Lord' in season 1, this dwindled toward the end of season 2, and was absolutely non-existent in season 3. The new contender for Hell's throne was starting to seem like a plot line worth pursuing from a romance perspective but he just went to dust without any climax or worthy scene. (I predicted he found a better gig midway so the writers just wrapped his character up)<br/><br/>Even Sabrina, the teenager, is completely self-determining and just knowing she can do what she wants, how she wants, just takes away from any realism since there are no rules for her. She does not listen to her Aunties, she angrily chastised them in season 1 (when they had good reason to lie) and made them promise 'no more secret's and all she does Is lie to them and let them find out in the worst ways. And even when it turns to crap, she doesn't apologise or have any awareness of what she is playing with - it's always a defensive 'well, I did it because I had a good reason...' not a remorseful 'ok, I thought it was a good idea but I can see you were right and I had no idea and should never have done it'. Whether on Earth, or in Hell, she just does what she wants and to Hell with the consequences, she'll just cry about it later and try to make it right in her righteous way, forgetting she is the cause of it all.<br/><br/>The academy of unseen arts - wonderful title. But I thought it was a long standing academy, like a smaller Hogwarts, and from the end of season 2 we are left with an average of 10 students. I was underwhelmed by this. The same goes for Hell - you can't tell me after a zillion years you only have a party of 12 hovering around to grumble about a lack of king. And all the other witches summoned in the land equates to... 4 or 5? I know extra faces are expensive, but I'm sure there was enough budget for a few more extras or scenes to make the season look like more than a stage-play amongst extended relatives. The only setting which really nails this is Baxter high, and I was actually surprised enough to comment that there appear to be students in the corridors and it actually looks like a high school. Unfortunately, most of the action happens off School grounds.<br/><br/>Prudence was always a dignified and sharp-witted character. Now she irrationally flips on Ambrose for things beyond his control (and who ironically has more reason to flip on her when she was happy to have him executed knowing he was innocent and 'honourable').<br/><br/>Please, for the love of Satan/Sabrina/Callahan/greenman, revert to the structured ways of season 1, and the same equation every other successful series utilises that guarantees longevity (like CSI, Supernatural, etc etc) - let the characters deal with one problem/theme/issue at a time, per episode (e.g. the episode - Dreams in a witchouse was one of my favourites). The lead's issues can simmer away in the background. It keeps us entertained and keeps us interested. It keeps us coming back for the next dilemma to be solved or disaster to be averted. Save the real disasters for the season finales and deal with them properly.<br/><br/>The 'go two separate ways sabrina' logic makes no sense - they are both still SABRINA. So unless they are planning to switch now and then, it wouldn't work. And where/how/what the hell did the second Sabrina come from the get the jump on Callahan ? I may not have paid enough attention because I'd lost interest.<br/><br/>There is of course so much more to say but I will end my lengthy criticism there.

510,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina," Entertaining enough, but a tonal mess and even managed to annoy this lefty liberal","I'm exactly who this show is aimed at. I'm a 20-something who grew up watching the original, and now quite happy to enjoy a bit of nostalgia!<br/><br/>As everyone has noted, the similarities to the original exist with proper nouns and little more. This is a much darker take on it, and that's fine by me.<br/><br/>What I did find disconcerting is just how overtly Satanic it is ('Satanism' here refers to an odd mix of Wicca, various pagan belief systems and theistic Satanism). I don't have any strongly held religious views of my own, but I found this rather tasteless and the writers seemed to deliberately want to cause offence.<br/><br/>This clashed terribly with the characterisation, which is cutesy and oddball. Zelda and Hilda ooze with personality with great performances by Miranda Otto and Lucy Davis. Richard Coyle is sufficiently sinister as Father Blackwood, the Satanic high priest, and Michelle Gomez is excellent in everything she's in.<br/><br/>The younger performers do my head in. Ross Lynch plays Sabrina's boyfriend Harvey, and it's not really Lynch's fault, but boy is Harvey is a complete waste of space - you have to wonder what Sabrina sees in him beyond his looks and endless stream of cheesy dialogue which could only be the result of a screenwriter's first draft. Kiernan Shipka is a great actress, and she's perfect for the role of Sabrina, but she's so righteous it's annoying.<br/><br/>The show's political agenda is cloying and watching it has made me realise why conservatives hate us lefty-liberal millennial snowflake types (use whatever terms you like). Their attitude is so holier-than-thou in the face of Hollywood clichés (because we've never seen bullying jocks on screen before) and they're quite keen to advertise how enlightened they are, which only causes division, entrench views and inhibit constructive dialogue. It's unhelpful.<br/><br/>I long for the day when we can watch a film or TV show and see diversity on screen without having it telegraphed at us. Producers and screenwriters seem to struggle with 'naturalistic' diversity and instead like to draw attention to it rather than simply have actors and characters that fit the narrative. The best show I've seen on this recently is Thirteen Reasons Why, and while I have mixed views about the show itself, the characterisation was excellent and the diversity never felt shoe-horned, but natural.<br/><br/>In Sabrina, this detracts from the narrative as we flip between the interesting horror elements and the rather dull real-world storylines. Plot threads come and go, and the pacing is all over the place. At one point, Sabrina gets tasked with solving a puzzle that people have spent years attempting to crack. We know she's going to solve it eventually, but rather than see her work and study at it - unravelling a mystery and having an adventure on the way - she just solves it. Blink and you'll miss it. You're left thinking: oh.<br/><br/>The show is well-made enough. There are some odd editing choices and filming style that will irk some people, but it didn't really bother me. It looks really good.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I really just wish they'd made a solid fantasy/horror show for adults - something in a similar vein to Buffy or even Stranger Things. It didn't need all the extra clutter.<br/><br/>P.S. Oh yeah, and Salem...beloved Salem. He's there, only now he's just a cat who doesn't do a whole lot.

The only explanation I can think of is that they know their target audience and are playing a strategic move, which seems to be working since it has somehow managed a rating of 8.",154 out of 214 found this helpful.,2.0,28 October 2018

519,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, A Watered-down Version of a Stellar Horror Comic,"IMDb crashed and deleted my long review, so :'''))) I'm going to keep this short:
I understand why fans of ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch"" are rating this series so highly, because they think it's a fresh and exciting take, however, this is a poor adaptation of the actual comic this is based on, a horror comic titled ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. Moving past the fresh and exciting ideas of the comic, it's not a compelling representation of them.<br/><br/><ul><li>This series waters down SO much. In the original comic, there was a heavy emphasis on Sabrina's aunts being cannibals, graphic scenes of Hell and Satanic rituals, nudity and gore were EVERYWHERE. It immediately set a legitimate horror tone for the comic, whereas you never get the feeling in this tv show like something bad might happen to the characters. It feels too ""nice"" and like an obvious tv production, like Riverdale. There's not the same standard of narrative tension.</li></ul><br/><br/>-They also jumble up the story wildly (and remove some of the best aspects) from the comic - I assume to stretch it out so they can add them in later. And while you can argue that this is an adaptation and it doesn't need to be the same, the point is that it's not better - in fact, it's less interesting. For an example - this isn't even a spoiler because its not in the show - in the comic, Harvey follows Sabrina to her dark baptism and get murdered/eaten by witches (and then brought back to life through necromancy). But the point of him being there was incredibly important to **certain** decisions for Sabrina, and it's exciting (hello!! murdering the love interest and then necromancy? awesome). But they just cut it out. And the resulting scene is just, less important for her as a character, and its duller<br/><br/>-There are storylines inserted (mainly high school drama ones) that add nothing to the show other than confusing its tone.<br/><br/>-Netflix shows should have the luxury of ""showing"" not ""telling"" and allowing for a more cinematic experience. I couldn't count the number of times that people's backstories and personalities were just explained through dialogue instead of showing us.<br/><br/><ul><li>There's a couple of problems with continuity, jarring edits and an overuse of short focal length and blur in the cinematography. To me, this plays like something which should have been picked up on in the edit, and been fixed during reshoots (which is a professional standard) but it wasn't.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, there are positives about this series (set design is good, it is also atmospheric in places, and I don't mind the actors), but when you really look at this series, it plays like Riverdale, which is """"okay"""" if they're pandering to a younger audience, but this series could have been something GREAT in the vein of more serious adaptations like the Haunting of Hill House. I highly recommend that if you're unsure about what I'm talking about, read the comic series ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"", because it's definitely more arresting than this.",137 out of 190 found this helpful.,6.0,26 October 2018
520,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Problems,"For someone who enjoys supernatural and magical shows, this series is extremely flawed. The plot for example felt weak. Going to a magical school and studying magic sounds awesome and exciting until you see that the only thing they seem to be doing there are choir practice and bullying. Not a lot actually happens in this show even though the episodes are hour long. A lot of teen drama, with little significance.
The characters for the most part felt weak as well. Aunt Zelda was the only high point of this series. We see her growing and eventually the Zelda we saw at the beginning of the series is completely different to the Zelda we see at the end of the series. Her love for her family grows stronger than her love for the dark lord.
The show did include some bizarre choices, like the blurring effect which I guess was supposed to create some sort of atmosphere, but failed miserably.",178 out of 252 found this helpful.,1.0,10 December 2018
521,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Long episodes and preachy,"I don't like shows that push political ideologies down my throat and vilify people who disagree.

522,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Chilling Adventures of Mary Sue,"There's much to says here that others have beaten me to, but one thing has not. This show takes a unique and compelling approach to a world of witchcraft and occultism -- a world that is fascinating, mysterious, and begs more exploration -- then plagues it by a self-centered protagonist who defies, disrupts, and resists it at every turn.<br/><br/>The writing is dreadfully predictable and the teenage angle is weakened by a dirge of cardboard characters, including a bland boyfriend with a backstory so thin it makes you wonder why its on-screen. These individuals are sometimes shoehorned as a means to propel the plot, but fail as anything more than filler because they're only exist in half of Sabrina's world -- the human half. The boring half. And they're gated from the witching world, which is all we actually care to see.<br/><br/>In lieu of a lack of witching friends in her age and circumstance, the entire plot centers around a no-less Harry Potter knock-off who can do and accomplish all better than anyone else on the show. Sabrina needs only a quantum of help at any given time so that she can turn and save the day yet again, sometimes twice an episode. She's perfect at everything and never fails and is never bested. She can sing perfectly for no reason and it never comes up again. She can overcome pranks AND pranksters. She can master puzzles. And she has the nerve to stand up to teachers in class. And she heads a rebellious school club. Oh and two boys lust after her, because this needed a love triangle. (Gag.)<br/><br/>Sabrina is written with no weaknesses or bad qualities, and most obnoxious of all, her teenage mindset is constantly catered to. She is the center of the world in this show and she knows it. All of her problems are the most critical and important and must be addressed immediately. No one has a life outside of hers and if they do, it has no impact on the larger story, so we don't care.<br/><br/>7 episodes in, I stopped caring about the show entirely.",222 out of 318 found this helpful.,2.0,7 November 2018
523,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, Teen Drama - not what I expected,"Like many reviews that have been posted, I was disappointed with this series. I knew the tv show and liked it but Netflix presented this as a more adult darker version. The adult actors and storyline were the only thing that kept me interested in viewing until the end. The social justice and extreme feminist messages are very off putting and caused me to lose interest a few episodes in.
I thought that Netflix would have avoided the ""teenage"" feel and made a more true to life feeling show(like Sabrina signing the book the first time as an acceptance of adulthood and understanding life isn't always about getting what u want) I understand Sabrina is a teenager and she's essentially ""growing up"" thru the first season. However, the messages of female superiority and warriors of social justice is being forced down the viewer's throats.
I will be the first to admit that I'm just too mature for the subject matter, it doesn't land well.",179 out of 256 found this helpful.,4.0,19 November 2018
524,Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, It's okay.,"I was actually very excited when I saw that there was a new version on Netflix of Sabrina the Teenage Witch. I grew up watching the sitcom version and loved it. I was really into this new idea of making Sabrina darker and much more serious.
Within the first episode, I was a bit bored by it. But I figured it might be a slow start off and will get better as it goes on. To my surprise, it just kind of stayed the same.
The more I got to know the characters, the less I liked them. Sabrina seemed too bland and calm about everything. Harvey was too nice and perfect that it just made him uninteresting. Sabrina's friends and foes in her high school were too over the top, there was never a middle ground for them. Some of the witches were okay, Prudence was a good character. In fact, there really wasn't any character that I could call my favorite, except maybe for Salem, and he didn't even speak a word.
Although the characters were no help to make this enjoyable, I did like the cinematography and feel of the show. The music was good as well. My only complaint about part of the story telling is the weird glossy look they do on scenes whenever they are in the witches realm/presence. It made me feel like my glasses were smudged with oil.
And like some other reviewers have stated, I wasn't into the underlying strong feminist message. It just didn't do anything for me. Parts of the story seemed too forced to make things dramatic and as it gets to the end, sooo many things have happened.
I can see why some people would like this show, it's not absolutely terrible. But all in all, I think it's an okay watch. I'm hoping the second season does a lot better.",78 out of 107 found this helpful.,5.0,22 November 2018
525,Formula 1: Drive to Survive, This is returning F1 to me,"Have watched every single Formula 1 race since mid-1991, I think. Went to several races (when they were louder, V12/V10 era, rather going to Le Mans with the current cars for live action). Every year after Häkkinen quit it got harder for me to justify why I even bother.<br/><br/>4 episodes in right now - this series has a chance to change that!!<br/><br/>I was sometimes wondering how much good a media company's ownership of F1 could do for a sport when they were helplessly talking ""Twitter"", but now I sense there might be potential.<br/><br/>When all you get from F1 is corporate PR, little go kart boys being streamlined for TV spots, DRS and catering, here is a bit of actual behind-the-scenes of F1.

535,Formula 1: Drive to Survive," Brilliant series, especially for non F1 fans","I went into this show with some degree of scepticism because I was told that nor Ferrar nor Mercedes would be featured in season 1. For the less knowledgeable, this sounded too me as doing a series about La Liga without Barcelona and Real Madrid. I couldn't be more wrong.<br/><br/>There is a vast amount of interesting narratives, stories, relationships and rivalries outside the two contenders. Enough to make me sit through season 1 in 3 days.<br/><br/>I believe this show makes for a very entertaining watch for any (even remote) sports fans, because it has many unexpected turns, emotionally draining episodes and plenty of feel good stories. You do get emotionally attached to a few drivers, and find yourself rooting for or against them on any given episode.<br/><br/>In my view, this show aims to get people excited about F1, much more so than entertain those who already die hard fans already. Namely because:<br/><br/>1) Die hard fans know the outcomes of the races going in (the show reflects on the previous season, it's not live) and therefore there's less surprise or emotion. For me it was an absolute thrill to see the end of some of those grand prixs<br/><br/>2) the show is not focus on the technical side of racing. It spends much more time on the relationships, the rivalries, the thrifts - overall the human side of the sport. Which is what makes it so engaging<br/><br/>It definitely made me hungrier to watch the 2020 season (whenever it can be underway) and has nurtured a bond that makes me cheer for some drivers and boo the others<br/><br/>
F1: Drive to Survive is an absolute genius move by Liberty Media, F1 and Netflix to market Formula 1 to new audiences. I think they have nailed that objective completely.<br/><br/>As far as converting audiences to a particular sport - I have seen nothing better. F1 Drive to Survive is an emotional and thrilling ride in one of the most challenging sports in the world. And it's truly worth it",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,9 April 2020
536,Formula 1: Drive to Survive, Season 3 ruined by the over use of Will Buxton,"First, let me say I appreciate this year was difficult to produce series 3 of Drive to Survive, given the pandemic. However, there were many things that they can't blame the pandemic on, that has resulted in Series 3 being by far a significantly worse series vs Seasons 1 &amp; 2. Here is why:<br/><br/>1. Despite the pandemic, the F1 season went ahead, and a full calendar of races took place - with the live events being covered without any issues by the broadcasters - so Drive To Survive (DTS) should have had no issues either. On the issue of Covid - it was a significant part of the story this year, yet really only got a mention at the start and the end, with it being largely ignored throughout. NO mention of Hulkenberg having to replace drivers who got infected. No mention of George Russell stepping in for Lewis Hamilton.<br/><br/>2. The fake commentary is now really noticeable. It is understandable to use a voice over in documentaries to keep the viewer informed. But doing it in the style as if it is recorded from the actual live commentary no longer cuts it.<br/><br/>3. Bad Edits. The editor needs to pay attention to what they are using in footage, and also the chronological order of events. The Mercedes DAS system was big headline news at winter testing. Yet the episode on Winter testing had no mention of it. Instead they tried to make out that people suddenly saw the steering gizmo in use at the first GP. This is factually incorrect, unnecessary, and for a documentary leaves you wondering about integrity. There was also the ""Lando vs Carlos"" rivalry episode. That just didn't occur. Fake news for entertainment purposes switches this from a Fly on the Wall documentary to a ""Scripted Reality"" entertainment show. The fact Will Buxton played along with the film maker's request to fuel this fake story has resulted in one of F1's reporters losing all respect. If he is prepared to embellish the truth for a documentary, what is he doing at the live events?<br/><br/>4. The Over Use of Will Buxton (and Jennie Gow): Even if there wasn't any fictional stories being told, there was far too much airtime given to Will Buxton (and to some extent Jennie Gow). Let's firstly observe what they were saying. At no point were they there for insights. Nothing new was learnt from what they said. If they are there purely to help fill in the blanks - this could be done by a voice over. Yet the film makers place these two in front of the cameras as to say ""Don't worry guys, if you aren't following what is going on these two will help you out"". Far from it, by the 2nd or 3rd episode, every time these two pop up you are left feeling exhausted. That is because there is nothing gained from when they appear. Saying things like ""the fewer people that start ahead of you is fewer people you need to overtake"" is pointless. This went on for far too much of each episode. You may think that's not too bad - but consider this: Will Buxton had more airtime than drivers such as Latifi, Hulkneberg, Russell, Raikkonen and - the 2020 World Champion Lewis Hamilton. That is the equivalent of FIFA doing a documentary on the world cup and leaving out the cup winners.<br/><br/>5. Not playing to it's strengths. 3 years ago when DTS 1 came out it was revolutionary. Snippets of Team bosses speaking, and swearing, at each other was a new insight into the F1 paddock. It was brilliant. The behind the closed door of a motorhome was new to F1 fans, seeing a driver in pain or real joy after keeping a brave face in the paddock showed their human side. Yet we are stolen from key events this year by Will Buxton telling us that kids colour car drawings red. OK, we'll miss any mention of the Tuscan GP, the Turkish GP, or Perez getting Covid. Yep, lets hear more from Will Buxton!<br/><br/>6. Repetition. How many times did we see the same race finish. Example being the Spielberg track. I think I counted that race being used for 3 different stories. So we were subjected to the same footage, same commentary, followed by - yep, you've guessed it - Will Buxton! Monza was repeated - but no Imola. Silversotone repeated, but no Istanbul.<br/><br/>7. F1 teams produce great content throughout the year. Maybe DTS is a victim of it's own success. Since DTS was released to the world, teams - most notably McLaren - have upped their game in providing access to fans. McLaren's Unboxed series after each race on youtube gives you that inside access. So maybe DTS has less relevance these days.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I strongly believe DTS is stuck between trying to aim itself at non F1 fans, but ultimately is only watched by die hard fans. This is not a way to recruit non fans into a sport. Ask F1 fans how they started watching the sport and many will recall stumbling across a race by chance and getting hooked. Or growing up with a parent who was obsessed. But most probably it is by someone who was once taken to their first Grand Prix and was in awe of the speed, noise and drama. DTS needs those 3 elements by the bucket load. You wont get a fan in a few years time say ""I got into F1 after I heard Will Buxton tell us Aston Martin is the British Ferrari on Drive To Survive Season 3"". This series needs a rethink. Ditch the vox pops from secondary level ""commentators"" such as Buxton and Gow and use real experts with very close links to teams such as Martin Brundle. Technical analysts are plentiful in the paddock - Ted Kravitz can explain to a 2 year old what DRS is - he is much loved and would be far better to explain things. Finally, if a story isn't there -never ever in a documentary make things up. Hopefully season 3 is just a blip due to Covid and season 4 will see that this Netflix Original can survive.",16 out of 21 found this helpful.,3.0,21 March 2021

Morgan (who I don't normally like; not on SNL or elsewhere) is hysterical and plays the role perfectly. The minor characters are all very good and amusing, and I can't wait to see them develop more and more.

552,30 Rock, Extremely clever but also laugh-out-loud funny,"I wasn't sure to expect from 30 Rock, having watched the steady decline of SNL over the last seven years or so. I felt, however, that this was not really a result of the writing as much as it was of the underutilization and/or departure of the most talented players (Ferrell, Oteri, and now Maya Rudolph, for example) and the periodic overexposure of less talented players (I'm looking at you, Jimmy Fallon). I was also encouraged by the fact that the many of the bright spots in SNL's history during that period were provided by host Alec Baldwin. So I was not 100% surprised to find that I love 30 Rock. Baldwin is, as usual, brilliant, and Tina Fey is a fantastic writer who also is humble enough to recognize her strengths and limitations as an actor. Tracy Morgan is constantly off his chain and, along with Baldwin and Jack McBrayer, provides most of the ""God, I had to rewind because it was so damned ridiculous"" moments (""Imagine Christmas wishes shooting out of your eyes."") The supporting cast is also talented and well utilized; I was very glad to see that ""Toofer"" and ""Cerie,"" among others, were upgraded to regulars for Season Two. From political satire to slapstick, it's all here. And as an African-American, I was impressed by the way racial issues were handled, from the use of the ""N word"" to the ""white guilt"" issues to the country club episode; they were skillfully handled, as some of these are hot button topics and could have gone very, very wrong. This show is just plain good.",99 out of 125 found this helpful.,10.0,8 October 2007
553,30 Rock," Still 10/10, even with 20/20 hindsight","I'm rewatching the series in 2020 after having discovered it in a library almost a decade ago and WOW! Has it aged well! Or maybe it's just that the world has aged badly in intervening years.<br/><br/>Step into 30 Rock and inhabit a world where female wit is a force to be reckoned with; where every actor gets their 2.5 minutes of fame per episode, and every character brilliantly subverts their own stereotypes in a way that's deep but not at all serious. From the mid life crisis man in Adsit, to the self sabotaging female boss in Fey, to the rags to riches star in Morgan, the aging fame addicted starlet in Krakowski... you never get tired of seeing the layers fall away from these people. It's light, but still riveting. And it is all tied together by plot arcs that are as insane as the best SNL skits (and funnier, in many cases).<br/><br/>By far, though, the best thing about watching this after several years is that it is so packed with one liners and sharp, snide social commentary that you can watch it again and again and still see new angles and perspectives. There's almost too much to take in in one single viewing in any of these episodes - and that's a great thing if you're a fan of the series, which I am.<br/><br/>I have a feeling you will be, too.",22 out of 25 found this helpful.,10.0,29 February 2020
554,30 Rock, World Class comedy!,"There's an ever-so-faint ""Woody Allen"" tinge to this inspired behind the scenes look at a live network TV comedy show. But Tina Fey and the other writers can ALWAYS be counted on to take everything just a step or two farther. The performances are uniformly brilliant. Jane Krakowski is delicious as the slightly passé actress who blissfully pounces on the feeblest opportunity to perform. Tracy Morgan is unrestrainedly larger than life in a role that only he could play. Alec Baldwin has such a rich insight into his convoluted, unpredictable character and plays him with such abandon -- it just makes you gasp! And the rest of the cast plays with a level of virtuosity that has only been seen a few times in the history of network television. The comedy is so dense and so polished that it's hard to believe you are watching a weekly program. I come by way of Monty Python, SNL, SCTV, Kids In The Hall, Frasier, Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Jackie Thomas, Newsradio, Just Shoot Me, and Everybody Loves Raymond. I can hardly believe I'm saying this, but, even after all these GREAT comedies, I think this is the smartest and the funniest TV show I've ever seen!",83 out of 111 found this helpful.,10.0,5 January 2007
555,30 Rock," Pete Schwetty Fan Club Members, Be Advised..................","It's always been my contention that great comedians make some of the best dramatic actors.<br/><br/>Well, what we have here is the corollary to the above-stated theorum. Our good buddy, Alec Baldwin, he of the ""Third place is you're fired"" monologue from ""Glengarry"", has quietly honed his comic timing via a run of ""SNL"" appearances and movie roles (""State and Main"")and emerged as one of the funniest actors around. His delivery has gotten so good that he's become one of those guys that's funny standing still, before he utters word one. You're laughing before you even know what the premise is. It's a hard pill to swallow, but it's gotten to the point that I don't know if I'll ever be able to watch Alec Baldwin again in a dramatic role without lapsing into hysterics before he deigns to offer a line of dialogue. ""30 Rock"" may put the final nail in the notable career of Alec Baldwin-""Serious Actor"", but I sure ain't complaining. If for no other reason, you should be watching this show just to see him deliver a line.<br/><br/>And if you still want another reason, Jack McBrayer is a flat-out hoot, and Tina Fey, who wisely scrambled from the deck of ""SNL"" before the ship utterly submerged, is obviously having the time of her life.<br/><br/>""30 Rock"" fits neatly into the ""no laugh-track zone"" that has become NBC's funniest Thursday night line-up ever.",96 out of 132 found this helpful.,8.0,24 December 2006

Fey has surrounded herself with some terrific unknowns including a guy who looks a lot like Jimmie Fallon who did some unfreeking believable impressions last night. Alec Baldwin WILL win the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor. Even Tracy Morgan, never my favorite on SNL, is terrific as the Martin Lawrence-esquire insane 'star'. Tina Fey has always been the reluctant sex symbol but she 'takes one for the team' and has done several episodes dressed to the nines causing jaws to drop across America. Now that the show is part of the best NBC Thursday lineup assembled since the Seinfeld-Frasier days, look for a long, healthy life for ""30 Rock"".",83 out of 116 found this helpful.,10.0,5 January 2007

The characters are quirky and believable - they remind me of some people I work with. The only character that doesn't gel with me is Tracy Jordan. Somehow, it's not a good fit for him. Whereas Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin along with the rest of the cast are essential to the success of the show, Tracy Jordan could easily be left out and the show would still work.<br/><br/>If I'm not going to be home, I make sure it's recorded. This could turn into a very, very successful sitcom. Already it plays well even though it's quite new.

560,30 Rock, Better than Studio 60,"After the last few lackluster seasons of Saturday Night Live, I was worried that this show would suffer from the same affliction as those terrible SNL-based films, like The Ladies Man, Superstar, Coneheads, Night at the Roxbury.... but 30 Rock is actually a character-driven comedy, rather than a gag-driven one like those films.<br/><br/>Tina Fey managed to put together a great cast using classic sitcom archetypes. Alec Baldwin is hilarious and subdued as the meddling nitwit boss, Tracey Morgan is genuinely brilliant as the wild and crazy black guy, and newcomer Jack McBrayer is thoroughly enjoyable as the creepy intern. Of course, the whole show is centered on Tina Fey, the constantly put-upon producer of an SNL-type late night comedy show. She has great comedic sensibilities, but she has wisely surrounded herself with a fantastic ensemble cast.<br/><br/>The show is literally jam-packed with laugh-out-loud gags, so even when one joke doesn't work, there's at least two other jokes that do work around the corner. After Tracey Morgan's last sitcom flopped, I feared that we'd seen the last of him. As the Martin Lawrence-esquire egocentric star of the show-within-a-show, Morgan excels. Without the burden of carrying the entire show, Morgan is able to fully realize his potential playing 30 Rock's a psychotic, preening celebrity host. The real gem on the show is Alec Baldwin, who usually gets the best one-liners as the idiot-savant NBC executive who can manage a big business but not his own life. But what really makes the show work is its cast of veteran comedic character actors who staff the fictional comedy show, including Scott Adsit of HBO's Mr. Show and Judah Friedlander from the film American Splendor.<br/><br/>30 Rock premiered on NBC at the same time as the similarly themed Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip, another SNL-based series. While Studio 60 took the dramatic route, 30 Rock went comedic. In the end, 30 Rock is better, however. Studio 60 suffers from too much moralizing and a large cast that the scripts can't quite manage to service.<br/><br/>My only complaint about 30 Rock is that we don't see enough of SNL-alum Rachel Dratch on camera. Rumor has it that she was meant to be a main cast member, but the network demanded her role be cut out. It's a shame because she is one of the funniest women in television.",79 out of 137 found this helpful.,8.0,28 November 2006

562,30 Rock, I'm rooting for this show!,"Who better to make a show,comedy or no,about the backstage goings-on with a live,sketch comedy show,than Tina Fey,the former head writer and anchor for ""Saturday Night Live""? After pitching the idea a few times to the network,Fey finally got her chance here and it is very strong!<br/><br/>Fey is Liz Lemon,a put-upon,single,thirty-something who heads up the writing and production of ""The Girlie Show"". It's tottered along just fine to this point,but when the network's hired mucky muck,an arrogant ass whose entertainment experience is almost nil and whose previous departmental supervision dealt with hardware appliances named JAck Donaghy(Alec Baldwin,relishing his ubiquity as comedic ace and character actor everyman)is hired to overlook the show's productionthe pot gets stirred. His first move is to shake up the cast of her show by bringing aboard Tracy Jordan(Tracy Morgan,who REDEFINES acting with abandon),a talented comic with alarming tendencies to emotional meltdowns and irrational behavior. <br/><br/>To make life just a little harder for Liz,she has to deal with:a sexually insecure blonde starlet with aging problems(Jane Krackowski)who considers Liz a friend;an oily,selfish boyfriend;writers who aren't very supportive(Judah Friedlander,Scott Adsit among them)and an unnaturally perky network page(Jack McBrayer). <br/><br/>I understand why NBC was more apt to put the PR rush for Aaron Sorkin's ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip"",but this is EASILY the better show between the two of them,not the least of which because Miss Fey's work on SNL and the decision to make this show more than bitingly ironic and preachy(as Studio 60 seems to be),comedic and yet not gimmicky.

You will fall in love with the likes if Alec Baldwin, Tina Fey, Even Tracy Morgan is fun to watch sometimes.<br/><br/>3. Excellent writing. You will never feel bored for a minute. This show is so well written that you will never want to guess about what's coming and you will always want to see it to the end. And this show is not very much written in a related continuance, even if you miss an episode, you can skip it and continue watching the series. you may watch missed one later and still feel good about it.<br/><br/>4. The show never feels repetitive like some of the television series as ""Mad Men"" and ""Two and a Half Men"". Each episode has a different problem and a different approach to that problem. The most amazing fact it that it does not stretches itself.<br/><br/>5. Some people may relate themselves to this show. Each of the character in this show is as normal as we all are today. some businessmen may relate themselves to Jack, some single working women may relate themselves to Liz, some to frank, some to Kenneth etc...etc..<br/><br/>NOT SO FUN FACTS:<br/><br/>1. All but one that Tracy Morgan as Tracy Jordan is sometimes a great disappointment and Jenna's Character is annoying as hell (Personal Opinion).<br/><br/>Apart from this, this show is so amazing and funny that I have watched it 11 times till now.

568,30 Rock," Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin (and sometimes Tracy Morgan and Jack McBrayer), enough said","This show becomes addictive. Like the Office, the other current flagship comedy show on NBC (and, very thankfully, playing back to back on Thursday nights), it has a curious effect on a first-time viewer: you may not entirely laugh out loud (although it may depend on what episode), but it gets the curiosity going enough to want to watch more. By two or three episodes, it's a hooker, so to speak - 30 Rock is a show that even if you just start watching it at the start of the third season you'll want to see everything else that has been going on before in the previous two (and, unlike the Office, Tina Fey's creation isn't very plot-continuity heavy save for a couple of details and Will Arnett or Rip Torns' characters). A big part of this are the stars; it's a good thing Tina Fey stars on top of writing/producing duties, because she is an underrated female comic talent- even as a straight character to comic relief like Kenneth or Tracy Jordan/Morgan she's incredibly sharp and with some nuance. And, of course, Alec Baldwin as her boss Jack: he is probably the biggest draw, and is so consistently hilarious you may need to stop and rewind if you got a DVD or Tivo to check out again some of the things he does with the character- it should be so obvious after a while, but it works, totally, without a beat lost. Add on to this supporting work from (breakout) character actor McBrayer as nerdy and soft-spoken Kenneth, Jane Krakowski's joyously egotistical starlet Jenna, and Tracy Morgan who finally pulls out some funny stuff after years of being off-and-on good o SNL, and you got a great show.

569,30 Rock, A Hilarious Embarrassment Of Riches....,"As an American who grew up in Europe, I always coveted ""Saturday Night Live"". It was one of those items of American culture I had grown up hearing about but could not see unless I visited relatives in the States. And when I moved here in the late '80's I started following it religiously. And sometimes it was good, and sometimes it was hilarious, but often it was hit or miss. And in the mid to late '90's it got Godawful.<br/><br/>It seemed that all the skits were playing it safe, the writers lying in wait until they could leave the show to bigger and better things while foisting crappy skits and lame character sketches off on us. Personally, I blame the glut of really bad movie adaptations(It's Pat!, A Night at the Roxbury, Superstar, the list goes on and on and on....), I felt the cast weren't willing to come up with anything really good or original until they had split and could then sell out to Hollywood on their own terms instead of Lorne Michaels'.<br/><br/>Then it slowly started to change. Risks began to be taken, quality slowly appeared anew, and talent suddenly seemed to be more appreciated and developed. After a long dry spell, and the depressing death of Phil Hartman, things were starting to look up. Things were actually starting to get good.<br/><br/>And me and all my friends also started to take notice of this. We also started to take notice of this cute brunette who was doing the ""Weekend Update"" and started to get curious. Who was she? What was up with that adorable little scar on her chin? Did she really need those glasses, or was she going for the whole ""Good heavens Miss Perkins, you're beautiful!"" angle? She was the head writer? No Way! Maybe that was why the show was getting better...<br/><br/>A couple of our girlfriends got jealous. Mine asked me what Tina Fey's appeal was: <br/><br/>""She's a thinking man's sex symbol."" I blurted lamely.<br/><br/>""Well, what about me?"" she asked.<br/><br/>Christopher Walken had hosted the night before in fine form, especially in a skit where he was interviewing a Centaur for a job at a hospital and all he could ask were questions about Centaur Sex and Bathroom Habits instead of medical qualifications(CLASSIC!!!), and so maybe I wasn't thinking properly when I replied: <br/><br/>""Um..., you're just a sex symbol?"" <br/><br/>Yeah, it got awkward after that....<br/><br/>So I guess you could say I had high hopes for ""30 Rock"". And that I am biased. I agree, but I'm still a tough crowd. I don't follow TV that much(Hardly at all, really), and ""SNL"" had started to taper off recently in the funny department. So I was skeptical. And I had also made the bad mistake of catching an episode of ""Studio 60"" first, which made me go ""Meh.."", then ""Feh..."", and then ""Beh!"" by the second commercial break at which point I headed off to the old Xbox 360 for a round of Zombie-Killing, followed by a half rack of cheap domestic and my worn out copy of ""Repo Man"".<br/><br/>When I awoke bleary eyed the next morning I tried to remember the night before and realized I still hadn't had a chance to check out ""30 Rock"", and when I finally managed to take a gander I was ROLLING! Hah! And since I don't follow TV, I waited until it hit iTunes, and purchased a season pass. This is from someone who usually pirates, by the way(Oh, f@%k off, Jack Valenti, we all know you've got a large stack of kiddie porn in your wall safe...).<br/><br/>Weeks later and I'm still getting my money's worth, a rare thing indeed coming from the entertainment industry these days. Yeah, you've got the cute brunette who still looks quite 'bespectable'. And you've got my favorite ""SNL"" host ever, Alec Baldwin, dropping witty one-liners about GE-manufactured convection ovens like Cheney drops GE-manufactured warheads on Baghdad. He is the Sultan of Sardonic Smarm, and getting better every episode. Tracy Morgan is given room to grow and doing very well at it, too. The supporting cast acquits themselves admirably, especially Jack McBrayer as the naive intern whose voice wobbles all over the octave range while the backstage craziness erupts all around him.<br/><br/>The show is hilarious. I keep watching it and I keep cracking up. I highly recommend you catch it, and catch it quick. In this world of media mediocrity, it's bound to be replaced sometime soon by some vile reality show, or stupid ""Lost"" spin-off. Why? Because it's smart, it's funny, and it's good. And when was the last time you saw something like that on regular television instead of cable? I give it two thumbs up, one high-five, and beer spewing out of both nostrils.

It has no laugh tracks (thank god).<br/><br/>The sitcom is basically about a T.V show and the team behind it, the company that owns it etc. IT is a really great concept watching a sitcom that takes place in NBC, the same channel that was running 30 rock, and make a mockup of the life styles of people in this business. Main characters of the show are head writer Liz lemon, played by Tina fey and her boss Jack Donaghy, played by Alec Baldwin. And both were great. They had such a fun Mentor-Mentee relationship. There were lots secondary characters, all spread out at different posts of TV show business and almost all of them were good. <br/><br/>The writing in this sitcom was very good. IT was really funny, mocking typical stereo type roles like big corporation bosses, actors etc etc and it was just so much fun to see it all. There were also A LOT of guest appearances/cameos, easily the most I have ever seen in a show so far. Al Gore, Matt Damon, Elizabeth Banks, Robert Deniro, Julliane Moore and many more. Some of them even established a role for couple of episodes. <br/><br/>The show felt pretty consistent for 5 seasons, but then the dip in quality was easily noticeable, especially in the last season. BUT even then, it was pretty funny. And by the time the finale came, all the adventures of cast came rushing through in an instant and I really felt sad that I won't be seeing the cast again as such.

However, season 4 has been quite a different story. The series takes quite a turn and almost immediately becomes quite honestly terrible. The acting is progressively getting worse. The story has done essentially a 180 degree turn and things hardly make any sense anymore. It's safe to say it becomes extremely disappointing.",73 out of 93 found this helpful.,6.0,10 March 2019

I wanted to watch a few episodes to nail down exactly what was wrong so here are the results.<br/><br/>First, both the leads look like they're hopelessly lost, the male lead doesn't seem to comprehend the concept of facial ques while having to act and the female lead doesn't seem to express any emotion besides for surprise and confusion, which is at least understandable since she has amnesia. And after watching almost 2 episodes of this show I wish I did too.<br/><br/>Second, the supporting actors all seem to just follow along with these dim witted ideas that are spouted off by the leads as if they have no choice. Umm hello guys you're suppose to be in a smart law enforcement agency and yet you take at face value jargon like ""She might be the most important resource we've ever had!"" Based on what? On the 30 seconds you've seen her for? See this is the kind of stupidity no one should have to stand for.<br/><br/>Finally the coup de gras, if all the other elements actually worked in the show the dialog is just horrid, it feels like it was written by uneducated children which as it turns out is perfect for the male lead since every other scene he seems to be pouting and stomping out of somewhere. Like the scene where he asks a general to tell him something then proceeds to interrupt him repeatedly as he tries to answer, all in futile effort to establish that he as a character has some deep back story which no one cares about because his acting is so very VERY bad.<br/><br/>2/10 by some miracle you've managed to pull together a story that would work if only you'd bother to fire both the leads and replace the writers with anyone who actually passed English lit.",193 out of 382 found this helpful.,2.0,28 September 2015

Sullivan Stapleton's acting was admittedly a little wooden in the pilot, but I liked his tough guy persona in Strike Back &amp; think he'll grow into this role with time also. Yes, the story line is completely far-fetched and unrealistic. Yes, the plot does borrow from different formulas we've seen before, but not in a way that's a total rip off from other movies or TV.

I guess that is the definition of "" great actor "" <br/><br/>She reminds me of that line from a song by Billy Joel, "" She has a way about her ""<br/><br/>That way is pleasing, both to the eye, and to the soul.<br/><br/>And as for Freddie Highmore, as I watched him develop the character, I began to believe that he really was insane.

I however was not expecting there to be so much intriguing mystery surrounding the little community they find themselves in.

Just enough to make you stick around long enough for the series to pick up speed, but this isn't so with Bates Motel. It starts at Mach 1 and doesn't let up. We are now about half way into the series it just keeps getting better and better. It's a Horror story, a gripping mystery, and one very good plot twist after another. Honestly I can't tell you the last time I've watched a series with this many twists in it so early into its run. Don't listen to the kids who wrote bad reviews.

612,Bates Motel," Riveting, well played prequel idea","The last thing I like to do is watching a series. I prefer films. Ended stories. However I could not resist watching the first episode of this idea of a nowadays prequel which is to explain how Norman Bates could become like he did in the classic Hitchcock movie Psycho. A strange, but still kind of compelling idea.<br/><br/>And from the start I was really drawn into the story, due to Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore. They play so well, that is starts twisting your mind. Freddie Highmore is such a perfect cast. Or rather, he's such a talented young actor. He's been studying the body language of Anthony Perkins character in the classic film. It's literally like seeing the young Norman. And in a strange way, Vera Farmiga is just like how we would see tough mother afraid of losing grip of her last piece of family, her beloved son.<br/><br/>It's also great to see the house on the hill and the Bates Motel to good usage again, as it still is standing like it was back in 1960. Maybe the most iconic film featured house in the history of film. I started enjoying it because of the acting, and will have to see more of this, building up the interest of seeing Psycho amongst the younger generation, and getting to lean about the grand master of suspense, Sir Alfred Hitchcock.",57 out of 77 found this helpful.,8.0,10 April 2013
613,Bates Motel," If 'Psycho IV"" had been made into a TV series...","An avid fan of Hitchcock, I thought this pilot was well done. Though, it was interesting to see an iPhone ring in Mother's house, being this is set in the modern day. Olivia Hussey left some big shoes to fill after her portrayal of Norma Bates, but I think (given this pilot) Vera Farmiga was well cast by the producers. <br/><br/>""Bates Motel"" was well shot, written, acted and executed... all while being appropriately disturbing already. In order to fully appreciate it, you should watch the 1960 original, and the made-for-TV prequel. That's where ""Motel"" will take the torch and continue the pre-story of how Norma basically created who AFI lists as their #2 Top Villain of all Time.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed watching Freddie Highmore continue where Henry Thomas left off. I believed Thomas as a younger Perkins, and I believe Highmore as a younger Thomas. I appreciated the opening scene too, as it touched on an area where previous Psycho-related movies skipped. <br/><br/>I have high hopes for ""Bates Motel"" and will continue watching it.

619,Bates Motel, Definitely worth every minute!,"I just finished season 5 so I can officially say that I've seen the entire show. I binged it over a few days and I'm pretty sad that it's over.<br/><br/>I thought season 1 was a bit slow to begin with, but the depth and complex characters got me hooked and so I continued to watch. The Norma-drama is what's really interesting and her interactions with other characters are fun to follow. After the first murder on the show it's impossible to stop watching, you can't stop but to wonder what's gonna happen next. 
 The show only got better with season 2 and then even better with season 3 (is this even possible anymore? Well it is for Bates Motel).<br/><br/>Season 4 was my absolute favorite. Though I wanted to kill Norman the entire series, he was extremely annoying. At this point you can really see how twisted his mind is, and it's hard to imagine how Norma can be in such denial?
 It was frustrating to watch scenes with Norman in the Pineview Institute because his doctors are somehow unable to see that Norman is out of his god damn mind?!
 What I really liked about this season was the evolution of Norma and Romero. From not caring for Romero at all throughout the series he evoled to one of my favorite characters. This high gard guy all of a sudden has a soft side. His pain when Norma died broke my heart. Again: I wanted to kill Norman.
 
I had high expectations for season 5 after reading good reviews and I got really disappointed. I felt like the show lost it's vibe with Norma gone and only existing in Norman's mind. 
 In season 5 you start to understand why Norman is the way he is and you won't hate him as much as previous seasons.

625,Victoria, Elaborate Fictionalized and Endless Bio,"Full disclosure: I read history and I try to honor it. This series is NOT history, it is fiction based upon a selection of factoids. For example, Lord Melbourne was a portly, sleepy gent of about 57 when Victoria first came to the throne. Something like a trim, active Rufus Sewell in his late 40's? You're kidding. Victoria is similarly glamorized by casting the beautiful Jenna Coleman as the actually plain young princess and queen. This makes for smashing romance, perhaps, but plausible history, no. And crediting Victoria for sympathy toward Chartist rebels is more wishful scripting. There's more, but why belabor it? It's largely idealized melodrama and should not be confused with biography.<br/><br/>Slow moving as well. Clearly aiming at a long run.<br/><br/>Otherwise, a nice production with a talented cast, but too fabricated and glacially-paced for me.",12 out of 12 found this helpful.,4.0,30 October 2019
626,Victoria," Polarizing, but I'm not surprised.","**This is primarily intended as a rebuttal to some very unforgiving reviews.<br/><br/>I started watching this show when I first came out and as many other reviewers have already stated, I was absolutely captivated by Jenna Coleman's and Rufus Sewell's portrayals of Queen Victoria and Lord M, respectively. I maintain that Rufus was a brilliant Lord M, and frankly I think the reason the writers were able to successfully execute Lord M and Victoria's fabricated infatuation for one another is rooted in the casting. It wouldn't have worked if M was cast accurately, a bumbling old man 40 years her senior.<br/><br/>I'm actually very surprised to read so many criticisms of Tom Hughes's Albert. On the contrary, I thought he did an excellent job. I've always been quite interested in the monarchy and have read extensively on some kings and queens that have captured my imagination in particular - Victoria being one of them - and their personal relationships. It's well-known that V and A were besotted with one another; I believe Victoria wrote ""Albert is beautiful"" in her diary after their second meeting in 1839. It's also true that she did not want to get married and felt that she was being manipulated into a union with someone who was more convenient for the family than for love. Albert was shy, intellectually-inclined, and very handsome. I don't understand what element of that Tom Hughes neglected. His chemistry with Jenna was suspiciously compelling until I learned that they're together in real life. I think he was altogether very convincing - perhaps with a modern flair, but that seems to be the feel of the entire show.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point. For someone like me, who really enjoys costume dramas and romance, this is a wonderful show. The sets are magnificent (CGI leaves something to be desired, but it's not too offensive), the costumes are to die for, and the writing is good. No, it's not absolutely stellar. But it's certainly entertaining. The cast handles very artfully the script they've been given. If you are very knowledgeable about history and find it absolutely impossible to enjoy a show that has taken more than a few creative liberties, this is not the show for you. It's not anything near a documentary, and drama is paramount. I agree that truth is often stranger than fiction, and there are many stories that writer Daisy Goodwin could have spun into a far more accurate and believable series. That being said, I don't hold it against her. While there are some plot lines that seem to have been pulled out of nowhere, the majority of creative liberty comes in the form of exaggeration in this show. Inclinations and motivations are stretched to the nth degree to really show the watcher that this character is either a good guy or a bad guy.<br/><br/>I think the show is worth watching. If you're new to it, certainly watch up to episode 3 in season 1 - that's when Albert's character is really first introduced and the show begins to take a turn. Season 3 started last night here in the US and I found the premiere engaging. I'm excited to see what happens next, as long as Albert's death is conveniently delayed for as long as possible.",47 out of 57 found this helpful.,8.0,14 January 2019

628,Victoria, Modernist Twaddle,"As a professional review put it, ""Very good as long as you have no expectations of historical accuracy."" Exactly.<br/><br/>Queen Victoria should be an interesting enough person that one could craft several seasons of entertainment and information. (Admittedly it might be hard to know how many seasons it would last and cover her extended reign accordingly.) However, this is ""Queen Vicki"" for the millennial crowd, and as written by a woman has typically strong ""girl power"" vibe. (Sure she had power, but as a monarch not a feminist.) The focus is on her many angsts, her romantic attachments real or imagined (i.e. Melbourne), and her relationship with a rather wimpy Albert - who in real life she loved so much that she mourned him for 10 years.<br/><br/>Of course, Victoria has to be the most enlightened of all - even though her reign is synonymous with tightly controlled morals. She doesn't want to be a ""broodmare"", but in real life had nine children - child-bearing being the priority of any queen. Season two amps up the political correctness. In the opening eps we get to see a black (American?) actor giving them Othello, and a near infatuation with Ada, Countess of Lovelace (for whom the Ada programming language is named) as a female mathematician. (Although the 'calculating machine' was nearly all Charles Babbage's.) And finally a gaay angle between two dandies of the court. Why the ""Upstairs Downstairs / Downton Abbey doings of the servants are part of the show is beyond me. <br/><br/>The costumes are sumptuous, the sets and settings beautiful, and mostly classically trained actors deliver their accented lines impeccably. None of this can compensate for the poor writing or wan themes.",70 out of 94 found this helpful.,3.0,17 January 2018
629,Victoria, Was not the life of Victoria compelling enough?,"Such a disappointment. Beautifully shot and acted - but the scripts? Teenage angst? Mommy and daddy issues? Nobody understands me? Whiney, catty relatives? Was not the life of Victoria compelling enough? <br/><br/>I like Jenna Coleman. She's the reason I bothered. She is playing a woman for whom an age is named. But the individual scripts would not make the cut of Downton Abbey.<br/><br/>And then there is historical accuracy.<br/><br/>In order to gin up some drama they create an entirely fictional love story between Victoria and Lord Melbourne, a man who in fact was 40 years older than the young queen. (The age difference between the actors is 20 years.) The casting of Rufus Sewell is a big part of this canard. The bogus love story is at the heart of the first four episodes. I am troubled by TV/films that take largely historically accurate stories and throw in nonsense. Is not the life of Victoria compelling enough? Maybe the fact that you could walk away believing there was a ""thing"" between these two historical figures does not trouble the authors. It should.<br/><br/>To make my point, about two other people from roughly the same period: does it matter that we try to get the relationship between Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings right?<br/><br/>At one point, Lord Melbourne tells Victoria that he is thinking of retiring. Its his way of saying, ""I'm too old for you."" She tells him something like, ""You're not old."" At 60 he had exceeded life expectancy for men of the period by almost 15 years.

630,Victoria, ericozu hits it out of the park,"I'm writing this is because of the characters of Paget and Drummond. Yes, there actually was an Alfred Paget and an Edward Drummond, but NO, neither man identified as homosexual. In fact, the real Drummond (whose family owned Drummonds, banker to Victoria's grandfather, King George III) was 23 years OLDER than the real Paget, and died three years BEFORE Paget came to court as Victoria's equerry in 1846! In short, there is no evidence that Paget and Drummond ever met! That they are presented here as hunky 20-somethings with the hots for each other for no other reason than to push an agenda is a vile insult to them and to their families!<br/><br/>While there is a ""point"" to making Paget and Drummond hunky 20-somethings with the hots for each other, there is NO point in vilifying Victoria's and Albert's uncle, Leopold. The real Leopold was a tremendous help to his niece and nephew. Here, he is a scheming scumbag who undermines Victoria at every turn, then, because he can, hints to Albert that he is Albert's father. There is no evidence Leopold's relationship with Albert's mother was anything but platonic, and there is no point in making him the heavy.<br/><br/>The real Victoria and Albert were progressive-conservatives, determined to drag the United Kingdom kicking and screaming into the 19th century. But here, they are SO put upon! Neither takes any interest in the issues or the welfare of the people unless forced to; it's a wonder either notices that they have children, much less, give them the time of day!<br/><br/>But the real crime ""Victoria"" commits is that it is - as ericozu notes - shallow, boring, silly, poorly written, and annoying.

632,Victoria," Good, but not that good","It starts very well. They give a nice insight into an 18yo girl, totally protected and kept from everything except her family, suddenly dropped into the position of Queen of the most powerful country on the planet. Not unexpected, but completely unprepared. The early episodes are very good. Melbourne and Peel are both very well done and the drama does what it should do, it breathes life into history.<br/><br/>The problems start when Albert appears. Tom Hughes is simply dreadful as Albert, completely unconvincing. Albert was an intense, prickly and stubborn man. Hughes plays him as a sulky toy boy. It is awful. But then Hughes tends to play sulky toy boys so it is hardly a surprise. A better casting would have been Daniel Brühl who played Nikki Lauda in Rush, but there it is. I suspect Hughes was included as eye candy for the ladies, and certainly as a man I found Jenna Coleman very nice to look at, so I don't begrudge them that. The difference is Coleman carried her part well, Hughes was all wrong. By contrast, his brother Earnest is excellent.<br/><br/>It also gets increasingly soapy after Albert arrives on the scene, culminating in a final episode that is little more than an extended advert for the 2nd series. It gets quite bad. It is known that Albert was not that keen on Victoria and accepted her proposal because it was his duty to do so. He fell in love her, very much so, but after they were married. That won't do at all for a soap (it would be OK the other way around), so he has to be besotted from the start. It's hard to see the Prince Albert we are given by Hughes falling in love with anyone except himself, so it's all very false.",65 out of 98 found this helpful.,7.0,23 October 2016
633,Victoria, What the Absence of Writing Talent Looks Like,"I concur with most of the negative reviews here, while allowing for the fact that great screenwriters should and do take liberties with historical material. The art is in making compelling and revealing stories from those liberties. There are marvelous tales hidden in the history of Victoria and Albert, but it requires hard work to bring them to life.<br/><br/>We have the unusual opportunity to compare Victoria, which is written be someone I can only the think of as a soap-opera hack -- whose TV credits consist of a string of reality TV series -- with the work of Peter Morgan and his incredibly brilliant work on The Crown -- as well as the equal brilliance of Julian Fellowes, whose Downton Abbey is cited so often in these reviews. The Brits are fantastic at period TV production, and their skills have sustained Masterpiece Theater in the US for decades. Yet without writing with the sophistication, wisdom and experience of seasoned screenwriters like these two, whose writing builds character, sustains tension, and reveals meaningful subtleties, all of the costumes and fine cinematography are but a pretty coat of paint over an empty shell. A tawdry illusion that may pass the time of viewers who don't know better, but fails utterly to truly engage both the brain and the heart.

634,Victoria, Just for Fun,"I am enjoying the show as a period piece and not for its historical accuracy. I am not sure what the future episodes will reveal, but hopefully not Victoria as a loving devoted mother, which she was not. Reading her journals and letters, and especially letters to her adult children over the years reveals a woman who hated being pregnant, did not like babies at all, and considered one of her son's unfortunate because he was an ugly baby. She thought babies resembled frogs. She despised and was revolted by breastfeeding, which probably is not uncommon back then, and rarely spent any time with her young children and preferred to spend most of her time with Albert of whom she was devoted to and passionate about privately, but in her letters she blamed men for many of women's woes. They both desperately wanted to create a loving and warm family, which unfortunately, they failed to do for the most part. I feel the actors are doing the best they can with the script and you are never going to portray the accuracy of a period and relationships between people when you are not their to witness it. You can only go by accounts, and documents written in their hand, but that does not truly reveal who they really are either.",31 out of 45 found this helpful.,8.0,15 February 2017
635,Victoria, Captivating and Up-to-date Historical Drama,"On the basis of seeing the first episodes of this Masterpiece drama, broadcast in the UK by ITV, I can freely say that I am hooked on to it. Daisy Goodwin's script is both taut and cleverly written, while the performances of the main protagonists are uniformly convincing. I particularly like Jenna Coleman's characterization of the young Queen - so apparently vulnerable yet possessed with an inner strength of will that enables her to resist the repeated blandishments of her self-interest mother the Duchess of Kent (Catherine H. Flemming), who so dearly desires to assume the title of Regent, aided and abetted by her unscrupulous ally Sir John Conroy (Paul Rhys).<br/><br/>This eight-part drama wears its moral scheme on its sleeve by contrasting the hissable villain the Duke of Cumberland (Peter Firth), with the pragmatic yet goodhearted Lord Melbourne (Rufus Sewell), who admires the Queen yet remains convinced that she has to transform herself from an immature girl into suitably monarchical material, and will try his utmost to achieve that transformation. Sometimes he has to be cruel to be kind, but all in a good cause. In between these two extremes stands the Duke of Wellington (Peter Bowles), and Sir Robert Peel (Nigel Lindsay), both members of the Tory Party (and hence implacably opposed to Melbourne's politics), but interested in maintaining the business of government.<br/><br/>As with most television costume dramas, the sets and decor are both opulent and historically accurate, supplemented by useful CGI shots where necessary. I especially liked some of the cinematographic effects (by John Lee) - especially the use of aerial shots to suggest the insignificance of humanity when compared to the greater business of running the country.<br/><br/>And it is this sense of contemporaneity that lifts VICTORIA out of the run-of-the-mill and transforms it into living, breathing drama. We hear a lot about the importance of ""duty"" - from the Queen as well as her friends and enemies - and we are led to speculate on what that term really signifies. Is it just a catch-all description masking self-interest, or do people really believe in it? In light of recent political upheavals in the United Kingdom, with one Prime Minister resigning (ostensibly out of ""duty""), and the opposition party tearing itself asunder with different conceptions of the same term, we wonder just how much VICTORIA is commenting on the present as well as the past, especially in its concern with politics and its relationship to the country's future.<br/><br/>I am definitely hooked, and await the remaining episodes with eager anticipation.",62 out of 97 found this helpful.,9.0,1 September 2016
636,Victoria, Not for those who know any history.,"'Victoria' is a fine example of the old adage ""never let the truth get in the way of a good story""<br/><br/>There are good sets and costumes and the story, as written, isn't at all bad. However, the script is a bit weak and the historical accuracy comes a poor second best to a story line with a distinctly modern theme. There are wholly invented characters, such as Victoria's maid, Skerrett, whom the Queen visits in her own home, something so impossible as to be ridiculous. Victoria's half-sister Feodora appears in London having run away from her husband in Germany, more utter invention as Feodora lived her adult life entirely in Germany. The Duchess of Monmouth, who simply didn't exist, has a nasty German husband and embarks on a fling with a footman - utter nonsense and presumably intended as a means of spicing things up a bit.<br/><br/>There are plenty of other inventions. For nothing other than titillation, Rufus Sewell is a good 10 years too young to have been Viscount Melbourne and Laurence Fox some 25 years too young to be Palmerston. Palmerston's wife was also far older than as played in the series and, as far as I can find, she was never consigned to an estate in Ireland; the family home was at Broadlands in Hampshire which is where Victoria stayed with them at one time. There is much more, but to go on would be a bore. Overall, as the series progresses, it's early promise fades and it lacks any real spark. It becomes more soap than historical drama.<br/><br/>Jenna Coleman makes a decent enough Victoria and many of the supporting cast are good at what they're asked to do, but poor casting and a weak script, allied to major historical inaccuracies are simply too much. Sadly, I have no doubt that many viewers will fail to understand that it is mostly fiction, not history, and will believe it all to be true.<br/><br/>If this series was publicised as a simple historical domestic drama, it might rank a 7; as a drama supposedly based on the lives of real people including a Queen, numerous other Royals, various nobles and high ranking politicians, I struggle to give it more than a 4.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,4.0,25 April 2019

643,Victoria, fairly bad,"I can't really emphasize enough how shallow, boring, silly, poorly written and annoying this show is. They can dress up these actors in colorful velvets and gold buttons, and stuff them into lushly carpeted castles all they want, but this will not make up for a lack of vision, message, theme, and perspicacity. Victoria complains a lot, yes she does. She's bored and put upon, annoyed by being pregnant, by her nagging mother, by puppy love, and other such trifles, and dramatic music comes along to make her boring boredom supposedly seem dramatic and important. But nothing important ever really happens. These characters hang about. The days go by. They complain. Politicians drop by to bother them about insubstantial minutia that never resonates or ties together into an interesting plot. Victoria doesn't think or talk about all that much...doesn't DO all that much. She and Albert love each other but it's hard to see why. The actor playing Albert always seems ready to drift into a nap mid-sentence. The actor playing Peel is particularly miscast. Victoria and Melbourne are played well enough but they are hobbled by the shallowness of what is asked of them. Finally, the ""B-stories"" are a particular slap in the face to the viewer. Taking their cue from Upstairs and Downton the writers made a feeble and slapdash effort to get us interested in a cook and a maid servant - to no avail. They might as well be singing, ""la la la, we're here to say something, until the main characters return to the screen... la la la."" The main characters are not much better. It's really hard to care about them and it is easy to forget that they supposedly represent such important symbols/figures of an age. They might just be some boring people living in a house if someone didn't take a shot at them once in a while. No spoiler here. We know from history books that Queen V lived to a ripe old age.

646,Victoria, Disappointed,"At least, I feel that way. I usually like UK series very much; for example, War &amp; Peace (2016) was a great adaptation, with a good script, excellent portrait of the time and quite good actors. I think there are two main traditions in that country: one seems to come from Shakespeare and has produced the best in theater and TV story telling, no matter if it was political (State of play), police gender (Morse, various DCI, Happy Valley, Line of duty recently), or social (Shameless, Hit and Miss) -won't deny I'm a Paul Abbot fan- and another one that is about social history, romance and book adaptations, with quite good representatives (Cranford, The Forsyte Saga or even Upstairs and Downton Abbey). Sometimes the first one is not so good, but still have something worthy, or maybe I have been very lucky choosing what to watch. But the second one has come from John Glasworthy, Jane Austen and so on to Barbara Cartland and Jean Plaidy/Victoria Holt. This has been happening lately with TV series from which I expected more, like Poldark and, now, Victoria. Such a good opportunity to make a historical and interesting biopic about XIXth century England and a landmark queen spoiled with clichés, bad -really bad- script, and a lot of cloying relationships that should have been interesting, like Victoria and Melbourne. And is difficult to blame the actors, since even Rufus Sewell looks ridiculous in it. Everything is so simple and predictable that becomes boring. It's customary to say here that it's OK: this kind of series has it's audience. But i truly believe that a better one historical romance could have been done, and the same audience would have been better served. Maybe I wouldn't have been so disappointed if the IMDb rating have not been so high. I wonder why this series have as many stars as War&amp; Peace. Maybe next time I should wait for 10.000 people to rate, or perhaps I should stay away from historical and romance series until the eager to find a new Downton success is over. Downton was smart made in UK Disney for adults; Victoria is flat Barbara Cartland Queen history for teenagers just that year that they fall in love with love. I hope such a character will find some day a good script with a good cast and deeper insight of the era.",20 out of 31 found this helpful.,5.0,30 January 2017
647,Victoria," Upstairs Downstairs at ""Buck House""","Distinguished writer and historian of Victorian England A.N. Wilson is associated with the production but it seems difficult to imagine him accepting the distortions to history the production applies. It is as much about tone as about fact. The film ""Mrs Brown"" seemed to hit all right notes in all the different places - upstairs, downstairs, conversations between courtiers - and their very different tone when directly addressing Victoria. All providing the context for their shock and horror at Brown's extreme familiarity with her.<br/><br/>It would be wrong to say this production has a tin-ear for how people spoke - it's instead the clear intention to provide a commercial soap, pressing many modish buttons. Jenna Coleman's beauty, while helping the ratings also seriously distorts history. Suitors for Victoria's hand, knew that they were making a play for the most powerful and prestigious woman then in the world, they were the men who would be King. That she was short, dumpy and no beauty dissuaded none of them from their professions of devotion - as watching courtiers - and staff - would have observed and discussed. While Victoria was determined, wilful, direct and came to quickly occupy her status as a monarch,she did I think share with every respectable young lady a belief that she should speak politely to elders of comparable status and this production seems entirely modern in ignoring this absolute obligation. <br/><br/>Leopold was Victoria's much loved and respected uncle with whom, from their letters, was fond, frank when necessary but diplomatic - exactly as one might expect. In this production he (played by Alex Jennings) is blunt and crude in attempting to publicly dictate to Victoria a suitable financial arrangement for Albert. The screenplay cuts out an important figure - Baron Stockmar, Leopold's personal physician who was first Leopolds emissary on behalf of Albert then after their marriage, became at Leopold's request, adviser to the couple.Thus Leopold could remain the fond uncle and leave any uncomfortable topics to Stockmar to raise - on lines pre-agreed with Leopold. <br/><br/>Rufus Sewell (Melbourne) was brilliant in The Woodlanders. Here he seems woefully miscast. Sewell is 47 years old and appears and sounds younger whereas Melbourne was 58 at the time. Sewell comes across as an older brother, not a father-figure-counsellor. Melbourne was an accomplished major public figure, orator, womaniser and old charmer, immensely skilled in all the play-acting skills diplomacy, in arenas from international to drawing-room to playing the gallant to a young girl, required. Rufus Sewell does not remotely resemble such a figure<br/><br/>Lavish, colourful, entertaining but throughout, historically, overwhelming soap gets into the audiences eyes - and up this reviewers nose.",41 out of 70 found this helpful.,6.0,4 September 2016

650,Atypical, Excellent depiction,"I don't understand why there are so many individuals stating the show exaggerates or skews autism symptoms. My son is on the spectrum, and in the autism works when you know one person with autism, you know one person with autism. That is why they call it a spectrum disorder. I feel this show did a great job of depicting Asperger's syndrome or high functioning autism. The actor is on point...lack of eye contact, sensory processing issues, blurting out inappropriate things, not being able to read others feelings, social struggles, his obsession with one subject, his outbursts...all the way to his food preferences. They also did a great job with how the sister is pushed aside and the marital struggles due to the stress of the autism. The fears the mother has reminds me of myself. I highly suggest this show; especially for families who have been blessed with an family member who is autistic.

652,Atypical, Accurate and Profound.,"I was asked a question on Quora about the show and decided to have a look.<br/><br/>As a person on the spectrum HF-ASD with AS, this blew my mind, it is so great that Netflix hung it out there and created a series that has mirrored my life with at least 70% accuracy. <br/><br/>While I believe that people watching the series may be looking at the actors and actresses abilities, I watched it to see if the series was as accurate as possible and still entertaining. <br/><br/>It was both, my sincere appreciation to Netflix to step out of bounds, the cast who did such a great job, the writers who have allowed the world to gain knowledge of a spectrum that is so misunderstood. <br/><br/>The show, to me, is a great portrayal of his experiences and from what I can understand, his family as well. The side stories add to the entire cacophony of emotions, sounds and experiences which was also enlightening. I learned a few things about people and hopefully, I can use them in my personal life.<br/><br/>To all the NTs out there, who have watched the series, hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.<br/><br/>May it please continue.",144 out of 157 found this helpful.,9.0,18 August 2017
653,Atypical," I have AS, and LOVED IT","UPDATE: Couldn't finish 3rd Season. The following is for the first two fantastic seasons. Seasons 1-2: 10. Most of Season 3: 4 (it just didn't grip me the same way the first two seasons did--felt like work).<br/><br/>---
First, I think certain symptoms of AS are exaggerated in all movies/shows. It MIGHT be me, but I think the (1) taking things literally and (2) poor social judgment are the two most exaggerated (they're definitely VERY real, just maybe not to the extent portrayed in movies/shows-- at least, in my experience/observation, if those two are present to the extent portrayed by Hollywood, so are other concomitant symptoms of more severe autism). Don't get me started on ""The Accountant"" (puke).<br/><br/>However, it's Hollywood, and understandable. The rest of the show is so great that I don't care about that relatively small exaggeration (which, again, might just be my own ignorance anyway). I actually kind of like it. Even if it's exaggerated, it adds an entertaining aspect to the show. And I'm not some whiny snowflake that needs to nitpick a relatively minor and understandable Hollywood embellishment because AS is ""my identity,"" which gives me some sort of soapbox to feel special about (can't stand those people!).<br/><br/>Like I said, loved it!<br/><br/>I care about ALL of the characters.<br/><br/>I love, love, LOVE Michael Rapaport as the father. But they're ALL great. Seriously, even less integral characters like the bartender and boyfriend were perfect. I'm very sensitive to overacting and unjustifiable drama, and I noticed ZERO of the former, and only one small instance of the latter (possibly a not very realistic reaction by the daughter, to support a message that the writer wanted to communicate more than the circumstances justified), but it was only once, and minor.<br/><br/>Overall, the events that unfold are justified by the circumstances (you feel as though everything that follows is an inevitable and realistic consequence of the circumstances).<br/><br/>Also, NOT BORING. There is no fluff! No boring explanations or transitions. The writers do an EXCELLENT job of making fun and interesting things happen IMMEDIATELY. One thing, after another. Engrossing from the beginning, and it STAYS that way.<br/><br/>All I ask to the creator, Robia Rashid, and the writers, etc, please do not get comfortable or ""satisfied."" Please do not become one of the MANY shows that has a great first season, then loses that original drive that made the first season so great. Please do not settle on anything. You made magic happen in the first season. Please maintain that same commitment to make season two magic as well.",208 out of 230 found this helpful.,7.0,12 August 2017

655,Atypical, Beautifully warm and funny,"This is a show about the everyday life of a family with an 18 year old boy with autism. Not the extreme kind, but the kind that makes it just bearable for him to go to school and keep a part time job - and wanting girls hehe.<br/><br/>I fell in love with all family members (and a few others) in the very first episode, and the love just grows. I have to give kudos to the writers and actors for portraying a ""normal"" family with such real challenges given their situation, in such a realistic and beautiful way. Nothing is overly exaggerated like most other sitcoms, and this is not comparable to the Big Bang Theory and Sheldon. This is far more realistic, and thus touching. It's not funny because of punchlines, it's funny because of situations. And no background laughter. <br/><br/>Sam - the main character with autism - is brutally honest (I guess, like Sheldon), and is (like most people on the spectrum) highly fixated on a few key subjects, that he naturally is an expert at. Que laughter! :D But he seems real. His challenges are in fact very real, and I know this first hand from having a brother at his age with autism as well. It is clear that the creators of this show has some deep personal experience with this condition (sorry if that's the wrong term to use:S English is not my first language). To me, this ads a huge emotional thumbs up.<br/><br/>Whether or not you are invested in the subject of autism, I will be shocked if you don't fall for this show. The story follows all the characters, and so the show doesn't become too monotone in it's depiction. We follow the younger sister's challenges with having a big brother that depends on her at school, along with sports and guys, and the parents and their challenges with getting time for themselves, and dealing with their social group as the ones with an autistic kid. And a whole bunch of other things. <br/><br/>When I am watching this show, I feel like I am watching the evolution of sitcoms that, instead of making foolish situations and punchlines with background laughter that drive the show through humor, I'm instead learning and reflecting and smiling my way through each episode with, if possible, deeper respect for all people that have to make special sacrifices in order to create their every day lives. I almost feel like a better person, and kinda want to thank the creators for that. <br/><br/>I hope this places your expectations exactly where they should be, and that you put it on and enjoy it as much as I did! :)",125 out of 140 found this helpful.,9.0,12 August 2017
656,Atypical, One of my personal favorites.,"One of my personal favorites.
This series is one of the top 10 series I have ever seen. It is unnaturally refreshing, and it always makes me feel happy or even sad.
The first season is perfect and the second season is better than the first and the third has episodes that I consider the best in the series, so I will say it with confidence. I hope that the fourth and final season maintains its current level and its current rating is 8.3 and deserves to enter the top 250 list in the best list because it is the best.
The gorgeous characters Sam, Casey, Zahid, Evan, Elissa and Doug are all superb.
Even if the fourth season is not good, I hope the series maintains its rating and I hope a comfortable ending

657,Atypical, Son with HFA,"Sam from Atypical is so much like my son, and yet so different. Sam's roller coaster life has given my son hope for his future. He was feeling as if he could not graduate high school and have a life. My son is 15 and a sophomore. Sam's character is mesmerizing, funny, sad, interesting, and plain amazing! Watching Sam has been such a great way for my son to recognize that life for him is going to be tough but, we can laugh and cry and freak out. It's alright. It will all work out some how. 
My son watching Sam and Paige has also given him hope in having a girlfriend that likes him for who he is. 
Atypical is the absolute best show to watch for families with a child on the spectrum - despite all the horrible reviews. I'm sure those reviews are from people that do not see Sam in children on the spectrum. Which is kind of the point - no child on the spectrum is the same and the reviews that say we need to keep trying to find the perfect way to represent kids with autism do NOT understand autism's unique characteristics. 
I think those people should make their own show about their views of autism and leave Atypical alone. It's amazing and wonderful. Sweet and inspirational. Sam is a super amazknf kid - and so similar to my son and my students - yep! I'm also a teacher that works in a school for children with autism. I love every single one of my students, and all their unique abilities. 
Sam Gardner - keep on keeping on. Don't let horrible people keep you down - they just don't get you! And that's alright. You are a bright shining star! And so is your real person, Keir, because without your incredible skills - Sam would not have been in my living while my son watched with a laundry basket over his head because he doesn't like big spaces either.",50 out of 55 found this helpful.,9.0,29 September 2018

Which leads to my only disappointment from this show so far, and that's the fact that the seasons are quite short. <br/><br/>The show is basically a comedy with some drama elements about an autistic high-school teenager. Unlike most of the other high-school shows out there, I actually liked this one because of the the amazing script.
The time at school isn't the focus of this show. It's about everyone surrounding the autistic kid such as family, friends, therapists etc.
You get to touch and feel all of their lives and the writers really did a great work to make you feel as if you're part of that family.
The dialogues are not banal, the jokes are good and some of the characters are sweet as a candy and you'll just love them.<br/><br/>There are some exaggerated parts, but It really isn't that bad and I guess it's part of what makes the show feel a bit more light and fun rather than being too serious.<br/><br/>So far it's one of my most favorite TV shows that I'd recommend anyone to watch, and it's suitable for the entire family.",25 out of 27 found this helpful.,10.0,6 October 2018
660,Atypical," ""atypical"" is addicting even for the neuro-typical","I'm watching ""Atypical"". (thank you Lauren). I'm so glad I stumbled (with a little shove by my sister ""L"") on this Netflix original series. Here's my ""Atypical"" reasons why. I'm a Mom with similar feelings and fears as the Mom in the series, so I can relate. My ""atypical"" son *loves* the main actor Keir Gilchrist, therefore I do, and more specifically, one of the only movies my son can actually sit through the whole thing is a Keir Gilchrist movie called ""It's Kind of a Funny Story"".<br/><br/>The main character, ""Sam"", hyper focuses on the Arctic and penguins relating everything, pretty much, in life, to that focus, like my son relates everything to Minecraft. He gets stuck on words, takes things literally, smiles awkwardly when expected on cue, and is effing hilarious...All atypical qualities that makes the movie and my son, exceptional.<br/><br/>I give this series 10 stars but more importantly, I give this series the full one hour sit through per episode with Minecraft and ""I like pie"" word rant breaks in between.",53 out of 61 found this helpful.,10.0,20 August 2017

Is about this complete family life with a kid whom has autism and how the experience of him in puberty, but the impact it creates on the whole family too. <br/><br/>Is really charming, lovable, sweet, intense and, most of all, deep and inner. <br/><br/>Keir Gilchrist (Sam), has the ability to perform exquisite his character, he is really promising. Plus the writers made an excellent development on the character. He is Autistic but not too much; not social, but neither too much; smart but neither too much. He keeps on the creepy exact balance that make his character unique.<br/><br/>The supportive sister portrait by Brigette Lundy-Paine, whom I haven't seen before on performance, is also great; she is this defensive strong girl whom has the soft spot: Her brother. <br/><br/>The whole family casting is awesome too, long time no see Michael Rappaport on such a good show. He does quite a good performance as a supporting father, he has the soft spot on the family, but also the leading male.

665,Atypical, Relatable,"Reading some other reviews it seems like the representation of Autism is slightly skewed in this show, but in my opinion it successfully walked a fine line between being accurate and presenting something that everyone can relate to. Hopefully that helps people understand the condition, while also still having an entertaining show to watch.<br/><br/>As a show it excels in character presentation as every main has their own quirks and struggles to overcome. Some of these struggles may be left unresolved and this is probably the only place the show falters a little. It felt like some things were left open-ended to allow for another series, so there isn't complete satisfaction in all the story lines by the end. But you can only begrudge a show so much for that, and while a tight closed story would be nice, it is better than turning into Wayward Pines where your complete story is so successful that you have a second series that is completely contrived because you had nowhere to go at the end of the first.<br/><br/>Overall this is a show that most people will have seen before about the struggles of an everyday family, through the lens of someone on the autistic spectrum. The characters and the drama feel realistic and down to earth for the most part and the comedy is mild but entertaining. It wasn't revolutionary, but it was enjoyable and definitely worth devoting a minor binge to in its 8 episode run.",49 out of 59 found this helpful.,8.0,13 August 2017

671,Atypical," Aims high, but finishes in the middle","For starters, Keir Gilchrist and Michael Rapaport crush it in this show. I'm generally not one to watch dramedies, but this show definitely has its moments.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint with the show honestly has to be Jennifer Jason Leigh. I'm not really a fan of the cheating subplot to begin with, but there's something about how she plays Elsa that just makes the character irritating and very difficult to empathize with. Maybe its the dynamic that her character is supposed to create, but it comes off as naggy. Pair that with the unnecessary character of Nick and the show just makes you feel bad for everyone who is oblivious to the mother's actions.<br/><br/>Some may argue that Doug's walking out in 2004 justifies Elsa's actions, but the show does not do a great enough job of stressing the magnitude of that, but milks the cheating scenes far too much, creating an unbalance between the emotions you feel toward each parent. Doug is trying to improve and Elsa is going off the rails.<br/><br/>All in all, I find the show to be quite entertaining, but there is definitely something to be desired that is not present.",20 out of 24 found this helpful.,7.0,24 October 2017

But now she's irresponsible, unlikeable, pushy and basically just a bad parent, she causes more problems for her kids. If you took her out of the show, everything would actually improve. That's how bad it has become. She went from hero to villain somewhere in Season 4. Getting her kids in trouble, encouraging them to do dangerous activities, forcing them to commit vandalism.... WTF?

679,American Housewife," Hey mom, you are not going to believe this, but YOU are being characterized on TV's new sitcom ""American Housewife""","Well the pilot episode was just aired and I must say that the story line about a slightly overweight mother and her husband raising three children in the suburbs of Westport Conneticut will resonate with a lot of household families. Actress Katy Mixon who just came off six seasons of the successful sitcom Mike and Molly plays mom Katie Otto, who feels a bit uncomfortable in what she feels is her over sized body compared to all the neighborhood school moms who remind her of the perfect Stepford wives. Now Katie's husband Greg, played by Diedrich Bader is just your normal dad who enjoys his morning read on the bathroom throne with a cup of java. Greg doesn't think Katie is as fat as Katie thinks she is. Nor does Greg think that two (2) of his three (3) kids are a bit weird, but Katie sure does. <br/><br/>Fat Pam is Katie's neighbor from across the street and she is moving which will leave Katie as the second fattest mom in her neighborhood. Katie convinces her husband Greg that he has to help her find a heavy woman to buy the house across the street so she won't be looked upon as the fattest mom in the neighborhood and she can feel better about herself. But common sense prevails and Katie ends up eventually having to welcome another Stepford looking wife to the neighborhood named Viv, played by Leslie Bibb. The initial interaction between Viv and Katie one could imagine it would not be exactly a warm welcome and thus we have the making of a new sitcom.<br/><br/>Katie and Greg are the proud parents of two daughters and one son. Their son Oliver's ambition is to be the next Warren Buffet but I don't think that Katie and Greg have the heart to tell their son that they actually are just renting the house they live in. Their younger daughter a cutey patootie named Anna-Kat is scared of germs and shows sign of having an obsessive compulsive disorder. Their older daughter Taylor fits right in the neighborhood with all the slim good looking girls and Katie resents that Taylor may grow up as just another plastic Stepford type wife, shallow but beautifully slim.<br/><br/>What I really like about this new sitcom is there is no ""canned laughter"" barreling at the audience during and after every conversation the family may have. The laughter will have to be earned and they earned my laughter during the first episode. This family themed comedy format has a good chance of becoming a weekly ""must see"" as we the audience get to know the personalities of Katie, Greg their three children Oliver, Anna-Kat, Taylor and their new neighbor Viv.

683,American Housewife, Every time I watch it just gets better,OK yea I am a family comedy junkie and I love this show and speechless equally though I have to say while Katie mixion was the only selling point for me at first I thought she was all I was going to enjoy from the trailer but I have fallen in love with the family kind of yes it's not really new but it is great.yes I get abc aring two family comedies too close to each other could be a problem but not here it's perfection like I Sayed it's not new just great my favorite part actually isn't even Katie . much to my surprise. It's the youngest daughter Anna Kat that has me in stitches every time I watch but the whole family is lovable and the adorable Katie mixion is just as sweet as always gotta love the show,18 out of 26 found this helpful.,9.0,15 December 2016
684,American Housewife, A fun parody and comedy!,I absolutely love this show! I can't wait for Hulu to put up the new episode every week. Honestly don't understand why people are so critical of it. ( One user mentioned reality of 'public' high school use.) It isn't Meant to be wholly factual or give a documentary like feel.<br/><br/>The show is highly entertaining and highlights real life personality/ faulty perceptions one may have.

686,American Housewife, A Mom's Binging Buddy,"As a super busy American housewife myself, I have to say I look forward to ad cherish the evenings I can binge-watch this relatable and delightful show. I snuggle in with my glass of wine and sometimes a snack (hey a mom's gotta eat), crack open my laptop and enjoy. I chuckle and yes, even snort at the comedy - it's that funny - careful not to wake my sleeping family.<br/><br/>Katie Otto truly is the American Housewife. I think we can all relate to the challenges she faces - including but not limited to - weight, self-image, kids, schools, community and our little silly suburban lives.<br/><br/>We can all relate to those two quirky friends that get us through life. For Katie is Doris &amp; Angela. And they are frikkin hilarious!!<br/><br/>Actually the entire cast is great! Her husband is one of my all-time favorite actors and while I've never seen the kids in anything prior I have to say they really bring it when it comes to comedic comedy and timing. Wendy Malick as always is charming, quirky yet biting.<br/><br/>If you're a mom looking for a fun, light-hearted comedy that won't make you think too much (because hey, we got enough on our plate) then this is for you. I rank it up there with my other favs like Modern Family, and Park &amp; Rec. well done! Can't wait for season 4",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,3 July 2019

While I liked Kathy Mixon in Mike and Molly, in this show she is a bad-tempered bully, self-involved, and a very silly woman. She is the weakest link in this show. Her perpetual sullen frown grows tiresome and it is hard to believe her lovely husband could have the patience to deal with her ongoing miserable behaviour. There is absolutely no chemistry between these two and the family dynamic is unbelievable. The situations are frustratingly stupid and superficial and I have absolutely zero interest in how the latest ""problem"" will be solved.

695,American Housewife, Former Fan,I loved the first 3 seasons. I was starting to lose interest mid-season 4 but season 5 has lost me completely. I understand diversity but it's almost offensive to replace an African American actress and an Asian American actress with the exact same race in the exact same supporting role. It feels like they are trying too hard to be politically correct at the expense of keeping a realistic story line. The recast of Ana-Kat has also fallen seriously flat. Ghiselle Eisenberg is an excellent little actress but she's an odd fit for this particular sitcom.,4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,5 February 2021

699,American Housewife, Wanted to like it...but can't,"Saving money, bad. Eating healthy, bad. They move to a white, wealthy neighborhood because of the schools, but the mom hates everything about it and everyone in it. And is constantly telling her kids why everything in the neighborhood is bad. I just can't buy it. If you hate the ""rich school"" and the kids that go there, why would you want your kids there? You do not need to go to the best school to get a great education and get into a top college...if that's their goal. <br/><br/>I'm waiting for the redeeming message, where she realizes that constantly comparing herself to everyone else is self defeating, and harmful to her children, but it never comes. The ""white privilege"" stereotype is annoying. The ""I'm fat and have a negative body image"" stereotype is annoying (and honestly, she's too small for that stereotype, so it makes it not believable). The ""over achieving Asian"" stereotype is annoying. The only stereotype that's believable and you are rooting for is the OCD daughter.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I like all the actors, they cast it well. I just wish it was a better sitcom.

702,Veronica Mars," dark and beautiful, Veronica mars is a witty and smart show for all ages","Veronica Mars is a dark and poignant tribute to teenage angst and isolation. As a sophomore, we find Veronica popular and happy. She is dating the most popular guy in school, Duncan, and is best friends with Duncan's sister- the wild Lily Kane. After Lily's brutal and highly publicized murder, Veronica loses her friends, her social status all because she choose to stick by her father who accused Lily Kane's own father, the rich and beloved Jake Kane.<br/><br/>Season 1 follows Veronica's life post Lily's violent murder. Veronica has become cynical and disheartened due to what she feels as betrayal by her closest friends. Overnight Veronica became the most hated girl in school. She formed a hard outer shell, cutting herself off from her emotions in order to handle all the events that occur after the murder, the taunts of classmates, and the current class war that's been waged through out her town.<br/><br/>Veronica Mars is homage to the noir film genre of the 1950s with our main character being a high school teenager. The uses of color in scenes are key to understanding the story. Every aspect of the show is used to tell parts of the story from lighting to background prop placement and it all comes together to tell a beautiful story about death, betrayal, love, revenge and redemption.<br/><br/>The best thing about Mars, besides the character develop, plot twist, and witty dialogue, are the issues that Veronica Mars faces on a daily bases. Including murder, rape, teen pregnancy, gang violence, reports on abuse, and drug trafficking. It also tackles the normal high school issues all teens face like peer pressure, cliques, and gossip but in a smart way. The story lines are tasteful and believable; the writers did a great job avoiding the normal camp and clichés found in a lot of teen shows.<br/><br/>Veronica Mars is hands down the best show ever to be featured on UPN/CW, and possible network TV in general. It is defiantly worth your time.",88 out of 111 found this helpful.,10.0,13 June 2008
703,Veronica Mars," Veronica Mars, great ensemble series - until it wasn't","As a completely different show, Season 4 of Veronica Mars would be watchable. As a continuation of a established show, it was a discordant watch almost from the first episode.<br/><br/>It seems apparent that the show runner, main actress and Hulu executives believed that the titular character was the only reason for continued interest in the show, and so wrote Season 4 specifically designed to shoehorn that character into a different genre. To do that, they had to regress her to the emotional maturity of a teenager. (Incongruously , because moving the series away from teenage drama was apparently an intention.)<br/><br/>When the central intention is badly conceived (and in show interviews, even more poorly articulated) then the lacklustre episodes that resulted are understandable.<br/><br/>Every canon character in this season was a parallel-universe version of themselves, including the character of the town of Neptune.<br/><br/>Keith, a strong, understanding, quick witted father figure, is infantilised by the loss of mental acuity and shown to be weakened man by the obvious device of a cane, several years after his accident. The father-daughter interactions of previous seasons are still thankfully present, but are nostalgic rather than vital. Keith's season long story arc is resolved with a whimper. (If only some ex-criminal had turned up earlier to get the correct diagnosis.)<br/><br/>Wallace is still in Veronica's life. She treats his new life and family dismissively, (drugs in the bathroom, anyone?). She gaslights Wallace by inviting him for a night out at the movies, and dragging him along to follow a lead. This character would not grow up to be a man that missed nuance and the way that Veronica views his partner, his family and his life, and he would have called her out for it well before now.<br/><br/>Eli, a long-time friend, is treated disparagingly and appallingly by Veronica for 'reasons'. These are later spelled out - Keith and Cliff worked hard (at their jobs) to get Eli compensation for his treatment by the Kanes and the police department, and... Eli took a settlement to provide for his family. Success, right? But not for Veronica. Who despite having it explained to her a couple of times - in actual words - is deliberately obtuse and demeaning. To emphasise the enduring nature of non-reciprocated loyalty to Veronica by the supporting characters, Eli saves both her and her father from certain death by a just-in-time intervention, and is supposedly amply rewarded with ... a look. So, Eli's character arc and redemption by the time of the movie has gone full circle, and he is returned to the teenage Weevil with limited options.<br/><br/>Critics of fan-servicing in the movie, reference the presence of cameos of fan favourites as a problem. Season 4 cameos came from the B-list of supporting characters. Max, who cheated on loved character Mac, Tim, the murderer, Mercer, the serial rapist. They did however, give 'new' Veronica a chance to be sarcastic and manipulative again to those currently unable to reciprocate. Although, Mercer did manage a dig at young Logan's supposed infidelity - a trait inconsistent, once again, with canon. The most likable, character, Parker, is introduced solely as a past-love interest of Logan to create tension when the marriage licence was finally going to be acquired. How the writers must have laughed to include her parting advice - ""Enjoy the honeymoon"", knowing what was to come. Whoever came up with the ""Let's give them what they want, but make it last less than an hour..."" surely got the most giggles.<br/><br/>Dick, has become a caricature of the already comic character that he was. A completely hedonistic male with occasional glimpses of depth, but always - a fierce loyalty to those he cared for. Another character reduced to a teenage level of maturity, by writers unable to explore what happens to people who suffer tragedy and whose support systems are others who have the same background. His convenient displacement to Romania, as an actor playing a mannikin, is parallel to the writers exile of his character to plastic body form. His presence is not required for the death of his father, the marriage of his best friend, or his best friend's death, because he served his purpose as badly written comic relief. A figure of ridicule, not sympathy.<br/><br/>Mac - dry humoured, quick witted, tech-expert with fascinating origin story, and personal trauma of her own and such admirable resilience is also... sent to Istanbul.<br/><br/>Critic reviews have referred to Maddy as a suitable replacement for 'teenage' Veronica Mars, except - Maddy has none of her redeeming features. Maddy steals a ring which she then sells. She also uses her victim status to great effect at Mars Investigations, so her need for manipulation techniques from Veronica seems unnecessary. She witnesses the beheading of a long-standing character without reaction or emotion. No relationships are seen to be formed with any other character - unlike Veronica, who found connections with others such as Wallace, Mac, Weevil and Logan despite herself and her self-defense mechanisms. A soul-less doppelganger is hardly a great choice for a replacement Veronica for Keith. Frankly, Keith can hire an actual competent detective.<br/><br/>New characters, the Maloofs, stay for the duration of the season in Neptune because of a ring. The blackmail situation undertaken by Mars Investigation, was both solved and resolved by detective ... Echolls. The lost ring, despite being part of the brief into the bombings and paid for by the Maloofs, dismissed by Veronica as irrelevant and solved by the sheer deductive brilliance of ... Vinnie Van Lowe. In fact, even the Mars exposure of the second bomber of Neptune - was previously foreseen by the bomber himself - and utilised in order to plant the bomb that - so very precisely, yet arbitrarily - killed Logan. The mysteries were poorly written. The neck bomb does not fit into final bomber narrative at all. Especially as he used a non-specific, pre-timed, casually placed bomb as his final coup-de-grace.<br/><br/>The Mexican cartel characters were given considerable time and dialogue to show the sympathetic side to violent murdering sociopaths. Enjoying lattes, loving relationships, comfortable friendship dynamics while holding down stressful jobs. Of course, their violence was rewarded with another paid hit job for a senator. It is strange that a large portion of this season, which dehumanises and diminishes so many long term characters, is used to show the humanity of two characters that practice casual violence, including the unneccessary killing and beheading of a man because of the coerced accusation of a Spring Breaker.<br/><br/>Dick Casablanca Snr, the 'Big Dick' of the Season almost duplicated the Woody incorporation storyline of Season 2. With his proposal for town regulations, he intended to further divide the Neptune community in order to make himself individually wealthy. Similar storyline, similar outcome.<br/><br/>Vinnie Van Lowe, detective extraordinaire solves the missing ring mystery by Sherlock level deduction. Veronica, who allows her office to be bugged and also invites in the thief who steals their information and tech, disparages him because he demanded a high daily retainer. Seems a strange fixation for someone who charges $300/hr plus expenses, and then uses partner's contacts to actually get a result.<br/><br/>Leo, is reintroduced to provide the supposedly shunned teen-drama love-triangle tension, that is fed by a long drawn out sexual dream sequence and more screen time than her supposed significant other, Logan.<br/><br/>Logan's growth, in stark contrast to Veronica's regression, required skilful handling. So, Logan, inexplicably impoverished, is fridged. Enough has been written by others about their reaction to this character's story arc and death for Hulu to understand the problems with this treatment. Dismissal of this reaction as shippers getting ""what they needed"" is poor justification. Despite Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell's assertions, they have previously indicated their distaste for this character's popularity. They mistakenly assumed it relied on the attention of the titular character for drawing power. However it happened, the Logan Echolls character, carved his own space independent of - but parallel to - Veronica's and many viewers loved his story arc separately. He was also the only character, that despite his relationship status with Veronica - called her out. Given Logan's current evolved character, and Veronica's devolution the question is not - will they - won't they? It's more - why would he? Street cleaning death, is an apt metaphor for the belittling consideration given to this character and his contribution to the show's popularity.<br/><br/>Logan, was the possibility of redemption and healing in human form, and many viewers are mourning that loss. Neptune, was the microcosm of the inequalities and injustices in the wider world, and many viewers are mourning that loss. Despite the title, the attraction for many of the original show was the ensemble cast of supporting characters - not solely the titular protagonist - many viewers are mourning that loss.<br/><br/>Veronica's previous teenage character was flawed, and made mistakes because of a fierce personal need to get to the truth, and make some part of her world make sense. This middle-aged ""strangely teenage"" version, is out of character - even taking into account her regression - so many viewers are mourning that loss. . The complete recharacterisation of Veronica, the removal of the integral parts of the show that made it beloved, and the delivery of a season that retroactively removes the enjoyment of previous seasons makes it a season to regret.<br/><br/>Veronica Mars was a great show - after watching season 4 - I miss it already.",52 out of 64 found this helpful.,6.0,15 August 2019
704,Veronica Mars, I loved it &amp; then I hated it!,"*SPOILER-ISH WARNING*
(Although I don't go into any details or tell you anything that happens I do express my thoughts on the show but more specifically the last episode of the new season 4. If you want to know what actually happens you'll have to watch or Google it. If you don't want any expectations going in you probably won't want to read this. If you're still interested keep reading.)<br/><br/>I just started watching this show about a week ago because I saw new episodes were being released. I've always heard about the show so I decided to check it out. I really liked it &amp; I was excited to watch the movie they released a few years ago and then the new season. I was a big fan until the last 10 minutes or so of the new season that's when everything fell apart and I kind of felt like I wasted my time getting invested in this show. I feel like they completely destroyed everything in those last few minutes. I can honestly say my life would suck less if I didn't finish that last episode. It honestly felt like the writer Rob Thomes just decided to see how angry he could make the fanbase and how fast he could destroy this show's reputation. Honestly after seeing the last episode I don't even care if it ever gets another season! Unless they undo what was done I'm completely over this show. I really don't write reviews for things but this infuriated me &amp; I need to let out my frustrations! If you're going to watch this show don't watch the last episode! It also would have been nice if season 4 was longer but I could've overlooked that if the season didn't end like it did! I can't think of another show that has made me feel this way!

705,Veronica Mars, Are you kidding me?,"After reading quite a few comments from people who thought this show is ""horrible,"" I was really surprised with their reasons. First of all, there are very few TV shows out there that are in every way true to life. Of course the situations aren't completely plausible! That's why we watch TV shows in the first place - we're entertained by things that we would not normally do or see. If I wanted to watch something ""realistic"" I'd just tape myself and watch it at the end of the day.<br/><br/>What's real in this show is that every character is complicated and has layers in their personality. The bad guy isn't all bad, and the good guy isn't so great either. There's just this gray area - just the way people are.<br/><br/>Then there's the complaint that Veronica Mars is ""too smart."" And that's a bad thing because...? I'm sick of mindless shows that give away the ending in the first minute and/or have the same tired plots. If witty is not your thing, that is sad and someone needs a good dose of ""sense of humor."" Maybe everything we watch on TV should be bland and predictable from now on? By the way, detective work is supposed to be logical - not flashy. When you want to look for someone, you'd automatically put a trace on things they own. What did you expect would happen? Some kind of laser tracking thingy?<br/><br/>The writing on this show is amazing, as are the actors and everything else. The artistic value is also incredible.

707,Veronica Mars, This had been a bad dream....,"All I will say is, if this gets a season 5, Rob Thomas needs to make the first episode Veronica waking up from a real bad dream.

708,Veronica Mars, Here's What's Wrong w/ S4 (From The Perspective of a Professional Writer),"I'm a writer and a writing coach, and as much as the ending of season 4 disappointed me as a fan and as a person whose favorite character is Logan, what I hated was all the betrayals of established and accepted formula for something other over something I agreed to through three seasons and a movie.<br/><br/>Let me explain. When I started watching, I was given a set of guidelines. Veronica is the main character. Check. Veronica solves crimes. Check. Veronica Mars (show, character, and supporting cast, especially Logan) is funny. Check. Veronica has meaningful relationships with friends and family, season one through the movie. Check. Season four. Check-ish.<br/><br/>Sure, we got Keith and Logan. And I loved watching that, but where the heck were Wallace and Weevil? It got particularly irritating to me when instead of Wallace and Weevil, we got way too much of lots of new and ultimately unimportant characters.<br/><br/>This is part of why I liked the show better as a procedural with one overarching big bad for the season. One case per episode means we get less of these extraneous characters, but still get the big case. But because they decided to deal with one case for all 8 episodes, and not use a lot of Weevil or Wallace, I got bored with them and ended up fast-forwarding those scenes. And you know what, fast-forwarding didn't make the plot hard to follow, which tells me those scenes really weren't necessary anyway.<br/><br/>However, I found myself making allowances for the things that lacked, because I loved the moments where Veronica was with Logan and working on her relationship (although, I didn't like how she treated Logan with regard to his therapy and personal growth-what is she, 12? Even in high school she was more understanding than that.) I also loved seeing V with her dad and watching them deal with his memory loss, and no matter how fleeting, I was totally into the scenes with Wallace and Weevil and even Dick! I watched on tenterhooks, thrilled whenever we got them.<br/><br/>I dealt with the strung out mystery, that at times was so predictable it had me face-palming, because I wanted to see what would happen next with Veronica and the other characters of the universe of the show-but particularly with her relationship with Logan. It was fresh and interesting and felt, for the most part, like a natural progression. ""So, this is what adult Veronica and Logan would be like together. Awesome!""<br/><br/>Logan was the character through all seasons and the movie, that pushed Veronica to be better, do better, to come to grips with what she wanted from life. Sometimes because he was being supportive .
The reason his character is so integral to Veronica's character growth is because he's the only character who is not only as smart as Veronica but also willing to call her on her crap. Sure, Keith is wicked smart, but he doesn't really push V. And sure, other characters call her on her crap, but they're not as smart as her, or they don't care about her as much or as deeply (they're not in love with her,) so it's not as interesting.<br/><br/>If a loser tells her to grow up, we roll our eyes. If Logan tells her to grow up, it makes an impact. Even people who don't like Logan are going to have very strong opinions about that. It's either going to hurt like crazy, infuriate us, or make us cheer. What it won't do is cause a blasé reaction. In writing, we'd call Logan Veronica's ""impact character."" And, frankly, no one else has the chops to pull that off.<br/><br/>I like Leo, but he can be bought with pizza for crying out loud. I like Dick, but there's no real relationship there. I love Wallace and Weevil, but while important to her, they don't have enough at stake with her to do it. And I LOVE Keith, but part of what makes him so fun is watching how he dotes on her. Not the main trait of an impact character.<br/><br/>Logan filled a position that no other character can, and that, after four seasons and a movie, no one else should. It's been established, and we accepted it. Every episode, every season, the Kickstarter movie, and even season 4, which was brought about, in part, by fan pressure again, was like a contract saying: this is the established universe, this is what you'll get. We held up our end of the contract and supported the crap out of the show. (It definitely wasn't fan service. It was self service.)<br/><br/>Perhaps that, Logan being an impact character, was the point of killing him? Rob Thomas did say he wanted it to be more about the mysteries, so adios character development? That's dumb. I'm not here going on about the mysteries. The mystery was fine, I guess, if not predictable. I'm here going on about character building. The true essence of the show.<br/><br/>Are the mysteries fun? Absolutely. Are they what keep me coming back? Nope. I mean, it's not like I'd want to watch a show where Logan and Veronica sit for an hour arguing over their relationship, but it's not the mysteries that really make an impact. I don't quote lines from bad guys. The memorable stuff, the stuff you talk about after the show is over, are the characters and what's happening to them. Point and case, no one is talking about the bomber now, or the case, or any of those several new characters that are never coming back. Everyone is talking about Logan and their very strong feelings about what happened to him. We don't care about the cases. We may like them and think they're interesting, but we don't care about them. What we care about is memorable and ""epic.""<br/><br/>This show has never been about how the characters can impact the mysteries; it's been about how the mysteries impact the characters. This is a character show. It's not GoT. You can't just kill one of THREE main characters, especially the impact character, and act like it's no big deal, like you can move the show onward and have it be as good or better. It is a big deal. And the show will never be as good if this is allowed to stay canon. It'll never get better. Veronica will never grow. She'll (the show and character) will stagnate. And fans will abandon ship.<br/><br/>Just by sticking through this season, I already agreed to:
1.) Give up the procedural aspect
2.) Watch (or fast-forward) through characters that are overall unimportant to the lives of the main characters or even the mystery, really
3.) Losing screen time with characters that normally had much bigger roles and who were more interesting than the guys in #2
4.) And now, it seems, I've even agreed to lose the place we've been repeatedly told is Veronica's field of battle, Neptune.
5.) And if #4 is for real, then also screen time with any of the characters that made up the world of Veronica Mars except for Veronica Mars. (What is she supposed to do? Have witty conversations with herself in the mirror now?)<br/><br/>But, I agreed to all that, because they kept her relationship with her dad and with Logan intact. But especially Logan, because again, he's her impact character. The one that keeps her doing the things she needs to do to be better; a better person, a better partner, a better investigator, a better friend, a better everything. He's the one that forces her to be introspective.<br/><br/>But now that's gone, too?<br/><br/>And just Logan in general who is an amazing character, that I'm glad to hear they're proud of, but pissed that they thought he was expendable. He, all by himself, is still the most interesting character to watch next to Veronica, and I'd argue sometimes he's more interesting than her. That's how you know he's un-expendable.<br/><br/>But no more Logan and just ""deal with it, the show'll be better."" Really?<br/><br/>It's like they got an idea for a new mystery show and wanted Kristen Bell to be in it, but because she was already in a mystery show, they just decided to wipe everything that made the real show so great and try something new. (Heck, it even comes with a built in fan base! Maybe not anymore.)<br/><br/>And, I probably would've gone along with it forever, until it turned in to ""Murder, She Wrote,"" even, if they'd left the main trio alone.<br/><br/>Why would I watch a show that betrayed every rule it established as ""the world of Veronica Mars"" to be just another crime scene show. I wouldn't. If I wanted to watch CSI, I would. This was supposed to be different. Better. And it was.<br/><br/>They manipulated my feelings and then ripped the only really good thing, the only one of two things that stayed the same from the original show, out from under me; the reason I kept watching when if it'd been any other show I would've quit halfway into the 3rd episode. That's why ""How I Met Your Mother"" fans were so ticked. They were promised one thing and were given the opposite of that.<br/><br/>Also, killing Logan because you feel like you've written yourself into a corner, or because you don't know how to write an interesting story that includes a man who is a Naval Intelligence Officer with a crazy backstory and loads of interesting baggage is lazy writing. It just is. I can think of ten solid ideas off the top of my head. I expect more from one of the most creative and clever shows I've ever seen. They know how to do it.<br/><br/>On a personal note, I hate and reject the idea that the only way V can be interesting to watch is if she's wounded and alone and doesn't have a man waiting for her. It's almost 2020 and we're still pushing the misogynistic idea that a woman can't be successful in her career, be interesting, and be happily married? Really? What the cuss?<br/><br/>Also, the whole idea that they're trying to get rid of the teen drama by killing Logan just sounds like they weren't paying attention to what they wrote this season. The only person acting immature was Veronica.<br/><br/>If you want an adult show, how about you make your MC act like an adult? And there's not much more adult than being married and having to deal with the trials that come with that. We, as the audience, have grown up-we wanted that for Veronica too.<br/><br/>Best,

710,Veronica Mars, I can't believe I'm saying this...,"I hate being sucked in. More than anything. I avoid anything that's popular just because I can't stand the herd mentality. It took me three years before I touched a Harry Potter book. I would not have watched this show willingly. My one uplifting, redeeming quality is that I'm a good friend. Always. Even at the sacrifice of my Wednesday evenings. I originally started watching VM because I was taping it for a friend who didn't get UPN in her new town. I was just going to tape it, but I thought it would be nice if I cut the commercials for her. Now, half a season later...I can't stop watching it. It's horrible. I actually rented the entire first season and watched it in one twenty-four hour sitting. If you start watching this show, be warned you WILL get hooked, no matter how hard you try to resist. It is a great mystery. Each episode has its own mystery that is self inclusive, but the overall season mystery is what keeps you speeding through traffic to get home in time on Wednesday nights.

711,Veronica Mars, Not just another teen drama...,"Okay, I admit...when I first started watching VM, I didn't really expect much. However, one or two episodes in and I was totally hooked. I really enjoy the noir aspect of it, and the fact that is doesn't hold anything back in terms of ""real"" issues such as drugs, and sex. Of course, these issues are dealt with in a fictional way that makes them intriguing (as opposed to depressing) to watch.<br/><br/>The writing simply got better in the second season, and every time I watch an episode, I find myself relating more and more to a piece of each of the characters. Its this aspect that I feel makes VM a truly great show, and I look forward to the seasons to come.",131 out of 218 found this helpful.,10.0,5 June 2006
712,Veronica Mars, Remarkable TV (season one review),"Despite dismal ratings and crazy scheduling, in 2 short years 'Veronica Mars' has obtained a cult following... so what is all the fuss? Well, I'll tell you...<br/><br/>Season 1 centers around the murder mystery of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried); daughter to software billionaire and best friend of the show's protagonist, Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell). Before the murder of her best friend Veronica lived a pretty idyllic life in Neptune, California; a town, as Veronica puts it ""without the middle class"". By all means Veronica shouldn't have been apart of the elite 09ers (kids who live in the prestigious 90909 zip code), her parents didn't meet the pay-cheque quota and despite the fact that her father used to be Sheriff (which had a certain 'cachet') the only reason Veronica was one of the 'beautiful people' was because she was dating Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn), Lilly's brother and heir to the Kane software company. But everything changed when Lilly was murdered Veronica's father, Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni) accused Lilly's father of murdering his only daughter and was booted out of the force when a video of the crime scene was released over the internet. Veronica's home-life began to fall apart when her family had to move out of their house and into a cheaper apartment, and when Veronica's mother could no longer handle being shunned by the elite community, she took off. Things got even worse for Veronica's social scene when Lilly's supposed murderer was captured after an anonymous tip-off. One-year on Veronica is no longer the preppy princes she once was; she has an attitude problem, no friends and now helps her father in the P.I business; 'Mar Investigations'; Veronica investigates everything from unfaithful husbands to a dog kidnapping conspiracy. But things begin to change with the arrival of new student and sidekick, Wallace (Percy Daggs III), as Veronica tries to figure out who really murdered her best friend, and who raped her the summer she was shunned by her former friends.<br/><br/>Veronica Mars is very reminiscent, but in no way a clone of previous successful teen dramas. VM has the same quick-witted writing jam-packed with pop-culture references as 'Buffy' and 'Gilmore Girls', combined with the mystery plot lines of 'Twin Peaks'. With a blonde, female P.I protagonist the show is constantly paralleled with 'Nancy Drew'; but be assured the investigative teen is the only similarity between the two. Veronica's mysteries aren't as corny or Scooby-Doo as figuring out who is really haunting the house on top of the hill  the show deals with infidelity, sexual abuse, murder and kidnapping. Taking a page out of Joss Whedon's book, Veronica Mars is extremely character driven  while the season's big mystery is very edge of your seat, it's the characters you care about and keep coming back to watch. Kristen Bell brings many shades and layers to the jaded Veronica; she's a wise-ass who tries hard to keep her shields up, but at the same time she is very fragile; and some of the show's best and most memorable moments come when Veronica lets her guard down, or feels totally beat by life. Perhaps the best thing about the character of Veronica Mars is the fact that she's extremely flawed. Sure, she looks cute with her perfect shiny blonde hair and impeccably cool wardrobe, but she isn't always the best judge of character and sometimes she just plain screws up. Whether it's dating a drug dealer, accusing the wrong person of murder or faultily stereotyping someone; Veronica is the best kind of heroine because she isn't perfect, she's damaged and that makes her real and accessible to audiences. Veronica is the high school underdog; living on the fringe of popularity, shunning the 'cliques' and mainstream, unafraid to put herself on the front-lines of unpopularity for what she believes in. She is the ultimate outcast, and everyone at least once in their life can relate to her because of her constant social struggles.<br/><br/>One of the other great things about 'Veronica Mars' is the fact that Enrico Colantoni and Kristen Bell have a great rapport. Amidst the seediness of Neptune's underbelly, it's nice to see that the father/daughter relationship is quite often the beating heart of the show. Jason Dohring who plays Logan Echolls; Veronica's former friend and current rival; is also absolutely fantastic. His character is constantly shedding layers, going from 'psychotic jack-ass', to tormented teen. Logan is a conundrum, one minute he's the typical high school jerk, with lewd comments galore: ""my underbelly is rock hard. It can go all night"" the next he's quoting great minds like William M. Thackeray for his daily inspirational phone message: ""To love and win is the best thing. To love and lose, the next best"". Logan has one of the most interesting and complex character transformations that have endeared him to 'Veronica Mars' fans.<br/><br/>Veronica Mars is 'on the bubble'; a TV show term for when a show is about to make it big. 'Veronica Mars' constantly receives rave reviews, but poor ratings (usually due to yo-yo scheduling and bad time slots). The show has ferociously devout fans and an extremely dedicated cast. It is a breath of fresh air at a time when cookie-cutter TV shows like CSI are ruling the box and reality TV shows are being churned out and devoured for no good reason; 'the Bachelor', 'Dancing with the Stars'. Do yourself a favor and dip your toes into this TV show; I guarantee that from episode one you will be taken in, hook line and sinker.",413 out of 747 found this helpful.,10.0,16 April 2006

714,Veronica Mars, A real gem!,"'Veronica Mars' - It's not Buffy, Twin Peaks or the Outsiders, but it's a worthy successor to each of them. <br/><br/>In today's market of Cookie Cutter television (CSI/Law&amp;Order) - what a breath of fresh air it is to see someone actually making something entertaining about investigation and mystery.<br/><br/>While the two breakout hits of the year have been 'Lost' and 'Desperate Housewives' and rightly so - Veronica Mars deserves every bit as much acclaim. It's smart, fun, and spirited.<br/><br/>With a great cast, led by star-in-the-making Kristen Bell (for those who've seen Deadwood, then you'll have seen a glimpse of her range in 'Suffer the Little Children'), she's ably supported by Enrico Colantoni - a great roll for the former 'Just Shoot Me' regular - as her PI father. Surrounding the two are a host of intriguing characters, who each have their face value introductions, and yet, as the show progresses, are never just what they seem. <br/><br/>At the core of the show's story, is the mysterious murder of Veronica's best friend, and the ripple effect that this has had on her life around her. Nothing it would seem has been left untouched  ostracized by her former friends, she leads the lonesome life of a high-school student by day, and her Dad's PI assistant by night. The perfect launch point for the many adventures to come, as Veronica tries to untangle the web of intrigue that has been thrown across the world she lives in. <br/><br/>This isn't a ham-fisted Nancy Drew effort - Rob Thomas, the show's creator, has learnt well from those shows which have tread across similar territory; the teen angst of Buffy, the engaging mystery of Twin Peaks, the class struggle of the Outsiders, and perhaps even the sassy cool of Alias's Sydney Bristow  they all have echoes in Veronica Mars, yet the show is far more than just a clever knock off. It's a genuine original! And I for one, hope that audiences will give the show the support it deserves.<br/><br/>Give it a chance!","568 out of 1,048 found this helpful.",10.0,28 November 2004
715,Veronica Mars, TV history in the making,"Veronica Mars is a fantastic show - the greatest since Twin Peaks. I feel very sorry for those who can't appreciate its incredible acting, suave and wry humor, amazingly detailed storytelling and hyper-complex characters. The massive amounts of angst and intensity among these high schoolers is the only unrealistic (or rather, surrealistic) aspect of the show, and it is forgiven because this is an superbly crafted exercise in stylized fiction and symbolism.<br/><br/>The names, for one thing - Neptune, Tritons, Mars -, are not only planetary, but mythological. Neptune is a cold, distant place, but reluctant gods of war inhabit it. Keith and Veronica Mars do not instigate war, but when others declare it on them, they prove supremely good at it.<br/><br/>The show represents one of those very rare couplings of a great concept, great writing and great directing with a remarkable actress who totally ""gets"" the whole complex atmosphere of it, and can act the part perfectly. Kristen Bell is an incredible actress (I, for instance, became aware of this show solely because I took an interest in Bell after seeing her tiny but impressively acted part in the movie Spartan); she has every conceivable facial expression completely nailed, and on top of that she is also fabulously gorgeous - all the more so because of her obvious intelligence.<br/><br/>Veronica Mars is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the two best American TV-shows I've ever seen, and my rating of it would be 9 or 10.<br/><br/>This show WILL go down in history as a timeless TV classic.",201 out of 358 found this helpful.,8.0,12 September 2005
716,Veronica Mars," Clever writing, wonderful acting, great story lines...","Veronica Mars is a cleverly written show that is unlike anything else on TV. The format is simple, yet the story keeps you engaged. Kristen Bell is the star and she is perfect in her role as the teen-aged detective. The story lines are crisp and always move along. You won't be stuck for seasons (as is the case in some shows) wondering when the story will move along, when the clues will all come together, and when resolution will come. Veronica Mars manages to find a mystery, keep you entertained with subsequent smaller mysteries, keep you intrigued as you find the clues throughout the season to the arc mystery, and wrap up the case. Though the show can lose focus at times with too much going on, it all will eventually be wrapped together and the writers really do learn from their mistakes, can admit that, and subsequently make amends. Hopefully, the show will find a much bigger audience and better schedule (not going months without airing) with the move to the CW. While the show has an often revolving door of supporting characters, the dynamic between Veronica and her father (Enrico Colantoni) is one of the best on TV. Also, throughout the seasons Jason Dohring has emerged his Logan Echolls as a breakout character (and the third most important) who has incredible chemistry with Veronica. These three actors are perfect in their roles.",118 out of 205 found this helpful.,10.0,31 May 2006

718,Veronica Mars, Jason Dohring steals the show,"I just finished watching series 1 of Veronica Mars. I really enjoyed the smart, kick some butt female character. It was very timely because I was feeling a bit down and it was a fun pick me up, and actually did help me to feel more confident (you get your inspiration where you can :)<br/><br/>The stories were all entertaining, and there is a good mix of mysteries that last an episode set against the series long mysteries. Almost every episode a new character is introduced, and then tends to pop up in the story now and then, which keeps it interesting.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the look of the show and set design. I would love some of the art work and furniture from the show, especially the large photo of framework that sits behind the couch in the Mars P.I digs.<br/><br/>The star for me was Jason Dohring, playing Logan.

719,Veronica Mars, This show is fantastic...I urge you not to see it!,"I have just finished watching all three seasons of this show, and I have to say, I've had better times. I've been moping around the house all day reading reviews, watching (mostly bad) fan made videos and thinking about Veronica Mars and how I'll never see her again. This sounds awful but this is the worst break-up I've ever had, honestly it is!<br/><br/>The thing is not that it ended, it's how it ended. Surely the creators must have had some idea that there might not be a season 4 so why not tie up some lose ends, let us go easy, give us some closure. The only character who got closure was Sheriff don Lamb and it was done so well that I felt sorry for him. Why wasn't this honor extended to the other, much more important and well loved characters? <br/><br/>The finale not only did not feel like a finale, it didn't even feel like a season finale. It looked like as season 3 progressed they were grappling with different formulas, desperately trying to find something that works. I don't think that what they did was half bad, I enjoyed the last few episodes as much as the rest, but by the end it was clear that there was no plan and they were making it up as they went along. It had to end and it was a bit messy. It left me with a bad taste, instead of remembering Veronica firing clever quips with her dad and Logan I'm picturing her walking in the rain, sad and disappointed. <br/><br/>I always thought Veronica as well justified in all her dubious decisions and dealings but what she did in the end was, well, a bit bitchy (hence the name I guess), and she didn't have time to redeem herself with her dad, with her friends or with us.<br/><br/>It was good while it lasted, but it left me heartbroken. Watch with caution and prepare your ice-cream.<br/><br/>Oh...I was so eager to get over with the girl talk that I almost forgot to mention that this is an excellently written, wonderfully acted, impeccably executed series. Kristen Bell carries the show but what makes this series what it is, is that the cast is great all round (except for a cameo by Paris Hilton, but it's forgiven).

721,Veronica Mars, Latest season is a let down (in more ways than one),"The latest season of Veronica Mars started with great promise with a slightly more sophisticated plot than the earlier seasons (Veronica was compelling as a teenage PI) but the actual cases were often half-baked and only the charisma of Veronica and her band of merry allies made it compelling. The movie was a gift to fans (who paid for a big part of the movie via a kickstarter) and it wasn't great cinema but at least the writers made an effort to bring the characters and give them meaningful moments.<br/><br/>Sadly that approach was abandoned for Season 4 which focused on a big mystery (which wasn't such after a while since it was easy to guess where things were headed) and most of the regular characters around Veronica got tiny and meaningless parts from Wallace to Weevil and Logan himself who seemed more of an obstacle than a character. Mac wasn't even there as the actress couldn't be bothered seeing how marginal her character's role was.<br/><br/>Finally and to add to the season's failures, a major character dies out of the blue (and offscreen) just because that's all the writers could think of to make Veronica grow apparently. Seems a bit of an overused device since Veronica's earlier 'growth spurt' followed her own best friend's murder... Lazy writing which frankly makes me skeptical of a (still to be confirmed) fifth season... The writers seem to be banking on Veronica Mars becoming a noir show rather than a teenage show but I think they are going to be sorely disappointed... There are plenty of great noir TV shows with great writing and acting such as Bosch and as popular as Kirsten Bell is, alienating a large section of the Veronica Mars fanbase, is likely to limit the future prospects of the show.",14 out of 20 found this helpful.,3.0,28 July 2019

725,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, My all-time favourite TV series,"Of all the shows, I believe that ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" is the one with which I can most identify with, since I have surely seen every single episode at least a dozen times - and yet it STILL never gets tired! I cannot get sick of this show, and it's making me a bit disturbed! Just what is it that makes this show so continually appealing, even around seven years since its final episode? I'm not sure...it's certainly not just one element. Every part of this show is magic: the wonderful acting from all involved; the witty (and often painfully hysterical) one-liners and banter between characters; the hip, cool atmosphere; the music...it all perfectly fits into what has to be one of the most remarkable and well-made sitcoms of the '90s.<br/><br/>I find myself shocked sometimes at the number of people who have totally forgotten about this show. Granted, it DID end in 1996, and obviously a lot has happened since then (most notably the skyrocketing music &amp; film career of a certain lead star), but I mean, come on! This show is an undisputed classic! Who can forget the wild, crazy, and just plain amusing adventures we've had with Will Smith and the Banks family?<br/><br/>There were times when I was just addicted to this show, I remember...it was a while back when the episodes were running in syndication every evening on TBS SuperStation...I can't believe how this show can always manage to crack me up. It's incredible. I've grown to love all these characters so much, and even now, I still wouldn't pass up an opportunity to watch yet another priceless rerun.<br/><br/>I agree, though, that yes, a lot of the late, LATE episodes (around the second-last and final season) had their fair share of groans, and showed some glaring signs of tedium, but thankfully, the overwhelming positive qualities of the series tower over such minor flaws - including the mysterious re-casting of Aunt Vivian's role from Janet Hubert-Whitten to Daphne Maxwell Reid; the increasingly old-hat shtick of using the same stock footage whenever Jazz gets thrown out of the Banks residence for the umpteenth time; the cursed addition of a new cast member - little Nicky Banks (Ross Bagley), etc....<br/><br/>It's not an entirely perfect show, certainly (but then - what show is?), and it has had its fair share of ups and downs in its moderately impressive run of six years. However, when all is said and done, in the end, this show can proudly stand on its own as a pop culture treasure. It has evolved from what seemed initially to be an awkward, cheesy, quaint little '80s/'90s Cosby rip-off to a mature, slick, and fabulously written/produced/directed program. Pure gold is what this show is. <br/><br/>A truly underrated, and always entertaining, gem. ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" is one for the ages.",147 out of 164 found this helpful.,,10 September 2003
726,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Still fresh after all these years,"I like to think of ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" as a memorable rap song from a time when it wasn't afraid to be creative or witty. Think of a song by Public Enemy, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, or hell, even The Fresh Prince's duo with DJ Jazzy Jeff (who guest stars frequently as Jazz), as the two were known back in rap's Golden Age as DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince.<br/><br/>Of course, this show flourished during a time when rap was still good, and I can't help but make comparisons to the hip-hop community. There is no question that Will Smith is a born entertainer, and he got his break in stardom outside of hip-hop with ""The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air."" In it, Will Smith pretty much plays Will Smith (I bet creators Andy and Susan Borowitz had a lot of difficulty thinking up that name), a Philadelphia ghetto youth who gets shipped out by his mother to the posh excess of Bel-Air to live with relatives - The Banks.<br/><br/>Once out there, he finds rivalry with cousins - the preppy Carlton and airheaded would-be blonde Hilary Banks (Alfonso Ribiero and Karyn Parsons), young cousin Ashley (Tatyana M. Ali) emulates Will's hip-hop attitude, and Aunt Vivian (alternately played by actresses Janet Hubert-Whitten and Daphne Maxwell Reid) keeps husband and successful lawyer Uncle Phil's (James Avery) head cool when Will gets into trouble. To keep everything tidy and in order, their loyal, sarcastic British butler Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell) is there too.<br/><br/>It's still fresh after all these years. It never fails to stir up careful, thoughtful, moving, and intelligent laughs from the viewer and I'm surprised I avoided it for so long.

728,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Hilarious comedy that everyone can enjoy,"This show is my favourite show on nick@nite. It's the only TV show that really makes me laugh. Of coarse that's only one great aspect of the show's magical touch of comedy. The acting is great and the show's characters each have their own individual and comical personality that the viewer may relate too. The storyline of the series is quite interesting. A city boy, Will Smith who was born and raised in West Philadelphia was sent to live with his rich aunt and uncle in Bel-Air.<br/><br/>The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air is a show you'll never get tired of. The attitudes of each character only builds up the humour. Carlton, the geek who thinks so highly of himself. Hilary, the stuck up brat. Can't forget Geoffrey the butler with the wise Aleck attitude and many more.<br/><br/>All in all, The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air is great fun and laughs for the whole family",50 out of 58 found this helpful.,10.0,21 August 2007
729,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, First-time experience - well worth it!,"OK, so I never watched this as a kid growing up. I was into manga, nickelodeon, Disney etc. However, now I am 25 i decided to go through all the TV shows I missed whilst growing up and this was one of them. Boy oh boy, I was not disappointed. Despite the last show being run over 20 years ago, this comedy is well worth the watch. Will Smith is obviously the star, but the performances by every single person in the Banks family was memorable. Some episodes were there just for the laughs, some were slower and some had serious learning reflections. The latter is what made this show stand out. Going from an episode that made me laugh to one with a serious message of gun control or racism sets this show apart from the majority of sitcoms. It was, well, a fresh experience. <br/><br/>One of the few gripes I had was that some of the jokes were repeated many, many times. It did start to grate on me when Will would say ""You know what I'm sayyyyyiiinnnngggg?"" in that characteristic tone. The other thing that slightly annoyed me was the re-casting of Vivian. I understand why it happened, but I just do not think the replacement was anywhere near as good.<br/><br/>Other than these minor points, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this show from S01E01 to S06E24. If you have not watched this show before, you should. If you have seen this show before, you probably should watch it again.",17 out of 19 found this helpful.,9.0,4 February 2017
730,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, THE BEST COMEDY OF ALL TIME!!!!!,"I absolutely love this show! I cannot ever recall an episode in which I did not laugh. Will Smith is so hilarious, everything he says always cracks me up. He also has this way of making eye contact with the camera whenever he's done something stupid or did something clever. I love the way Will always picks on Carlton and Uncle Phil. Will Smith, I think he's one of the best megastars in the world today. Vivian (Daphane Maxwell Reid and Janet Hubert Whitten), both portrayed the character excellently I must say. Carlton, what can I say? He always cracks me up. I'll never forget the episode where he and Will were imprisoned and Carlton started freaking out, wow, man, I literally fell down laughing away. Ashley (Tatyana Ali) I love her character. Uncle Phil (James Avery), he's a lawyer turned judge and a father who teaches good moral values to his children. I love his character. There is also Geoffrey. Wow, he is the most sarcastic butler around. He always makes fun of Uncle Phil and boy do I get off with laughter whenever I see him. But the show only had one problem and that was the character Hilary. No offence to Karyn Parsons whom I think is a beautiful and talented actress but the character of Hilary was seriously messed up. Here you have a 21 year old woman still living with her parents and won't go out to look for a job. All she concerned with is the way she looks. I think Hilary was the most annoying person on show. I HATED HILARY. She shouldn't have been like that. Gosh, everytime I had to see her, I would switch the channel until that part was gone. But nevertheless, I still loved the show. I've been watching the reruns since 2000 and I must say, I never get fed up of it. I look forward to it EVERYDAY. I was surprised that it was not included on RANK's Top 25 comedies of all time. This show should have at the top. If anyone does not think this show is funny, then something must be wrong. If I feel depressed and need a good laugh, all I have to do is watch this show and get tonnes of jokes. I wish they would have like the whole 5 or 6 seasons on DVD or VHS so I could go buy it.

The Banks family had the uncle of Will that was Philip (James Avery) a successful attorney who knew all about the problems a black man faced in a white society. The Banks had two daughters who I describe both as being just as sexy and beautiful as ever first the oldest and spoiled Hillary (Karyn Parsons) and the youngest the pretty Ashley (Tatyana Ali). The Banks family always had to deal with problems in life and had fun of it in the process. The theme song by Smith and partner Jeff Townes ""Parents Just Don't Understand"" said it all.

And what would the show be like without Geoffrey's sarcasm? The witty butler always has some smart alek thing to say. The smartest people and consequently, the least humorous are Phil and Vivian and Ashley. And even they are pretty funny. That just goes to show you how funny and creative this show truly is. My favorite character would have to be Will because his humor and sarcasm are priceless.

742,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," After all these years, it's still Fresh!","The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is a hilarious family comedy show full of laugh-out-loud humour and plenty of heartfelt dramatic moments that anyone can enjoy, in the same vein as Keeping Up Appearances (another brilliant comedy show). I've literally seen this show so many times, I basically know it like the back of my hand.<br/><br/>This sitcom is filled to the brim with so many witty puns and sarcastic quips, that it'll leave you wondering how they where able to think up such creative jokes. One might even say it manages to subvert your expectations in a way you'd have never thought of before. Some of the more mature jokes like the innuendoes and double entendres will go over younger viewers' heads and keep adults laughing their heads off. The opening credits montage is accompanied by an upbeat jingle which lasts throughout the duration of its very addictive theme song.<br/><br/>Good humour is all about precise timing when it comes down to the comedic line deliveries and by letting the humorous moments flow naturally from the whacky events of the scenarios and situations the characters inevitably find themselves in, whereas bad humour will always feel as if it's being forcefully put in, which seems to be the case with just about nearly every stupid modern comedy film in recent years, pandering to a demographic of people with low attention spans by rapidly shoving in a bunch of dumb unfunny jokes to keep them amused. This just goes to show that it's still a funny sitcom after 3 decades and proves the '90s had much better comedy writers than we have nowadays.<br/><br/>Will Smith was perfect at playing an overacted version of his usual wise-cracking self. Alfonso Ribeiro was spot on as the innocent-minded, lovable and huggable Carlton. James Avery was great as the stern but caring father of the household, Uncle Phil. Karyn Parsons was a little annoying at first as the spoiled and self-centred Hilary, who acts like a selfish dumb blonde over the course of the whole entire series, but she soon grows on you. I have mixed feeling about Tatyana Ali as Ashley because on the one hand she was really sweet and adorable as a little girl in the first season but by the sixth season, when she fully matured from a moody adolescent into an incredibly attractive young woman, I thought she was extremely hot. DJ Jazzy Jeff's inclusion on the show may have started off as a running gag but he quickly evolved into a prominent recurring character who became a mainstay for the rest of the series. The stand out character for me would have to be the Banks' faithful butler Geoffrey, who is not the slightest bit afraid to openly speak his mind and has a very dry sense of sarcastic humour in contrast to the rest of the main cast's lively comedic performances.<br/><br/>It's fun, feel-good, family-friendly entertainment that's fit for people of all ages (and believe me, I should know). So what more is there left for me to really say about this other than just telling you to ""give it a watch, because I guarantee you won't be disappointed"".",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,5 February 2020

744,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Lets face it....Carlton rocks!,"Say what you will about this show. And don't get me wrong, the cast was so good together. But much like Don Knotts during the Andy Griffith show, Alfonso Ribiero was way underrated, and I'm not sure why. The writers put Carlton on paper, but it was Alfonso Ribiero who breathed life into the little geek. I had never watched Fresh Prince until about five years ago and then it was on Nick at Night. Now I always make sure to watch.<br/><br/>I can remember the first time I saw the ""Carlton Dance"".....it was hysterical. And there was on episode where Will actually danced with Carlton. I was rolling on the floor. Tonight Tom Jones actually made a guest appearance as Carltons Guardian Angel....loved it, absolutely loved it.<br/><br/>So next time you are flipping thru the channels, stop on Fresh Prince and check out Carlton. And remember what I said about Alfonso. The writers may have envisioned Carlton, but it took Alfonso to make me, a forty two year old mother of one, in the mid-west, a fan of this show.

745,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Hilarious! This is without question Will Smith's best work.,"Before there was ""Just the Two of Us"" or ""Gettin' Jiggy Wit' It"" there was ""Parents Just Don't Understand"".  And before Will Smith was a Bad Boy or a Man in Black, He was THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR.<br/><br/>To me, this light-hearted sitcom represents the high point in Will Smith's career.  His more recent films are amusing, but they'll never match the sheer hilarity that this series had going for it.  Similarly, Smith's music post-FRESH PRINCE is decent, but it's nowhere near as fun and fresh (pardon the redundancy) as it was when he was layin' the beats down with DJ Jazzy Jeff.  This is not to say that Smith's career isn't a successful one--not by a long shot.  But the more profitable his work becomes, the farther it strays from his roots, and the more apparent it becomes that he has no plans of ever reviving his old-school styles.  I guess the days of Carlton, Vivian, Hillary, and the rest of the charismatic cast are forever over.",13 out of 21 found this helpful.,,26 June 2003
746,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, The Mystery of the two Vivians,"There was a mystery surroundings the two actresses who played Will Smith's mom on the ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"",which was in my book a top rated Monday night staple during its six year run on NBC-TV(1990-1996). However,it was one of NBC's top rated Monday night lineups during the early 90's with shows like ""Blossom"",which came on right after it and was in the ratings top ten for most of its run,which had a huge African-American audience tuning it each week to see what Will Smith would get into next. It was a all-out hilarious show. However the mystery surrounding this was explained in a documentary that was seen on the E! channel called The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air Story. It had candid interviews with former stars Will Smith,James Avery,Janet Hubert,Karyn Parsons,Tatyana Ali,Alfonzo Riberto,and Joesph Marcell.The situation had something to do with a contract dispute and there was tension of the set between Smith and Hubert during the shows' fourth season which in turn she was dropped from the cast and replaced in the shows' fifth season by actress Daphne Maxwell-Reid(the wife of WKRP in Cincinnati star Tim Reid). However,the final episode resulted in its cancellation in 1996, which in turn brought Will Smith from rapper sensation to international status as an Hollywood actor who was nominated for Best Actor Oscar in ""Ali"". As for actress Tatyana Ali(who played daughter Ashley Banks),she has a recording contract with Qwest Records and had a smash #1 hit album during the shows' run which was produced by Quincy Jones and Will Smith, and is planning a follow-up to her debut CD,which will produced by Janet Jackson(you go girl!). As for actor James Avery, he went on to become a lawyer after the series went off the air on the UPN series ""Sparks"",and can be seen on the CBS military drama ""JAG"". Alfonzo Ribero,who got his start opposite Micheal Jackson in the Pepsi commercials during the 80's and was a regular on another NBC series called ""Silver Spoons"",went on to star opposite LL Cool J in ""In The House"",and now can be seen on the syndicated musical variety show called ""Your Big Break"". As for the other actors like Joesph Marcell(who played butler Jeffery),and Karyn Parsons (who played spoiled brat Hilary),and actress Janet Hubert..well that remains a mystery for the moment.

This is cool comedy, there's no swearing, and the series tackles a lot of different issues.<br/><br/>This show has six seasons hence being around for 6 years, the season finale episode has Will talk about wanting to stay out there in Bel-Air to finish school, this aspect is a bit over the top, he's been going to school for 6 years, what on earth was this young man studying? Is he going to medical school?!<br/><br/>I'm glad that Netflix UK has made all six seasons available. Whenever one feels like something lighthearted, it's there. The difference between the 90s and even the early 2000s and now is that this show is not that funny anymore, but it's still watchable, there's still some funny dialogue and funny moments at times, but it isn't as humorous as back then.<br/><br/>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air is one of the rare sitcoms that can pull off serious dialogue and serious scenes as well as bringing the comedy straight after.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,29 November 2017

749,The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," The Fresh Prince is up there with Sanford and Son, The Cosby Show as one of the all-time Black US sitcom greats","For all of Will Smith's film efforts, it will be the global success of Fresh Prince of Bel Air that made him the Hollywood star that he is right now. If you discount the last few seasons, where it went downhill and the cast changes such as Daphne Maxwell Reid as Vivian and the added addition of the young Nicky Banks had taken place, the Fresh Prince has been undoubtedly one of the very few black sitcoms to make an impact on mainstream television. Not just in the US &amp; UK but other parts of the world as well.<br/><br/>For the exceptions of Ali and The Pursuit of Happiness, Will Smith's performances in the film world will always pale in comparison to his namesake character in this rip-roaring comedy, which for the good part of 4 seasons, was funny and consistent.In addition, the efforts of James Avery, Alfonso Ribeiro and Joseph Marcell should also be commended and for being able to provide this show plentiful of laughs and some interesting moments. <br/><br/>I am somewhat surprised that Alfonso's career hasn't taken off in the same way as Will's, especially as he was just as talented as entertaining as Will himself on the Fresh Prince. I do think the sitcom did fall apart slightly when some of the story lines got too serious for its own liking in the last 2 seasons. Though the one character I disliked more than anyone else on this show was Hilary- she was so stuck up,materialistic, wooden, shallow, spoilt. She was basically a dumb blonde stereotype, although I sort of understood the writers purpose of putting her in the show; as in to present to us that in Hilary she is an example of a person, where with money and wealth, and that having enough money and wealth doesn't mean people should respect you, if you don't have the right attitude to go with it. And yet the attitude she had was one that had 'me, me, me' written all over it, which of course is wrong.<br/><br/>TFPoBA is and was an excellent sitcom and the ending in the show's finale in the sixth season was a fitting and appropriate way to end its 6- year run. Even though it did suffer a few minor mishaps in the last few seasons, this was still a great show. One of the all-time successful US black sitcoms to ever air on TV, it was hilarious and almost flawless.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,25 June 2007
750,The Good Wife," Best New Drama of the 2009 Season! ""Fellow Men"" take note: This is NOT your standard ""woman scorned""","This wonderful new series, takes what I felt was a dubious premise, and instantly turns it into entertainment gold.<br/><br/>I'd never liked ""ER"", though Margulies has formidable talent. Given the right character, script &amp; director, I felt certain she could deliver. In The Good Wife she does. Her distinctive ability lies in nuance, &amp; here she is finally given the perfect vehicle.<br/><br/>The scripts as well as the entire cast, take directions you'd never expect. That's is the real appeal of the show. Archie Panjabi is a spiffy surprise as the ""investigative assistant"", if you will. She approaches her character as if she's the entire supporting cast of ""Shark"", (James Woods 2-season crime drama) rolled into one easy-on-the-eyes, package. She's tough, loyal, funny, &amp; adds to the show's depth.<br/><br/>Kudo's also, to veteran Christine Baranski for playing her ""been-everywhere...done everything"" role in a fresh way she seldom has in recent years. <br/><br/>I watched the first episode with my wife.. (ok, FOR my wife) not expecting much at all. Boy, was I surprised. Subsequent episodes have been exponentially better, richer, &amp; have demonstrated that THIS show simply refuses to go down already beaten paths. I really love that! I have yet to be able to predict anything at the beginning of an episode, as I can with just about any other major network drama. This show is a TV page turner...<br/><br/>TGW is at once touching, topical, intriguing, even funny. Example: The courtroom judges are not your ""standard-TV-crime-show-judges"". They always prove to be yet another surprising element this show takes advantage of. In my opinion, this is the show's greatest strength. There ARE obvious choices at every turn in the story lines, the characters, even directorial choices, but NONE are ever followed. Prepare to be entertained and surprised.<br/><br/>Rare in this era of formulaic crime dramas... formulaic everything on TV, ""The Good Wife"" deceives slightly, even in it's title, which almost caused me not to watch what I figured was going to be ""chick-flick-TV"". Males take note. This is simply a great show &amp; will not disappoint.<br/><br/>Everything in it is fresh, imminently watchable, &amp; the result of great creative effort to not be just another law-oriented drama.

751,The Good Wife, One of the best legal dramas I've ever seen - compelling viewing (Review updated May 2012),"First post. Thanks to other IMDb reviews, I decided to give The Good Wife a try. And boy I was not disappointed. Julianna Margulies leads a stellar ensemble cast, the acting and script writing is near-flawless, and the weekly stories are believable yet not over-the-top. A nice almost Thriller main storyline flows throughout the episodes, adding a compelling undercurrent to what could have been just another legal drama.<br/><br/>The Good Wife examines the lives of legal professionals as affected by their cases and work circumstances. It certainly does not mirror the style of any other legal drama in style, timing or episode structure, and I believe it has found a well-deserved niche of it's own on current high-quality television drama.<br/><br/>I highly recommend you watch this series if you enjoy fine acting and tight, coherent and interesting story lines.<br/><br/>Greg PS. Thankfully there is no ""This is based on a true story"" etc. tag-line to distract the viewer from the scriptwriters obvious prodigious talents, and a very enjoyable hour of weekly escapism!<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 1st May 2012 Review Update (no spoilers): ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>I have just finished watching Season 3. Literally sitting on the edge of my couch. WOW!. Since my original review this fantastic drama has grown in depth and breadth - I can now place it (almost) with Deadwood, Dexter, The Walking Dead, Battlestar Galactica and Six Feet Under as an all time television great - no exaggeration. <br/><br/>The interplay between characters (of whom the depth is truly 3 dimensional) is complex, yet does not try to confuse the viewer in an attempt at narcissistic scriptwriting ""greatness"" (We all know shows that do that). It just flows. <br/><br/>Amongst the stellar cast, my favorite character would have to be exotic and mysterious Kalinda Sharma, played by the mesmerizing Archie Panjabi (2009 Emmy award winner for best actress, and Chopard Trophy winner for the phenomenal 2007's ""A Mighty Heart"").<br/><br/>Subtle humor is so well crafted and acted, you are guaranteed at least one belly laugh per episode; these become almost a small gift from the writers - an (we want these characters to resonate with you) unexpected and welcome tangent from the often serious, sometimes even chilling story lines.<br/><br/>Truthfully I can't recall one episode where I reflected ""gee that was a bit dull, I guess they had to do that to pad out the season"". Forget the usual clichéd formula episodes from the Scriptwriting For Dummies handbook - you won't find them here. No lame flashbacks, no ""24 hours earlier"" and no musical/costume themed episodes here thanks. Just gritty, compelling and eminently enjoyable television.<br/><br/>The Good Wife is simply superb.",117 out of 137 found this helpful.,9.0,2 April 2010
752,The Good Wife, A show about politics,"This is not a family/drama series.<br/><br/>This is an intelligent and well written series about politics and the law.<br/><br/>The system, if I may.<br/><br/>The character developments are great, indeed, but the focus of the series is not on the main character as a wife or parent - but as a lawyer, and the cases her firm handles. Her struggles with her husband becomes another way of portraying examples from politics, rather than being the center of the series. With that being said, the drama scenes here and there are extremely well written.<br/><br/>This is a show that grows on you, like great series does, building up slowly - Until you find yourself hooked. It gives me the same feeling as another great TV-series, The Wire. It is also visually stunning.<br/><br/>Take your time with it, watch the whole first season. It won't disappoint you.",88 out of 102 found this helpful.,9.0,1 January 2011
753,The Good Wife, Love this Show. Hate to see each episode end.,"This is the best new show of the season. The ""story within a story"" method is used to great effect, as we follow Alicia's marital woes, the inter-office politics, the husband's efforts to get out of prison, and the family ups and downs at home. Interwoven with these ongoing plot lines, there's a new legal case to tackle each week. I find this show a rich combination of humour, pathos, romance, mystery...<br/><br/>Kudos to the young actors who play Alicia's children (Makenzie Vega and Graham Phillips). They are likable teenagers, neither bratty nor too-good-to-be-true. In fact, I think this show is very well cast overall.",117 out of 139 found this helpful.,9.0,13 December 2009
754,The Good Wife," Sexy, classy legal drama","For five years, during its original runtime, I avoided watching ""The Good Wife."" I didn't see the appeal in a show about a corrupt official and his lawyer wife. Even with the constant adverts from More Four, it just never appealed to me.<br/><br/>Then, in early 2014 I worked abroad and had no access to internet. A friend gave me the first three seasons and, after having given up on ""Downton Abbey"" during the second season premier, decided to give ""The Good Wife"" a shot.<br/><br/>""The Good Wife"" is one of those quiet shows. It's rarely melodramatic, despite the potential for melodrama in its storylines. You get a better understanding of how Alicia is doing by how much we see her drink in an episode, than how often she screams at colleagues.<br/><br/>Alicia Florrick is the wife of disgraced DA, Peter Florrick. Despite the fact he maybe traded the law for sex and drugs, Alicia continues to stick by him. She actually goes further when, due to his assets being frozen, she returns to work after 16 years. How'd she get a job? Well, her ex-flame is now a named partner at a law firm and he hires her on the (secret) condition that his partner also gets to hire a new start, with only one being kept on after a year's probation. While she deals with duking it out with a boy half her age for a job in an office that makes her uncomfortable, she deals with her husband's mess through the tabloids, the blackmailers and, worst of all, his mother. Drama, no?<br/><br/>""The Good Wife"" manages (for its first 6 and a half seasons) to find surprising and satisfying ways to remain exciting. Alicia, played by Julianna Margulies, is just such a power house of emotion and remains magnetic throughout. The creators often stumbled with the periphery characters, but Alicia is so perfectly created, from her dress sense, to her walk, to her little laugh. Even when the show dipped in the final season, Alicia remained worth watching.<br/><br/>That's not to say the side characters aren't pulling their own weight: Cary Agos (Matt Czuchry), Will Gardiner (Josh Charles), Diane Lockart (Christine Baranski), Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) and Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) all put in excellent work and each have arcs or moments throughout that often rival Alicia's ongoing story. My favourite story, involving Cary's false imprisonment, is one of the best montages in the show and it doesn't occur until Season 6.<br/><br/>Throughout the show, guest actors pop up repeatedly as judges, lawyers, family members and I don't think a performance was ever squandered. Alan Cumming, who appeared as Eli Gold, was so damn good he became a regular. Michael J Fox, Stockard Channing and Nathan lane all show up throughout the run, alongside some other surprising special guests.<br/><br/>My love of the show stems from Alicia's character arc. She's a tragic character who learns, unfortunately, that power comes with a price. Throughout the show, she is named ""good"" or ""saint,"" but as her confidence and ability grow, and as she steps out of her husband's shadow, she becomes what she hates. Despite never losing the namesake ""Saint Alicia,"" her actions from season 5 onwards see her use her power for selfish and mean reasons. What's interesting is that she never once sees herself as the villain. Not until the very final moment of the show when it comes full circle. She wants to get ahead in the game, who can fault her for that?<br/><br/>If you're on the fence about The Good Wife, I recommend jumping right on it. It's a sexy, sophisticated procedural with some stellar and exciting character arcs throughout.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,22 August 2019
755,The Good Wife," Great show, terrible ending","I can only think of worse show ending: Dexter. The Good Wife's would be number #2. And don't get me wrong, I don't always expect happy endings. But I do expect closure, and this show became a mess after a main character left. I think the audience deserved more after so many years...<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen the last episode, just don't. It will ruin the whole story for you. Just imagine a fair ending in your head and stay with it.<br/><br/>I loved the show, I really hated the ending. I kept watching the boring last two seasons to get closure, and I didn't get any.

756,The Good Wife, I cannot recommend this show enough. It is a jewel!,"Why is The Good Wife such an extraordinary show? (I write this while eagerly waiting for the fist episode of Season 7) 1) The character. Alicia is independent, but not a feminist; she sometimes fails, but she never gives up; she is deep, but witty and funny; she has principles, but is sexy; she is true to herself, but dares to experiment and change; she is wise, but you can never take her for granted. In a word, Alicia is brain, morals, fun and passion.<br/><br/>2) The secondaries. They are all pertinent, unpredictable and greatly acted characters. They give perfect balance without distracting from the main line.<br/><br/>3) The themes. The show presents very contemporary and controversial legal issues, related to seldom visited subjects such as Bitcoin money, odd consented sexual behaviors, electronic fraud, bots interactions, non-conventional marriage, new intellectual property rights, and the like.<br/><br/>4) The action. The show is always fast-paced but not frantic; lots of interesting and very gripping things happen across the episodes, which always seem plausible and well-grounded, and are a pleasure to see.<br/><br/>5) The direction and concept. It is a 23-episode per season show. Now, when many series are restricted to less than 12 episodes per year, The Good Wife keeps the fantastic habit of producing lengthy seasons, with time enough to develop both short-time and long-time parallel stories and create loyalty among fans.<br/><br/>I really like this show. It never bores me, it always delivers, it keeps surprising me but not to the point of losing the essence. I remember watching the first episode 6 years ago without great expectations, just to give it a try, and I came to love it and wait for each new season with renewed enthusiasm. Kudos for Ms. Margulies who works the magic in such a natural way! And long life to this superb show!",28 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,4 October 2015
757,The Good Wife," Compelling, Intelligent, Good Character Development","I keep under-estimating this drama; perhaps because there are no big names associated with the production of it - my mistake! This drama continues to capture me hook, line and sinker every week. I am loving it to the point that it has become one of my 'must see' TV shows. <br/><br/>The writing is strong, the acting is as good as one finds on any other hit drama show (CSI franchises, Law &amp; Order franchises, Criminal Law, etc.) and the direction is excellent. The budget is clearly huge. Given all that, this show may not win a bountiful of Emmy's although it may win for the lead actress or the support actress. <br/><br/>However, with all that is on the air these days, this is in the top 10% of all television and the top 2-3% of Drama.",105 out of 142 found this helpful.,7.0,18 December 2009
758,The Good Wife, A great drama,"I have not been watching any of the law-firm based dramas such as Law &amp; Order. Therefore I decided to give this show a try. I had already seen Julianna Margulies' excellent role in ""City Island"",which also featured the underrated Andy Garcia.<br/><br/>I was expected Margulies' portrayal of Alicia Florrick to bear a more victimized expression. What I saw instead was a strong female character - a character not stereotyped as a woman out to give a free vasectomy to every man who comes in her way. She holds her own, and does so without trying to bulldoze anyone who disagrees with her even remotely. Even the minor characters such as her children and mother are developed in satisfying detail.<br/><br/>I have only watched 9 episodes so far, but I definitely like what I see. Each episode has a definite conclusion, usually a happy one. It is possible to see the episodes out of sequence without feeling like you missed something. I give this show 10/10.",63 out of 86 found this helpful.,10.0,14 June 2010

The writers have done a good job inter-connecting the law and politics elements of the show, plus there's complicated relationships and family issues thrown in.

760,The Good Wife, The Good Wife is a GREAT SHOW!,"I have to say that I simple love The Good Wife. When I first saw previews of the show when it was starting, I was a little hesitant to watch it. Thank Goodness I watched it! I LOVE it. I am a mother of 3, and (lets say age 40+), but when I get ready to watch this show I feel like a teenager again. I wait until it is on Demand after it air on Tuesday nights, and I watch it all alone the next day. But I have to definitely wait until my husband and children are asleep. I do not want anyone to talk to me, nor answer the phone when I watch The Good Wife. This show is so great! It is not only interesting in sense of court cases of great interest, but also has awesome personal issues &amp; interests. When my oldest daughter sees me watch the upcoming previews on occasion if she is watching TV, and I say that I LOVE this show and cant wait to watch it when everyone is asleep, she laughs and says it sounds like a stupid show or soap opera. She says the title alone. But she has no idea how great this show and writers, actors &amp; actresses are. I love all the cast, each and everyone one of them. My personal feelings towards the relationship side to the show: I wish Alicia works things out with her husband and just moves on from this. She already proved to everyone that she can get herself out there, work on a great professional level, and let nothing interfere with what happen with Peter. She holds her own. I love Alicia. I like Will also, but I rather see them as co-workers and friends only. I think if the writers put them together it will change the show entirely-as referring to its title. I also love Ely Gold! His character is so great. He can do anything he sets his mind to do. I love when he told Zack's friend Becca off and threatened her when she was putting things out there and hurting Zack's family. He set her straight, I laughed at that one. He seems to be everywhere when needed. Please let him be a regular to the show, and please make him remain loyal to Peter. I also love Kalinda. I am not sure why she hated Blake the first time she set eyes on him. Kalinda has a way of getting things done as well-she is great! I love Diane, and was sad when she revealed to Ely that she will be starting her own firm-I would hate to see them all split apart. On another note, I crack up to myself when they have that lady judge who insists that both parties answer their pleas &amp; comments by saying: ""In my opinion"". I laughed at that one, and enjoy her ruling the courtroom on those days. Well to end this: ""In My Opinion"" this is one of the BEST shows on television. The Good Wife has GREAT: entertainment, drama, suspense and surprises around each corner and always has awesome endings.You also learn a few things when watching each court case. I am never bored when watching any scene, whether is the courtroom, the law firm, Alicia's home or even when they on occasion go for drinks: This is of course is ""IN MY OPINION"" LOL. Please writers, if you read this extra long review: Keep up the good work! AAA+ Show - Simply Love It!",70 out of 103 found this helpful.,10.0,17 December 2010
761,The Good Wife," A woman scorned by scandal and a sex affair, branches off to independence to fight for justice and success.","This show can certainly be relevant with all of the political sexual affair scandals of recent years. As many high profile politicians have been known in recent years to cheat and have affairs on their wives. To name a few you have John Edwards, Mark Sanford, John Ensign, and most memorable was Eliot Spitzer who cheated and had an affair with a hooker that's the theme that this new drama ""The Good Wife"" took a page from and started the book. Only later the pages turn over to new chapters of independence in which new answers and the search for justice is sought.<br/><br/>Anyway it begins set in the windy city of Chicago, Illinois as a state attorney Peter Florrick(played by ""Sex and the City"" and ""Law and Order"" star Chris Noth)resigns after it is revealed that he had a sexual affair with a escort an attractive hooker type. This was paid for by state money and bribes so he's even sentenced to prison time and this has destroyed and hurt his loving and faithful wife Alicia(the attractive veteran Julianna Margulies). Talk about a woman scorned and feeling down in the dumps as she has her two children to now raise.<br/><br/>However if you were expecting a weekly series of scandal, sex, and affairs, and political back stabbing this series branches off to another direction. After this Alicia decides to once again go back to working for a Chicago law firm where she tries cases of people who've been hurt and have suffered wrong doing. It's like she's using her anger and hurt to help others as she fights for truth and justice trying to prove the corrupt and special interests are wrong.<br/><br/>This so far is one of the better series on TV, even though you don't have to watch it every week still it stands out for the way it branched out from political scandal it proves that from one's hurt that they can become independent and fight back against the corrupt system for others who have been wronged. And it's good to see the veteran Margulies strut her stuff as she's showcasing her independence in a classy way that seeks justice and truth.",54 out of 79 found this helpful.,7.0,21 October 2009
762,The Good Wife, Soapy seduction,"If I were limiting my rating of this show to the realm of present-day American TV, I'd rate it a 9.5. It's the only show I go out of my way to see. And why? Because it's the only one that gets me worked up over the characters, in other ways than by having them murdered or suffering from some dire disease. Dramatic involvement has fallen out of fashion on TV in the U.S.--most shows are too cool to care--and so I take an old-fashioned satisfaction in becoming variously worried, relieved, angry, or cheerful about what the characters are doing and what is done to them. My suspension of disbelief is facilitated by a sharp cast and vivid direction, which puts emotional suspense and its concomitants--focus, pace, mood, foreshadowing--ahead of all else. <br/><br/>...And I have just now realized that what I'm describing, or working toward describing, is a seduction. That pinpoints the type of pleasure the show furnishes, and explains the slight suspicion it engenders. Watching it, I feel as if I'm being enjoyably had by a high-priced, attractive call girl who's very good at what she does; but it is what it is, no more. And so, though I count myself a fan of the show, I can't for a second regard it as serious drama, although it's endeavoring to pass as such. Apart from a strong satirical streak--more like marbling, really, since it runs through every part--what it is is soap opera of a fairly high order, showing genuine cleverness and feeling. Of course it bears only a tenuous relation to real life: the legal cases are resolved patly, in sudden courtroom revelations; the personal turmoils resolve themselves into neatly defined crossfires; and in between, one gets little sense of life as it's lived, i.e. continuously. What does Julianna Margulies do in her office all day? What do her kids do while she's at work? The show doesn't care much. It's concerned with the big scenes, the sweeping flourishes, the successive waves of crisis that batter its heroine.<br/><br/>Margulies' persona, probably even more than her performance, is what holds it all together. The series sets her off like a diamond, but she's the gleaming center. Somehow the actress seems universal: elegant yet earthy, modern but timeless; one can imagine her in any form in which a beleaguered heroine might figure, from Jacobean tragedy to telenovela.<br/><br/>...And so I keep watching.",48 out of 77 found this helpful.,7.0,15 November 2010
763,The Good Wife, Where it all went wrong....,"I just finished binge watching all 7 seasons as I never caught it on the original syndication. After a couple of episodes I was well and truly hooked and it's been a long time since I've been this emotionally invested in TV characters.<br/><br/>The first 4 seasons of The Good Wife are excellent. They follow a basic but brilliant formula; a legal procedural with quality background content. Each episode revolved around the law firms cases, but also had Alicia's issues with Peter and Will to add layers. Then came seasons 5.<br/><br/>The show really started to go pear shaped when Josh Charles decided to leave the show, but was made worse by the writers decision to kill off the character of Will, rather than simply have the character leave. Charles was signed on for 15 episodes of season 5, but a greater solution would have been to have him film 10 episodes in season 5, culminating in him leaving Chicago to head up one of Lockhart Gardner's new offices in LA or NY. This could have allowed 5 episodes to bring back Will when the show was wrapping up, to allow for Alicia's 'happily ever after' moment. The whole Will and Alicia story-line was enticing because it gave the viewer hope that Alicia would come through all of her heartache in a better position than she was in before. By killing off that Will, it killed off that hope. Attempts to replicate that chemistry with Finn Polmar and Jason Crouse just weren't the same (although I much preferred the Finn possibility than Jason).<br/><br/>After Will died the whole direction of the show changed. The legal procedural side of the show took a backseat to Alicia's political campaign, Cary's time in prison and the never ending merry-go-round of law firms and partners. The show lost the focus and stability which had previously been it's strength. There's a reason why some shows last longer than others. Think Law &amp; Order: SVU or NCIS. They've got a winning formula and they don't mess with it. When shows go off track and try to change what they are, it alienates the viewer. Another example of this happening recently was with Criminal Minds; as soon as that show started focusing on one story arc (Mr Scratch and Reid's false imprisonment) it became boring and arduous to watch, resulting in its recent cancellation.<br/><br/>The series finale of The Good Wife also feels like a rip off. We've spent 7 seasons following Alicia's journey, only to see her right back where she started; standing by her disgraced husband and being alienated by her friends. I think the viewers deserved more than this.<br/><br/>I felt emotionally invested in Alicia's journey, and the ghostly re-appearance of Will broke me more than it should have. It was a giant reminder of where the show could have and should have ended.<br/><br/>The first 4 seasons of The Good Wife are a solid 10/10, but the remaining 3 are more like a 6/10.",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,8.0,27 February 2019
764,The Good Wife," The Good, the Bad, and the Noisy","I recently started ""binge-watching"" this series, so my views are different from viewers who have watched the show on a weekly basis, and I am going to do all I can to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>While this show has a great cast of actors and a slew of interesting characters, there are too many episodes that rely on noise as drama. Too often, I find myself irritated by the frequency of manic lawyers shouting over each other in a court or conference room. The writers should stop relying on this device as a method of creating dramatic tension. More often than not, it merely annoys viewers and makes us reach for the remote. <br/><br/>The loss of a significant relationship gave the writers an opportunity to grow the main character in imaginative, innovative, fresh ways. Instead, they shoved her into politics against her will. I am quickly losing all compassion for the protagonist. I also find myself caring less about other characters as the story sprawls into implausible reaches. <br/><br/>Depending on what happens in Season 6, I may or may not care enough to watch new episodes when I catch up to the current season.

767,The Good Wife, sadist cynical series where evil wins and people are under the measure of egoism they serve to idolize themselves deceived by a false sense of greatness,"This series is well made but its aim is to show in good way the evil in the individuals which manage power and laws disdaining human beings. The cynicism is to paint in good way the evil so to make it gracious; also the good figures are in some way bad because they appear as pathetically hypocrite full of false goodness unable to recognize the evil in front of them. This kind of series is the attempt to undermine the evil within the hearts of people embellishing it with curiosity and morbidity. The only benefit concerns with the description of what USA are: a false evil tyranny full of false dreams by which to scam citizen based on the contempt and corruption of human life. As far as the narrative structure a lot of incoherence is present: processes ends soon; the protagonist wants to be a good state attorney to pursue honesty but during her contest helps assassins, drug system and other criminal to avoid the condemnation. Many characters and situations are ridiculous. The good directing and pace seem only to mask these weaknesses. A series to depict a cynical evil world where greedy enriched, criminal system and power individuals represent the mediocrity of the society with their useless existences which damage and corrupt the life of the whole community (""the only ""good"" message"": the system is completely corrupt and you are part of this system).",12 out of 19 found this helpful.,1.0,18 August 2017

769,The Good Wife, ..9+...only because we all have to anticipate there could be another,"Across the board every facet of this show is top notch.. writing, casting, acting, directing, production values, etc., etc. It's no fluke it is regarded as one of the best programs on television today and it can stand on its' own merit as one of the best all-time. It's extremely difficult for any show to maintain high quality on all levels from week to week.. but from season to season, it's darn near impossible. This show has well achieved this impossibility. Does it keep going.. it's hoped so.. but you get the distinct feeling that if and when it starts to slip in any category, it will come to an abrupt end. You do not want to have its' legacy in any way tarnished it's just been too outstanding to let that happen. It would be easy to single out a couple of the actors for praise, but we all have our choice favorites. It's been said television programming has been slipping over recent years, that shows are nowhere near as good as they once were... The Good Wife shatters that argument completely.

We do not interview employers, people are able to be self employed. While we do make recommendations to judges, they were far from the type which were shown on the 5/30/15 program. We do make recommendations for release at First Appearance hearings, bond reduction hearings and revocation hearings, but none as were represented. It is extremely rare for an officer will have to take the stand.

775,The Twilight Zone, The true beginning of modern Science Fiction,"Wow! Where should I start?  ""The Twilight Zone"" is arguably the greatest science fiction television show ever!  Almost every single episode is a masterpiece of modern Sci-Fi.  I feel ""The Twilight Zone"" is responsible for the way we view science fiction today...provocative, strangely eerie, and wildly entertaining.  The shows creator and writer, Rod Sterling, was a master of creating a show that caused you to stop and think, re-examine reality, consider the impossible, check the closet before going to bed, and sleep with the lights on! I watched this program religiously as a child.  Every Saturday night I had to bribe my little brother to stay up and watch ""The Twilight Zone"" with me because I was afraid to watch it alone.  It came on at 11:00 p.m.  By 10:45 my little brother was sound asleep with chocolate smeared around his mouth, and I would be alone, curled in a blanket, awaiting the next spine tingling episode.  I was never disappointed.  By the time it went off, I would usually be sitting there alone...in a comatose-like daze, staring at the static on the television screen, too afraid to turn it off because to do so would ensure that you met with some hideous fate similar to the one you just saw earlier. ""The Twilight Zone"" was also a spring board for many young and talented actors/actresses during its run from the late 50's well into the 60's.<br/><br/>Thanks to mail order companies, I have ordered and received every single episode of ""The Twilight Zone""!  It would be impossible for me to say which episode is my absolute favorite because I loved so many.  But a couple do stick out in my mind.  They are ""Time Enough At Last"" and ""Eye Of The Beholder"". If you've never watched this wonderful example of television at it's best, I plead with you to check it out.  It can be found on the Sci-Fi channel as well as various other stations via cable T.V.  There's no sex, no foul language, and no graphic violence.  But you will find a solid plot, famous actors/actresses years before before they became famous, and a story with a very surprising twist at the end that will leave a smile on your face, or, a cringe as you wake up your someone else in the house to turn off the T.V.",166 out of 175 found this helpful.,,23 July 1999
776,The Twilight Zone, A Show of Depth Well Ahead of it's Time,"""The Twilight Zone"" brought a complexity and maturity to television that had never existed before and probably hasn't been seen since. The stories were always ironic, briliant, and fascinating, and they often came with a moral lesson. Episodes like ""A Kind of a Stopwatch"", with Richard Erdmann, ""Time Enough At Last"", with Burgess Meredith, ""Nightmare at 20,00 Feet"", with William Shatner, and ""Where is Everybody,"" with Earl Holliman, dove into concepts and situations no other show would have even touched. The entertainment brought on by ""The Twilight Zone"" was as vast as the Zone itself. Its principal writers, Sterling, Beaumont, and Matheson, were the best of their era. For sheer television entertainment, nothing compares to the brilliant, heavyweight stories of ""The Twilight Zone."" TO be frank, ""The Twilight Zone"" was the first show that didn't insult the viewer's intelligence.",110 out of 120 found this helpful.,,7 December 2002
777,The Twilight Zone," When It Worked, No TV Show Was (Or Is) More Imaginative","Rod Serling's distinctive approach gave ""The Twilight Zone"" a unique character that will always keep it among the best-remembered of all classic television shows. Not only that, but it set high goals for itself, and it took a lot of chances - and not chances in the phony, trivial sense in which a lot of more recent series ""take chances"" by resorting to unnecessarily provocative or indecent material that actually guarantees them attention and acclaim.<br/><br/>""The Twilight Zone"" took chances by experimenting with many different kinds of stories and material, and by aiming to provide high-quality entertainment while simultaneously giving you something to think about. As a result, there were a few episodes that didn't quite click, and that seem odd or even dull. But when it worked - as it did a great deal of the time - no television show then or now was more imaginative.<br/><br/>In a short review, it would be impossible to list all of the memorable episodes, or even to cover the full range of the kinds of material that it used. There were chilling episodes like ""To Serve Man"", which is often remembered by those who saw it decades ago, and there were thought-provoking episodes like ""In the Eye of the Beholder"", which was also imaginatively filmed.<br/><br/>Many episodes relied primarily on a well-written and well-conceived story, while others, like ""The Invaders"", relied heavily on excellent acting performances (in that case, by Agnes Moorehead). There were occasional light-hearted episodes like ""Once Upon a Time"", which was also a nice showcase for the great Buster Keaton.<br/><br/>It's too bad that these anthology-style series went out of fashion, because a number of them were of high quality. This one, in particular, stands well above its subsequent imitators. The best science fiction, like the best of any genre or art form, appeals to the imagination, not to the senses, and imagination is what ""The Twilight Zone"" was all about.",143 out of 159 found this helpful.,,4 November 2004
778,The Twilight Zone, A Dimension of Mind,"The concept of 'The Twilight Zone' grabbed me immediately. Rather than a simple collection of supernatural tales designed to give us the willies, Rod Serling set out to utilise the often underrated medium of Science Fiction and Fantasy to put forward his social commentary on mankind. Serling's early straight drama scripts had been cut to shreds by the networks whose main concerns were keeping the sponsors happy and not offending potential viewers. This came at the price of quality entertainment and, despite the worthy targets of the scripts, it was more important for the bosses to ensure their funding was secure than it was to produce socially conscious programmes. However, by using a genre that was generally considered to hold little creative value, Serling managed to slip plenty of subversive social and political satire past the censors without them picking up on it. This was the sort of materiel that, in the 1950s, would never have made it to the screen unveiled. It exposed corruption in authority figures, it exposed the sort of weaknesses inherent in mankind that American networks are still so unwilling to portray in their country's citizens. By adding in a supernatural element Serling could suddenly comment on whatever he wanted. To the networks it was a sci-fi show, a bunch of far fetched stories about unusual people. In actuality, it was about all of us. Often the supernatural element figured far less heavily in the story than the social element. Serling's wonderfully melodramatic, wordy scripts focused squarely on his characters rather than just utilising them as two dimensional pawns overwhelmed by the story. People, their thoughts, choices, behavioural patterns and emotions were the story.<br/><br/>Just as compelling was the nature of the twilight zone itself. Although Serling offers us a long spiel at the beginning of each show describing the zone, it is purposefully vague so as to not erase the mystery. All we know is that entering the twilight zone causes things to take a turn for the unusual but in exactly what way is impossible to tell until you're in the thick of it. This is because the nature of the zone is so elusive. Sometimes it is a God like force which metes out justice or teaches characters a lesson. However, the zone's sense of justice is often distinctly skewed. Although corrupt, violent, generally unpleasant people get their comeuppance in the zone more often than not, being a good, honest, benevolent person is no guarantee that you won't end up with the rough end of the stick. This is what makes The Twilight Zone such a fascinating watch. You don't know what sort of mood the zone will be in from episode to episode. Sometimes it takes active control, rewarding the good and punishing the bad; sometimes it takes a step back after having set things in motion and simply observes the outcome; sometimes, in what often prove to be some of the best episodes, the zone unleashes its sick sense of humour on an unsuspecting innocent (the most notable example of this being 'Time Enough At Last'). It's even possible for the zone to contradict itself, such as the back to back episodes 'The Sixteen-Millimeter Shrine' and 'Walking Distance', which offer two very different outcomes for characters who long to return to their pasts.<br/><br/>More than ably assisting Serling are several other regular writers, most notably Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson. These two writers turned in many of the very finest episodes of the series and proved to be more consistently reliable than Serling (although, to be fair to Serling, they did not contribute nearly as many scripts to the show as he did). Less inclined to lapse into broad, cartoonish comedy or over-sentimentality, Matheson and Beaumont turned in some of the most famous episodes (""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"") and some of the most undervalued (""Perchance to Dream""). Matheson was to be admired for his taut plotting, strong characterisation and convincing dialogue while Beaumont frequently came up with the most intriguing (""Miniature"", ""Passage on the Lady Anne"") and plain horrific (""Long Live Walter Jameson"", ""Perchance to Dream"", ""The New Exhibits"") concepts.<br/><br/>Of course, as is the case with virtually every anthology show, some episodes of The Twilight Zone were better than others while some were just downright awful (check out the likes of ""The Mighty Casey"", ""The Whole Truth"" or ""Mr Dingle, The Strong"" for just a few examples) but when it got it right, the result was frequently magical. These beautifully made stories in gorgeous, crisp black and white, continue to thrill, delight and disturb me with each viewing. Rod Serling's mysterious but lovable humanitarian host is a hard man to refuse and when he asks me to step into the twilight zone with him, I rarely refuse.",23 out of 24 found this helpful.,8.0,21 February 2007
779,The Twilight Zone, Stop At Wiloughby!!,"This episode begins in the foyer of Mr Williams' personal and professional fatigue...This dilemma transcends the cumbersome nuisance of an encroaching mid-life crisis..It is far more fatal!!..Mr Williams is cannonaded by being under constant scrutiny at his high profile job, and this undue stress takes a toll on his physical health as well as his mental resolve...Pressure from all sides has made Williams acutely aware of his actual breaking point...This Twilight Zone episode brilliantly depicts how a man who has sophisticated Connecticut suburbia by the throat can be the well deserved recipient of self deprecating pity!!<br/><br/>As Williams is returning home from work one evening, he falls asleep and has a dream about a town called Wiloughby...In this dream the train stops at a town named Wiloughby, which is a quaint little town in the late 1800's...Wiloughby ""Where a man can live his life full measure"".. Wiloughby is a simplistic and serene utopia.. Small town America in the late 1800's?.. No flu shots, no air conditioning, no television, abhorrent racial intolerance and non-refrigerated food!!..yet for Williams, Wiloughby represents an innocence and happiness that is right out of a Currier and Ives painting!!<br/><br/>When Mr Williams arrives home, he tells his wife about his dream!!! Let's first meet the wife...She is a preoccupied virago who is consumed by material accoutrement as a way of flaunting accomplishment and success...Her brow beaten husband's accomplishment and success!! It is Chateaubriand every Friday at the Country Club and clothes from Peck and Peck just to brandish a badge of prestige, her avaricious nature is solely for the purpose of nurturing the shallow virtue of vanity!!<br/><br/>As the husband explores the conundrum of climbing the corporate ladder, the wife merely purports her husband's social isolation and emotional neglect and relegates it to indignant and precocious whining...She perceives the town he manufactured in a dream called Wiloughby, as an escapist panacea which serves as a subterfuge for averting the reality of executive level competition!!<br/><br/>Returning home once again, Mr Williams has a dream about Wiloughby and now he is determined to get off the train and visit Wiloughby should he have this dream ever again!!...Increased pressure from his job and a total lack of empathy from everyone around him intensify his desire to change his life!!...He gives his wife one final plea to support his mixed feelings about everything...This completely backfires and she makes it perfectly clear as she previously stated, that she wants no part of a man ""who's big dream in life is to be Huckleberry Finn""...It is important to note that William's wife is not impervious to what he is saying, she understands fully of what he is saying and resolutely resists it!!<br/><br/>Now being pressured from all sides to the point whereby a head vice seems like a Tonka Toy...Mr Williams once again falls asleep on the train and decides to get off at Wiloughby (The manufactured town in his persistent dreams)...To Williams, he has now entered the citadel of respite and solace...To the real world Mr Williams has committed suicide...For now, Mr Williams is in the world he wants to be!!<br/><br/>This Twilight Zone episode illustrates how being raptured up in white collar slavery can often times lead to being trounced by recrimination!! As a result, it is easy to lose sight of what is truly important to you!! Now all of a sudden, the joy of heartfelt laughter, and human compassion seem like old relics!!...A mandated life of affluence can be the insidious assassin to happiness, as well as a ruthless vitiation to a tolerable perseverance!!<br/><br/>The Twilight Zone episode ""Stop at Wiloughby"" is loosely based on Rod Serling's life in terms of the pressure he faced while doing Twilight Zone!! It is very ironic that this episode premiered on CBS the day I was born!!...Rod Serling's articulation of the social climbing America is done up to perfection in this episode!! Carrying across an idea that is prolific and socially astute in nature is difficult enough on it's own right, but when you are continually interrupted every twelve minutes by commercials about bleach detergent, chocolates that taste homemade, and Mercury Convertibles, it is seemingly far more difficult or next to impossible...Rod Serling somehow finds a way to convey his message and flawlessly...This is my second favorite Twilight Zone Episode of all time...I love it, but then again I love a lot of them!!",160 out of 197 found this helpful.,,30 August 2005

Rod Serling helped usher in a generation of paranoia and science fiction thanks to this groundbreaking show, and I'm thankful for this.

784,The Twilight Zone, Far Ahead Of Its Time And Still Relevant Today,"Just recently, I finished a kick of re-watching all 156 episodes of the original Twilight Zone series. If I were to average out all my individual episode rankings, that number would probably fall between 7-8 stars. Yet, when looked at as a whole rather than the sum of its parts, The Twilight Zone is 10/10 all the way.<br/><br/>When TZ is hitting on all cylinders, it is easily one of the greatest anthology pieces ever produced. The lion's share of the credit here goes to show creator and writer Rod Serling, who is truly one of the most inspired individuals to ever put pen to paper in screenplay format. The deeper themes about society or humanity are just as relevant now (if not sometimes more so!) than they were upon original airing.<br/><br/>It absolutely astounds me that this show premiered in 1959. That was ten years before the moon landing! I can't imagine what my grandparents would have thought about a show like this, dealing with space travels, aliens, and all manner of oddities hardly a decade removed from the Second World War and firmly in the Cold War.<br/><br/>Like I said, the best TZ episodes are treasures that will be enjoyed and studied for decades to come. Does the show have its share of clunkers? Of course. But only a true handful of episodes are truly bad. The others largely depend on personal sci-fi tastes or the time-period in which they are viewed.<br/><br/>About the only reason I would even consider dropping this from a perfect ranking is the fourth season of the show, which produced hour-long episodes. Those efforts aren't bad, per se, but are simply padded with dialogue to fill time rather than written for a longer runtime, for the most part.<br/><br/>When taking the long view, however, The Twilight Zone firmly resides in my top-five television programs of all-time. Despite premiering well before it could fully be appreciated, having to deal with the inane TV standards and practices of the era, and being constantly underfunded, Serling managed to keep everything afloat and write some of the best multi-genre material ever seen on the small screen. Whether comedy, mystery, horror, sci-fi, human drama, or any other genre is your game, you'll likely find something to enjoy in the breadth of The Twilight Zone.",8 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,7 July 2020

This woman is an enigmatic phantom who has been disillusioned by consequences, she winds up resorting to dipsomanical forms of entertainment, this means that her only form of emotional consolation comes from a bottle of cognac, apathy is suffocating her, and she is afflicted by her own personal failure!! The abrupt revelation that mendacity is your stilted panacea, and reality is her bitter cynicism, necessitates a formidable trepidation which you are unable to cope with!! This is a dreadfully candid scenario with definable features!! You are unfamiliar with this nightmarish figure, but she has an acute resemblance to you, she is warning you about yourself, and you have become terrified!!<br/><br/>This Twilight Zone episode deals with devastating disappointments which emanated from personal neglect and wanton selfishness!! You (Ann Henderson) were mirrored by the fallen angel of darkness, otherwise known as you at age 43!! You were suppose to marry Mr Right, and as a result of your adolescent instinct being one of your downfalls, you wound up marrying your childhood sweetheart, he was definitely Mr Wrong!! ..The only constant in your life is alcohol, and your stupors of disenchantment result in blaming your father for everything, hence, you are stalemated by non-productiveness, and you have become misanthropic by default.. These irrational logic patterns of yours are indicative of a banal, run of the mill, alcoholic's proverbial cop out!! Your father's estate has been run into ruin, and your prevailing domestic enmity is a crippling force to your very existence!! At the ripe old age of 18, your desolate future accosted you, and you had no way of fighting back...You were victimized by a lethargic attrition, disheveled by circumstances, and though you were born with a silver spoon in your mouth, your incredible lack of discipline and discriminating judgment has caused you to be permanently bankrupt!! Bottom line, you had a dual with adversity and adversity won!! Everything in your life has gone wrong, and now you are isolated and despondent!! This comprises the callous vilification of your miserably pathetic plight...Without question!! It is definitely time for you to reap what you've sown!!<br/><br/>This was my favorite Twilight Zone episode of all time!! It depicts the realistic tragedy of deteriorating wealth decimating an entire family!! Rod Serling illustrates how lives can easily be destroyed by making the wrong decisions!! Films like ""Dracula"" and ""Wolfman"" are indeed supernatural sensationalism, and the real horror story which receives the certificate of authenticity is Ann Henderson's life!! Yes, the monster that will destroy you is your future!! While Ann owned a racing horse on the verge of bank foreclosure, by no means, may she ride off into the sunset!! This episode has a very poignant and compelling dialog which addresses the upheaval of pecuniary dissemination!! The trend of domestic disaster in this case is resoundingly irreversible!! In 1964, television's perception of the well to do insinuated that they were omnipotent.. The reality of affluence is that once it is passed down to the heirs (Otherwise known as the overgrown adolescents) it is reduced to nothing in record time!! The Twilight Zone segment ""Spur of the Moment"" does a tremendous job of displaying such an unfortunately realistic situation!! It was made during the last season of the series!!

786,The Twilight Zone, The Shelter,"How much do we really know about our next door neighbors? The pleasant facade they masquerade around becomes a stilted and decorative shield for them when their prevailing circumstances are totally cop aesthetic. What happens though, when adversity besieges, and the obligatory veneer is stripped away? The affable camaraderie of your friendly neighborhood kindred spirit, (otherwise known as your neighbor) becomes abruptly, and instantaneously obviated with these circumstances, and now, your neighbor is now a vulgar,venomous, vile, gut-wrenching, self-absorbed- for- survival- mode, monstrous parasite! This episode ""The Shelter"" is unequivocally,one of the best ""Twilight Zone"" segments out of the entire series! While it is compared to ""The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"", I felt that ""The Shelter"" was a great deal more compelling. The intensity of the characters' excoriation was extremely gripping with the episode. As opposed to ""The Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"" where the people extracted a little too much exaggerated paranoia. The cast was very well put together, including Jack Albertson and Larry Gates. (Gates played a doctor, and was down in the basement in the ""Twilight Zone's"" ""The Shelter"", just like he was in the movie ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" ). ""The Shelter"" possesses a vitriolic contempt with which these threatened individuals harbored! This enmity is far more of a lethal arsenal than any defense weapon around. How much do we hate? What exactly is it that we are thoroughly willing to do just to stay alive? The desperation, the prejudice, the primal fears, and the scruple less non cooperation we capitulate to at the first sign of terror, becomes a grim scenario that is truly alarming!! This ""Twilight Zone"" segment ""The Shelter"" purveys an incredibly desperate acrimony which basically admonishes the entire human race. This false alarm for apocalyptic calamity with this ""Twilight Zone"" segment has encapsulated an aggregate character assassination for all of these New York suburban misanthropes who became victimized by this precariously macabre situation. You might want to look in the mirror and attempt to reaffirm the distinction between man and beast after watching this ""Twilight Zone"" episode. I did, and, quite frankly, such a situation that ""The Shelter"" brought before me, has made it very difficult for me to distinguish any comfortable dichotomy between human beings, and a bloodthirsty wolf pack!! This wry little epigram definitely put me in an frightfully horrid mood, particularly on a philosophical level! Rod Serling hones in on the rudimentary instincts of man, which are for better, or, for worse, Serling accomplishes this parody in a very successful manner too! What is the most significant aspect to Rod Serling's works is the esoteric element to them that transcends the importance of television ratings and popularity! This intriguing quality is one whereby the paradigms in which Rod Serling manifests were stunningly pertinent to the thought patterns of modern twentieth century America! I do not mean that these ideas were remotely similar to Eisenhower era conceptions, I mean that Serling pinpoints many U.S. cold war ideologies with an utterly succinct and identifiable accuracy! Rod Serling had attained such a creative stranglehold on television entertainment with ""Twilight Zone"" that it almost seemed as though programming approval from CBS President, William Paley, became relegated to the triviality of a tertiary concern! So many ""Twilight Zone"" segments were fabulous, and I feel that this episode of ""Twilight Zone"" entitled ""The Shelter"" was totally outstanding as well!!",21 out of 26 found this helpful.,10.0,7 July 2010

The Twilight Zone,"Featuring some of the most bizarre, eerie, and thought-provoking tales of the weird and supernatural that you're ever going to see, Rod Serling's ""The Twilight Zone"", from the early 1960s, has had a phenomenal impact on redefining the genres of Horror and Science Fiction.<br/><br/>This brilliant, landmark TV series, that almost single-handedly changed the way we viewed things strange and extraordinary, has so rightly earned its high-ranking position in TV History thanks to its excellent production values, and its deft blend of credible human emotions mixed generously with incredible, awe-inspiring situations, which ranged from comic to tragic.<br/><br/>These intriguing half hour episodes were all filmed in b&amp;w.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,8.0,11 October 2012
791,The Twilight Zone," If ever a series deserved to be called ""classic,"" this is it.","In Joel Engel's biography of Gene Roddenberry (an indispensable tome for anyone interested in the main names of American television, and remarkably less worshipful than the Great Bird's official life story), he relates how Roddenberry boasted that he had brought more of himself to ""Star Trek"" than Rod Serling had to ""The Twilight Zone."" The fact is, though Roddenberry and Serling are among the few TV writers to be genuine household names, Roddenberry can't really have all the credit for ""Star Trek"" - but in spite of the involvement of the likes of Richard Matheson, Rod Serling WAS ""The Twilight Zone,"" writing close to two-thirds of the series and narrating every show.<br/><br/>Say what you will about the UK offshoot of the Sci-Fi Channel, but they've done us a great service in their airing and reairing of most of the episodes (following its ragged treatment on terrestrial television). Of course there are some poor episodes - ""Once Upon A Time"" is painful, as are most of the videotaped episodes (shot to save money, but even Serling objected) - but when you've got more than 150 shows you're going to get a few; and Stephen King's fairly offhanded review of it in ""Danse Macabre"" (which seems to have influenced at least one comment here - though not a direct lift, too many aspects of it directly parallel King's words) is thrown into stark relief by his own attempts at writing for television - ""Storm of the Century"" was a three-parter that failed to compel me to return after the first part.<br/><br/>Like ""The Simpsons,"" this is one of the very few series that richly deserves its endless repeats since it went off the air - accept no 1980s revival (or even a 2002 one), and the movie can be ignored as well; the monochrome episodes are the real deal. With the scope that only an anthology can give a series, the Twilight Zone encompassed comedy, horror, romance, mystery, the works - with the central character receiving his or her well-deserved comeuppance, or getting another chance, or getting a life-changing lesson. Even when you know what's coming in the renowned twist endings, the shows can be watched over and over; the heartbreaking romance between Jack Warden and a robot in ""The Lonely"" (""I must remember that. I must remember to keep that in mind.""), the vile family who find that ""The Masks"" have changed their lives forever, Roddy McDowall's discovery that even on Mars ""People Are Alike All Over,"" the ""Nervous Man In A Four Dollar Room"" who emerges victorious against himself...<br/><br/>In every aspect from storytelling to acting to music, you can see how this made Serling's name; even some overly theatrical dialogue can't ruin it. One of the few shows still airing in this country that's almost as old as ""The Phil Silvers Show,"" long after Sci-Fi's dropped ""Farscape,"" ""The Dead Zone,"" ""Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World"" and the rest, people will still be visiting... the Twilight Zone.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,,18 April 2003
792,The Twilight Zone," The Best Anthology Show Ever...Often Imitated, Never Duplicated","The original Twilight Zone is, without a doubt, the best anthology show ever. Far superior to the 1980's version and anthology shows that came after, this is a superior TV series.<br/><br/>Each of the stories had great dialogue, fantastic plots and really creepy endings. I won't go into detail about the stories because it would spoil it-but they were creepy and thought-provoking at the same time. Some of the plots were pure fantasy at the time but now in 2003, some of the plots may be close to reality...and that's the scary thing.<br/><br/>Throughout it's history, the show's guest stars read like a Who's Who of Cult TV. You had William Shatner from Star Trek (in an absolutely fantastic episode) and there were other stars as well such as the late Bill Bixby. It was fantastic.<br/><br/>(ALERT-MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD)<br/><br/>The best story for me ever was a creepy tale featuring Burgess Meredith (The Penguin from the Batman TV show). He is a bookworm in the episode and loves spending all his time reading. He is ridiculed for this. One day, he is in an underground library when there is a nuclear holocaust above. Now, he decides he will stay underground and read as much as he wants. Then, in a horrible accident, his glasses fall to the ground and are shattered. After finally having the opportunity to read to his heart's content, he has now been deprived of his one hobby forever. Creepy or what?<br/><br/>
(END OF SPOILER)<br/><br/>All in all, perhaps the creepiest show ever. Definitely cult TV with a capital 'C.'",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,,3 May 2003
793,The Twilight Zone, A Quiet Revolution,"In 1959, network TV was dominated by pretty-boy detective shows (77 Sunset Strip; Hawaiian Eye), law &amp; order westerns (Gunsmoke; Have Gun, Will Travel), and innocuous sitcoms, (Ozzie &amp; Harriet; Leave It to Beaver; The Donna Reed Show). If little else, most of these were entertaining in a blandly narcotizing way. TV producers may have wanted to experiment, but were hamstrung by a production code that was even more restrictive than the notorious motion picture code (crime must not be rewarded; moral transgressors must be punished; the sexes must not be shown in the same bed, etc.). Perhaps more important, producers were strait-jacketed by sponsors who insisted that programming should be as inclusive as possible so as not to risk offending or ""confusing"" any segment of the audience-- all the better, of course, to sell the sponsor's product, a not unreasonable requirement, given TV's commercial basis. <br/><br/>I mention this background, because it's hard to appreciate the cultural significance of Serling's Twilight Zone without it. For the above restrictions inevitably produced a product that was almost uniformly bland, superficial, and, by most accounts, boringly predictable-- (One near exception was the series from that sly old subversive, Alfred Hitchcock.) But pity the poor writers who week after week had to search for fresh water in the middle of this much traversed desert. Because of the conformist approach, two of the biggest casualties were, not unnaturally, Reality and Imagination. For rarely did any of these shows demonstrate even a nodding acquaintance with reality as most of us live it, while what imagination was shown was, of course, channeled into safe variations on the usual. I think many of us old enough and imaginative enough at the time, knew that network programming could be a lot better than what FCC Commissioner Newton Minnow characterized as TV's ""vast cultural wasteland"". <br/><br/>Obviously, it would be a great overstatement to view The Twilight Zone as a magic cure for this blighted situation. But, Serling did boldly and persistently set out to challenge the blandness, and in the process prepare the way for greater offbeat programming. Of course, TZ never claimed to introduce 'reality' into a weekly series-- that would come later with 1971's All in the Family. However, Serling did insist upon that other missing ingredient, 'imagination'-- and by the bucket loads. How well I remember that 1959 evening when I tuned in ""Where Is Everybody?"", the series' pilot and first installment-- Earl Holliman wandering through a mysteriously deserted town, running smack-dab into a mirror, and winding up in a plausibly topical outcome. I expect many others besides myself were bowled over by the novelty of what we had seen. A whole new world of what TV could be opened up, thanks to Serling, and his success in getting sponsors to take a chance on an innovative concept. Even more happily, was the promise of more to come.<br/><br/>Sure, few of the following episodes reached the riveting level of that first installment, at least in my book. But rarely did an entry completely disappoint. Then too, after the first couple of years, the quality dropped off as scripts began buckling under the weekly pressure by falling back on old material for new variations. However, such classics from the first year as ""Walking Distance"", ""And When the Sky Opened"", and ""The Hitch-Hiker"" are among the finest dramatizations of the supernatural ever to appear on TV, and hold up as well today as in that long ago black-and-white. Of course, Serling shouldn't get all the credit. As other reviewers point out, authors such as Charles Beaumont and the greatly under-rated Richard Matheson contributed much to the series' classic standing, as did the often overlooked producer Buck Houghton and director Douglas Heyes. Still and all, it was D-Day paratrooper Serling who exhausted himself in the struggle to deliver three key qualities always in short supply on public airways-- intelligence, innovation, and insight. And for that, those of us graybeards who still enjoy a re-run or two, will always be ready with a tip of the hat to the squinty-eyed gentleman with the cigarette and the powerful belief in the liberating role of imagination.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,,24 June 2006
794,The Twilight Zone, The Long Morrow,"Almost nothing that I have ever seen on television is quite this depressing! That does not mean that I thought this episode of ""Twilight Zone"" was bad! It does mean, however, that this episode entitled ""The Long Morrow"" was very poignant! The two main stars in this ""Twilight Zone"" segment were Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing. Mariette Hartley is an actress who evokes very heart felt expressions that harbor an asserted and clarified cogency! This is a quality of an actress (or actor) which is very believable! Robert Lansing has a subtle disposition which purveys an intense and dedicated conviction throughout this entire episode.The characters that Mariette Hartley and Robert Lansing play, winds up being a situation where they encounter each other through happenstance interaction in this ""Twilight Zone"" segment. Their intuitive nature dictates that they follow their auspicious urges and get to know each other better. They decide to have an absolutely wonderful evening together regardless of the fact that he (Robert Lansing)has been assigned to a space mission which commences the very next day. This mission will distance Robert Lansing's character from the world for 40 years! As a result,all kindred spirits, and emotional cohesiveness he has experienced with everybody, including Mariette Hartley, must be abandoned and reduced to a bittersweet memory! Turns out, because of a mechanical failure, that his venture into space results in the earth aging all but a few days, while he has aged over 40 years! So now, the end result is one whereby the caprice of a space time continuum has relegated a sorry soul of a man into a plight of unprecedented loneliness!! This emotionally insurmountable tedium which comprises 40 years of festering an affection for a potential loving soul mate, has abruptly resonated into a situation where he must sever all ties, and, bid farewell. Arctic desolation has become the savage assassin which has alienated a man from societal contact, this inevitably means he has no ability to act on any love interests either!! Returning from this journey, 99.999% of all men would call in their marker and claim their love for their woman, even though she is 26 and he is 70! Love in this case is not tough, it is utterly gruesome! The disheartening circumstances are such whereby this man must let the love of his pre-isolated world go. This is a selfless act for the benefit of her well being. Such a philosophical catastrophe ruthlessly demonstrates that this is a case where love truly means total sacrifice! Idealistically phrased, she says ""it doesn't matter the way you are, nor the way I am"". More eloquently and astutely put, he says ""Oh!! it matters""!! While watching this ""Twilight Zone"" episode and being barraged with an unusually precarious paradigm, I noticed that Rod Serling wrote this segment. You have to generously indulge Serling to attain the total gist of what he was trying to say with this episode. I did, and I got extremely depressed. In this instance, I would say that depression is not entirely pejorative, rather, depression serves as a strengthening tool for fortifying my stamina as an individual! This ""Twilight Zone"" episode is outstanding, and is one of the best episodes that this series has ever manufactured! I put it up with the top ten ""Twilight Zone"" segments in all of this series' history!!",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,2 December 2009
795,The Twilight Zone, In Praise of Pip,"There are so many tremendous Twilight Zone episodes. One previous writer talked about ""In Praise of Pip"". This episode struck a chord with me. I watched the episode years ago and may have seen it another time over the years, but I watched it again during a recent Twilight Zone marathon on TV last week. Now that I have children, I relate to that episode, well, emotionally. Pip, the son, is essentially ""the only good"" that the father(played by Jack Klugman)has in his life. Yet he is helpless to learn that his son is dieing in seemingly unheard of place that happens to be South Vietnam. I as a father can really feel this helplessness and sense of grief. But what really hits me is when the son appears at the amusement park. I have asked my son many many times if we are ""best buddies"". As far as I'm concerned when my little boy tells me that I'm his ""best buddy"" then nothing can beat that. But it was emotional to hear the father ask Pip that question. It shocked me as I didn't remember that part. And I realized I may have gotten the idea to ask my son this from the Twilight Zone - I don't know. In Praise of Pip shows the connection between a father and son that may very well touch anyone. It is timeless.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,,4 January 2006
796,The Twilight Zone, Television at it's best.,"If it ever were asked, as to what is or was Television at its best, then the Twilight Zones, ""In Praise of Pip"" would be a prime example.<br/><br/>Completely void of superfluous harsh language or cheap sexual one-liners, the writing, acting and dialogue are some of the best this medium has offered.<br/><br/>The camera work even by today's standards, was timely and inventive. Never did the special effects try to compensate for content, as so much of today's productions are presenting.<br/><br/>This, and other episodes of the Twilight Zone, are examples of how well written teleplay's, with above board acting, do not require immature gimmicks to obtain an audiences attention or praise.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,,1 January 2006
797,The Twilight Zone, The kind of show that will be on TV for another century,"Rod Serling, the embodiment of ""The Twilight Zone,"" said it best: ""The Twilight Zone is a wondrous land of the very different. No luggage is required for the trip. All that is required is the imagination."" (quote from ""The Fifth Dimension"" Twilight Zone fan site).<br/><br/>Though often imitated (modern ""Outer Limits,"" Night Gallery, Tales from the Dark Side, etc.), the complex blend of sci-fi/horror/drama Serling created stands the test of time. No other anthology show has reached so deep into the collective unconscious to pull out the fears and dreams people have all over the world (and perhaps all over the universe...).<br/><br/>With most of the ""classic"" episodes being written by Serling, Beaumont, and Matheson, it is clear the writing for TZ was more focused and more creative than the typical TV anthology. Episodes like ""Time Enough at Last,"" ""Eye of the Beholder,"" ""To Serve Man,"" and ""The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street"" are good enough to be considered art. Watch the TZ marathons on the Sci-Fi channel to see what I mean.<br/><br/>

FAVORITE EPISODE: ""To Serve Man"" - While everyone knows the ""It's a cookbook"" line, I love that final scene when the man's on board the ship, about to get eaten, and the aliens send food down to fatten him up.

798,The Twilight Zone, The TV pioneer of the Sci-Fi Genré!,"This is the series that started it all, ladies and gentlemen, and it will remain a hallmark for all time as THE sci-fi show with a moral to each story, often employing sardonic humour and wit. In this age of ""show me dazzling computer effects, gore and blood, and sensationalism"", it is a shame that  the younger set seems ""bored"" by the thoughtful, insightful stories of the gold old ""Twilight Zone"". Consider this: without this first step none of the other productions that have followed in its wake would have been possible!  The sci-fi product of today, for the most part,  relies heavily  on cosmetics and special effects leaving the storylines looking like limp soap opera drivel. As to the Twilight Zone? The list of writers who contributed to this incredible show looks like a who's who of the most famous and talented sci-fi /horror writers to ever grace the pages of fine literature! The list includes such greats as Ray Bradbury, Jerome Bixby, Henry Kuttner, Richard Matheson,  Damon Knight to name just a few. The list of actors famous and unknown (at that time) is staggering! From Mickey Rooney to William Shatner and then some! Musical scores of great reknown Artists like Bernard Herrmann!! Franz Waxman!!  These are the genuises behind classic films like Hitchock's ""Psycho""  and  ""The Bride of Frankenstein""!!

799,The Twilight Zone, You are now entering another dimension...,"This series by Rod Serling is an absolute classic of American television. The stories were simple and easy to relate to, but they always ended with a twist that left you with your mouth hanging open in awe. It dealt with many of the most basic fears of men: fear of the dark, nightmares that seem almost too real, paranoia, death, and concepts of evil. Mingled with these stories are ones that are 'what if?' situations, like ""Probe 7: Over and Out"", ""Five Characters in Search of an Exit"", ""Eye of the Beholder"", ""The Night of the Meek"", and ""Time Enough at Last"". A great many of the episodes were also chill-inducing in their own right; ""Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?"", ""To Serve Man"", ""It's a Good Life"", and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet"" all played with the viewers' minds and were much more effective in scaring people like myself than the so-called 'horror' films of today. The more psychological disturbing, the better...at least that's the case for this show.<br/><br/>Serling's appearances in the beginnings of the shows only added to the mystery surrounding each player, each situation, and each object. His monologues were beautifully delivered at the beginning and end of each episode, adding a sense of the supernatural to each installment. Serling also had help from many other writers for the show, like Ray Bradbury, and with great actors of their time (Mickey Rooney, Jack Klughorn, Agnes Moorehead, and Burgess Meredith), the show will always be one my favorites as long as I live.<br/><br/>""You're traveling through another dimension, a dimension not only of sight and sound but of mind.

It would have been easy to play this scenario for cheap laughs - and sure, there are some - but Upload goes further, exploring relationships, ethical boundaries, and most of all, the blind spots in the mirror we hold up to ourselves.<br/><br/>The series has more range than you'd expect: mostly cheerful, but with moments of suspense, disappointment, and even (real) death. It reveals itself in stages, as each two-dimensional character, in turn, suddenly displays real depth. It's like watching popcorn, wondering when the next kernel is going to blow, always a little surprised by which one it turns out to be.<br/><br/>The humor is pervasive, and the writers didn't settle for (only) the obvious ""hey, remember, I'm actually dead"" jokes. The laugh-out-loud moments, for me, were much subtler - like in the news video showing a group of headless bodies as they are encountered by first responders, one of whom slips a pulse-oximeter on a corpse's finger.<br/><br/>My wife and I pretty much binged this series in about three sittings.

Those interested in fashion, makeup and pop-culture will find it instantly interesting, but beyond the obvious, you'll find a show that makes you think about life, about parenting, about friendship and about love. It is truly wonderful to see these amazingly talented people that went through hard times, but are still able to find joy and beauty in life.<br/><br/>They say Drag is the art of illusion. And isn't illusion a fantastic subject? Films like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" and ""You Will meet a tall dark stranger"" make me think so.

This show has guest judges apart from the standard judges which are Rupaul, Michelle Visage, and Santino Rice. The guest judges have included actors,singers and TV personalities. The challenges are design to test the queens and to allow them to show America why it is they should win. Acting, singing, rapping, comedy, dancing, impersonation, have all been bases for challenges.

828,RuPaul's Drag Race, The most real reality TV so far..!,"I just watched the 1st season of Repual's Drag Race and because of the positive energy this show implements; I attend to watch more Repaul's seasons. First of all, for those who compare this show to American Next Top Model and other shows of the same genre; you are wrong in so many levels since the core, for starters, of both shows are totally different. Rupaul's show focus on testing drag's surviving skills in the preforming business. Papering self make-up &amp; hair, sewing unique outfits, dancing &amp; lip-syncing, are some of the jobs assigned for the contestants in Rupaul's Drag Race because these queens are exposed to them every time they want to channel their drag persona on stage and more importantly, to themselves. In terms of human quality and productivity, Rupaul's Drag Race has a lot to offer. Being drag is not easy or safe even in our time. Drag Queens and cross-dressers has had it the hardest among the gay community considering that the majority of drag queens are gay. They put literally themselves out there for the world to judge and there are some, even among gay guys, who try to segregate themselves from them and feel repulsed by them so a drag lady has to be really courageous and develops an unbeatable character to feel strong &amp; stable against all criticism about her life. This is another value that the show is trying to bring through the course of the race. In terms of other reality TV shows, I feel that Rupaul's Drag Race is the most genuine of them all although, ironically, the concept of the show is based on men dressing as women which is should not be up-normal anymore. Rupaul is trying to deliver a positive message in his show about loving oneself which is lacking in many competition shows. I have seen a dance competition show where the majority of the contestants below 20 and the judges are emitting real sociopath behavior when it comes to evaluating the young contestants outcome, all for the sake of the shock value to improve the network ratings. Others might find problem with the tune of the show and how it represent drag in stereotypical image which is incorrect. Drag queens are flamboyant by nature and these individuals have to channel their femininity while they are in the dress and make-up so the only question is if the viewer is comfortable about which 45 min of drag and what does it represent or if the viewer really know the difference between drag queens, transvestites, transsexuals, gays, etc. As the first show of its kind, I find that the creators and the producers of the show have done a great job and if there is a little bit of shallowness, it should be with tolerable amount especially comparing to other reality shows and computation shows which are now quantity with no quality.",24 out of 39 found this helpful.,9.0,23 November 2013

However, both are just as entertaining. My favorite competitors actually happen to be the runner up in both seasons. They are very creative and diverse. However, I did love the winner from season one<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, if you like good old reality competitive TV show, with interesting and creative people, this is the show for you!<br/><br/>In all, it's like a drag version of Project Runway mixed with America's Next Top Model.

It gives a platform (heel?) for these gorgeous talented performers to strut their stuff (perhaps a bit too literally for poor Jade). It debunks a bunch of drag-queen myths (no, they don't live in drag all of the time). RuPaul, appearing in both male (dorky and adorable) and full-on drag magnificence is a perfect blend of snarky and kind; guest judge Santino Rice from Project Runway is delightfully perceptive and just bitchy enough. I fell in love with a number of amazing queens: sweet Nina Flowers, who rocks the glam/androgynous look better than Ziggy Stardust ever could; Ongina, the feisty, funny, gender-bending fashionista who reduces everyone to tears (no spoiler here); Bebe Sahara Benet, CAMEROOOOOOOOONNNN! <br/><br/>I'm deducting one star because the contestants that were eliminated early were pretty weak, and because I think there could have been a smidge more drama (Rebecca, you bore me so).

832,RuPaul's Drag Race, A great show (which has lost its way),"Every generation has its tv shows that sweep the airwaves. Rupaul's Drag Race is certainly amongst those for this millennium. It's not just a show; it's a cultural phenomenon that has brought the art of drag to the mainstream and earned countless fans in the lgbtqa+ community and beyond.<br/><br/>Drag Race is among the better reality tv competition shows because it is so fun and inventive. There's a little bit of everything in there, from fashion to comedy to acting to singing. Many of the queens to come out of the show are icons and have helped make drag as popular as it is today.<br/><br/>However, where Drag Race in the past seemed to be above the usual shady reality show tricks, in recent seasons it has become more and more unfair and seems to be more rigged than it ever was. Most fans agree that the show's peak was seasons 5 and 6, but since then (for the most part) it has been losing its way. Season 7 is famous for being a disaster, season 9 was good but the change in format for determining the winner was one of the shadiest things Rupaul has done, season 10 was messy and season 11 was the most unfair season of the show so far. Storyline and drama seems to have become the show's primarily focus, sacrificing fair judging for causing a stir. Yet, the earlier seasons did not need this to create a good story. Season 5 had the best storyline of any season and it didn't feel manufactured or forced by the judges. There was a definite attempt to replicate it in season 11, but because it wasn't natural, it didn't work. Things like that make the enjoyment for the show go down, along with the quality.<br/><br/>This does not mean the show has become awful, but it has experienced a drop in quality. The earlier seasons will always be the peak of the show and unless Rupaul changes the way things are done, I think the show will continue to go downhill.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,22 March 2020

And it's fun to watch: the 9 contestants are flamboyant and have a great sense of humor (one of them has a nickname ""Pork chop""), the style is very similar to the shows mentioned so you don't feel like you're watching a completely redesigned program. The things that are said are sometimes outrageous (""if I was a girl, I'd be a stripper or slept with lots of guys and be pregnant with lots of kids""), always a little bit shocking, and the stakes are high. There will be a lot of flirting and intimate relations ion the show I bet, but it won't be called gay sex, it will be called lesbian sex; add some famous faces to the mix and voila!

846,RuPaul's Drag Race, RuPaul's First Decade Race,"Year after year the show has been delivering a new season of this competition. Every year there are new contestants and challenges, so every season is different. Therefore let's get started with the first X seasons.<br/><br/>
Season 1: This season can be jumped, and it's probably recommended to do so. The unique thing this season does successfully is establish the basic of the reality but the winner and the filter are so boring.<br/><br/>
Season 2: Things look more pleasing for the show. The cast is more likeable, and the visual quality has improved. Some things need some changes but this is an enjoyable season.<br/><br/>
Season 3: Going up. Funnier and smarter. The cast is full of talent and most of the jokes become legendary for the history of the show.<br/><br/>
Season 4: This is where the joke gets so hilarious that it's practically flawless. The competition is increasingly formidable, and choosing the winner becomes a challenge. The gags are shocking and the storytelling is intriguing.<br/><br/>
Season 5: One of the best casting in the show. There's a moment when it's anybody's game cause they are all so talented. The jokes are better, and the lipsync is on point. This season almost achieves perfection.<br/><br/>
Season 6: The peak of the show. A cast full of talent and memorable queens but overall the most rightful winner of the show and one of the most memorable top 3 in the reality. Many good gags and flawless lipsyncs.<br/><br/>
Season 7: This is in my opinion the worst season ever, and I know that this season is full of talent like Ginger Minj, Katya and Trixie Mattel but most of these queens were good after the show, not in the season. Everything is a mess and the winner remain a polemic decision.<br/><br/>
Season 8: I admit it. I love this season because it was the first season that I follow but it doesn't possess that much talent. Just four queens are absolutely lovely in every way and the rest is just forgettable. The winner is so much better than the previous season so at least that was right.<br/><br/>
Season 9: This is the moment where the show decides to be good again and cast many talented queens. The competition is increasingly formidable again.The shocking gags are back, and they were better than ever before.<br/><br/>
Season 10: The season X maintains the quality of the previous one. The queens are talented but for the final 4 the winner gets obvious and it's not so surprising. The season is excellent but not as much as it used to be in preceding years.<br/><br/>So... Yeah, many things happen in the first ten years of the show.

The judges feel like they're at the mean girl's table and everyone just falls at the feet of 'Mamma Ru'. The insipid sucking up is really forced and so sorry to say this, but rather embarrassing for them. This has come a long way from the ballroom and the dance floors below the stacked platforms and neon stockings of the Club Kid's feet. I'm not sure what they would think of this. From something that celebrated individuality to... this.<br/><br/>There's no real work in the 'workroom' anymore and the art of it all is not what it was. I respect anyone's love of this, but maybe I've just seen something I love pass me by, into a new era I don't feel is authentic, and that's fine.

854,Godfather of Harlem, Fantastic cast and production marred by mediocre and cliche'd writing,"Crime drama genre aficionados will dig Godfather of Harlem's groove with Forest Whitaker at the helm as Bumpy Johnson, a convict recently released from Alcatraz penitentiary off an 11 year beef into a strange new Harlem that he doesn't recognize: Italian's dominate what used to be African American-owned territory and the police are more intolerable, violent, and complicit in the drug trade than ever before.<br/><br/>The cast for Godfather of Harlem is spectacular. Forest Whitaker as Bumpy Johnson is flawless, while Vincent D'nofrio as his rival Italian capo conjures up imagery of Tony Soprano in a past life. Both men are titans on the screen.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's where the best things about Godfather of Harlem end. The story, while based on real people and places, is incredibly cliche. There's nothing in Godfather of Harlem that you haven't seen, heard or thought of before -- from the stale bigoted vocabulary that nearly every character employs in their dialogue , to the tried-and-true racist tropes that litter the story ... Godfather of Harlem ultimately feels like a caricature parody of a crime drama than an actual serious entry into the genre.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth watching, just don't expect your mind to be blown in the same way that shows like The Wire or The Shield captivated us. If you're looking for an excellent black-centric crime saga to start watching, give FX's ""Snowfall"" a shot instead. Godfather of Harlem feels too infantile in its development right now to be taken seriously as a contender -- give it a season or two to flesh itself out before engaging yourself with Bumpy Johnson's world. The makings of greatness are there screaming at us loud and clear, let's just hope the people writing the script step it up with more mellifluous and less-cliched dialogue and give us entertainment worthy of the Epic moniker the show's home network is named after.<br/><br/>Definitely keep your eye on this cinematic universe though.

855,Godfather of Harlem, Very Good + Serious Flaws,"I like this series, but it is hard to watch at times.<br/><br/>A few serious flaws:<br/><br/>A period piece, from the early 1960s... with a RAP soundtrack? Big mistake. They should have used period music only. I guess they were pandering and mistakenly thought they needed modern music to attract a younger audience.<br/><br/>Perhaps another pandering tactic to reach the young 'urban' male audience (who were raised in the era of the Kardashians) is the anachronistic portrayals of interracial relationships. While there have been interracial relations since the beginning of human history, there almost certainly were non in the early 60s between a mafia princes and a kid from Harlem, nor between a rich society woman and a Bumpy Johnson type gangster.",38 out of 61 found this helpful.,6.0,21 October 2019

876,Travelers, Consider the Source,"I tuned in to Travelers with low expectations. Time travel has rarely made for compelling television. Often, it's just an excuse for moving to a new historical setting each week. (Even Doctor Who stopped doing pure time travel after the first few years and started emphasizing the ""relative dimension in space."") Travelers sounded particularly dreary: people from the future taking over humans in the present. Oh, great, a time travel story that lets us glimpse the wonders of... the present.<br/><br/>And yet, Travelers defied all these expectations and turned out to be one of the freshest bits of SF on TV.<br/><br/>It's not a special-effects-heavy show. Instead, it focuses on squeezing every drop of juice out of the slightly off-kilter premise. For a start, ""taking over"" present-day human hosts kills them. So there's a massive built-in moral dilemma. And it's worked out with painstaking logic. Time travelers try to pick people who were about to die anyway - but this too presents problems. The time travelers need to remain undiscovered, which means seamlessly picking up the threads of their hosts' lives. Time travelers may have motivations of their own, which need to be dealt with in the present. It all meshes beautifully.<br/><br/>I won't give away much more, other than to say each episode expands and twists the basic premise in a new and clever way. The acting is uniformly solid, and the characters are likable in spite of their sometimes glaring faults. The mix of characters has the feel of a really great ensemble, a group you'd really like to follow for a while.<br/><br/>What I didn't realize at first was that Travelers was created by some of the key members of the former Stargate TV team. Of course, two of that show's best writers, Mallozzi and Mullie, are masterminding the entertaining space opera Dark Matter. Meanwhile, Travelers is being put together by former Stargate writer and producer Brad Wright, with directing work by Stargate alumni Martin Wood and Andy Mikita. While Dark Matter is more light-hearted, Travelers carries on the harder-edged side of the Stargate tradition, without losing that show's uncanny addictiveness and entertainment value.<br/><br/>Even if you're not a Stargate fan, you should definitely give Travelers a chance. It's a show that really knows what it's doing. It knows how to tell stories that are morally deep, intellectually clever and emotionally satisfying, all at the same time. We've seen some really good SF on TV lately, but Travelers is the one show that I'm most excited to see more of. A LOT more, hopefully.",325 out of 353 found this helpful.,9.0,22 July 2017

879,Travelers, Superb New Series You'll Want To Keep Watching,"This is a unique show, different from other time travel scenarios, in the way it is written, acted, and how well it's produced. I'd actually call it THE new break-out series to watch for 2016. It's nice to know there are still true Creatives working in the industry who can produce a gripping, interesting program without the benefit of a huge budget or glossing every other scene over in tons of fancy CGI. <br/><br/>I wouldn't mind just a bit more in the special effects arena, but there is a Realness to the plot/episodes that manages to transcend the lack of technical effects, which let's the viewer's imagination do some of the best work. That may be the singular quality that makes it so phenomenal to watch! I also think that as this sci-fi series grows its following, Travelers could be a lot like other Cult Favorites that were lower budget but grew up --just enough-- to start incorporating a few more well-placed, topically-consistent special effects (think Lost Girl, Fringe, DW, Orphan Black, etc).<br/><br/>The plot is well-premised, based on a peek at a frightening future that is almost too easy for viewers to conjure up on their own. Travelers may be firmly anchored in Here and Now, but the Future and Past are folded into the Present with excellent story lines and smooth, logical character development. This yields amazingly restrained but thoughtful performances from the actors, including the ever-talented Eric McCormack (in, what may very well be, the best role of his career). The episodes are so subtle yet intense that each one will grab you by the brain and you won't want to stop watching. I've re-watched the pilot episode a few times now, and it still hasn't gotten old. Like a very good book, each new pass yields a little more for the imagination to chew on. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this gem of a show and truly hope Travelers gets picked up for a long, healthy run.

Nice little twists on the usual time travel situations.<br/><br/>The first episode is a little confusing and I found myself rewinding once or twice, but everything becomes clearer as you carry on watching. Even towards the end of the series, you remember odd things you hadn't really noticed or understood at the time which become clear.<br/><br/>I just cannot understand some of the negative reviews, I loved this series.

There aren't any mustache twirling villains, mad scientists or shady billionaires (as of yet) - the characters are youthful and relatable, played by a very promising ensemble of Canadian actors. The premise is refreshingly original, utilizing the idea of souls hosting human vessels rather than the physical act of time-traveling (there's no cheesy time machines here). Grant MacLaren (played by Eric McCormack) rounds out the group as a much-needed older authoritative figure.

894,Travelers, Artificial.Intelligence vs People Decision Making,"A lot has already been written about the plot, the acting and the tightness of the series. I was hooked from.ep.1 and have viewed the series several times. Oddly the small budget works in a weird way as in it lends it some authenticity though i do not the Lab def gets an update next series. The dialogues while not punchy linger...<br/><br/>What makes this one stand out big vs other sci- fi/time travel is 1. The main premise which is revealed towards the end of series 1: decision making; using AI devoid of human emotions vs people decisions which has its biases but also its strengths esp when it affects others humans. This premise is easily extended to our current lives as well what with so much data analysis tools governing several aspects of our lives. Yet when Marcy talks about 2.0 she is right in saying it wont be exactly her since you cannot teach her all.that she has assimilated unconsciously. The Director vs faction was a believable premise for me and the confusion it creates not er unlike everyday life 😃 i hope to see this conflict resolved going forward <br/><br/>2. The high degree of empathy one feels with the characters and the high quality of acting; esp.the use of facial expressions in the characters of Marcy, Jeff and David. McCormack lends the right glamour value with his stronger international profile and leadership(modest) while the younger actors do well in getting under the skin of the characters. Philip Trevor Grace Forbes Kat are now like part of the household. I do hope.the charm.of the characters continue in series 2<br/><br/>The protocols too somehow weirdly make sense.

895,Travelers, An excellent new sci-fi show,"Perhaps the viewing of ""timeless"" for me made ""Travelers"" look a bit better than it actually is, hence 10/10 rating, non the less, its easily the best sci-fi show released after ""The Expanse"" or if we're going to get into time travel genre maybe the first half of ""Continuum"".<br/><br/>Pacing is fast, there is very little idle or meaningless dialogue. Whoever was writing the script definitely had enough to go on to fill the show without having to resort to cheap dilution. Its almost as if the plot was so thick they actually had to compress it.<br/><br/>Acting is top-notch, only the FBI agent seemed to be lacking and a little out of character at a few moments, but other than that pretty much the entirety of the cast not for a second looked questionable, cringe-worthy (timeless...) or somehow out of character. Immersion was very solid. Top tier direction and scenery also helped quite a bit with that.<br/><br/>Characters are realistic and behave as normal humans would (I'd think), their decision making is rational for the most part yet there is plenty of emotion and even romance with some drama. The cast fits in well and looks good, in fact they have some very interesting roles to perform and it was a joy to watch them do it.<br/><br/>Overall this show in terms of quality of writing, story-line, direction, cast and acting can very well compete with Expanse, HBO's shows and other high end well made quality content that doesn't insult the viewer as if they were some brainless cattle that will chew up just about anything.(I'm not talking ""science"" here, you have to be a deluded lunatic to complain about Fiction in the genre of ""science FICTION"". There is one review here that does just that, he must have confused this with the documentary section) <br/><br/>""Travellers"" may lack the scale and epicness of Game of Thrones or The Expanse, but for its scope its definitely comparable.<br/><br/>Sense8 came to mind and I'd say ""Travellers"" is better so far. Its only been two episodes and I'm not easily impressed, but this show has sure made my day.<br/><br/>Check it out and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",130 out of 169 found this helpful.,10.0,26 October 2016

You are quite terrible in many ways, with some of the cheesiest special effects I've ever seen on television, and some of the cheesiest writing as well, but your story captured my imagination like no Game of Thrones has done. The friendship/romance between Merlin and Arthur is almost unbearably lovely and the characters of Guinevere and the knights still haven't left my heart. There were moments of absolute brilliance in this little family show elevated by beautiful acting that still resonate and stay with me after all these years. I would go through it all again.",156 out of 167 found this helpful.,8.0,26 September 2017
901,Merlin, Wonderful in many ways,"Years after this show has ended, I am still watching and re-watching! As others have noted, Merlin has many strengths. In terms of structure, each episode of the series contains its own mini-adventure. Sometimes, these adventures spur the season arc onwards or create consequences that characters must grapple with in later episodes. All of the seasons, except Season 1, end with a double feature that closes out the season's main danger. The reimagining of the Arthurian legend is very well done in many ways, showing that the creators have perhaps drawn on a variety of tellings of the story to create something new.<br/><br/>The lead actors are all exceptional. Bradley James and Colin Morgan have incredible chemistry - it's even a lot of fun to watch their interviews with each other, as they seem to have the same chemistry in real life! Colin Morgan is flat out amazing as Merlin, often conveying two or three emotions simultaneously and even portraying Merlin himself as an actor (as the older Emrys, as the old sorceress.) He effortlessly handles everything from tragedy (Lady of the Lake) to comedy (A Servant of Two Masters.) Bradley James is stoic, handsome, and good-hearted, exactly as we would have wanted Arthur, and he also rustles up quite a bit of feeling in certain episodes (Sins of the Father, The Wicked Day.)<br/><br/>Katie McGrath is exceptional as Morgana (and so beautiful!). She successfully charts an incredibly tricky character arc, layering tension into her character season by season. Those who claim she is too emotional or overacting in her scenes miss the point of Morgana's character - it is her very excess of passion and empathy for others that bends her from light to dark.<br/><br/>There are also great cameos from talented actors sprinkled throughout the series, including Michelle Ryan, Sarah Parish, John Lynch, Miriam Margolyes, Charles Dance, Emilia Fox, Tom Ellis, Santiago Cabrera, John Hurt as the dragon, and others. Asa Butterfield as the young Mordred is incredibly creepy and wonderful to watch. The locations are also beautiful and well imagined.<br/><br/>But the series suffers from two main weaknesses. First, the characterization and character development are inconsistent. Bradley James and Colin Morgan manage to show that their relationship has evolved due to their own talents, but their characters are not written that way. There is little growth in what Arthur sees in Merlin, and Merlin rarely acknowledges Arthur's flaws, especially his lack of judgment. The relationships between other characters are also chronically under-imagined: Gwaine and Merlin, Arthur and Gaius, Merlin and Gwen, Gwen and Gaius. Some episodes reset to zero, ignoring whatever has come before between two characters. The entire web of relationships that would support a close-knit Camelot community is never explored or used. Many of the characters are therefore rendered static rather than dynamic.<br/><br/>Angel Coulby suffers the most from this poor character development. Guinevere unfortunately only becomes an interesting character when she falls under Morgana's spell in Season 5. Otherwise, Guinevere is unnaturally obedient, docile, and strangely Pollyanna-ish. There is little reason why she should be lovable or attractive to two gorgeous and talented men and her love story with Arthur is largely unbelievable. It is also difficult to understand how she transitions so well from servant to queen, seemingly growing in confidence by leaps and bounds between seasons. In general, the show has an irritating tendency for all the interesting women to cluster on one side (Nimueh, Morgause, Morgana) and all the interesting men to cluster on the other (Arthur, Merlin, Lancelot, Gaius.)<br/><br/>The second weakness is that the series ENDS with Merlin revealing his magic to Arthur, meaning that we never see the two of them working together as true equals. Throughout, the audience sees Merlin undertaking dangerous and difficult tasks, with no thanks, but we never see the pay-off, i.e. a proper discussion/reckoning between Arthur and Merlin about the role of magic in society and Merlin's beliefs vs Arthur's beliefs. The show has to contrive absurd scenarios to ensure Arthur never sees Merlin use his magic but he also never benefits from Merlin's huge trove of knowledge.<br/><br/>This ultimately undercuts the message of the stories. The characters keep waiting for the mythical day when Albion is real and magic will flourish again, but they exercise little free will in getting themselves there. For a show aimed at young adults, getting the themes right should be incredibly important. What harm is done when you keep secrets from your friends? Why should you not deny who you are to appease others? Why should you treat others with respect and dignity? Why is it wrong to persecute those who are different from you? By not providing closure on these themes, the show ultimately ends on a rather dismal and disappointing note.",28 out of 28 found this helpful.,7.0,17 April 2020
902,Merlin, I'm still not over it,"I watched the 5 seasons in two weeks - I was completely hooked! I'm definitely going to rewatch soon as well! The secrets, suspense, magic and romance kept me hooked and on the edge of my seat! Merlin is the best character; he's adorable, beautiful, relatable and hilarious. The COMEDY literally gave me life. I LIVED and BREATHED for when Merlin did something weird or stupid! Arthur and Merlin were the best and I seriously wish there was a season six (would for real donate $2000 or my life for it).<br/><br/>I cried so hard when it finished and now I wish that I could erase all of my memory of the show to re-experience it again. The character development is amazing, plot is gripping and adventures are fun. The comedy is beautiful and the relationships between characters (especially Arthur and Merlin) is the best part of the show.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!!<br/><br/>CAUTION: If you are really into the legend of King Arthur then you might not like how everyone is young and facts are a bit altered but if you can overlook all of that then you are seriously going to love ""Merlin.""",55 out of 60 found this helpful.,10.0,6 September 2019

904,Merlin," For what it is, actually fairly good","Okay, I feel like you have to judge this show with a grain of salt. I've actually found it very enjoyable and oddly addictive, though that doesn't mean I think it's good. Yes, there are plot holes, character inconsistencies, cheesy dialogue, etc., but I think because it doesn't take itself too seriously (like, for example, Robin Hood was prone to do) it can get away with most of these things. There are moments of genuine comedy that I really appreciate, and the rest of the time I spend giggling at the aforementioned flaws. I think the cast is quite good as well: Colin Morgan is charmingly dorky as the title character; Anthony Head milks a surprising amount of emotion from a ridiculously poorly written character; and the rest (except perhaps for Katie McGrath, who can be a little too emotional) imbue their roles with genuine humanity. I especially like the growing relationship between Merlin and Arthur-- the way the show is written, Merlin's only reason for helping Arthur is that 'it's his destiny,' and Arthur has no real reason at all to help Merlin, and yet you definitely feel that they are starting to care for each other.<br/><br/>So, yeah, it's no television masterpiece, but it is fun to watch, and sometimes that's all you need.",205 out of 249 found this helpful.,8.0,15 November 2008

907,Merlin," Instant fantasy, just add dragon! ....and more","First of all, if you are a really big fan of the Arthurian legend, stay away from this one. Even I, with my superficial knowledge regarding those ancient stories, could tell that this show takes quite a few 'creative liberties'. This said, it is really a rather good show. The sets and costumes are nice (though way out of time for the historic era), the storyline is interesting with a good mixture of humor and suspense salted with some adequate special effects. After just three shows in the series it is hard to judge how much depth the main characters will be able to develop, but they are all so.....likable (My favorite being the young Arthur). There are probably better ways to spend your Saturday evenings, but if you're in front of the tube anyway, you can certainly pick worse.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>I just finished watching the ninth episode. It is hard to believe, but what appeared to be another shallow if decently made series, turned into a respectable drama show. The humor from the first three shows is still there, but as the story unfolds so do the main characters, gaining depth and subtleties and opening interesting plot opportunities.<br/><br/>Die hard fans of the legends will still not like it, as much of the underlying mystery gets a complete work-over (and the presence of a dragon sure doesn't help there), but as a stand-alone show, it certainly got me hooked :)<br/><br/>If you haven't been able to see it, because you're not from the UK and have no access to internet sources: This is definitely worth waiting for!<br/><br/>EDIT2 (a few years later):<br/><br/>Five seasons and a couple of years later I can still say that it's been a good show. Even though it eventually fed off the chemistry between the main protagonists and was weakened by the sub-par acting of what was supposed to be the main villain and antagonist, it holds its own as a work of entertainment.

908,Merlin, Bring Merlin Back -- Surely More to Merlin than 20 Something!,"I became addicted to watching all the episodes of Merlin when that's all we could do was stream movies during the Covid 19 period (spring-summer 2020). Well, I will tell you that I absolutely loved Merlin after the first Season was over and quite literally I was completely hooked. I felt like it was part of my life and family. Merlin and Arthur had such a wonderful bantering back and forth. Some things, like any family, has duplicative events. But it was so very familiar seeing it every day -- it comforted me. Then, I fell in love with the baby dragon and when I saw how horribly treated the baby dragon was by the self-loathing Morgana, it completely broke my heart. I hated Morgana even more. Why didn't she die then. B*&amp;tch!. Oh how I wish there was so much more to this series.

909,Merlin, It's Magic (sorry that was corny),"There are many similarities between Dr Who and Merlin in terms of the way they are written. Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.<br/><br/>There is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.<br/><br/>Don't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.<br/><br/>I think Merlin will run for at least another series.

Merlin, Arthur, even Richard Wilson as Gaius against all the odds, are all brilliantly cast and played.<br/><br/>In many ways this reminds me of the unexpectedly addictive power of the original Star Trek series when it first appeared - only this is far better acted, far better cast, and far better written.<br/><br/>In my opinion one of the very best new things to hit British TV screens for many many years.",119 out of 170 found this helpful.,10.0,3 December 2008

While any man would fall head over heels for the lovely Katie Mcgrath as Morgana. I was hooked from the first show and actually like it better than Dr. Who. The C.G.I. looks a little under funded at times, although the sets are extremely well done. Merlin is worth watching and deserves recognition on the prime time lot.

It was truly a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Seemingly created in the vain of ""Hercules"", ""Xena"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""Beastmaster"", this show takes it's own spin on the Arthurian legend by rewriting the tale to make it a tad more soap opera-ish.

920,Merlin, In a land of myth and a time of magic the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy. His name is Merlin.,"Wow! What an amazing, stunning show, absolutely incomparable to any other one in the fantasy genre. Being spared of all the brutality, which is common on TV nowadays, it begins as a light family fantasy show, filled with humor, and turns into a powerful drama nearing its end. Similarly, I started watching it just for entertainment, and couldn't help crying during the last heartbreaking episodes. The central figure of the show is Merlin. I was lucky to binge watch all 5 seasons and thus followed the transformation of Merlin from a clumsy lad with magical abilities into a mighty yet humble sorcerer with pure and noble heart, who never abuses his power or uses it for evil. I admire the idea of Merlin as a young man, approximately of the same age as prince (and later king) Arthur, who shows great courage, loyalty, devotion, compassion and wisdom beyond his years, always staying in the shadow but selflessly following his destiny and protecting and helping his friend Arthur in every possible way:<br/><br/>Mordred: Arthur is a lucky man. Merlin: Yes. Mordred: Not just to have Gwen. To have you I admire you. Can't be easy to do so much for so little reward. Merlin: I do not seek reward. Mordred: Recognition, maybe. Merlin: My friends are safe and well, that's all I require.<br/><br/>Merlin: It's... lonely. To be more powerful than any man you know, and have to live like a shadow. To be special, and have to pretend you're a fool.<br/><br/>Morgana: How well you've kept your secret. How well you've protected my brother. Who could've thought  a worthless servant with all that power.<br/><br/>The series finale (in which Merlin confesses to Arthur that he is a sorcerer):<br/><br/>Arthur: I thought I knew you. Merlin: I'm still the same person. <br/><br/>Arthur: See you are not an idiot. That was another lie. Merlin: No. Just another part of my job.<br/><br/>Arthur: All these years, Merlin. Never once sought any credit. Merlin: It's not why I'm doing it.<br/><br/>Merlin: Some men are born to be great kings. Me I was born to serve you, Arthur. And I'm proud of that. And I wouldn't change a thing. <br/><br/>I'd love to give credit to all the actors, who created compelling and complex characters of Morgana, Mordred, Uther, Arthur, Gaius, Gwen, Great Dragon, but it's Colin Morgan who is above all praise. His charm and talent make him heart, soul, and magic of the show.",18 out of 24 found this helpful.,,22 January 2013

924,Merlin, What a ride!,"Why, oh why did I decide to watch this during the pandemic? I thought I was jumping into a cheesy yet lovable, comedic fantasy and instead I'm left with the feeling I watched something entirely different.<br/><br/>The cons of this show are obviously laid out during the first season. This isn't a ""serious"" show 100% of the time, it is often humorous and silly. Some episodes can be formulaic and are more fun-filler than expert story-telling. These factors would sink a show most times, but the episodes we get that move the story and character development along are worth the watch.<br/><br/>The acting. Damn! These actors truly bring this story to life in a way that is touching and heartfelt, especially Bradley James and Colin Morgan whose relationship that unfolds throughout the entire series is incredible. Where other actors could have fallen short with this kind of writing, they are able to deliver the humor and camaraderie as well as the serious, emotional moments that make you truly believe in their friendship. The chemistry between the two carries the show and make the ending that much more bittersweet.<br/><br/>Do I wish the last season was succinct and explored more themes such as Merlin's magic admission to Arthur, Arthur's reign of Camelot (where was the united land we were promised?), Guinevere's transition into queen, etc.? Sure! I think Season 5 could have benefited by tying up some of these storylines and it would have felt like more robust of an ending. I do appreciate what they were able to do and feel that it ended in a way that was (NOT happy, nor really satisfying of course) true to the story and characters.

925,Girls, Commits the sins of being boring and unfunny.,"I have seen many complaints about Girls only being relatable to a small sliver of the audience. I have also read someone defending it saying that we can't relate to the characters on Dowtown Abbey but still love it. I like Downtown Abbey. I think of Mary Crawley as a bit spoiled, high-minded, even snooty but still good natured and I like her with her faults and I am far from a British aristocrat. The maids, footmen, valets, and cook - I can't relate to their situation either... Secret is we do relate to them through their experiences, like Daisy learning to stand up for herself in a respectful way. Enough about Downtown Abbey...<br/><br/>I think you CAN write a show about spoiled privileged self-absorbed white girls in their early 20's. Actually, that show could be really funny because on some level who doesn't like laughing at privileged sheltered girls stumbling through a big city? At the same time we are laughing, we are also being comforted by the fact that life isn't easy for anyone, learning from their mistakes, and watching them grow. I'm also not troubled by the fact that all the friends are white - I found this to be somewhat realistic. Even a boyfriend who is too nice can be upsetting - you want a partner, an equal, with opinions and not a puppy dog that follows you around. This sounds like I am going to start praising the show? All the main complaints about it don't bother me. However, my point of criticism was it forgot to be entertaining and the situations are poorly written. It isn't funny and I am bored to tears while watching it. The characters are also often just plain annoying.<br/><br/>I saw an episode one night not knowing what it was. It was so boring, drab, and lifeless, I kept thinking what is this? Is it a show? Who could produce something so vanilla, limp, and dull? Thanks to the info button, I learned it was 'Girls.' So I googled it and found rave reviews and decided to watch some episodes - maybe I couldn't appreciate the show without seeing the story that came before. I watched the first 3 episodes, that makes 4 total and 4 too many. The show just fails on multiple levels, mostly at the satire it tries to be. I admit there are brief moments when the show rises above and realizes its potential, again, very briefly. Sometimes the lack of comedic timing kills a scene. The dialogue and interactions are also very simplistic and there is never any subtext. <br/><br/>Things that bugged me in the first 2 episodes: <br/><br/>The lighthearted abortion party was a little disturbing and I am completely pro-choice. So the British girl isn't the type to be emotional but she doesn't show up to her abortion and just confessed to you that she does want children (the conversation about her wanting children was one of the most badly written scenes I have ever watched.). What is your response? You are worried about your friend who is facing a huge life decision and is unsure about her choices? Worried she may be somewhere needing your support? Nope, you are annoyed she stood you up. What? The situation could be funny but NEVER in the way it is presented. The show then wimped out and balked on the unwanted pregnancy. (Also, she would have had a pregnancy test and medical exam to schedule an abortion so was she miscarrying?)<br/><br/>Hannah makes a joke about date rape in her interview. OK, nose-diving in an interview should be funny and make you uncomfortable. Her date rape joke makes you cringe but not cringe at how out of touch Hannah is but cringe with who wrote this terrible show? <br/><br/>Hannah's lover during sex wants her to pretend to be an 11 year old girl that he took from the street and is going to send home to her parents covered in semen (they use the other word) while shoving his hand in her face. He's a jerk but still this one, I... don't... get. <br/><br/>Alright, it's all to character development and we aren't supposed to think they are the greatest people in the world - they are real with flaws. They certainly are not completely awful but whether we are supposed to be laughing at or horrified by them, we should be invested in their story. The characters inspire nothing. They aren't interesting, they aren't funny. I didn't like them or hate them and I didn't care. You don't have to like a character to root for them. I also had a nagging sense that the show was telling superficial people, it is OK to be this self absorbed.<br/><br/>You shouldn't have to be living in a narrow section of society to like a show and relate to the characters - most shows I watch are far from depicting me but I like them, I relate, I laugh, I cry. So when a large chunk of people think a show is not relatable, it's the show's fault and not the viewers. The shows biggest failure is it's boring. I didn't absolutely hate it despite it making me cringe at times. It's just a blank void as vacuous as its characters.",159 out of 222 found this helpful.,4.0,13 January 2013
926,Girls," 4 stars, but only because of Adam Driver","Seriously, Adam Driver is the only good thing about this show. He is a great actor, but even he could not save this utterly silly display.

927,Girls," Fresh, funny, and also a bit depressing","I went into the first episode of Girls with pretty low expectations. I figured that it would maybe be another Sex in the City, with some pointless softcore porn here and there, but I decided to try it out. It is now, along with Game of Thrones, one of my favorite shows on television. In fact, when we get a fresh set of shows on the DVR, Girls is always the first show that I want to watch. It is fresh, funny, and also a bit depressing at times. This is definitely not Sex and the City. That show was glamour and lightheartedness. This show, on the other hand, is about that bad experience that lots of people have coming out of college called ""the quarter life crisis"".<br/><br/>The tone of ""Girls"" is somewhat dark, cynical humor. It is about four young women out of college a year or so. They live in New York City, but unlike the Sex and the City ladies, they are struggling financially and, overall, they aren't very happy people. There are Sex and the City posters in a lot of scenes, as if to remind you that you are NOT watching that show. Their jobs are deadend-ish in nature, or just plain nonexistent. They have lots of what looks like unsatisfying or awkward sex. There is an undercurrent of disillusionment and shattered dreams with all of the plot lines. Graduating from college and moving to New York City, isn't the world supposed to be your oyster? Since you still have youthful good looks, freedom, and income, shouldn't your 20s be the most fun part of your life? Maybe for some, but that's not how it works for a lot of people. For some folks, either men or women, the years immediately after college are when you find out that the world truly doesn't care about you, or that you don't have the talent to do what you wanted to do. It is when you grow apart from your college boyfriend or girlfriend and wake up one day to find that you have nobody of significant romantic interest in your life. It is when you find out that there are jobs out there that are horribly boring and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>I normally get annoyed by the excessive (and often boring and pointless) sex in HBO's original series, but it fits into this series just fine. This show centers around the trials and tribulations of young women in their early to mid 20s, and one problem that they all share is an unsatisfying sex life. Having been raised and gone through college with today's ""hookup"" culture, the men in their lives are lazy. They barely have to lift a finger to get laid and they don't need to be romantic to seduce a woman at all. They have sex and then somebody goes home right after. If you are looking for one big feature to distinguish this show from Sex and the City, I think that this portrayal of modern sex culture would be it. Sex and the City portrayed it as glamorous and empowering for women. This show (and I am not sure if this is intentional) portrays it somewhat the opposite. Hannah has been having sex with her partner, Adam, for a long time, but she barely even knows him. Marnie has a long time boyfriend, but she's not turned on by or in love with him. The relationships that these women have are shallow and unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The themes are interesting, and the writing is clever too. The one liners are usually funny. The hijinx are sufficiently wacky and unpredictable. If you have shared experiences with the characters in this show, then I think that you will ""get"" it, and that you will find it funny. If you haven't, then this show might not appeal to you. If you were turned off from the show by its marketing or because you didn't want to see another ""Sex and the City"", then I highly encourage you to give it a look. Especially if you feel that you can identify with some of the characters. As a 38 year old man, I still could, despite being older and, well, male. This show doesn't appear to be too popular, and that disappoints me, because I really want there to be a second season.",189 out of 272 found this helpful.,9.0,29 May 2012
928,Girls, Absolutely terrible.,"This is one of the most unimaginative pieces of trash I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I am usually pretty open in what I try - I'm not all too picky, and I am an open minded woman - but this, this... ugh. I don't even have the words. How do people get funding for stuff like this?<br/><br/>The main character is bland and boring with the usual self-image troubles. She is also disgustingly reliant on other people - namely her parents - by the fact that she expects absolutely everything from them. The supporting roles are just as terrible - unrealistic, and frankly, they're nothing new - they are characters you expect, and dread, in every television show of this sort. The writers didn't disappoint in that way, at least, in providing generic, irritating characters who make you want to beat their heads in with a stapler as soon as they open their mouths.<br/><br/>The fact that it's supposed to be ""spot on"" to how girls of that age are (and speaking as a 20 year old female here) - I can only be astounded at the crap people produce, or the way that young ladies are obviously viewed. We don't watch each other poop, we don't have showers together... good lord, I could go on for a long while about how this is pretty much a writer's fantasy on what he hopes young women are like together, rather than providing something slightly truthful.<br/><br/>Maybe it's just the cultural differences - I'm from Australia, and I noticed that an English chap who also reviewed this has maybe said it's a cultural thing as well. I sincerely hope Americans aren't like this, because Australians certainly aren't.<br/><br/>What can I say about it? I want the 30 minutes of my life back that I lost while watching it. You'd honestly be better off watching a dog chase its tail.",190 out of 285 found this helpful.,1.0,29 March 2013
929,Girls, Mixed feelings,"I hadn't been following the show yet but decided to get caught up since all the episodes were available on demand, and since they are nice and short it didn't take much time. <br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about the show. I'm definitely not in my twenties anymore, and even when I was my situation was different from Hannah's (I was broke and struggling through art school without any family support, and not in New York). That was years ago--Hannah could theoretically be my daughter--yet I recognize and sympathize with a lot of what goes on in her world. A good bit of the show is funny and smart, and I do care about her--she's afraid and a little lost and going through a series of disappointments. I get how it feels to have something to say and find yourself (or others) questioning whether it really needs to be said, which must be really rough when you've spent the last few years in a crucible of complete focus on self-expression (grad school). I'm just not sure I like her. And maybe that's OK, since Hannah doesn't seem to like herself very much despite little bursts of ego and a chronic exhibitionism--but the occasional moments pop up where it feels like I'm supposed to cheer her on when I want to shake her instead. Her motives seem hollow, and too focused on trying to actively *impress* others, which could be intentional. It's hard to tell if she's having trouble being herself or if the trouble IS that she's being herself. Maybe the generation gap is to blame, or maybe there is no message and she's just packaging up and delivering a slice of life without any adjectives or claims printed on the box. And there is certainly more going on in the show besides the protagonist's character study. <br/><br/>I'll continue watching to see how Hannah progresses. There is value in the writing, and it's pretty original. Feels a little like a graphic novel (a la American Splendor), weirdly. Glad to see Zosia Mamet after being introduced to her on Mad Men, and hope her character (Shoshanna) is allowed to grow out of what appears to be comic relief. Also good to see Becky Ann Baker again, the warm and authentic mom from Freaks and Geeks. She's less cuddly here but just as real. <br/><br/>If you're in your twenties you may well like this more than I do. If you're {ahem}older you might like it more than me anyway. But it's certainly worth watching an episode or two to find out.",73 out of 104 found this helpful.,7.0,22 May 2012
930,Girls, It's annoying.,"I can see some minor appeal to this show and I won't challenge the taste of anyone who likes it. My girlfriend watches it regularly, though she can't articulate why.<br/><br/>From my perspective it's a pointless meta-tragedy where rich 30-somethings attempt to act like poor 20-somethings but wield only enough emotional depth to emulate spoiled teenagers. Each character is a razor-thin veneer that barely manages to obscure the underlying actor's radiant sense of entitlement and profound lack of awareness.<br/><br/>These are truly despicable, irreparably self-obsessed people. Girls would work so much better if it were framed as satire rather than as a dramedy that wants to be taken semi-seriously.",114 out of 171 found this helpful.,2.0,29 March 2014
931,Girls, Incredible first season followed by utter letdown,"Okay, this is going to be a long one, true fans of the show who understood what was special about Girls please bear with me.<br/><br/>I watched Girls season one with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised at its unique take on human nature and relationships. This show combined awkwardness and reality in such a way that a guy who says ""I'll make the continent of Africa on your arm."" during sex started to seem charming a couple episodes in because he made you laugh and was real as it gets. Every single character had realistic problems that you could relate to and all of them was weird and funny in their own way.<br/><br/>I could not wait to see season two but I was disappointed beyond belief. <br/><br/>We had left a dumped and robbed Hannah on a beach eating a huge piece of wedding cake, but that sad girl was nowhere to be found now. <br/><br/>In season 2 Hannah is transformed into an extremely confident and kind of a bitchy wild party girl. Oh and she also hates Adam who she was obsessed with and now Adam is the one chasing her. What happened there? When did she come over her fears and insecurities? Why did Adam forgive her? The gap between season 1 and 2 is not supposed to be unseen character development. <br/><br/>Hannah having hot sex with hot guys that were ineptly planted in every other episode much like the shallow guest stars of Friends, more than enthusiastic to feed her already over-blown ego (""Beg me to stay""? ""Don't mention the word love to me""? Come on!), <br/><br/>Hannah being a complete bitch to Adam and Marnie, <br/><br/>Hannah being Obsessed with Elijah and who he barely enters into, <br/><br/>Hannah doing coke for an article,<br/><br/>all these were painful to watch with not one shred of humor in them. Why would she call 911 on Adam as if she had just met him? Why invite Marnie to dinner, tell others she's a psycho for coming, sell her out to please Charlie's whats-her-face girlfriend only to get all bff and defend her to Charlie in the end? Speaking of Charlie: ""you're never getting any of this again."" was a criminal line to write. That's possibly the least Charlie to thing say in that situation where he has a girlfriend himself.<br/><br/>So right when I was about to give up and stop watching the show came episode 6 and 7 like breath of fresh air. Laughs from start to finish, character development, awkwardness in all its beauty, and just great writing and execution. The guys who wrote those episodes (Murray Miller and Bruce Eric Kaplan) knew the characters. Having Adam and Ray spend the day together and those lovely conversations was a joy to watch. Jessa's ""But I'm the child."" line was pure emotion. But guess what, those were the two out of three episodes in the whole season that weren't written by Lena Dunham.<br/><br/>The last three episodes were entrusted to her again and she immediately toned the mood down to shallow comedy with sketchy plot ideas that had nothing to do with her characters. Sudden onset of extreme OCD? Wow, that's realistic! Charlie the musician guy suddenly receiving the gift of software skills, inventing an app, selling it and being rich and surrounded by ladies? That's even more realistic.. A constantly grinning Adam's dreamy blind date? I won't even go into that. Shosh who basically tells everyone that steps into her house that they can stay forever finds it shockingly irritating that her boyfriend lives with her. The handsome and funny doorman at the party was pure Apatow and Hollywood stamp and it made me feel nauseous.<br/><br/>So what is apparent to me is that Lena Dunham only had a seasons worth of material in her and now all she can write is these fake sketchy ideas she tries so hard to fuse into her beautifully written characters. <br/><br/>If Murray Miller and Bruce Eric Kaplan had written the entire season this would have been a show I would force my grandchildren to watch. She should watch those two episodes again and again to understand that crazy things don't have to happen with every new episode. Adam and Ray returning a dog, Jessa and her father getting together, Hannah having weird sex with a teenager... All you need is to stay true to your characters and just let us see them being themselves in normal daily ordeals. <br/><br/>I'm still hoping for a better third season.",54 out of 77 found this helpful.,5.0,27 March 2013
932,Girls, I'm in my early 20s and I don't like this show,"So I thought I'd check 'Girls' to see what the hype was all about. The storyline interested me, especially because it was about people my age. So far the positivity of this review. <br/><br/>I'm halfway through the first season now and I just turned it off because I couldn't watch it any longer. I've never seen such a bad show. I should be able to relate to this. I myself graduated a year ago as well, taking my first steps on the job market, I have a boyfriend, I have great friends and I'm also struggling with 'life' some times. But god, I am nothing like Hannah. She annoys me so much. I actually agreed with her parents during the first episode. You're 24 and you still need financial support from your parents to pay for rent? You dare to ask them 1.100 dollars a month? Spoiled brat. I'm 21 and I've been taking care of myself for over a year now. <br/><br/>It's not all bad. For example, I get how Marnie struggles with her boyfriend, how she doesn't really know what to do about the situation. Shoshanna is clearly insecure, because she's still a virgin, and feels like a bit of an outsider - definitely something you can understand. But that's about it.<br/><br/>I don't spend time with friends on the toilet, I don't want to shower with them, I can't even think of making jokes about rape during a job interview, if one of my friends had to undergo an abortion, I'd be a little more supportive, and I would NEVER be okay with a guy treating me like a piece of meat and being a total A-hole all the time. Adam is probably this type of character you need to give some time to get to know better, which is supposed to be interesting, but I just don't feel the need to watch another episode. <br/><br/>The actors all do a very good job, it's the storyline that gets me bored. The show is shallow, the characters only complain, take no action or whatsoever and I'm getting more tired every minute I have watch it. These people are 23-25, which is 2 to 4 years older than I am. Yet, I have the feeling there's nothing I can learn from them. <br/><br/>I get how life in your twenties is a struggle, as it is for me and loads of others, but this just isn't realistic. We do stupid things, but we're not THAT retarded. I'm the target audience, yet I feel like a parent who's constantly yelling to just grow the f*** up.",52 out of 74 found this helpful.,1.0,3 October 2015
933,Girls, Hate love hate,"At first I hated this show. After watching the pilot i thought to myself why is this even airing? Especially on a network like HBO?! Then one day a marathon of the first season was on so I thought I could give it another shot. I sat down and watched the whole season. There were some episodes that I loved and the show started to grow on me. For a while I was even a fan and I couldn't wait for the next season. When season two came out I was so excited to check it out. After watching the first episode I was very disappointed but i kept on watching. Second episode aired, third episode aired and so on and it just kept being awful. The season ended and I just couldn't believe that there was not even one episode of the show that I loved. It's clear that the writers are suffering from a lack of inspiration. The main character Hanna became unbearably annoying and yet there's an episode that involves only her. It seems to me that the writers of this show had no idea what to do with their characters so they did all the wrong things and ruin everything good about them. At the end of season one there was so much potential but it all went down in season two. I am surprised that season 3 is announced and that this show still has a huge audience. I am sure that I will not give season 3 a shot and I hope that will be the last season as well.",47 out of 67 found this helpful.,1.0,26 March 2013
934,Girls, Everybody Looks Like They Need A Bath,"I had a professor who use to say ""there's no accounting for taste"". Some people are going to love things you hate, some are going to find things funny that you find stupid, and some are going to find things compelling and inspiring that you find boring at best and pure bullshit at worst. He was right. This show is nothing but a trashier, newer generation of Sex in the City where the characters are even more narcissistic (I never thought it possible) and less appealing. Some folks might like it and they're welcome to it. I know that I've liked shows over the years that most hated, so to each their own.

935,Girls, Story Reads Like Text Messages Sent from the Mall,"First of all, this show is the dictionary definition of nepotism as most of the people involved are the offspring of the rich and connected. Go look it up. I guess the story pulls all the right strings about women and lesbians or whatever the hell else is fashionable because, man, has this project ever been pampered by the press who just can't get enough of it. I had enough after about ten minutes of the first episode when the protagonist is shell-shocked because her wealthy parents are cutting her off a few years after graduationfrom college! What horrible people! But I'm just an intern! Interns are all kids rich enough to not get paid, something I could never swing.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the last episode.<br/><br/>Just a bit of the glow from the press, this from the NYT:<br/><br/>""For starters, it was straight-up funny, an aspect of ""Girls"" that tends to get lost in all the big-picture conversation around it.""<br/><br/>What do you call the opposite of funny? That's what it was. She walks around without pants and a cop stops her, like that is supposed to be funny. They need to put ""funny"" in quotation marks like I did because their definition is definitely non-standard. The sort of hot chick gets caught jerking off and throws her phone. Was that supposed to be ""funny?"" The episode is full of moronic pop culture references, stuff like Full House. Here's the deal, it's OK if you watched total crap like that growing up but using them as references in adult life is just creepy. Here is another ""joke"" that shows just what a shallow idiot she is: <br/><br/>""A live jazz trio? That's the most disgusting thing I've ever heard.""<br/><br/>Unfunny and incredibly anti-intellectual at the same time.<br/><br/>""I'm in emotional pain."" Would anyone other than a self-centered half-wit actually say that out loud?<br/><br/>Jia Tolentino writes in The New Yorker the opposite of a hatchet job:<br/><br/>""The main characters are never more ridiculous than when they are explaining the way they see themselves—in one of Marnie's funniest moments, at her infelicitous wedding, she described her aesthetic as ""Ralph Lauren meets Joni Mitchell,"" with a ""nod to my cultural heritage, which is white Christian woman."" The fruitlessness of endlessly fine-tuning your self-image—of frantically trying to echolocate* your personhood* against someone else's story, real or fictional—is baked into every episode of the show.""<br/><br/>If you are using this series to ""echolocate"" your ""personhood"" I would suggest finding a source a bit more substantive. Why would this nitwit want to bring a child into the world when she obviously is completely inadequate of managing her own pathetic life?<br/><br/>I will be the first to admit that I am too old and too male to get this show. It's made for young women. I get that, but why can't we just ask a little more out of this demographic instead of celebrating the completely mediocre, stupid, and—much, much worse—the anti-intellectual? As if spewing crappy TV show references is what passes for wit and sophistication among this crowd. The same dumpy and lazy kids from Reality Bites who think they are cool but they are mostly just poorly-educated sheep feeding on celebrity gossip, lousy pop music, and whatever food/diet fad is du jour.<br/><br/>*Ironically, the spell-check at IMDb flagged these as non-words.

937,Girls, Time to end this show,"I actually liked Season 1 but it went downhill from there. Now I'm watching Season 5 and am appalled by how bad it is but at the same time very interested to understand why Lena Dunham feels she must have her character show her vagina to her supervisor, steal a poor guy's bike, hike a mountain in her bikini and generally show off her naked body in random moments even though the plot doesn't require it. The answer is simple. <br/><br/>The show is doing terribly. The plot is silly, the female characters are all variations of one character, that of a narcissistic, confused, spoiled brat. The only thing that can make people passionate about this show and keep watching it, is their hatred for Lena Dunham's character. She must have thought ""you want to hate me? I'll give you reasons to hate me"". Hence this last year Hannah became even more obnoxious, spoiled, rude and narcissistic. But the worst thing is the flaunting of her naked body in every episode. This is not the healthy reaction of an overweight woman who feels confident in her own skin. Nope. It is provoking and of poor taste and every time she shows me her naked ass I feel like she's also screaming: ""in your face then!"" Agh.

939,Girls, From a guy's perspective,"I am a straight (if that matters...) 30-something guy and I just watched the first five episodes of HBO's ""GIRLS"". So in a nutshell:<br/><br/>I really dig this show. I think it has an extremely unique vibe to it, that kinda reminds me of ""How to make it in America"" (with a pinch of Woody Allen). It's nothing like ""Sex and the City""... well it's about a group of Girlfriends, that happen to live in New York City and well... yes Sex is an issue. But still, it's nothing like ""SATC"". It's much more down-to-earth, realistic and... different. I like all the girls and their facets. The casting is great. Though they work with some (New York) clichés in the show, I really have the feeling that I know people like that from my own life and experiences. The early 20s, an age where you're on your own for the first time of your life, grown up but still clueless about life and what to expect from it. It's kind of an adventure to figure out who you are, what you want and where to go. I really feel that ""GIRLS"" makes a great job capturing that feeling. Lena Dunham, creator, director and protagonist of this show is crazy talented. People will hear (even more) from her in the future. Mark my words.<br/><br/>Hopefully HBO won't axe this show as they did with ""How to make it..."". It's a great show and I really enjoy watching it.",147 out of 236 found this helpful.,7.0,28 May 2012
940,Girls, GIRLS - Overrated,"I admired Lena Dunham when she had her success with TINY FURNITURE - I didn't like the movie, but I was impressed she wrote,directed and starred in her little indie and got such amazing press for it. Good for her - but now with GIRLS - again, huge success but everything that left me cold in her film does the same with her HBO series. First off, I don't think Dunham is that good of an actress - she has this sing song manner that I find irritating and as a writer - I find that she is kind of lazy - it seems like when she gets stuck in writing a scene and doesn't know what to do - she'll just write in an awkward, humiliating sex scene and boom - wow - it's like life man! Yes, I know things like this happen in life and there are girls and boys like this in life, but that doesn't make it entertainment. There's also child rape and animal cruelty but that doesn't mean it should be a series - hey wait a minute!!!

941,Girls, Keep Your Clothes On Lena,"When I first saw the trailer for this show it reminded me of a cheap version of Sex and The City. I ran out of shows to watch so out of pure boredom I decided to watch Girls on demand. I wish I could get my time back. Why Lena Dunham thinks everyone wants to see her naked body every few minutes is crazy to me?? Yeah I get the whole female empowerment issue but showing your gross body every episode is way too much. And in what real world would any attractive man want to have sex with someone so unattractive and I'm not just talking about her ill built physique. Her attitude alone is disgusting. Hannah is so self absorbed, narcissistic and egotistical that it's shamefully pathetic. In what world does someone like her dress so poorly and act so selfish and still is able to maintain a sexual relationship and any real friendships?? It doesn't happen like that. SO what makes this good television?? Nothing about it does. Even with all its awkwardness, it lacks heart and depth. I don't find entertainment in false relations between females. All they do is talk crap about each other then smile in each others face but still call each other friends. Everyone praises Lena Dunham on her writing of this show but in all reality the writing is junk, the acting is terrible (especially Lena's character Hannah), and the grotesque nudity and sex scenes are so uncomfortable that if any 20 something females say they can relate to this garbage then they really need to reevaluate their lives. And please tell me in what world does NYC always have sunny days and never a day of cold ass winter? Please cancel this joke of a show and make a show that is more realistic that empowers women by proving that not everyone has to be a supermodel to be confident. Please keep your clothes on Lena.

942,Girls, what is realistic?,"I know it's only a show, but I am SO tired, bored in fact, with the laziness of writers and producers who, for the sake of entertainment (and advertising dollars)continue mining the same sad, vaguely misogynistic territory where women are laughable, but not funny. <br/><br/>It's like the underlying message is: never mind, woman are just silly, not to be taken seriously.

Let me start with the fact the all main characters in this show (all of those ""girls"") are assholes. They are just bad people, most of them at least. They don't seem to care about other people. They are a-holes to each other as well half of the time.<br/><br/>Hannah is the worst. She is the most self-centered character ever. She doesn't care about anyone but herself. Sometimes she tries to seem like a human being, but usually she just fucks everything up and the show expects us to be compassionate to her. I just don't understand this, does this show want me to become an asshole as well? Is this the point, the idea of the series -- be an asshole to others, don't give a damn about your friends or boyfriends? It's not like Hannah's character evolves, becomes better -- she is a bitch throughout the whole show.<br/><br/>And why is every guy obsessed with Hannah? She is not the most attractive girl out there, she is boring, she is unfunny, nothing about her is so magnetic that every man around her should be willing to make out with her. In first season there were 2 guys (attractive, athletic guys) who had sex with her -- okay, I'm fine with that.<br/><br/>In second season there's like what, five more of them? Every guy she sees becomes obsessed with Hannah, everyone thinks she's the best, why?? Note that all of them are athletic, handsome men, not chubby boys as herself. Is this Lena Dunham's fantasies? <br/><br/>I can go on and on explaining why this show is so bad, but I don't want to. This show isn't worth neither your nor my time.<br/><br/>Verdict: 1/10. Too bad, too delusional.",17 out of 23 found this helpful.,1.0,16 March 2018
945,Girls, 3/10,"I quite liked the first season, so I was surprised the following ones were so awful. The show deserves kudos for showing the female body as it is and for the realistic view of sex. Unfortunately, that's not frequently done in this industry.<br/><br/>And why I didn't like it? The script is random and full of clichés we had seen in so many series before. You can actually predict what will happen. The show lacks any psychological depth. Hannah has OCD in one episode and then never again. Marnie's ex first gets very rich and then loses everything to the point of selling drugs in the park. Marnie - an independent, self-confident woman at the beginning of the series - turns into somebody completely different, directionless later. I liked the persona of Shoshanna, since she was more probable psychologically than the rest of them. To bad she was the one appearing least in the series.<br/><br/>Some acting was bad, most notably that of Allison Williams. Although to be honest, I sometimes had the impression the actors just found it difficult to tell lines which were so out of their characters.<br/><br/>Another problem is the veracity of the life portrayed. The series seems to tell us you can live in NYC, wear trendy clothes, party till you drop, do drugs and go to gym several times a week, all that without having a job or any other source of income. Just, you know, money will magically appear every morning on your table. That contrasts with the series' alleged aspirations to show ""real life"". Lena should have presented this show as one about fashionable, upper middle class twenty-somethings in NYC openly without a pretense to represent the real life of twenty-somethings including money problems.<br/><br/>The series is pretentious. I know in your early twenties most people tend to use words like ""life"", ""forever"", ""love"" too much. However, their constant use in dialogues makes it really difficult to watch. There is just too much drama. It's like reading teenager poetry.<br/><br/>Finely, I would like to mention here the author's uncritical attitude towards Hannah. It's very visible that Lena identifies with Hannah, who is her alter ego. This is problematic, since Hannah is treated positively in the script even when that's totally unrealistic. Most attractive men get attracted to her. She is constantly told she has a great talent, although, honestly, we don't see much of it. It is showed that people, even random people, instantly like her, although she really gives them no reasons to be friendly to her. It's a kind of a therapeutic series for Lena I would think. But this treatment of Hannah disturbs the realism of the world portrayed and makes the show difficult to watch.<br/><br/>3/10",15 out of 20 found this helpful.,3.0,29 April 2017

947,Girls, Ally McBeal but without the creative writing or humor and with butt ugly sex scenes,"Ally McBeal. The Mindy Project. 30 Rock. The cartoon strip Cathy. The story of the quintessential female with quirky insecurities and mild-to-severe neuroses has been a crowd pleaser time and time again.<br/><br/>And then you have shows like ""Girls"" which take that story to annoying new depths, degrading women, making men look like beastly predators, focusing on sex to an obsessive degree (and I mean literally ""focusing"" as in the camera shows everything short of a colonoscopy), and for what... for laughs? No, not even that. For just sheer awkwardness I guess.<br/><br/>That's my opinion and I'll leave it there. For the rest of my review I'll just cite some examples, and you can be the judge if this is the kind of show that you think you'll enjoy. Writer/director/star Lena Dunham plays an insecure, chubby 23-year-old named Hannah whose life is full of self-imposed disasters.<br/><br/>Example #1. Hannah gets an STD because she ritually has unprotected sex with some guy who uses women as if they're toilet paper. When she learns she has the STD, she whines as if she's the victim and we're supposed to hate the guy for not using a condom. Poor little victim Hannah.<br/><br/>Example #2. Hannah, who has never had a job and relies on her hipster parents to pay her rent, insurance, cell phone and food bills, is told by her parents that they are cutting off her allowance and forcing her to earn a living like the rest of us schmucks. She whines as if she's the victim, and we're supposed to hate the parents just because they're rich. Poor little victim Hannah.<br/><br/>Example #3. Hannah finally gets a job where she is very inappropriately fondled by the boss on the first day. She just sits there and takes it with a goofy expression on her face for about 5 minutes. Then later she whines as if she's the victim, and we're supposed to hate the boss (who, by the way, asks her point blank if she's OK with him being ""touchy"", and she says nothing) because he's a creepy predator. Poor little victim Hannah.<br/><br/>Example #4. Hannah is still smitten by the disgusting man-beast who gave her an STD, and he texts her a picture of his hairy man parts (which, yes, they feel the need to show us on camera). He then texts her ""SRY THAT WAS MEANT FOR SOMEONE ELSE"". That part was funny, I admit, but then once again Hannah whines like the victim but stays with him because she's too stupid to, I dunno, tell the creep to get lost like a real woman would do. Poor little victim Hannah.<br/><br/>And the list goes on.<br/><br/>You'll notice that I'm dwelling on the character Hannah even though there are 3 other stars of the show. That's because this is basically the Lena Dunham (Hannah) show with only momentary diversions to the other characters who, by the way, can be equally whiney with the same ""use me, I'm just a weak little girl"" attitude as Hannah. Kudos to Allison Williams who tries to rescue this show admirably, both with her humorous acting as well as by playing a female character who actually can stand up for herself. But not even she can save this mess.<br/><br/>Congratulations, Lena Dunham (Hannah)... you've successfully knocked women back to the 1950s, with the only difference being your character drops her underwear for any man who will use you. And you've successfully made every male under the age of 50 look like a rapist (oh wait, the ones over 50 as well).<br/><br/>I actually urge you to watch this show just so you'll see how disgusting television can be in the 21st century. But for the love of Moses don't pay any money to see this.",34 out of 51 found this helpful.,2.0,25 March 2015
948,Girls, As honest as I can be...,"I ended up binge watching all six seasons of Girls and at the end of this crazy journey, I'm left with more questions than I've had at any other point during this show. However, before I get to that, I'll say that It was a good show with an interesting dynamic between the characters, which is what kept me watching. From dysfunctional families, intense and unhealthy relationships, narcissistic friendships, and everything in between. The actors were all great at portraying their character's certain quirk and the interactions between each of them felt realistic. <br/><br/>Here'sthe spoilers come into play. Although I enjoyed the show for the most part, the ending had me wondering if the writers just gave up. Hannah ends up pregnant with a guy's baby who only appears in two episodes. She ends up telling him she's pregnant, but he doesn't want to be apart of the baby's life. Adam (her on/off ex-boyfriend) ends up with Jessa, but leaves her I guess? He tells Hannah that he wants to raise her baby together, to which she responds by entertaining it for an episode and a half and then randomly decides she doesn't want to and they both leave sad AGAIN (they both obviously still love each other but it's a common theme for them to break up; this time for good). During their rendezvous, heartbroken Jessa has a meltdown and almost sleeps with a complete stranger. Adam then returns to their apartment, reluctantly. Shoshanna ends up engaged to a guy the show didn't bother to introduce at all until the moment Hannah barges in on Shoshanna's engagement party that she wasn't invited to. Ray spends some time with Shoshanna's old boss and they hit it off. Elijah continues to go to auditions for a play. When Hannah decides to move out of the city, Marnie asks to go with her to help her raise the baby. The last episode focuses only on Hannah, the baby, Marnie and Hannah's mother many months after the baby was born. It makes no mention of what became of Adam and Jessa's broken relationship. If they recovered from Adam choosing Hannah and then coming back to Jessa after being rejected. Nothing of Elijah and if he landed the role in the Broadway play. Nothing of Ray and if he is now dating that lady. Nothing about Shoshanna's wedding or marriage. Marnie's future is up in the air as she chose to be stuck with a hormonal Hannah and her baby somewhere in Upstate NY, giving up on her social life and career. The whole ending was just awful. The writers gave up on all their character's storylines and didn't give any of them a justified ending. Even for Hannah, her last scene was her successfully breastfeeding her baby after many failed attempts to get him to latch on. That was it. That was seriously the end of what was a pretty decent show. I felt as though the writers couldn't figure out what else to do with Hannah, so they got her pregnant by some random character and sent her away from almost everyone, didn't want to give Marnie a well-deserved happy ending or any kind of peace of mind, gave up on Shosh and Ray by forcing the viewers to swallow the rushed relationships they found themselves in, and gave up on the storyline of their best and craziest characters, Adam and Jessa, leaving us with a very open ended last scene of them. The whole thing felt very rushed and all over the place. As I sat there wondering what the hell just happened, wanting to scream like Adam, I couldn't help but think to myself that they pulled a typical 'Hannah' move on all of us. If you watched the show, you know what I mean.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,5.0,16 January 2018

951,Naruto, It can grow on you...,"I've seen a lot of anime throughout the years. I've seen what people call the 'good stuff', I've seen the 'bad stuff'. In time, I realized and accepted that not everyone is going to like something, or dislike it. No matter what the anime (or movie, or book, or game, etc.) it boils down to personal preference. So, how do you know if you'd like something you've never seen but heard so much about? When I first started Naruto, I saw the potential in it. From the first episode, they presented a distinct setting with distinct characters. Sure, archetypes were being followed (the boy dreaming of becoming big, the old grandfatherly figure, the teacher, the rival). The first episode showed emotion and depth to its main character and what he will struggle with, along with the dynamics of his interaction with other characters and their quirks.<br/><br/>Cut about ten episodes later, the plot arc currently being followed felt to me like it was not going to matter much to the main story. Some episodes had drawn out battles, and I got that feeling that the anime would be the type where they would go from different area to different area, developing their skills and learning moral lessons and such, but there would be no grand plot, no B story, that tied the series together. I also worried it would fall into mediocrity. Without giving anything away, by the end of that arc (about 19 episodes in), my mind was changed.<br/><br/>Having seen all of the series up to the current episodes, I can say at least for myself that at its best Naruto is a deeper anime than some give credit to, and can be quite addicting. A strong focus is on its characters as they develop throughout the series and there are moments of real emotion, tragedy, intensity and even just amusement. It's not perfect, as there are slow times in the series (and the cartoon suffers from tricks to get as many episodes out of the original story as they can), and I won't say everyone will end up liking it but I can say it had unexpectedly become one of my favorite anime.",90 out of 95 found this helpful.,8.0,24 February 2007
952,Naruto, Far better than one would expect.,"For the last few years, nearly everybody I know who watches anime has been raving about the anime series ""Naruto"" and proclaiming it as one of the best new anime series in a long time. Judging from the way they've all been talking, I have been expecting this show to become a huge worldwide phenomenon not unlike ""Dragonball Z,"" another anime that was being hailed as one of the all-time greatest anime shows. I will admit that I jumped on the ""DBZ"" bandwagon and have seen nearly the entire series, but I never really saw it as the sublime work of art that all the fanboys drooled over for so long. It had its moments and was kind of fun, but it also moved really slowly, with fights being dragged out far longer than they had any right to be. It also became way too predictable, with story lines that pretty much consisted of the main characters desperately trying to become stronger so they can face the next ludicrously powerful scary bad guy. Needless to say, I found that the show became tiresome long before most of its fans stopped worshiping Goku and Vegeta as spiky-haired gods. It was for this reason why I was so hesitant to check out ""Naruto;"" it seemed to have basically the same fans as ""DBZ,"" which led me to believe that perhaps it wasn't the masterpiece that people said it was.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I was wrong. While I don't think it's the greatest anime to come out of Japan, I will say that it has me hooked. It does have some problems such as main characters that can get really annoying and fights that are occasionally dragged out to epic lengths, but after watching the first thirty or so episodes it became clear why this show has so many fans. On the surface, ""Naruto"" appears to be a typical children's show, with lots of (mostly) child-friendly humor and an energetic and mischievous boy hero in the lead role. After a few episodes however, it becomes clear that this show is quite a bit darker than it first lets on. Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura may be ninjas-in-training, but they are also only children, and the reality of what they are training to be frequently rears its ugly head in the form of some dangerous and rather frightening opponents and situations. While it is fun to see Naruto and his team go up against the bad guys with their mystical ""jutsu"" abilities, that fun is frequently muted by the fact that these kids are often out of their league and seem genuinely afraid for their lives. This and other darker elements such as Sasuke's obsession with killing his brother and the fact that Naruto has been ostracized in his own village thanks to a demon within him give the show a kind of tension and pathos that I never felt from ""Dragon Ball Z."" An English-language version of ""Naruto"" is currently airing on the Cartoon Network, but the 170-plus episodes of the far superior Japanese version have been floating around the internet for years. Download a few episodes and take a look. You won't be disappointed.",48 out of 52 found this helpful.,,23 March 2006
953,Naruto, Who says adults can't watch cartoons?,"A friend of mine introduced me to the Naruto series, and I have liked it from the first moment I saw Gaara of the Sand walk across the screen! I am now engaged with trying to watch all of the episodes starting with the very first one, and I am impressed beyond measure by it's storyline, which manages to combine action, adventure, humor, science fiction/fantasy, and coming-of-age elements all in one. I wouldn't recommend it for young children due to some very dark elements which surface and, of course, violence. However, the very dark elements succeed in intensifying the storyline, and in character building. All the characters are very unique, no cookie-cutter fill-ins here!, and the bad guys are especially well developed. This is a far cry from Skeletor and Cobra which were the villains of my youth (and oops, I've just dated myself). The only drawback I can think of are the excessively long battle scenes, which can take up several episodes. The number of episodes in proportion to the importance of the battle.",120 out of 139 found this helpful.,,8 September 2004
954,Naruto, First Anime I've watched and it got me hooked,"Last year my roommate got me hooked on watching Naruto. I had never really been a big Anime fan. Shows like DBZ and Inuyasha never really appealed to me. I had seen a few episodes of Tri-Gun and found it rather interesting but the story of Naruto is what really drew me in. The quality with which it is written is very well done. And is not centered entirely around fighting, there actually is a plot here. The story is about 3 ninjas as they progress from genin level (beginning ninjas) onward to some rather high lvl battles and their hardships along the way. Each of these characters is well described with a rich background. And each character possesses unique abilities, none of which I have found boring or pointless so far. Currently I have read all the manga and have all the Anime downloaded. It is a truly excellent series. I fear that if they do bring it to the US. that sites that provide us with the anime may not be allowed to continue providing us with the show and if it comes to US television it will be edited because they will probably intend for kids to watch it and in it's original state it is entirely inappropriate and in no way should be compared to a Saturday morning cartoon show. The different jutsus are exciting to watch and well thought out. Battles can tend to last multiple episodes but to me that does not matter, the flashbacks just add to the storyline. The quality of the actual animation which can really be seen during the fight scenes is unbelievable. They truly have some very talented artists working for them. Lastly, the music is top notch. The intro's are extremely cool and the music in the actual show is also very well done.",110 out of 127 found this helpful.,,8 February 2005

The animation is good and the style isn't very unique but the story is incredible and so are all the fine details about all Ninja Techniques. The 'world' Naruto takes place in is wonderful and incredibly detailed with history and different cultures. The setting is almost that of feudal Japan in respect to weapons and the types of soldiers and different classes and military ranks. But its modern in respect to technology and clothing. The plot is very good and sometimes very suspenseful and always interesting.

Also the legendary 3 have a fight and thats nothing much compared to most other fights scenes on the series, its supposed to be the ultimate battle against all of the 3 legends of the nartuo world, but the other fights and the main story line makes up for that. the characters are all SO original the most original has to be gaara of the desert, his ninjutsu is the power to use sand, to defened and offend the target, hes got to be my favourite. Orochimaru is a VERY original character alswell, when he first shows up in the story, your not sure if thats really a bad or good guy which makes it even better to watch.

Naruto is about a boy called Uzumaki Naruto, who lives in a hidden ninja village called Konoha. Neglected and hated by all of the villagers, Naruto tries his best to prove that he'll one day become the Hokage, the strongest ninja and also the leader of the village. There is of course a reason that all of the villagers hate Naruto. This goes back to his birth. Konoha was terrorized by a great demon fox, which killed a lot of people. When everything seemed lost, Konoha's fourth Hokage showed up, using a secret, but suicidal ninja technique which sealed up the demon inside of Naruto. The fourth hokage told everyone not to tell any further about the demon inside of Naruto and he hoped Naruto would be treated like a hero who saved the village, but instead of that Naruto was treated like he was the demon itself. Soon, the behavior of all the parents passed down to the children, which resulted in a bad childhood for Naruto. It made Naruto an annoying and attention seeking child. But later...through some hardships, Naruto passed his test at the ninja academy and a world of adventure now lies before him.<br/><br/>This is where you pick up the story and what a story it is! Naruto has got many, many unique and well though out characters, so there's a favorite character for everyone. The action is very good, because of the many techniques that exist in the shinobi world. There are stealthy ninjas, like Shikamaru; long-range ninjas, like Temari, but also the head on ninjas like Naruto himself. The bad guys are cool, like Itachi, and somewhat scary, like the main bad guy Orochimaru. Naruto is just an Anime that everyone MUST see. You'll be addicted before you know it!",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,,25 August 2005
963,Naruto, The story of a true underdog ... Naruto,"well this is an amazing story based on the Japanese manga .... The characterizations are rich and the plot is excellently developed .... Though it may be slightly predictable ...and sometimes the comedy sucks ..... the fights and music tracks are quite awesome ..... this is the true story of an underdog...naruto ... recognized by no one and hated by everyone...for possessing no ninja skills and a demon fox trapped inside him ...... how he battles with his sheer will and determination against insurmountable odds to achieve a goal he set for himself is poignantly portrayed in the series ..... the series drags slightly in between but picks up pace and becomes heavily addictive later on ..... Maybe there is a naruto in all of us ...maybe there is a fighting spirit deep within us which can never be extinguished .. this wonderful Japanese anime is a tribute to this amazing attribute inherent in everyone of us .... it tells about friendship,loyalty,courage and unselfishness ... it tells about arrogance,deception and hatred .... it is a journey of varying emotions ... it is the story of a true underdog called naruto ..... don't miss this amazing anime ... i rate it 8.7/10",41 out of 57 found this helpful.,,10 July 2005
964,Naruto," Great Story, Great Characters, but includes 3 seasons of filler","If you want to get into Anime watch this. It perfectly resembles what Anime is like. The story is great, the characters are absolutely amazing and super memorable. However, most of season 6, season 7, and season 8 are filler. They add nothing to the main plot. Also, as you watch more you start to know what will happen. Most storylines are the same. However, this takes nothing away from the fights. Their are so many and they are all so good. All anime fans should watch this at some point.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,7 July 2020
965,Naruto, NOT A DBZ RIPOFF,"OK, so I've watched 103 episodes so far of this series, and I have to say it, Naruto is original. Yes Mishimoto was a big follower of Toriyama, and in many ways Naruto is a sort of homage to him. But Naruto has a lot of things that DBZ was missing. First off, when characters die, THEY STAY DEAD!!!!! There is no special way to wish them back. Once they're gone they're gone. Second, music: the music in Naruto is 100X better then anything heard in DBZ. Dbz did have some cool themes, but Naruto is the only series where I have actually imported the soundtrack. There's almost nothing wrong with the soundtrack other then the usual soft theme. Granted it isn't a Yoko Kanno piece, but in essence not everything should be compared to the work she does because it invariably falls short. Thirdly, character development:<br/><br/>The characters develop feelings for each other, and you will find yourself developing feelings for the characters. There are animes that do that, but not to the extent Naruto does. I have cried multiple times while watching Naruto because of the pain that Naruto and Company have to go through. Mostly Naruto in his quest to become Hokage. In DBZ, I couldn't care less about what happened. Fourth, fights: There is nothing wrong with the length of the fights in Naruto. They're not too fast and they're not too unbearably long. The average fight lasts about 4 episodes. There is an exception to this in the 70s, but only because there are two fights going on at the exact same time. In short, download the first 20 episodes, which takes you through the first saga. Yes, 103 episodes is a lot of time, but the story will keep you engrossed. Also of note, Happy Birthday to the anime which turns 2 years old on Sunday Oct. 3rd. I give this a 9/10",91 out of 141 found this helpful.,10.0,1 October 2004
966,Naruto, Warning: Highly Addictive Show!,"I'm sure by now that you're read plenty of reviews that have exclaimed on its pros and cons, so I will only go into them very lightly.<br/><br/>Cons first. The animation isn't bad, but could be better. Meh...I'm fine with the animation, yet others seem to make a big deal over it. Whatever. Also, it has been mentioned often that Naruto is very like DBZ. That it is. Its main similarity/flaw is how long the fights take. Although its not as bad as DBZ, some fights take up to 3 or 4 episodes which is a bit drawn out. &gt;.&lt; Other than the intros and outros (which are wonderful!) the music is pretty bland. Meh. So those are all of the bad things I could think of. Seriously though, I like the series enough that I don't mind or even notice any of these 'flaws'. People just seem to like to complain about them.<br/><br/>Yay! Pro time! Again, lets touch on Naruto's similarities to DBZ. Naruto is head and shoulders above DBZ on almost every level. Naruto actually has GASP character depth and development! This is one of Naruto's strong points. The reason the series is so addictive is how likable all of the characters are. So even if you don't like the main characters (Naruto-loud, clumsy, strong willed. Sasuke-cold, angsty, strong. Sakura-love struck and smart) there are PLENTY of minor characters to satisfy any of your favorite character cravings. All of my favorite characters are side characters! Also, the villains have depth unlike DBZ. All of the villains actually have a reason (no matter how psychotic) to do what they do. Tragedy seems to be a big part of Naruto and almost every character has suffered including the villains.<br/><br/>OK, I'm done. I say Definitely check this series out, you'll become hooked, I promise! Keep a lookout for my favorite characters: Neji, Itachi and Gaara!! 9/10",52 out of 79 found this helpful.,,19 June 2005
967,Naruto, Amazing show.,"I have watched Naruto for about a year now and I have to say that it is one of the most engaging and developed anime shows ever. There are currently 146 episode, 2 specials, and 1 movie and all of them have something positive to contribute to the anime world. The only thing that slows the pace down is the flash back episodes, or the episodes where it is heavily based on dialog. The action in the show is fantastic and the animation in the show is done perfectly. But the one thing that makes this anime a cut above the rest is the music. With original recordings, the in show music is the icing on this already delicious cake. I highly recommend Naruto if you are looking for a deep, engaging anime show dripping in style and originality.",43 out of 65 found this helpful.,,18 August 2005
968,Naruto," Excellent ideas, good execution but the damn fillers....","Naruto seems to be one of the more popular anime nowadays. And why shouldn't it be? It has an interesting story and a good plot line. The action is exciting, the comedy is great, the characters are likable (except Sakura perhaps), the plot develops quite well and everything is very well performed.<br/><br/>But then again, there's also something a lot of anime succumb to. The wonderful world of fillers. Hell, it wouldn't be a big problem either if the fillers weren't the same damn story repeated over and over and over again. It's basically something like this: Naruto and company meet some guy/girl/creature who's different from the others and rejected by the society and Naruto goes 'You're like me'. Beat bad guys up, earn the new guy's trust, become friends, go home and never talk of the incident ever again. From about the 120th episodes to the end of the series there's nothing but this aforementioned nonsense. None of these episodes are nearly as memorable as the one actually related to the plot. Even other anime which are infested with fillers have them 1-2 episode long and they come in between the actual plot related episodes and they do NOT dominate the whole series, unlike Naruto.<br/><br/>If they had just made the series about 100 episodes with less(or none at all) fillers, this would've been much better. Lots of potential for a great anime down the drain. If you're looking for an anime with little to no fillers, I highly suggest One Piece.<br/><br/>Again, this is an above average anime which had the potential to be amazing but was ruined by the overuse of bland fillers.",14 out of 19 found this helpful.,6.0,14 December 2009
969,Naruto, Very good and addictive anime!,"I like anime, but am very picky and choosy with it. Most anime tends to stray from the storyline and go into something completely off the wall, or the subject matter to begin with is very juvenile. Not Naruto. The storyline is consistent and complete. Everything that happens which seems extraordinary is explained in detail, thus the viewer can keep up with what's going on. There is character growth and development. Naruto is based off a Japanese comic (manga) of the same name. A few episodes stray from the manga's storyline, these are generally bad episodes where the characters go against their nature... luckily they are short stints. In America the first 60 episodes are due to come out on toonami which was a horrendous choice for cartoon network. This will eliminate the adult aspects of the anime. I would've thought it would debut on adult swim. in Japan, up through episode 130ish, the story is consistent and enjoyable.",29 out of 44 found this helpful.,,20 September 2005
970,Naruto, Best Anime in my opinion,"DBZ may have a lot of action. It may have a lot of fights. A lot of people say DBZ is the best, and better than Naruto but I disagree. DBZ's storyline is not that good, but Naruto's is strong. Also, Naruto has some action too, and plus a great storyline it beats DBZ. It doesn't matter how much action a show has. It has to have a good storyline with it and that's where DBZ starts to fall apart. This is just my personal opinion. I hope that I have some people who support this because when I post comments like this somewhere else I feel like the odd man out. Anyway, this is what I feel and if anyone disagrees please comment back politely.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,3 March 2008
971,Naruto, Just a damn good story.,"Will people stop comparing this to Dragonball Z? It's not exactly difficult to be better than that.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll spare you the story set-up, it's been explained and re-explained. I will say, however, that the set-up doesn't give it justice at all. The sheer depth of all the different characters, and how they all flow seamlessly with each other is just mind-blowing. In particular, episode 19 is a tear-jerker, along with any of the episodes that show what happened to Gaara.<br/><br/>In essence, the story and characterization are the series' strong points, and they alone make it worth watching.<br/><br/>That and the music. It rises above the standards set for anime shows, with some of the most beautiful piano tunes and the most amazing hard-core guitar riffs.<br/><br/>Not without it's flaws, however. Nothing is. The animation can repeat itself a bit too much at times, and frankly, the filler episodes (espescially the humour in them) SUCK. Seriously, you can skip the ones that aren't important to the story, since the ones that are kick so much ass.<br/><br/>9/10. Go see it. NOW.<br/><br/>Wveth!<br/><br/>(P.S.

980,Dynasty," This series had so much potential, where did it all go wrong?","Season 1 started off so well, a good storyline, reasonable twists &amp; turns, and a lot wealthy people. Like most of the viewers, I started off slightly disliking Cristal 1.0 (Nat Kelley) and by the end of the season she was one of my favourite characters.<br/><br/>Then the producers fired Natalie Kelley (Cristal; the female lead) by never calling her back for Season 2, replacing her with Ana Brenda so that the producers could cash in on more international viewers in Spanish speaking countries.<br/><br/>On a whole season 2 was quite good but never really recovered from the damage done, there was till hope though, but then...<br/><br/>By the end of the season as the viewers finally end up accepting Ana (Cristal 2), guess what happened? Ana quit the series due to ""personal issues"". Has the CW never heard of a contract?<br/><br/>So instead of bringing back Cristal 1 they decided to recast Cristal 2 with a random actress no one knows or cares about (no offence).<br/><br/>I honestly feel like this is what the writers deserve, first they fired someone who was willing to remain on the show indefinitely, then they hire someone who probably wasn't, then she left.

1002,Marcella, Baffling writing no spoilers,"I can honestly say I've never seen anything quite like Marcella. Unfortunately I don't mean that it in a good way. 
The first season was entertaining if a little frustrating due to having plot points hanging in the air, but I could accept that as it was obvious those plot points would be picked up in season two. 
It was (note - was) a fairly standard police drama - gritty setting, messed up detective etc. Sure it was a bit silly and far fetched in places but it remained fairly grounded.
Then came the second season, and wow I don't know what happened in the writer's room, but someone, somewhere lost the plot.
Character after character is introduced to the point where there were so many stories going on that it became hard to keep track of everything. But don't worry I said to myself, at some point all of these stories will come together into an epic finale. And yet no they didn't, many were left unresolved, characters that had big parts for multiple episodes (if not most of the season) suddenly disappeared without trace never to be mentioned again. Worse still, each of the stories got more and more far fetched and unbelievable to the point where aliens could land and you'd probably just accept it.
For a police drama there was very little actual police work being carried out, every break in the case came from coincidence - which occurred at an increasingly alarming rate.
Many of the plot points from season once were reintroduced early on but then never mentioned again leaving parts of the story still unexplained.
Worse still, the writer even said in an interview that it didn't matter about the disappearing characters or unexplained plot points as it was just like real life in which we don't know what happens to everyone we meet. Ermmm well no actually, that isn't how writing in any form works.
Finally, I'm not sure how to even talk about the final episode of season two as fter all the ridiculous twists and turns, it ramps things up to 11. 
I think the editor must have edited in footage from a completely different show as the final ten minutes are probably the worst and most hilariously bad change of plot line I've ever seen. I'd almost recommend watching both seasons purely to see what I mean. If ever a show has been made up as the writer went along then it's this one. 
Sadly despite the awful writing (which to repeat is the worst I've ever seen), I probably would watch season 3 if there is one, because I can't wait for the episodes when she either:<br/><br/>A) wakes up and realised she's still a child and it was all just a nightmare after watching too many episodes of Paw Patrol.<br/><br/>Or <br/><br/>B) is saved by a Doc Brown who asks her to go back to the future to ride hover boards and save the world.",214 out of 275 found this helpful.,2.0,13 April 2018
1003,Marcella, Enjoying reading the reviews more than Season 2,"My husband and I sat through this entire second series waiting for all these wonderful actors to be given a coherent storyline. By the fifth or sixth episode we were fascinated by the strange new characters that appeared and the bizarre new personalities some of the main characters had to develop. Wow, we said, wonder how the writers are going to tie all this together for a semi-acceptable finale? Surprise, surprise, they didn't! We just figured by the time Marcella started chopping her hair and self-mutilating, the writer(s) must be teenaged offsprings of the producers on maintenance meds. <br/><br/>What a waste of time but terrific fodder for scathing reviews!",105 out of 131 found this helpful.,1.0,11 June 2018
1004,Marcella, So ridiculous,"Many reviewers have mentioned the excessive number of extraneous characters, the unresolved plot lines, and Marcella's questionable ability to do her job with her mental illness such as it is.<br/><br/>However, my biggest problem is with the main plot. How in the heck would a single mom have the time to be a serial killer? And she's supposed to be so diabolical that she was somehow holding the weirdo neighbor's mail-order girlfriend hostage, only to set up some weird camera angle thing to lead the cops to the hostage's dead body? 
And how did her first victim survive his lobotomy but none of the others did? <br/><br/>If the writers can't even get a single straightforward mystery that makes sense, I don't have any hope for season 3.",103 out of 130 found this helpful.,2.0,11 June 2018

We've all suffered through some dreck before, but season three was unforgivable. I can't see how it wont be a career killer for not just the writers but all of the cast as well. Anna Friel is a decent actress, but this was definitely a low point in her career. Her performance made me not want to see her in anything ever again. Granted, the script was a complete and total mess, but she didn't have the chops to save it.. as a matter of fact, she made it worse. It was so bad that everyone involved should just remove this series from their resumes.

1009,Marcella, Is it Just Me?,"As a Fifty something male of UK origin that grew up watching &amp; reading all kinds of police and detective thrillers, I have now seen something that warranted my writing a relatively negative review. Not because it was absolutely terrible, but it flatters to deceive and that in itself will fool people into watching something that really isn't that good.<br/><br/>Now it may be that I have just come out of watching several fantastic series (my opinion of course) namely Bosch, The Killing (all 4 US version series), The Following, The Fall, Happy Valley and Line of Duty (all three series at once, I was late to the party); and I may be suffering withdrawal from good character acting. But as I write this, tonight herald's the finale Of Marcella (series 1) and I am only looking forward to it on the basis that I sat through the previous 7 episodes and feel that I have invested all this time therefore I need some sort of dividend.<br/><br/>Surely I cannot be the only viewer that finds virtually all the characters unlikeable, derivative and, for the most part, shallow characterisations. Even Marcella's children seem to be ungrateful and unfeeling. The worst offenders, however, are DC Alex Dier the white female detective that prefers to dress in a male orientated fashion; and DC Mark Travis the (almost) idiot savant (treated as much). Both of these characters seem to have been ported over from the likes of NCIS, CSI, King &amp; Maxwell, Criminal minds et al, solely for the purpose of letting the viewer know that 'yeah, we're hip to what's going on in TV land over in the USA'. Very poor characters indeed.<br/><br/>The actors do what they can with what they have got, but it seems as though none of the characters have any flesh on their bones at all. What the hell Jamie Bamber, Patrick Baladi and Sinéad Cusack are doing walking on and walking off for 5 minutes every now and again seems to be yet more proof that absolutely no-one has any serious part to play other than Anna Friel.<br/><br/>I am further frustrated with the inclusion of so many niggly little things that HAVE been included that serve (seemingly) no purpose whatsoever. Why one character needs to be seen wetting himself with the onset of MS is totally beyond me, let alone the knicker fetish of another. It seems that the writer, Hans Rosenfeld, wanted to impress us with lots of little details but gives us no back story whatsoever to most of the major players.<br/><br/>The plot is interesting enough, with plenty of twists and turns and red herrings, but as of writing (just before the finale) we seem to have so many loose ends that it will be almost impossible to give satisfactory outcomes to them all in the space of an hour.<br/><br/>If there is anything in the finale to improve my review score I will revisit afterwards. Otherwise I am afraid to say that this is definitely not up there with the likes of Line of Duty or The Killing, better save your time for something else.<br/><br/>Edit. 19 05 2016 Have now seen the final episode. I don't think it would be fair to downgrade my 4 stars, but as I suspected, even though the plot was satisfied in general, the finer tendrils were left largely untouched with the viewer left predominantly to fill in the blanks as they see fit.<br/><br/>If you want to watch good foreign crime drama watch either the US or Danish versions of Søren Sveistrup's The Killing or the truly brilliant Line of Duty.

1011,Marcella, A Fiction Written by a Child,"I hope there will be no third season. The Swedish screenwriter Hans Rosenfeldt is a child who likes to shock and capitalize on not so bright people. His explanation of Season Two finale is childish and cold. Hans Rosenfeldt said that ""Marcella wanted Rav out of the way. He just talked her off the roof and she has really no idea what to do next. (This is the main reason that she assaulted Rav and handcuffed him). When she goes back into the incident room and sees the pair of scissors and all of that, that's when she subconsciously knew that she was going to try to erase herself. She was thinking, 'I can't be Marcella anymore. I don't want to be Marcella anymore. That's too hard for me to be, so I'm going to erase myself. Distort my face and erase myself.'""

1014,Marcella, Why is everyone so unlikeable in this show??,"I understand that the most interesting stories are always centered around flawed characters. However, so many of these characters are written to be increasingly unlikeable, and not in the ""interesting"" way. The worst offender is her ex, Jason. Why do the writers have him SO bent on being completely irredeemable and hateful? He has no base for 90% of his actions and I find it hard to believe they were ever a happy couple with how tastelessly revengeful and petty he is. But it's not just him. Marcella herself, though wonderfully acted, is completely unbelievable as a top detective. Most of her findings come from coincidence and someone with her type of ""episodes"" is hardly capable of the type of case work she does. Her head supervisor also seems to only have one role, and thats to tell her to NOT follow her instincts and to stay away from said suspect, basically ""because he said so"". And her kids... her KIDS. They hate her and are relentlessly cold and ungrateful for NO REASON WHATSOEVER. Like father, like offspring, I guess. So many unresolved plot points it gives LOST a run for its money.

1017,Marcella," First Series Barely Good,Second Series a Nightmare","In the first series we learn that Marcella is a brilliant detective with a problem: some horrible event in her past, which she can't remember, plus the death of her newborn daughter from 'cot death (called crib death or SIDS in this country), provoke panic attacks/fugue states in which she does things, often life-threatening, that she can't remember. Meanwhile, her husband is dumping her, she knows not why. She does some great detective work and eventually (very eventually) solves the overly complicated case, and that should have been enough. Unfortunately, the series got great reviews from people devoted more to histrionics than actual drama, paving the way for the lavishly violent, incredibly over plotted and utterly unbelievable second series. Here, almost every character--and there are WAY too many of them--is utterly despicable or a sicko of some sort. It starts with ritual murders of random children (17, it's eventually learned) for no known reason. The subtext is abandonment: Marcella has abandoned her family for her job; her husband has abandoned her for yet another woman (the first was murdered in Series 1, with Marcella made to look guilty for fake-drama purposes); her bosses (one of whom is sleeping with her) abandon the department to this nutcase who is a danger to herself and others; her children (a psychologically damaged 12-year-old son and a fairly level-headed 15(?)-year-old daughter) abandon her off and on; the boss who sleeps with her semi-abandons her for an ice-queen blonde who is a saintly do-gooder running a foundation for poor kids which is in turn threatened by the pig-capitalist husband to whom she is non-credibly married and whose tone-deaf behavior would send Bernie Sanders into cardiac arrest. Then there is the lesbian couple demoralized by financial troubles because of failed in-vitro treatments, which leads one of them, who works at the Foundation, to get involved in a lucrative blackmail scheme in the ice queen's behalf to pay for another shot at in vitro, even though she doesn't want a kid anyway, while the one who DOES want a kid tries to get pregnant the conventional way by inviting some random saloon lout to violently shag her in a restroom toilet stall. There's also a sick member of Marcella's squad, who uses his tech expertise to spy on her home life. At first furious, Marcella cools off when she realizes that she can a) blackmail the guy into digging up dirt on her husband's lover and b) get proof that her husband was trying to blackmail HER. A marginally sympathetic customer in the first series, he's despicable in Series 2. During one of Marcella's attacks he slashes and bruises himself; when she 'comes to,' so to speak, blackmails her: if she doesn't sign over the kid, he'll tell the court how she knifed and beat him, thus costing her not only the kids but her career. Meanwhile the latest kidnap victim just barely escapes from his country-house dungeon and is given a lift by passing motorists, but any hope of great-god-almighty-and-ending at-last is quickly dashed--bashed, really, when the rescuing motorists' car gets into a competition with an oncoming train and wins the silver medal. This give the scriptwriters the chance to produce another kidnapping, and the victim, wouldn't you know it, is Marcella's son! From here we proceed to the further lunacy required to ID and nail the killer who is--well, you wouldn't guess in a million years because it's totally made up and straight out of left field. Enough? But wait--there's more, as they say on TV. In fact there are TWO more endings coming!. First, it has already been established that Marcella is seeking help for her mental derangement via laughably silly recovered-memory therapy: the therapist simply says she'll count down from 5 and presto! Marcella will go back to the Terrible Thing that occurred. And that first time, she almost makes it. Now, after the serial killer is caught and her son has been saved, Marcella goes back for more therapy. She voyages back to the very day and place of the Terrible Thing--her newborn baby's nursery. The infant has colic and has been screaming her bloody head off without letup for two solid days. (This scene feels as if it were filmed in real time.) Alone, with no one to help her, distraught, frantic and on the edge, Marcella hugs the infant to her breast and, overdoing that as she does everything else, accidentally suffocates the child. This in time leads her to the ledge on the roof of police HQ, thinking to end it all. But then a fellow officer who has been nothing but a cold fish for all of two seasons, suddenly turns all melty compassionate and pulls her back. OK? Well, sort of. She compromises by slashing herself with her scissors and running off into the night. In the SECOND extra ending she's found sleeping rough under a bridge, looking homeless and destitute, which she is. But then she is wakened by a stranger from some mysterious, off-the-record enforcement agency. The squat she had been living in, he says, has burnt to the ground, its occupants so badly incinerated they had to be ID'd by DNA. Since Marcella's DNA was found there, she has been made officially and legally dead. And that, my friends, is exactly the kind of non-person the mysterious agency needs to carry out its mysterious deeds. Thus is the stage set for the threat of yet a third season of Marcella. The wise viewer is well advised to imitate the actions of Brave Sir Robin:Run away! Run away!",44 out of 61 found this helpful.,3.0,23 June 2018
1018,Marcella, Disappointing,"Being a fan of murder mysteries (especially British) I anticipated that ""Marcella"" would be on par with others I have loved (Luther, Broadchurch, The Missing). I was sadly disappointed.<br/><br/>The characters, story line, and crimes were interesting - in fact the acting was good. But the writing is lazy. SPOILER alert: when the great reveal happens in the last episode, we discover that the killer murdered a number of other people (pretty much chosen at random) to mask the fact that he wanted to kill the one person he was after. Very weak writing - I was let down. Not the kind of writing I was used to.<br/><br/>In addition the killing of the little girl seems to have been inserted into the show to provide a clue that eventually got the killer caught. There was no other connection to the little girl at all.<br/><br/>It is normal for shows like this to have a lot of ambiguity and confusion throughout - after all you do not want everything revealed or it would not be a mystery.

Legend of Korra gives strongly made backstory of the villains and heroes alike. They gave strong reasons to why the villains are rebelling and why the heroes are going against it. Its not those cliché 'I want to take over the world.' like the first series.<br/><br/>For anyone who does not consider watching this because its a cartoon, its from nickelodeon and its main character is not a slender and well toned skinned hottie.

1027,The Legend of Korra, My early 2c: A more energetic and fast-paced sequel,"The Avatar is back and this time she is a teenager who is far from calm and peaceful.<br/><br/>Compared to Avatar: The Legend of Aang, this sequel has its own appeal: it's really energetic, featuring mostly city environments, has an older cast than the one in Aang, and just has an overall faster, flashier and more forceful pace than its predecessor. That makes it a lot of fun, and a very exciting show, but at times it also makes it hard for me to warm up to the cast, and hard to just take a moment of contemplation, peace, and relaxation like I would with The Last Airbender.<br/><br/>Visually, like ""Aang"", this show is stunning. Beautiful, intricate and unique environments, with lots of fluid and well-crafted motion. Awesome soundtrack with the series' trademark mix of eastern and western music, but ""Korra's"" music is more rocky and jazzy, to match with the show's tempo, than ""Aang's"" smooth and calm scores. The storyline seems to be picking up quite nicely as well, with civil conflict brewing up in Republic City. The show is definitely making its own path and tone, and setting itself apart from ""Aang"".<br/><br/>But I still found myself really missing ""Aang's"" serene environments, gentler characters, and the cute, quirky humor. In fact I kind of found it hard to warm up to the characters in ""Korra""....Korra is overall a very cool character, but is too aggressive and forceful. I hope that changes throughout the show, as Avatar always shows the evolution of its characters. Her newfound city friends, as well, are not that likable and their friendship is a little distant -- Aang, Katara and Sokka's friendship was as naturally progressing, fun, and close as they get. I also really miss the silly humor! Who can forget the cabbage seller from ""Aang"", and Sokka's silliness. With ""Korra""'s older cast and a very serious conflict and villain already introduced and confronted, I really want more humor to balance the show out.<br/><br/>I think the show needs to calm down a bit, take a breath, and let its characters meaningfully interact a little more before ramping up the action to the 1000th degree. Still, a flaw due to excess is better than a flaw due to lack. The Legend of Korra is an excellent and well-crafted show, and I look forward to seeing it form into a series worthy of its predecessor.",396 out of 571 found this helpful.,5.0,22 April 2012
1028,The Legend of Korra," Just as good, but harder to watch (emotionally)","To those uncertain about The Legend of Korra: watch it. It is every bit as good as the original Avatar series was. Set in a more modern world, the new avatar is faced with struggles of a different kind, struggles that relate more to our modern world. Technology is booming, crime is rising, and a revolution is awakening. This is much more real than the last series was.<br/><br/>The characters are built incredibly realistic, too. Korra is a revolutionary heroine: she is realistic, imperfect, hasty, rebellious... all the things that a teenager girl really would be. Faced with difficult decisions, she doesn't always choose the right ones, yet she always learns from them. The other characters also show these strenghts and weaknesses along with equal depth to the characters of The Last Airbender.<br/><br/>While different, troubled, and darker than the original, everyone should give The Legend of Korra a chance.

The only downside I can think of is that, because the series will only concludes two seasons, is that, in my opinion, everything's a bit rushed. It's like they want to fit a lot of content into the 2 season time-frame. On the other hand, the series is brilliantly detailed, just like its predecessor, and has it's typical quirky humour.

1030,The Legend of Korra, Gorgeous animation cannot mask weak writing,"...Or at least it shouldn't. I was shocked at the 8.6 rating this show has. Now before we get to the review let me say this: I WATCHED THE FIRST SEASON OF KORRA BEFORE I EVEN TOUCHED THE LAST AIRBENDER SERIES. I had no bias, no expectations. I was drawn to Korra by its beautiful animation, the dark plot, and the 1920s-inspired setting. I had heard of ATLA and had friends who were fans but I myself was never interested until I watched this show. At first, it was looking to be one of the best animated programs on television, perfect for kids and adults alike, but as the season wandered on, the quality plummeted.<br/><br/>The main plot itself is great: several non-benders are joining a terrorist organization after being mistreated by the benders for decades and there is question as to whether or not the avatar is even relevant in the modern world. You'd think the writers would have had a field day with this concept. They do not. Instead they waste time with one of the worst love squares in fiction.I think the writers did this because of the fans' interest in the romance of the first series, arguing over whether Katara belonged with Aang or Zuko. I say let the fans' do all that romantic speculation and save the soap opera plots for their fan fiction. If they wanted romance, then they should have kept it all low key.<br/><br/>The characters had so much potential to be great. Korra is the anti-Aang: more physical than spiritual, impulsive, and competitive. It would have been cool to see her grow as a character, but instead she gets everything handed to her on a silver platter by the season finale: she loses her most of her bending ability and we're tantalized with the idea that the next season will involve her getting in touch with her spiritual side, slowly regaining her power. Nope, instead she sheds one tear and all of a sudden ghost Aang shows up saying, ""Congratulations, you've gotten in touch with your spirituality! Here's all your powers back and then some!"" Stupid.<br/><br/>Mako and Bolin are terribly handled as well. Mako is truly appalling, stringing one girl along and then abandoning her for the main character. He doesn't break a sweat when his brother (whom he is supposedly protective of) is kidnapped by terrorists, but when Korra is taken he flies into hysterics. And the creators want us to like him. Yeah right. Bolin starts out cool, but slowly devolves into a watered down version of Sokka who exists only to pine after Korra and make wisecracks while the other characters do the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>And then there's poor Asami, the one decent character of the main four. She's lost her mother, become estranged from her father who disowns her once she refuses to accept his radical political views, and now has to deal with Mako, who tells her he loves her whilst he makes out with Korra while Asami's sleeping a few feet away. He never even takes responsibility for it. Poor girl... Luckily most of the minor characters are interesting, in particular the antagonist Amon and Toph's daughter Lin, a metalbending police chief.<br/><br/>For those who say the writers were handicapped by having only twelve episodes to work with, let me give you an example of why this assumption is hogwash. There's an excellent anime called Princess Tutu (2002) and its first season is in many ways a self-contained narrative. With only thirteen episodes to work with, they packed in as much character development and plot as they could, and did it extremely well. Korra has no excuse. It should not have wasted its time with so much filler and teenage hormones if the writers were so concerned about having only twelve episodes.<br/><br/>As of this writing, season two is set to come out next month. The only reason I gave this series a rating of six instead of four is because it's not over yet. I cross my fingers that the writers have learned from their mistakes and improved significantly.",239 out of 392 found this helpful.,4.0,11 August 2013
1031,The Legend of Korra, Gets better each episode,"I enjoyed the previous series, ""The Last Airbender,"" and I had been checking every month or so to see if the new ""Legend of Korra"" had been released yet. Yesterday I realized that five or six episodes had been released so I watched them all while typing up some notes for school. I have to say, the first couple of episodes I was pretty worried. Many of the characters seemed very harsh and unlikable. Yet, as I got to know them better, I really started to like them and enjoy the show. ""Legend of Korra"" is lacking the hilarity which made ""Airbender"" so fun to watch, yet it is replaced with more menace, intrigue, and (I want to use the adjective ""page-turning"") excitement. The bits of humor that are present are perfect and I think they have captured a good balance. I'm really hooked. 9/10. The one missing star is in case the show takes a turn for the worse.",141 out of 238 found this helpful.,9.0,14 May 2012
1032,The Legend of Korra, Good new elements (although some are too much),"The Legend of Korra starts pretty high paced and the new avatar is found fast, in contradiction to the previous series (where they take more time with the intro). This means that the adventure also start fast. Also, note that you should have seen the ""Avatar, the Last Airbender"" before you watch this one.<br/><br/>They have put some new concepts (for this series), like: after 70 years there is new some new technology, more love story, and a lot in the city (where Aang travels a lot over the entire world). I like this, but I have the feeling that there is a little too much, like too much new technology and too much love. I would have found it better that some technology is still being developed or missing (which other technology could be made clumsy in use). But there are also some new cool elements, such as the way of telling what has happened ""previously on avatar"", and a new sports game. <br/><br/>The humor is still good (I had a very good laugh somewhere in episode 10), and it's nice to see some of the previous (aged) characters back. I rate this 8/10 because of I really like the concept of newer technology in a fantasy world. But not higher because some elements are a little too much (to my opinion). Anyway, I couldn't stop watching and saw this entire season straight.",86 out of 145 found this helpful.,8.0,10 July 2012
1033,The Legend of Korra," Not as good as the prequel, but still the best Animation in awhile","Legend of Korra appeals to be way more mature than its prequel: The Last Airbender. Whilst that gives an edge to Korra, it also removes that childish and innocent humor enveloped in rather serious conflict. <br/><br/>Still, do not be fooled - Legend of Korra is an impressive animation work; it goes flawlessly in graphic and motion design, it doesn't lack a humor nor a good, intriguing story. Korra is basically everything Aang wasn't: She's stubborn, hasty, inpatient and not as shy as Aang. I think they made quite a good move here since we already have three season with over twenty episodes to watch a mindful, calm and shy Aang. The gathering, or gang if you wish, are also kind a different. There's that innocent, teen ""Love squared"" as I like to call it which is more amusing than serious, though. Then there's again one ""wisdomous"" guy with only patience and non-conflict solution on his mind. There are also many others; lots and lots of different characters that you will surely enjoy in. It's actually still early to judge the show because it unravels itself episode by episode. As the more episodes are aired, the more you realize about the story of Republic City and all its mysteries. <br/><br/>To short the long talk, Legend of Korra is most likely more mature than the Last Airbender (which actually brings another question: if Tenzin is the Aang's only child (or so I understood), then there's only four (upcoming fifth) remaining Airbenders - We'll see), with not so much a childish humor (which is still there, don't worry) and a story which untangles really slowly and forces you to watch the show from episode to episode. If you loved the prequel, you'll love its sequel.",104 out of 179 found this helpful.,9.0,21 May 2012
1034,The Legend of Korra, A lackluster series that fails on so many levels...,"I've waited patiently until the conclusion of TLOK to finally write this review. I am huge fan of ATLAin fact I feel it is one of the best animated series out there and give it a solid 10/10. From the very first episode you are drawn into a world where the story telling and character development are top notch along with some well balanced humor and even a splash of romance. We were able to not only see but also feel the struggles the characters faced and how it changed them. It was a unique series that despite being made for children, appealed greatly to adults as well. Now, let's get back to TLOK.<br/><br/>I thought the first season was okay, but it had promise. I didn't like all of the characters and the pro bending stuff wasn't my cup of tea, but heyit was more Avatar! However after this the show just continued to get worsewith some exceptions being the Avatar Wan episodes which were simply incredible – in my opinion on par with some of the best ATLA episodes. But despite a few decent episodes this show just kept missing the mark and then concluded with a lackluster ending that was unfortunately a fitting end to this poorly written series.<br/><br/>I always think back to the very first episode of ATLA where Zuko states ""You're the airbender? You're the Avatar?"" which still gives me goosebumps as I sit here writing about it! It grabbed you in the gut, made you pay attention and care about the characters. ATLA did this masterfully with almost every episode. TLOK failed at this miserably with very, very few exceptions.<br/><br/>Gripes That Ruined This Show: <br/><br/>1) The Radio Announcer: Holy hell was this guy annoying! He needed to die.<br/><br/>2) Love Triangles: TLOK uses this to the extreme and I mostly blame the idiot fans for this. Any one out there ever been in a real life love triangle? I haveand they are not fun at allin fact they destroy people's lives. Hands down, the most stupid and overused plot device in modern storytelling.<br/><br/>3) Cookie Cutter Villains: Every season of LOK revolves a megalomaniac villain who wants to take over the world and preach their drivel to the masses. Amon was pretty goodbut each season we get the same type of evil nut jobsame crap, same story. No new ground broken here...lazy writing at its worst!<br/><br/>4) Prejudice against the old characters. We get a little tease of them, but now they are all mostly old and feeble. I guess King Bumi was an exception? <br/><br/>But my biggest complaint about this show is that while the premise was that it was ""more adult oriented"" the show ends up taking a huge step backwards into kiddie land. If you actually compare the two serieslook closely at how many silly over the top characters are in TLOKand then look at the more serious tone of ATLA. Let me explain further.<br/><br/>At first I liked the fact that the creators were not afraid to jump 70 years into the futurehowever they didn't really change anything. We have two annoying animals to replace Appa and Momo and they are p!ss poor replacements at best. And then there is a fatal overdose of what I call The Sokka Factor. Sokka's antics were silly and at times annoyingyet his character evolved and he got serious when called to action. If you really wanted a more grown up showhow about leaving this silly humor OUT OF THE NEW SERIES? Well the opposite happens because the writers dump on it us by the truckload!<br/><br/>This brings me to Bolin's character, who along with his wooden brother Mako were both a complete waste of animation and provided nothing new or interesting to the series. I watched the entire first two seasons several times before I actually memorized their names. This is a testament to how worthless I found them and how little I cared for their characters. Bolin's character continues to get more and more stupid and annoyingand then is joined by Bumi, Varrick and finally the most worthless character in the entire Avatar Universe, Prince Wu. This diarrhea overload of silly Jar-Jar Binks ""humor"" got so bad that I started counting how many minutes of each episode were devoted to these idiotic characters spouting off their stupidity and waving their arms around. I could almost see the writers in a room with a bunch of storyboards: <br/><br/>""OK we start this episode with a little serious story telling to tease the audienceand then BRING ON THE SOKKA! More silliness! Get him on the soapbox waving his arms and being SILLY! The kids love this crap, goddammit! OK, then we have another 2-3 minutes of some personal struggle of Korra'swait not too much since we want to save the big reveal about Zuko/Toph or anything intelligent fans might actually care about for the next episodeand then GIVE ME MORE SILLY SOKKA!"" o_O<br/><br/>Just watch how much screen time, especially in season 4 is given to this drivel. It's such a damn shame. Made for adults my ass!<br/><br/>And as a final insult, we get a ridiculous ""Dumbledore is gay"" ending. Fan pandering at its finest! <br/><br/>To the writers and creators of this showyou had us by our heart strings with ATLAyou really did. Then you allowed that horrible movie to be made. And then this crappy series. I'm extending my middle finger at my screen and THIS IS FOR YOU and all your stupid fans who actually supported this insipid drivel! <br/><br/>In conclusion I can best sum up the failure of The Legend of Korra and the future of this franchise by providing a movie quote spoken by Mako himself:<br/><br/>""Success can test one's mettle as surely as the strongest adversary"".<br/><br/>Case closed.",181 out of 325 found this helpful.,3.0,23 December 2014
1035,The Legend of Korra, Barely a sequel,"The reason why Avatar: The Last Airbender was so great was because it took a fairly simple good vs evil conflict, and as the story progressed, it became more nuanced and morally gray by exploring the ambitions of the heroes and villains.<br/><br/>The exact opposite holds true for The Legend Of Korra, where every season starts off with the potential for a complex and nuanced story, yet almost always turns into a contrived, black &amp; white, good vs evil conflict, and every seemingly sympathetic villain turns out to be a generic Big Bad that just used the Philosophy of the Day to hide their true intentions, with Season 2 being clearest example of this.<br/><br/>The characters are all bland, with the possible exclusion of Korra's teacher, Tenzin. Team Avatar itself feels extremely disconnected and its members treat eachother less like best friends and more like awkward coworkers. The humor is cringey, the romance is horrific and the writing feels like Fan Fiction at times, with some ridiculous new additions to the Avatar Universe (Pokémon Spirits, Giant Demon Kites, Laser Titans and Giant Robots FFS) <br/><br/>Overall, The Legend Of Korra is superficially entertaining, and what it has in visual appeal, it lacks in depth and emotion. It focuses more on trying to be edgier and darker than Avatar that it completely loses focus on crafting a good story and compelling characters, thus the supposedly ""mature themes"" fail to leave any impact.",94 out of 168 found this helpful.,4.0,30 June 2018
1036,The Legend of Korra, They didn't need to milk the cash cow,"Korra - Creator's pet. Instead of being a goal oriented, focused, good role model for girls like Katara, she has the personality of a 90's Disney princess -- rebellious free-spirit that needs a man to be happy. <br/><br/>Bolin - The reincarnation of Sokka. Jokes tend to fall flat; mediocre comic relief.<br/><br/>Mako - Creator's pet #2. He has Batman's backstory, but the dimensions of a piece of paper and the personality of a sock. He only exists to serve as a love interest for Korra and to keep Bolin from feeling lonely.<br/><br/>Asami- One of the very few characters worthy of sympathy. Her dad's a lunatic, her mom is dead (unless there's a cliché twist coming up), and Mako left her for someone less interesting and not as good-looking.<br/><br/>Tenzin - Tenzin is the strict, father-figure mentor that you've seen a million times before. He'll use the ""you disobeyed me"" speech, and then at the end of the episode come to an understanding. Cliché.<br/><br/>Lin - Jim Gordon as a female. She plays by the book, unless she's pushed.<br/><br/>Amon - Would have been a great antagonist if he hadn't gone the terrorist route like Bane. He and his brother are the most developed characters of the series, and they're killed off!<br/><br/>Many fans will defend the show's lack of character development by saying ""Michael and Bryan thought they only had 12 episodes to work with. How could they do better?"" Here's how:<br/><br/>1) Pro-bending shouldn't exist. It wastes time. Remove pro-bending and you have at least an extra 15 minutes to move the story along, develop characters, etc.<br/><br/>2) Remove the melodramatic romances. This is suppose to be an Avatar sequel, not the Winx club. The original series did fine without episodes focusing on relationship angst, and this show would've done fine as well.<br/><br/>Other problems with this series are as follows: <br/><br/>Rushed ending - The creators should have left some things ambiguous instead of cramming in 6 resolutions in the last 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Lack of action - The original series spanned over numerous cities and had adventure at every turn. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with staying in one city, I just wish the show stayed faithful to its trailer -- action-packed.<br/><br/>Cheating - Affairs in a kids show? Isn't this rated Tv-Y7? How are we suppose to care for Korra and Mako when all they do is hurt people and get away with it without repercussions.<br/><br/>Equalist plot - It fell short. I wish there was more focus on this and lesser focus on the crap I mentioned above.<br/><br/>How the series can improve: <br/><br/>1) Give the equalists a new leader, and make that person a political extremist -- not a down right terrorist.<br/><br/>2) Focus on story, not romance.<br/><br/>3) Let those who do wrong pay for it.<br/><br/>4) Expand on the equalist plot. Let them form mobs. Make it the equalist vs benders with Korra stuck in the middle.<br/><br/>5) Let Korra work for something. Give her a conflict; stop letting things come easy to her and don't let Aang's spirit work as a deus ex machina anymore.<br/><br/>The second season may improve, and the show may become good at one point, but it will never compare to the original. As it stands currently, this show doesn't need to exist. It plays out like a bad fanfiction.",133 out of 245 found this helpful.,5.0,28 December 2012
1037,The Legend of Korra, A must-watch for EVERY avatar fan!!!,"It's very rare to come by a good, western-animated show that has so much depth, emotions and darker/more complicated themes to it. The avatar series, and the legend of korra specifically, are absolutely top notch with combining deeper themes and animation. The show's artstyle is stunning with very well thought out battle scenes. The story follows Korra's journey of realizing herself as the avatar, post- 100 year war and Aang's time, where she has to deal with incredibly well written villains, the declining image of the avatar in a more modern world and mental struggles all at once! It's never easy being the avatar, and the writers sure didn't go easy on her and her team.<br/><br/>The main reason why it's so fun watching this show is because it EXPANDS on an already great universe, created in the first series, with Aang. I can never get enough of it! If you consider yourself an avatar fan- GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW. I can 100% guarantee you won't regret it and have a great time.",28 out of 45 found this helpful.,10.0,28 August 2020
1038,The Legend of Korra, Korra is just amazing! A perfect start as a sequel to The Last Airbender!,"Just watched 2 episodes of Korra.... and I must say it's more than what i expected. Didn't expect the same fun from Korra as last air bender... But Korra turned out to be a lot fun... Though the sequel is set 70 years after the original series, though there's no Aang and the Team Avatar... New Avatar is as much fun, you'll just fall in love with this character.. Last Airbender is been a favorite animation of mine, since i started watching it, back in 2008... I even have this thing, of watching it at least once a year... So i'm just glad that Korra started out to be a perfect sequel for the original series... Animation is better than The Last Airbender and action is brilliantly done... Music just gave goosebumps... So if you are a Last Airbender fan then let's just say that you'll have a big smile on your face while watching Korra... If you are not a fan then still you would have that smile...

1039,The Legend of Korra," Avatar, what have you become...","I really have no words to justify 'The Legend of Korra', only that it is just a huge waste of your precious time. This is mostly a hate comment by the way and therefore it has only some MINOR SPOILERS. For more depth I recommend to watch the video's of E;R on YouTube, because I have pretty much the same opinion as well and I think he explains his very accurate. You probably wasting your time reading this review, so I like to start with the conclusion first. <br/><br/>The Legend of Korra is a huge insult to arguably the best animated TV series ever made by telling an extremely poor written sequel with almost no character development. So if you are that person who are looking for a series with a bit of the same intelligence like the original ATLA, then I suggest you avoid this ""Legend of Korra"" at any costs(I am probably too late with this), because it only triggers the hype-button, nothing more. <br/><br/>I stuck around only the first season of this series, because the concept of the story was not ALL that terrible, however in the end of season 1 they managed to mess things anyway... The amount of plot holes in that episode became so spontaneously big, that I could not stand it much longer, so eventually I quit watching it. <br/><br/>Now for the long version...<br/><br/>First I want to tell that Avatar The Legend of Aang is for me the best animated TV series by choice. However, this sequel, with its own level of logic, plots, character development, scripts, and so on and so on... well it does not reach even close to the original(typical for sequels nowadays). I can't even find the connection in this show with ATLA and that is because of all the in-corrections in the history of the ATLA. Did Michael and Bryan ever watched their previous show?! Also 'Respect' is so hard to find in TLOK, that it is like finding a Siberian Tiger in your own backyard. Respect and discipline were always the important factors of learning a new element. Speaking of elements, I can't believe that Korra can already control three elements from the start of the show(I simply can't believe that this was just approved), even though they are living in a time of peace. Now Aang managed to control the other three elements just in a couple of months at the age of twelve, but even at his age(12) that is almost impossible. Now we see that Korra can bend 3 elements at the age of 4, but how?! She is after all not a disciplined character to say the least unlike Aang. I just can't find any logic in this element-bending system.<br/><br/>I also can not find any adult-thinking characters in this series(which supposed to be more mature). The moments that made me cringe are countless, especially all those awkward dialogues with the endless stupidity of the main characters. Bolin is at the top of that list. Bolin is probably meant to be the ""Sokka"" character in the story. However he does not have the intelligence nor the humor to make him even act a bit like Sokka. Humor was not what made Sokka so successful as a character, it is about the contrast with the comedy he brought and his mature act in the group. He wants to be a leader and he wants to help and he got things done with his creative idea's even though he is a non-bender all along. Bolin on the other hand is just acting dumb in order to be funny and that is by far not enough to built up his ""character"". <br/><br/>As for Korra, the creators really made it hard to make Korra's character likable. Korra is a rash, arrogant and sensitive character with a small amount of patience and I am completely fine with that. Her personality also kinda reminds me of Po from 'Kung Fu Panda'. Po also has a rash character, with a dream of becoming a legendary warrior. He showed off in front of the furious five hoping to pass the test in their presence and even impress them. He failed the test and he felt like a loser that he will never become a true Kung Fu Warrior. This setup worked because we saw the character of Po change by taking away the hopes of the main character. This gives us the opportunity to sympathize with them and there is no single time in The Legend of Korra that gave that opportunity for well almost every character actually. Korra still remain the same rash, sensitive, arrogant character like in the beginning, who still letting people do stuff for her, because she is the avatar.<br/><br/>There is simply nothing in this show that gave more value to the avatar universe. In fact it is rather destroying it and the more I think about it, the more I believe that this is not a coincidence.",87 out of 158 found this helpful.,3.0,1 April 2017
1040,The Legend of Korra, Korra Sue starring in How to Destroy a Good Thing,"Without going at lengths through the accomplishments of the spiritual forefather of this series, let it be noted that A:TLA revolutionized the animated series scene when it came out, a testament to the power of higher-quality animation and good writing. With that in mind, a sequel, with the same people at helm, was a thrilling prospect.<br/><br/>Up until coming face to face with the creation, that is. LoK borrows many elements from A:TLA, and could have conceivably done a fairly good job of preserving the central aspects of the A:TLA universe while tweaking it for a new audience. Instead, the fans of the original were pelted with, metaphorical, dung pies all the way from the title character mastering three of the four elements by age four to the awful, contrived ending where the casual viewer was berated for wearing hetero lenses when the romance took an unexpected turn.<br/><br/>The show as a whole undermines the notion of an Avatar, reduces what have been beloved characters to mere jokes and has the audacity to pat itself on the back for destroying the legacy left behind by Aang and co. What is the point of the Avatar training and going around the world when Korra Sue can bend three elements by age four? What is so great about Iroh entering the spirit world when there is an accessible portal through which most anyone can pass? Why is the Avatar in any way special when the Turtles might have bestowed their powers upon any other mortal who would then go on to fuse with Raava? The answers can only be the following: none, nothing and he/she isn't.<br/><br/>I suppose they tried re-framing the origins and demystifying the concept of Avatar, but Bryke seem to have overlooked that half the fun is in the mystery.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the animation is of good quality and the music likewise contributes to the atmosphere. But these factors can only do so much. One needs a good story to work with. Which story is not to be found here.<br/><br/>If one watches the series without a single iota of an expectation, then it will surely please. For those of us expecting more than a pretty picture , however, it will likely leave a sour aftertaste, be advised when choosing to watch this.<br/><br/>3/10 is the score I give it, and those three points go to animation and music, and nothing else besides.",112 out of 211 found this helpful.,3.0,15 April 2017
1041,The Legend of Korra, Simply should not have been made...,"(Note) this review is based largely on the first series, the second is slightly more tolerable but still didn't hook me enough to watch more than the first six episodes.<br/><br/>Avatar: The Legend of Korra is not without its positives. The need to differentiate itself from its predecessor goes without saying and the steam punk setting is interesting, blending modern sensibilities with themes like industrial expansion and political revolution. The summaries of the episodes, told in a sepia old-movie style with a posh British commentator are genuinely exciting and the music is jazzy and upbeat. However, there is little else of merit in this deeply flawed re- imagination of the Avatar universe.<br/><br/>The opening credits of The Last Airbender were narrated enthusiastically by Katara, they created anticipation. J.K. Simmons, who can be interesting, is positively lack-luster by comparison. And Tenzin, whilst delivering the odd amusing line or gesture, is just boring. Korra too is unlikable. Of course she has to be different to Aang but she is constantly whining and very hard to sympathise with as a result. The inevitable romantic sub-plot is not believable, how does anyone fall for someone so mopey? Bolin is a failed attempt to recreate Sakka in that he isn't particularly funny and Mako is too serious. In its rush to create an extravagant plot, it forgets character development, which was what underpinned The Last Airbender - Zuko being the greatest example in his defection from the Fire Nation.<br/><br/>Throughout, the question is raised: how can stoic and bland Tenzin even be related to the playful and interesting Aang? It is answered in a flashback where Aang is depicted, astonishingly, as not only weak but as a dull character, telling Toph to stop calling him nicknames, something that the old Aang would never have done. Not even with the additional and strenuous pressure of uniting the land. Being the Avatar is no longer a privilege, it is just a title, a word even and though this may make it seem grittier, it has no more relevance than, for example, Useful Pro-Bending Player: The Legend of Korra. <br/><br/>The frequent use of blood-bending is very problematic, as it was symbolic of human depravity before, it was a moral issue, could a person ever stoop so low as to physically control another human? Could it ever be right? Now, it is used flippantly and its gravitas is diminished. Similarly with the ability bestowed upon the avatar to remove bending, another moral issue, born out of Aang's desperation not to end the Fire Lord's life and supposedly only possible for the pure of spirit. Again, tossed around trivially until it loses its meaning.<br/><br/>To see people comparing The Legend of Korra and The Last Airbender in the same breath is staggering. Korra's adventures seem to try their very best to trample over and defile the memories of Aang and it is a real, real shame. As a stand-alone series, it might be passable but it is impossible to ignore comparisons between the two. It could have been so much more but it just leaves a bitter taste in the mouth and is a dip back into the Avatar universe that ultimately should not have been taken.",97 out of 182 found this helpful.,3.0,16 March 2014
1042,The Legend of Korra," Can't believe I'm saying this, but ...","The Legend of Korra seriously takes some steps into the right direction by throwing in some more or less ""new"" concepts (new as new for Avatar) such as love stories and relationships from the get go and a more ""modern"" world. If you watched the original Avatar (if you didn't go right to it) you may appreciate that, although Korra really has some of Avatar's good old content such as fast-paced element-bender battles, it also feels new and fresh and in no way ""forced"" to be a sequel on it's own. If it really will be as entertaining and as good as the prequel only time can tell but for now (seen 6 episodes so far) the story is more promising than I ever could have imagined it to be. Last but not least I really want to point out the storytelling: If you pay attention you'll notice that the script for this series is much more than just a foolish attempt to catch the fame of ""Avatar"": Many old characters can be ""found"" here, revived as new roles. Great humor and action awaits.",91 out of 172 found this helpful.,10.0,27 May 2012
1043,The Legend of Korra, I still can't believe these are the same writers of The Last Airbender,"First of all, what the legend of korra did right: amazing art style, old timey feel of the introduction and narration of each episode and giving us hope of expanding the world of the original Avatar series and the stories of the characters we loved. Now the train wreck.<br/><br/>The legend of korra promised several things from the very beginning, the world we loved but with 1920's-1930's based culture and technology, a better understanding of the spirit-world and a female main character (still unfortunately underdone in superhero archetypes with the result that a lot of people will over look a lot of the flaws in writing of the series), but it wasn't enough. If you will recall the first couple episodes of the first avatar, they were fairly poorly written, the characters were still one dimensional but after that the episode quality slowly improved. The legend of korra begins with a slightly better first episode but then the episodes get worse. The first half of seasons 1 and 3 were okay but the ending of each season were generally bad with the last half of season 2 and all of season 4 being laughably bad to the point that they had to rely on flashy gimmicks just to try and keep people's attention, such as demystifying the avatar (which I will get into later) and making korra start off straight and then become gay.<br/><br/>The demystification of the avatar was the worst of it, the avatar is supposed to represent the most upright person in the entire world, one who stands for justice and freedom, and yet they start him off(you get to learn about the first avatar) as a thief who tricks his way into getting and keeping his powers of firebending and then befriends a spirit who fuses with his soul to allow him to get the rest of the elements. They then also take away korras ability to contact any of the past avatar lives and never restore it. <br/><br/>Also, the fight scenes didn't resemble fighting so much as dancing while showing off their flashy moves. There was no apparent understanding of what a fight was or how to win it, you might as well watch the ""The Funniest Ever Black Belt Masters Showing Skills"" on youtube. Furthermore, it seemed like every villain in the series was developed over one hour of breakfast while the writers were watching cheesy cartoons, I guess the best thing about this series is that it might encourage the watchers to start reading as they lose hope in TV as an entertainment medium.",97 out of 186 found this helpful.,1.0,17 July 2015
1044,The Legend of Korra, A Mess.... But Heck I Still Like It,"Overall I thought the show was ok. Probably the best character is Tenzen. He carries a lot of weight to restore the Air Nation after Aang goes since it was Aang dream. Korra is the next best one. And the rest are kind of hard to really get them because you don't get a lot of personal arcs with them. A disappointed character to me was Bumi. He seemed to be a good strategist at first as the only non-bender of Aangs children but he doesn't do much at all. He just gets annoying.
Since the show doesn't have an overall arc like the Last Airbender, Korra's resolve to accept her defeats and learn from them is what is the overall arc that stretches to the end. But why is that it? That's something that seems like it could've been resolved earlier. I did find a lot of moments where she faced the villains and struggled to be moving and engaging, but it was kind of annoying to see her be so head strong and impatient basically the entire series.
Oh well. It's still an ok series, but it was kinda messy. The ending with the Korrasami moment was kinda abrupt and came out of nowhere. The build up to it was not very justified. There were small moments here and there but they could've been interpreted as just good friends.
Ending with that, the animation and fighting looks great, but the writing and characters are what brings the show down.",16 out of 25 found this helpful.,7.0,25 August 2020
1045,The Legend of Korra, The hype is undeserved,"This series started with a lot of potential. Do not assume this negative review comes from someone who can't ""cope"" with how different this series is from its predecessor. I was prepared for a different world and new themes. But, unfortunately, this series fell way short (at least at this point where season 1 has finished).<br/><br/>We are left with characters who do little to grow, a plot which ends up confused and hanging more than reaching a true climax and resolution, and some of the most tacked-on romance I have ever witnessed. The storywriting was just so weak and each episode did little to remedy it. Would you like a better understanding of how Korra has difficulty with spirituality and air bending? Would you like to really see why? Sorry, we'll dedicate a few episodes to professional bending which will do little to expand on the overall story or its characters at all. I won't present spoilers, but it's clear how much time is wasted on a very obvious and lazy romantic pairing early on. At first I thought Bryke were just messing with the fans who are obsessed with ""shipping"", but no, it was serious. The question is, how do these kids even have a chance to fall deeply in love with each other so quickly when there's so little going on with their personalities to make them have a true ""presence""? Amon, as a villain, seemed a redeeming area. The conflict of benders and nonbenders. And yet, the depth that could have gone into the issue was absent. Hell, everyone's parent(s) died because of some random firebender. Yeah, OK. That's a bit of a cop out if I've ever seen one.<br/><br/>By the end, the serious questions that should be gripping the main characters are there but they seem so much shallower than they should be. Not to create spoilers by being specific, but it's as though the ending stayed in that kiddy pool while trying to pretend it deserved to become an Olympic swimmer.<br/><br/>I'm not a young, insane fan. I like a good storyline and I can recognize one. It's not even a matter of opinion, this story with so much potential just fell short. I'd blame it on the shorter 12 episode length versus the 20 of season one of TLA, but Book 1 of TLA would have been a stronger story with bolder characters even if you removed the eight most filler-like episodes within it. I just don't know where the magic died... perhaps because Aaron Ehasz wasn't writing? Seems like he had a lot of the best ideas for the first series.<br/><br/>I hope it finds its footing in season two, but for now I'm a pretty disappointed viewer.",164 out of 330 found this helpful.,5.0,2 July 2012

1047,The Legend of Korra, Disappointment for several reasons,"-Great but inconsistent artstyle.
-Interesting and educational but very poorly handled themes, with false, sometimes even morally wrong resolutions/quintessences.
-Major violation of various basic principles of fiction storywriting, and forced plots, resulting in a lot of bland exposition, poor conveying of important character motivation, and biased points of view. (The mystery is dispelled, as simple ""magic"" granted arbitrarily by gods.)
-Unnecessary and subjectively very bad chosen explanations for the world and its laws, sometimes in conflict with the original series (incosnsistent rules to bending and spirit realm, very flawed origin story, technological bs).
-dumbed down, two dimensional and stereotypical characters with little to no (or just the pretense of) developement. Especially the unintellectual, tantrum throwing bully protagonist with anger issues, who gets everything handed on a silver platter and never really has to deal with the consequences. (And if it happens, it isn't shown). And the beloved Characters and their legacy from the original series are handled despicably.
-Comedy theatrics are obnoxious and often out of place.
-The world of charming traditional asian cultures from the original series were discarded for a cold, western steampunk setting, which gives the series a totally different feel, and imo not for the better.<br/><br/>All in all, it's avatar, but with less of most what made the original series great, unnecessary additions, and a sour aftertaste.",66 out of 125 found this helpful.,3.0,20 April 2018
1048,The Legend of Korra, Huge disappointment,"I absolutely loved the original series; however, I found this new series to be seriously lacking in substance, and thus extremely disappointing. The show is obviously aimed at teenage audiences, and thus has a lot of unnecessarily angsty romance that wasn't present (or at least more subtle) in the original series. Although the 'bad guys' in the series seem to have a valid cause, they are depicted as almost wholly evil. We don't get to know any of them personally, except the main villain, who is only shown in a sympathetic light once we learn that he's a bender. Most of the ""bad guys"" are faceless, generic goons, and show zero character development. In contrast, in the original series, we are shown the human side of the fire-nation; some members of the fire-nation are good, and even join the protagonists' side. Although the show's premise is interesting and has potential, the main characters are fairly two-dimensional and (in my opinion) not very likable -- especially Mako, who is basically a moody jerk, (unsuccessfully) played off as tormented and mysterious. All in all, definitely a downgrade from the original series. The writers took away any sort of deep meaning that was present in the first series for a short fandom-pleaser. The show also seems very rushed, as the creators only planned to make one series. I don't understand why it has such a high rating.",89 out of 176 found this helpful.,3.0,9 December 2012
1049,The Legend of Korra, Not even coming close to its' predecessor,"Let's get started!<br/><br/>Animation: Clearly the main selling point to this series! Some time and effort has been devoted to make this a huge step-up from its' predecessor, for the visuals, at least. The fights are well choreographed and nothing short of awesome at times, but somewhat lacking in subtlety and thought in favor of bigger and flashier effects. All in all a job well done.<br/><br/>Setting: It doesn't swing well with me to be honest. After reviewing the second season (the one with the avatar wan flashback), it strikes me as odd that the world seemingly doesn't evolve in either technology or society in several thousand years yet is pushed past electrification and democracy in a mere 70 years with no apparent struggle or explanation. TLOK loses more than just a few points from this, because it severely lacks the charm and appeal so evident in the setting of ATLA. The focus on one rather uninspired and underdeveloped town rather than the whole world and its' struggles doesn't do it any good, either.<br/><br/>Writing: And here it begins to fall apart! The massive changes in the writing staff from ATLA is perhaps the biggest flaw in the whole series. Every clichéd development you can possibly imagine IS USED in the TLOK, and to such extremes that you could actually guess the outcome of an episode if you are presented with all the troubles the characters get into, usually after three to five minutes. The problems don't stop there: Protagonist struggles-&gt; gets its butt kicked by villain-&gt; struggles some more-&gt; seeks guidance-&gt; gets its butt kicked some more only to be rescued in an almost embarrassingly stupid and obvious deus ex machina event is NOT what an intelligent viewer expects from a sequel said to be written ""with a more mature audience in mind"", and that's the set-up for all the seasons! Mix it up with teenage angst and excruciatingly trivial relationship problems, paired with grown- ups daddy or mommy issues and their ongoing futile struggles to resolve them for no apparent reason (Toph and Lin's meet-up, as well as Tensing taking a hike with his siblings were almost unbearable to watch), and you get an godawful mess of a plot, that only has to maintain until the inevitable big fight without any variation, but fails to deliver even that.<br/><br/>Characters: It gets worse! None, and I really mean NONE, of the protagonists are relatable in the slightest. No motivation, purpose or goal, other than to drive the questionable plot forward is apparent in any of them. The avatar is a sad excuse for one, struggling more with herself and her issues than with the problems at hand and actually seems to get weaker and more pathetic as the series continues. Her sidekicks are either useless and wooden (Mako and Tensin, who fall short in their given roles, fighter/boyfriend and mentor, almost completely), or cringe- inducing goofy (Bolin and Varak, comic relief without comic or relief), or sadly underdeveloped (Azami, the only pale light in the whole cast). Some characters, especially Su Beifong and her family, are so utterly without value and purpose that they seem to lack any justification for their continued appearances in the story, while the antagonists are by far the most interesting characters, with actual, somewhat believable backstories, while still being painfully underdeveloped. I'd certainly like to see a spin-off with Zahir and his merry crew, based mainly on fighting and the philosophy of the red lotus, it couldn't be worse than this drivel! Character development doesn't take place at all, apart from Korra's sexual orientation, which was an rather obvious and sad move from the writers to get some attention back to their failed project. If they really cared about that they would have started the season with the change, not finished with it.<br/><br/>Summary: <br/><br/>Animation: 6/10<br/><br/>Setting: 4/10<br/><br/>Writing: 2/10<br/><br/>Characters: 0/10 <br/><br/>Overall: 3/10",52 out of 102 found this helpful.,3.0,23 February 2017
1050,Black-ish, Do people honestly take this satirical show literally?,"I am writing this review because I find it utterly unbelievable that people take Black-ish literally. The show is obviously satirical. It's making fun of the idea that society believes that there is a certain connotation to blackness or, put simply, certain behaviors and beliefs are considered ""black"". As an upper class black individual who lives in a white neighborhood, I get it. Because of the color of my skin, I'm supposed to ""act black"" and black friends find it weird that I ""talk white"". The show is basically Dre making fun of the fact that being black is more than having a skin color; it comes with expectations and stereotypes that many black people feel the need to embody because if they don't, they won't be authentically black. It is not being racist. It is raising stereotypes, but in a comical way that is supposed to make watchers really question the validity of them. It's a comedy and you're supposed to laugh at Dre's nonsensical obsession about not being black enough. I think the problem is people fail to recognize satire, not just in Black-ish but in any context, such as articles online, commentators always take it literal. <br/><br/>But it's a joke. It's making fun of the idea of ""acting black"".",186 out of 246 found this helpful.,8.0,29 January 2015
1051,Black-ish, It's Funny - Let it Go &amp; Enjoy,"Normally I don't go to the trouble of writing a review but in this case I had to. Reading the other reviews you'd think this was directed by Malcolm X. It's amazing how offended people can get by a black character (yes he's a character and one of the few) on TV. Do these reviewers who were so utterly offended by this character ever stop to wonder what the black community thinks of white TV? Which is to say almost all TV.<br/><br/>They mentioned being too militant, too black black black (even though that's literally in the title) and so forth. If you watched the entirety of the show, you'd realize that was the point. It was way over top, it was a classic caricature of a man who realized, and so too did his family, how ridiculous he was being and let it all go at the end. <br/><br/>At the end of the day it was funny and entertaining, my wife and I laughed out loud at a few spots which rarely happens. As for the not-believable comment, well I'll leave it at the fact that it's a comedy on TV. That's like saying I don't watch The Colbert Report because it misrepresents the news. By this standard you'll scrap about 95% of the stuff out there, although Transformers could happen if you think about it. <br/><br/>My gauge of a show is whether I was entertained or not, and in this case I was. I second the 7.3 round to a 7.",110 out of 175 found this helpful.,7.0,26 September 2014
1052,Black-ish, It Has Won Me Over,"Like some other reviewers here, when I watched the first episode, I turned it off after about ten minutes. It's an unfortunate pilot that leads viewers to think that the entire show will be a narrow diatribe on ""blackness"". But the show is titled ""Black-ish"" and it is appropriately titled.<br/><br/>I don't remember what made me give it another chance, but I decided to watch the second episode and I was pleasantly surprised. But one episode does not a series make, so I watched the third. And I found ""Black-ish"" to be a very enjoyable comedy that had me laughing out loud numerous times.<br/><br/>Like the Cosby family, this family speaks the Queen's English, and they prove to be rather genteel, despite the father's attempts to reconnect with ""the struggle"". He says, ""They (the younger generation) have nothing left to struggle for."" The mother replies, ""Can't that be a good thing?"" And he answers, ""No!"" This show reveals some truths without spelling them out, like ""All in the Family"" did so well.<br/><br/>""Black-ish"" reveals that the father's discontent is a generational thing--something all of us feel who realize that young people cannot identify with the values and events of earlier generations. And it eventually shows that humanity trumps ""blackness"".<br/><br/>I hope this show pursues the path it is on. There are lessons here for everyone. And the writers are mining laughs far outside the topic of race.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. I especially love the two youngest kids. The youngest daughter, Diane, is hilarious; she possesses a comic timing that far surpasses her age.<br/><br/>Update 10/30/14: The show has proved that it is consistently funny. I am upgrading my vote to ""9"".<br/><br/>Update 11/10/16: I am sorry to say that the show's focus and its comedic balance shifted in season 3. So my grading of the show applies only to the first two seasons. Enjoy them.",81 out of 134 found this helpful.,9.0,10 October 2014
1053,Black-ish, Intelligent fare for more than just African Americans,"First of all those who are offended by the title of the show should just pipe down and realize that the creators where just being satirical. As a black man I find the over abundance of buffoonish television shows that are typically geared towards African Americans to be passe and very stereotypical. Tyler perry based shows like Meet the Browns and House of Pain, though well meaning in their portrayal of the Black experience, often suffer from poor writing ( a habitual issue with Tyler Perry productions) and out of date tropes and production values. These shows are typically successful due to Mr. Perry's built in audience and,quiet simply ,a scarcity of programming geared towards black viewers. What makes Blackish stand out is its strong writing, perfectly cast lead actors( Anthony Anderson and Lawrence Fishburn's chemistry is particularly impressive), and irreverent look at the issues facing an upper class black family. Obviously some may not ""get"" some of the humor if you are unfamiliar with the nuances of black culture, just as an African American might not get every funny referrence from ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"". The vast majority of the show, however, deals with issues that anyone can relate too. I'm 3 episodes in, and like most good shows, Blackish gets funnier the longer the writers have time to flesh out the characters and progress with the story lines. One more note. In no way is this show racist like some misguided and ignorant reviewers ( with some admitting to having only watched 15 minutes of the pilot...talk about ADHD) suggest. To those individuals I would say give it an actual chance. Check out the first 3 episodes on ONdemand before you pass a hasty judgement on such a small sample size",87 out of 152 found this helpful.,10.0,22 October 2014
1054,Black-ish, Had me but lost me... quickly,"Ok, so the commercials weren't enough to make me tune in, but it's been on in reruns after another show I watch. At first, it was funny, so I decided to start watching it regularly, and that's when a few things started bothering me...<br/><br/>1) It REALLY feels like 2000's Cosby reboot - all the way to having the eldest daughter leave for college and turning it into a spin-off. The only difference is this time the wife is the dr and the husband is an ad exec instead of a lawyer (and hopefully not ruffying unexpecting women).
Ironically, I'm watching an episode right now and they JUST mentioned the Cosby Show...<br/><br/>2) It's really pretty racist. Given the title of ""Black-ish"", of course I knew it was going to be dealing with a black family and black issues, but it goes the extra mile to paint all of the white characters in a negative light. That really pisses me of because it's such a double standard. You can't say it's wrong for one group to make jokes about one group, but it's ok for that group to make fun of the other. Racism is racism, it doesn't matter who's making the comments to which group.<br/><br/>The wife, Rainbow, is bi-racial (1/2 black, 1/2 white), which could really open up the series to some interesting (and much needed) story lines and talking points, but instead not only do her black husband and in-laws make fun of her for being mixed, but she only identifies as black to the point of open hostility to most white people she encounters - NEVER saying anything when confronted with a sensitive situation like, ""My dad is white, and I love him,"" or ""I'm bi-racial, and..."" It's always, ""as a black person in this world..."" It almost feels like they included it to try to give them a pass on making white jokes, but they show ZERO sympathetic white characters, just villains.<br/><br/>They show Dre at work, and all the white co-workers are absolutely idicotic, racist, and clueless. Yet somehow, it's a huge win for Dre to work there because it's such a big, prestigious firm. Which is it, a prestigious firm or nothing but useless idiots?<br/><br/>It's just really disappointing. Instead of making it a funny show that's about a family that happens to be black, it's all racial issues all the time. It could have done for the black community what Will &amp; Grace or Modern Family did for the gay community, instead it's just a reason to perpetuate stereotypes.",58 out of 101 found this helpful.,4.0,11 January 2019

I laughed wholeheartedly at the satire and looked forward to the next, new, episode each week. However, the series has evolved, and where it's gone is just plain mean.

Two, Blackish recycles humour but delivers it badly, therefore, making it not funny. Three, the show is borderline racist, not just to black people, to people in general. Anthony Anderson is a great actor, he's a funny guy, great chemistry in front of the camera and clearly the only reason this show is tolerable. Along with Laurence Fishburne, these two are the only two people I enjoy watching. As for Tracee Ellis Ross, in all honesty, her role is pretty damn annoying. It's My Wife and Kids all over again, where mom tries very hard to connect with her teenage daughter and tries to look cool so her younger daughter looks up to her. While we're on the subjects of daughters, when did it become funny to see young kids be sarcastic, rude, back-talk and too big for their own shoes? Plus this little girl carries it out with terrible acting skills. And again, when was it funny to see teenage girls with constant mood swings hating on their parents? No parent finds that funny.

The message is an unfortunate one because the implication is that conforming to stereotypes is desirable. One has heard the arguments against assimilation but instead being aware of one's roots while pursuing one's individuality the solution offered by the show is enforcing stereotypes. There is also the unfortunate message that acquiring wealth and its attendant possessions makes young Americans white as though there weren't legitimate black avenues of self expression at the upper echelons. It caters to and encourages the perpetuation of stereotypes of black people. This is the second time, the first being in 'Girlfriends', that Ms. Ross has acted in a show that does this.

1074,Black-ish, my opinion,"the show is racist plain and simple. to say its not a show about race is a lie. its about a man who think his family is assimilating to well into white culture and are not being black enough. the problem is...THERE IS NO BLACK ENOUGH... black is your race (your social category) it has nothing to do with your social status, culture, personality, or behavior. cheep stereo-type after another. if a black man grows up in japan is he not a black man? who ever thought of this trash is extremely lacking in creativity and is just trying to make money and obtain publicity and ratings from the hot topic of race in America. stupid 1/10 stars id give it less if possible.",95 out of 187 found this helpful.,1.0,23 October 2014
1075,Happy Endings, I Severely Miss this Show,"This is my first review ever, so please bear with me.<br/><br/>Happy Endings was a terribly underrated and under-watched show that deserves very high praise. It blows both Friends and How I Met Your Mother completely out of the water (and trust me, I love both of those shows too). Each character was unique, well-developed, and hilarious! The show has a really distinct feeling to it. It was modern in the best kind of way. Penny, Max, Brad, and Jane were definitely standout characters for me. Alex and Dave were great too, but I have to admit they were not quite as interesting as the other four. Nevertheless, this show really let us get to know each character both individually and in the group setting. Plenty of memorable guest stars helped to round out the cast.<br/><br/>The writing is smart and funny. There are inside jokes that are recurring throughout the series. I keep finding great jokes upon multiple viewings. It's both laugh-out-loud funny and make-you-think-a- little funny. <br/><br/>This is the one show that I would pick if I could pick any show to come back onto the air. I would even give back season 4 of Arrested Development and the Veronica Mars movie (both of which I love) for more Happy Endings*. If you haven't seen this show, watch it right away and fall in love with this amazing group of friends like I did.<br/><br/>*EDIT: Okay, I may have been a bit over-dramatic with that statement...",42 out of 45 found this helpful.,10.0,15 March 2014

1078,Happy Endings, Phenomenal!!!,"This show is simply superb. The deliverance, character development, and plots of each episode are amazing. Overall the show is hilariously quick-witted (similar to 30 Rock and Community).<br/><br/>The pilot doesn't really do the show justice though. All of the characters are quirky in their own way, and they all get into antic situations. I'd recommend watching at least the first two episodes to get a feel for what the show is really like. Honestly, I can't wait to see how the show evolves from here, I'm sure it will be amazing!<br/><br/>I recommend Happy Endings if you like shows like: Modern Family, 30 Rock, and Community.

1079,Happy Endings, Great start,"I read an earlier review comparing this show to 'Friends'. They couldn't be more wrong. Sure, its got the typical cast of 3 main female character and 3 main male characters, some who are in relationships and some who are single, but this seems to be the norm to most new sitcoms (ie. How I Met Your Mother, Big Bang Theory etc.) This show on the other hand is quite refreshing in a way that makes it comparable to other popular past sitcoms, yet is original and different. Flashbacks during scenes remind you of Scrubs and Family Guy yet do it in a way that doesn't make it seem like they're stealing that idea. You've really got to see it to know what I mean.<br/><br/>So far, while writing this review only four episodes have been shown, and quite honestly, I can't wait for the next one to come out. The characters all have their own unique qualities that make them interesting and i'm sure that as the series goes on we'll get to know more about them.<br/><br/>In my own personal opinion I would definitely recommend Happy Ending to anyone willing to open themselves up to a new sit-com.",53 out of 71 found this helpful.,9.0,26 April 2011

The acting is great,each of the characters has something different and unique, the dialogs are funny and you get great moments of laugh. I hope this will not change later. <br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend this show if you've watched 'The 70s show' or 'How I Met Your Mother'. I can hardly wait for more episodes. Hopefully this will not get canceled after a few episodes like a lot of other great shows were (like Firefly or Pushing Daisies.",79 out of 109 found this helpful.,,14 April 2011
1081,Happy Endings, Best comedy on TV,"This is the funniest sitcom since Arrested Development. It's witty, sharp, and twisted. It gets compared to Friends a lot but the characters are jerks to each other in a similar setup as Seinfeld or Curb your Enthusiasm.<br/><br/>Elisha Cuthbert who was the weakest link in season one has improved tremendously. She has great comic timing in playing the ditz Alex. Damon Wayons Jr. shines as Brad. He takes all the great comic attributes of his father and adds his own hilarious spin. I also love how Adam Pally as Max breaks the homosexual stereotype. He thinks just like a straight man and is rude, obnoxious, and hilarious.<br/><br/>Every member of the cast is great and the pop culture references are as Penny would say ""Ahmazing"" When you can have a sex dream about the mom on the 90's comedy dinosaurs you are a pretty funny show. Season one is good but season two and three are where the cast really shines. Check the show out if you love Community, Arrested Development, Peep Show and other witty comedies.

The characters are well defined individuals, each with their own quirks without being quirky.<br/><br/>The first five episodes have all been laugh out loud funny. The situations have been believable and relatable but go to very funny surreal places. It's creative but the creativity all comes organically from the characters so it never seems forced.<br/><br/>Also, no laugh track, no setup-punchline timing to make you feel stupid.",38 out of 52 found this helpful.,8.0,2 May 2011

I can simply say that I loved it.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the actors are hard to put into words, their acting skills and the writing of the show all combined together make this into such a good show.<br/><br/>I'm so glad that this show has aired - and I can finally watch a new comedy that makes me really laugh hard when watching - yet enjoy the different aspects of the writing and still be humored by the quality of the episodes and their story lines.",49 out of 69 found this helpful.,10.0,23 April 2011

I get concerned when a new show gets slotted in between the hottest most popular shows. But I was hooked right away. There is definitely great chemistry amongst all cast members. The jokes are well written and the timing is well done. One area of concern is what's in store for the couple that fell apart at the altar - I am not sure how they will handle their relationship, but so far so good. They take risks, but they pay off. The result is sweet and funny and engaging. I think it will get even better with time. I am definitely continuing to watch it!",35 out of 52 found this helpful.,8.0,27 April 2011
1085,Happy Endings," Great show, do not compare it with Friends!","I had my doubts about this show at the beginning. I started watching some episode because it aired right after Modern family. But after watching a couple of random episodes, I started to get interested.<br/><br/>The characters really grew on me, I really recognize my friends and I through them. It's funny, touching at times, well written and intelligent. They make lots of references to movies, TV shows, celebrities, so if you don't watch a lot of movies and television, you may have some trouble understanding everything. <br/><br/>It's refreshing to see a gay character who's not a drama queen, typical type of gay guy you see on TV. Adam Pally, who plays the gay character, is awesome and my favorite. It's also so refreshing to see an interracial couple (black and white), that openly make jokes about their differences. <br/><br/>The only thing I don't really like about this show, is Elisha Cuthbert. Although I like her and I think she is so pretty, I don't think she plays her character well. I feel like she can't find her place with the others and she doesn't really fit, like she's missing something. A lot of times, I just find her awkward. But that's just my opinion. I'll still watch the show. Maybe she'll get better with time. <br/><br/>So overall, I think it's a super cool show. And please do not compare this series with Friends, this has nothing to do with it. It's too easy to say they are friends and do stuff together, and compare characters. It's so much more than that. I never really liked Friends and I love this show. They can't re-invent the wheel. We all have friends, a lot of them resemble others, it's based on real life that's it. <br/><br/>I really recommend everyone to at least watch season 1 :) Then you can judge by yourself :)",16 out of 22 found this helpful.,8.0,25 March 2012

As a Chicagoan, the setting has an authentic feel and while I do recognize the Friends-esque setting, the characters are refreshing to me.<br/><br/>My favorites are Jane, Brad and Penny and, frankly, I could happily watch a show about those three alone. I love Jane (Eliza Coupe) and Brad's (Damon Wayans, Jr.) relationship - they are hilarious individually, but there's something magical about them together. They are amazingly kooky and have their own relationship shorthand, which is endearing. I can relate to Penny (Casey Wilson) on so many levels - she's just trying to get it right and she's so optimistic, even when everything goes wrong.<br/><br/>Max, Alex and Dave are good, too, but they don't pop for me the way the other three do. I do love that they didn't go obvious and flamboyant with Max.

It doesn't MATTER that there's no overriding story arc as each episode stands alone, and each is funny. I don't see it at all as like a Friends rip off, it's far too leftfield, the only similarity with Friends is it's got a group of people who know each other in it.<br/><br/>Yet you've poorly scripted and acted forgettable stuff with awful timing that's basically a sequence of bad slapstick and double entendres (see ""two broke girls"") and that's renewed?

1091,Happy Endings, Refreshing and amazing,"I just found out about this show. Why this kind of show doesn't have more success is a mystery to me; and yet killing, cursing,and cheap nudity is all over the place. I have never seen the show Friends but the concept did make me think of it. Anyway, this show is about 6 friends. Alex, Dave, Brad, Jane, Penny, and Max. They are all ""ah-mazing"" as Penny would say and they are funny. It touches subjects that are current but in a light and funny way. The characters are great together, the situations are not forced and the dialogues flow naturally. Jane, Brad, Penny, and Max are my favorites but Alex and Jane do bring they own game and when they are all together it's just perfect. I would be shocked if I read that they did not like each other because watching them everyday makes me want to be in a group of friends just like that.I am so sorry that it's over but what a treat.

1092,Happy Endings, Typical Hollywood Rehash,"IF you're over 30 you might not like this show. It's the typical fare Hollywood is rehashing over and over, but this time it's ""modernizing"" with an interracial couple (but STILL the same tired African American man with the Blonde white girl), one sided jokes and 80s sitcom no-real-story-just-people-hanging-out episodes, each pretty much like the last. What makes the shows before it click with an audience is because they are funny, non politically bent with characters that can be individual from the others. Happy Ending has none of this and feels forced and fake. BUT the teenagers think it's great (but then again they think MTV is how the real world works) and it's just modern-hip enough for pretend hipsters to smugly say ""Oh yes, it's far beyond The Middle and Modern Family humor. It's cool."" There ya go. Hopefully, like the other shows before it this sorta rips off, this one too will vanish.",34 out of 80 found this helpful.,2.0,25 May 2011

I currently love to watch Modern Family and this show ranks up there. Its a different setting/scenario but how it makes me laugh is the same...HARD!

1095,Happy Endings," More like cr@ppy endings, if you ask me...","I've had high hopes for this one. I adore Elisha Cuthbert, and I was so excited that she's returning to TV...<br/><br/>But come on... It's 2011, for g*d's sake. Shows like ""Modern Family"", ""Cougar Town"", and ""The Middle"" are on the air on ABC, to name only the single-camera comedies that ""Happy Endings"" is joining there. Not to mention the competition - ""Community"", ""Traffic Light"" - both shockingly well written comedies. It's like a rotten apple in an otherwise flawless bowl of fruit.<br/><br/>I really don't want to be the jerk here, but I honestly don't understand, why this show got 8.0 points here on IMDb. Yeah, the cast is good looking (Hollywood, d'oh) and they are generally decent actors (Hollywood, d'oh, pt. 2) but the characters are... well, they almost don't even exist. It's just a bunch of mediocre professionals, fooling around in front of a camera, without any pronounced reason, or goal whatsoever. It's not the kind of stumbling around when taking the very first steps... something's very wrong, that's seated deeper than that.<br/><br/>I've watched each and every pilot in the past 6 or 7 TV seasons (network or cable, everything), and there were many occasions, when I had felt like: 'OK this was pretty bad, but I can feel it will take off, and get much better'. With ""Happy Endings"", I have no such feeling at all. There are just too many things that are wrong about this one. The characters that are supposed to be funny (or funnier than the others) are just not, the lines, and plots are not funny enough or at all, the ones that come through after all, are so clichéd, that if I had a penny each time I've heard of seen them, I'd be rich.<br/><br/>I have a very bad feeling about a pilot, when after watching it I can't remember the characters' names. It's a dead-on indicator, that the show is badly written. Another 'tell' is when I'm confused about who is really the lead character, or 'hero' if you will, but it's quite silly to talk about heroes since it's (supposedly) a comedy.<br/><br/>James Burrows had said in an interview once, that it's very easy to tell if a comedy is well written - or if it works or not: don't look at the screen, only listen to the dialogue, as if it was a radio play. It has to work, even then. And damn it, it's true: try it, with ""Friends"", ""Cheers"", ""That 70's Show"", I could go on. It works. With ""Happy Endings"", it does not, even if you look at the screen it doesn't.<br/><br/>But at least Elisha is beautiful. That's not enough to save the show, in my opinion.",28 out of 67 found this helpful.,1.0,28 April 2011

Personally, I love all of them but if I have to choose it would be Max and Penny; Max is charming, sassy and a slacker which add more points to him, and Penny? she reminds me of Phoebe Buffay but in less weird world. I think I speak for every guy when I say that we watch this series cause of Elisha Cuthbert, though ironically her character is flat (gradually changing in second season), of course she is pretty to look at, but have you see her on-screen sister? Eliza Coupe is mamacita sexy! <br/><br/>My favorite episode from Season 1 would be 'Mein coming out' and 'The shershow redemption', both brilliantly written and has its own warm that will surely bring smile to every viewers.

Fast Forward to Jazz Kwon Do and I think ABC found themselves a winner. Listen, its nothing like ""Friends"" other than 3 males and 3 Females. That crappy show that NBC just axed, ""Perfect Couples"" was more like it than this. I would certainly say its more like ""How I Met Your Mother,"" meets ""Cougar Town"". 2 more shows that have great writing and built some decent back stories for their characters.

I really hated the first season because it just wasn't appealing to me but it sure got better. I really miss shows like these because I haven't seen a good comedy series since the end of this one.

1103,Everybody Loves Raymond, This series took me ages to get into,"...but now I'm hooked, and I've even bought 5 DVD boxsets of it! Its weird because its both subtle AND sharp humour.<br/><br/>Its about Ray Romano, a sportswriter who just wants a quiet life...but he has 3 kids (a girl and twin toddler boys) and Debra (his wife) who struggles to juggle housekeeping and being a mother because Ray just will do anything to stay out of her way and not help! Debra is not your typical sitcom mum. She's independent and opinionated, and a very good match for Ray - she keeps him in line!<br/><br/>His Italian American parents (Marie and Frank) and divorced 40 year old brother (Robert) stay in the same street and facing across from Ray &amp; Debra's house. And they are never away from there - The parents are very loud, expressive, overbearing people, but they don't mean to be....It's just their way. The brother is quirky to say the least! he's 7 foot tall and has a voice like Eeyore from the winnie the pooh movies (he IS the voice from the cartoon). He has weird little habits and is a little obsessive compulsive and insanely jealous of his younger brother Ray. However, at heart they are good, caring people and the family are extraordinarily close...but you'd never know it by the drama and shouting that goes on all the time! This is where the comedy comes from....<br/><br/>Now, I am married to an Italian man and I know from experience what Italian in-laws are like! so this might be why I find this so funny....watching Marie (Rays mum) is like watching my MIL (only its not so funny in real life, believe me!!)<br/><br/>If you like Seinfeld, King of Queens (another sitcom which took ages to grow on me), CLASSIC Woody Allen movies, the film Mambo Italiano or My Big Fat Greek Wedding, then you'll like this.

To put down Americans, to put down someone's physical appearance and be glad an actor/actress hasn't been on tv lately is way over the top. Some people even over analyzed this show, like watching this show is going to turn anybody who watches it into a sexist monster. Get real people. It's just a fictional tv show.

1107,Everybody Loves Raymond, wonderful sitcom,"I'm not a big fan of TV.  I think most of it is terribly contrived and has very little to do with the lives of normal people.  This show is different. The fights they get into, the disputes, everything is true and funny.  Ray is the beleaguered protagonist and his parents and brother are absolute scene stealers.  This show is just wonderful.  The writing is good and I can really see these sorts of things happening in my family.  It is much easier to watch when it is someone else's family though.",56 out of 91 found this helpful.,,17 January 2000
1108,Everybody Loves Raymond, The actual reality TV for many of us,"""Everybody Loves Raymond"" turns all those '50s comedies on their heads. It's not the Donna Reed Show, not Leave it to Beaver, not Father Knows best. It's family life with all its good points and bad, all the love and frustration, and all the individual foibles. Raymond is a sports writer whose parents, the domineering Marie and the couch potato Frank, live across the street from him. His wife Deborah is beautiful but can't cook and comes under constant criticism from her mother-in-law. Ray's brother Robert is a policeman who is jealous of him because - well, ""everybody loves Raymond."" This show is hilarious - my favorites are numerous, but one of the best is the lost cannister episode when Deborah swears she doesn't have a cannister of Marie's and then it turns out the kids had it. It falls to Raymond to sneak it into his mother's house, so on Easter Sunday he wears a down coat to hide it. I also loved the tofu Thanksgiving turkey, taping over the wedding with a football game, the fly eating woman dating Robert, Robert hanging out with his black partner and walking around in a yellow suit, the colored condoms on Halloween, the girl scout cookie debacle, and dozens and dozens of others.<br/><br/>It was Ray Romano's goal to go out on top, so the series ended in 2005. It was a great run, a perfect ensemble cast, and will be enjoyed on DVD and in syndication for years to come.",31 out of 48 found this helpful.,,25 March 2006
1109,Everybody Loves Raymond, Timeless humour in the classic mould.,"It took me a long time to get into this show because most of my friends kept putting it down. I'm now addicted to ELR and bad luck if nobody else I know admits to watching it! Apart from 'Becker' no other current American comedies really appeal to me. <br/><br/>What do I like about ELR? The way Ray sets off events without knowing how, then stands back and watches the results of his unconscious actions. Both the cast and the scripts are first-rate. Robert of course has to be my favourite character; he reminds me in some ways of Jack Benny. Favourite episode has to be the one in which Ray's parents back the car through the front wall. One of the great moments of television! <br/><br/>Long may this series continue.",43 out of 71 found this helpful.,,8 April 2003

1111,Everybody Loves Raymond, Marie's 'representation' of seniors,"Someone once posted a comment about Marie being a disappointment for seniors everywhere. The big part of it is this, that Raymond's mother is an exaggerated form of Phil Rosenthal and Ray Romano's Mother also, I don't get why people believe like with The Cosby Show (as far as black representation) that the seniors on the show have to represent ALL seniors or the majority of them.<br/><br/>In Seinfeld, I know a couple that was similar to George's parents, but that doesn't mean that they are the representation or the unique representation of seniors everywhere. It is a TV show that is based on the families of the writers and the creators of which Phil Rosenthal and Ray Romano are. Also, my mother isn't as overprotective as Marie is but I don't go around yelling about how Marie isn't like her. TV is representative of not only people but of the way writers see them as well as the characters and how they act. Good writing takes this and makes it known to the audience.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading",39 out of 65 found this helpful.,8.0,26 July 2006

The characters are hilarious, especially peter boyle, and always leave me laughing. down right, it is simply a funny show. Oh my god and seven foot tall robert who has to duck every time he walks in is priceless. Basically, all these people who said multiple stars were only given by CBS employees, don't listen to them. They have no taste whatsoever, no humor in their life. I am not a CBS employee, I am a 14 year old girl who completely enjoys ""everybody loves raymond"". I won't summarize for you, because everyone else did that, but one character was left out: Amy. Normally when sitcoms add characters in later seasons (as Amy is added as Roberts wife in a later seasons) the show goes down hill. But not Amy Mcdougal, she is absolutely priceless.

Its not the belly aching humor you get with some shows but it really is a great show. I'm not a catholic but I like that they even go to church every once in awhile. No they aren't preachy. They are just showing the humor of people's relationship to the church nowadays. Would love to see Brad Garrett get another show. The one he got really looked a bit lame.

I didn't always feel this way, but I tuned into a syndicated Raymond for the first time in a year, and I was blown away by how good-and how truthfully painful-the episode was. The show can be funny, and it can occasionally grab your guts with it's troubled family poignancy.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Ramano tops Seinfeld, Garrett beats Richards et al.

1124,Bodyguard, Never Show Your Weakness!,"I think the British are usually successful in thriller genre. And I've seen that they are really successful with this series. The series made an excellent beginning with the opening scene. I can say that, the first 20 minutes of Bodyguard are arguably one of the best thriller scenes. From that moment onwards, I knew I had to watch all of episodes as quickly. At some moments the tension was so high that I could feel the excitement.<br/><br/>Action scenes were very successful, directors and cinematographer did well. The scenario is not unnecessarily extended, the series has a realistic fiction in general, and you get excited while watching. The action is so good so that you can't talk about some scenes being stagnant because there is a team that reflects emotions very well. What's really impressive about this series are the breathtaking action-packed scenes. It's here where it really deserves. As with most dramas, it skews dark, but that's not necessarily a bad thing for the world it is portraying.<br/><br/>There are two things that make Bodyguard stand out from a lot of the other similar series in this genre and the first is the way it good manages thriller. The first twenty minutes of the first episode is a really good example of this. The second one is acting. The entire cast is giving very good performances, in what are at times really difficult roles. The acting, particularly from Richard Madden, is outstanding. Best known for his role as Robb Stark in <a href=""/title/tt0944947/"">Game of Thrones (2011)</a>, <a href=""/name/nm0534635/"">Richard Madden</a> has an incredibly difficult job of playing someone whose world is starting to fall apart. 8/10",279 out of 298 found this helpful.,8.0,22 December 2018

I am not sure I could leave it a full week between episodes, each episode had me wanting more. The length of the series is short but perfect, not overly drawn out, nor rushed towards the finish line. The cast is well chosen, and they do way more than just deliver their lines, a result that draws you in and keeps you guessing. The directions and mis-directions to keep you guessing do not under-estimate the intelligence of the audience, nor try to spell out every detail so it does require some attention, but is all the better because of this. A very very strong show, and I really hope they can bring a second series to air with a different bent to it, but a second series would be a really big challenge to top or equal this first.

1128,Bodyguard, Good show ruined by really bad last episode,"Very disappointing ending which ruined the whole show for me. The last episode was disappointing for these reasons: 
How does Budd manage to run away from the crack police services after he disarms the bomb?
Why does everyone suddenly have the need to confess and give up the conspiracy?
Why does the crime kingpin not disappear after he sees Budd prancing around with a suicide vest all day - surely he must've reckoned that Budd would tell the police of his involvement. 
How did Budd get into the ex assistant's flat and how does her crime kingpin boyfriend not notice that he's being followed by her car?
Why does the crime kingpin go to his police source's home to confront her at the front of her house?
Why did Nadia reveal all at the end - she would've probably been released if she would've kept stumm but she brags about being a jihadi engineer who saw an opportunity with Budd when he talked her down from blowing up the train. Somehow she deduced that he could be used to create greater havoc (like killing the home secretary) even though she had no influence over his assignment or anything else.

The first three episodes were thoroughly enjoyable to watch. There were some great moments, such as the totally out-of-the-blue shooting from the office block.
Sadly, after Julia had finally been killed, the quality dipped and the plot became convoluted. First it was the Government who killed her, then the Secret Service, then some crime ring, then the Secret Service, and so on...
I finished the series not really sure which parts of the murder the Government, Secret Service, and gang each contributed to.
The last episode was really quite boring, and I found myself checking how long was left a couple of times. The final confession of the Jihadi woman was hard to understand.

His more negative character traits are superficially dismissed as 'problems', originating from trauma suffered in active service<br/><br/>In the latter episodes, one can forgive much of the cast when they struggle to convince, because their main function is simply to pass on information to the audience and explain what is going on. Episode 5 was particularly frustrating in this regard, giving the viewer a headache with an hour of almost endless exposition. Nor is there anything inventive or humorous in the dialogue or the performances, making it something of a trial to sit through. However the script cannot be blamed for Nina Toussaint-White's terrible miscasting as someone we are supposed to believe was an experienced detective. The director should have demanded more from her than a constant, pained expression. She brings nothing else to the role at all. <br/><br/>How different to the promising first episode, where silences, measured pauses and slow build-ups created a tension-filled atmosphere with ease. The show started to slip when Montague and Budd's relationship took a ludicrously unbelievable turn, and one which was quite unnecessary for the overall story. It would have been so much more powerful to leave their relationship professional with nothing more than hints at an ever-growing friendship and mutual respect, but no, the writers couldn't resist going over the edge and it was all downhill from there.<br/><br/>The setting is unrecognisable as modern-day London with snipers, political assassinations and attacks on schools; it feels more like a war zone, but the dull and cliched news reports - which were put there presumably to give the series some authenticity, actually have the reverse effect, treating these catastrophic events like business-as-usual.<br/><br/>The final episode was the most ridiculous, which managed both to be highly far-fetched and nonsensical.<br/><br/>Although there were 3 or 4 scenes in this series that were amongst the most gripping I have seen on TV, they cannot make up for the amount of time where little is happening beyond tired descriptions of an increasingly implausible plot.",137 out of 251 found this helpful.,5.0,3 October 2018
1141,Bodyguard, Here's my list of 15 massive plot holes in the series and why I rated it a 3 and thought it utter nonsense.,"The plot of the Bodyguard is like the finest Swiss cheese: full of countless holes. I tried to count, but gave up at 15.<br/><br/>(As the point of this post is entirely a list of spoilers, consider yourselves warned before you read on.)<br/><br/>Here's my very incomplete list and why I rate this series so poorly.<br/><br/>1. The open scenes are full of suspense but in hindsight (as so many of my criticisms will be) nonsensical. To begin with: Who called in the 'terrorist threat' to London transport? I assumed that rather important point would be pursued and be an important link in the solution it was so silly but it was just one of those threads that made no sense. I know it is a standard plot device but it remains a weak one. How did somebody come to spot a suicide bomber getting onto the train? No explanation is ever given. (And even then, it was the wrong person - i.e. Nadia's husband, not Nadia!)
2. Those who reached the end of the series (we came close to giving up) know that Nadia ends up revealing herself as the master bombmaker and (apparently) the mastermind behind the series of bomb attacks in London. Huge point this one: master bomb makers generally don't blow themselves up. They are way too valuable to the organization to be allowed by their colleagues to blow themselves up in a suicide attack. They could make dozens and dozens more bombs killing hundreds if not thousands of people if they keep themselves alive but will only kill a handful of people if they volunteer for a suicide mission on a train. Terrorists get the 'foot soldiers' to sacrifice themselves, not the bombmakers. And, in any case, she certainly wouldn't have tried to suicide attack while her work was unfinished - i.e. the later bomb attack on Julia.
3. Why would Nadia even be wearing a suicide vest? At the time, it is meant to appear that Nadia is an unwilling 'volunteer' to the terrorist cause. However, in hindsight we know that she is very willing and wants to make the attack. But a suicide vest in this situation makes no sense at all once we know (in hindsight) that Nadia is the mastermind. More likely would have been a fully concealed bomb inside a piece of luggage which could NOT have been accidentally spotted and could then have been triggered by the pressing of a discrete button. There are situations for suicide vests but this clearly was not one of them. If you are walking into a police station or an embassy or government building where a large piece of hand luggage would be viewed with suspicion, then a vest is probably the way to go. But on a train where luggage and bags are routine? That's definitely NOT how to do it if you are a willing bomber. Think it through viewers. It made no sense in hindsight other than to try and mislead viewers from the stop with a bogus scene.
4. Worse, why suicide at all? It was totally pointless. Nadia is an engineer who is a genius and who put together a series of complicated devices including one that was triggered by a clever pressure switch. Don't you think just maybe she could have built one that could have been triggered remotely or with a timer? Get on a train at Heathrow with some luggage just as hundreds of others are doing at the same time. Place the luggage in the luggage area. 5 minutes later, disappear to the toilet, leaving the luggage behind. 5 minutes after that, get off at the next station. 5 minutes later, boom. No need for a suicide mission at all. It was an unbelievable bit of the plot and yet critical to completely and unfairly mislead viewers.
5. Why does Nadia even confess at the end? All they really hit her with is that she knew about where David's kids went to school. It would have been dead easy to talk her way out of that one but instead, after putting on her innocent wife for several weeks at every interrogation, she decides to suddenly confess everything. Why? It made no sense.
6. Yes, they go on to mention that her DNA had been found inside the final bomb control. WHAT? Her DNA? What did she do? Spit into it? Lick it? Pull out one of her hairs by the root and leave it inside the bomb control? Cut herself when making the bomb and drip blood into the device? Ridiculous. Just handling it might have left fingerprints but not DNA. There is no DNA in perspiration if that's what they were implying. It was a stupid suggestion.
7. Finally and in any case, why did Nadia back down in that opening scene and not detonate the bomb if she really was intent on being a suicide bomber. She gave a very convincing performance in the opening 10 minutes as the poor innocent wife. But if she intended, initially, to blow up the train, then why didn't she do so when David confronted her and she was surrounded by passengers in the first few minutes? Again, it made no sense.
8. Nadia claims to have passed messages from inside prison to the outside co-conspirators on how to plant the Julia bomb. This seems a very remote possibility at best. Not impossible; just very implausible given the high alert situation in London. Maybe I'm being picky on that one, but it seems very contrived and borderline unbelievable that she would have been in a position to pass messages.
9. Why drive a truck loaded with explosives at the school as a suicide mission? Again, it was hardly necessary to have a suicide mission. It would have been far simpler to simply park the truck in front of the school gates overnight, stand a few hundred meters away, and when you have a crowd of kids (including David's) enter the school in the morning push the remote button to detonate the bomb. Again, there is a time and place for a suicide truck (like driving a loaded truck at the US embassy as happened in Beirut decades ago) but not in a school situation when it is NOT an obvious target unlike an embassy or police station where a truck parked outside would have been a huge issue. You don't waste good terrorists in a suicide bombing when it isn't necessary.
10. The blood on David's face throughout the final episode. How ridiculous was that? David is claiming loudly that he did not put on the vest himself but nobody believes him. And yet nobody in the police confronting David ever says ""hey, maybe he's telling the truth if he's been beat up like that as he obviously didn't do that to himself."" Nobody even once mentions the blood he is covered in during the entire, what, 30 minutes he is walking around London. Not once. Not credible. Not in the least bit believable.
11. In episode 4, suspicion falls on one of Julia's aides after the planting the bomb at the school where Julia was giving the speech. ""Why wasn't he vetted,"" asks one of the police or security people. ""Of course, he was vetted"" is the reply, ""anybody working for the Home Secretary"" is thoroughly vetted ,or words to that effect. But then we have the fired aide, Chanel, who is openly seen in the company of someone who is known to be a leading figure in the London crime world, Luke, and who obviously had been in a relationship with him for ages. Yet somehow that was missed in the vetting process for Chanel??? Maybe if the relationship was hidden but she was hardly trying to hide it with him picking her up at work and she was frequenting his club. Again, just not believable that a proper vetting wouldn't have spotted this.
12. We see David carefully hiding his gun behind a wood panel in his home and spending rather a lot of time sealing the panel and disguising it carefully so that it can't be found if his home is searched. Later, a police search of his home discovers the panel but the gun isn't there. Why? We find later that David opted to move it. Why did he move it after all the careful disguising of the hiding place? No explanation is given. And where does he move it to? To a location in his home that any thorough search of his home would have detected (behind an easily accessed ceiling light that only needed to be pushed lightly to reveal it wasn't attached) and which would have been a far more obvious hiding place than the panel. Again, silly.
13. David returns to Julia's flat and it takes him all of two minutes to figure out where she has hidden the missing device. In a location that (again) the previous police search of the flat would have unquestionably checked. Behind a photo? Come on! How do you not check that???
14. In a closing scene, David confronts Chanel in her flat. I missed a word or two but the next thing we have is David driving with Chanel to David's boss's house??? Why has she directed him there? It makes no sense unless I completely misunderstood what was going on. Anyway, that's were they go and there he has the extraordinary luck to arrive at the very moment the crime lord is confronting the corrupt police chief in her driveway about her lack of controlling the situation. Amazing luck isn't it? He arrives at the exact second that Luke decides to openly contact the corrupt boss. Just amazing. Or was it just awful sloppy lazy writing. 
15. Why was David's clip replaced with blanks? The reason given at the end was something to do with the bad guys wanting him to be used as a patsy. Right. So they knew he would try to kill himself and thought it best to keep him alive by replacing his bullets with blanks so he didn't? How unrealistic is that? One: he could still have chosen to kill himself a different way. Two: wouldn't it have been better to actually have him kill himself and then leave evidence in his flat (like a typed confession?) that he was indeed in cahoots with the killers? Far better than letting him live and run around for 3 episodes trying to find the killers don't you think?<br/><br/>Anyway. I've had enough of going back over this series trying to remember all this nonsense. It's a shame many viewers didn't reflect a bit more on what they had seen before giving the series a 10 and praising it so highly. Was it well made? Sure. Was the lead actor excellent. Yeah, I'll give you that one. But was the writing of the plot in the least bit decent? Er. Not in a million years.",196 out of 369 found this helpful.,3.0,5 October 2018

Despite most BBC stuff needing a health warning the production, filming and writing are pretty decent. If you could only take a pair of scissors to those cringeworthy BBC soundbites Bodyguard'd gain a good critical score. (Rob Stark) Richard Madden here plays a ""Sean Connery without the quips"", taciturn, emotionless, good-cop character. His ability not to flinch even after shocking events gets to be daunting, as does his ability to hear normally after an ear-drum destruction event. You could continue to drill holes in so many other very ridiculous and stupidly constructed scenarios of Bodyguard. As a very violent but not at all original TV Series it does what it says on the BBC Tin - entertaining, springing surprise upon brutal surprise &amp; appealing to an audience the BBC ""supposes"" to be ""out there"", though (since their finances are safe) nobody at Beeb HQ really needs to know.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,5.0,10 September 2020

Add elements such as the alleged weapons expert bodyguard doesn´t check his own ammo in the pistol clip, and thereby manages to fire a blank in a defining moment, followed later by a completely laughable scene in where he is knocked unconscious and strapped into a bomb vest and then held up by police / colleagues who all of a sudden doesn´t believe a word he´s saying about being forced to wear it because he omitted a piece of non vital information to them earlier, and the officer pointing a gun at him (why?) suddenly, after repeatedly requesting it over the radio (??) ""gets a green light to shoot"" our bomb vest wearing heroon the spot (?????), WHICH THE OFFICER IN QUESTION THEN CHOOSES NOT TO DO, DESPITE HIS OWN DESPERATE REQUEST TO DO SO, and while fearing of our hero detonating his vest (hence the neeed to shoot him point blank, even hough he is wearing a dead man trigger and therefore would kill all his sceptical and trigger happy colleagues if taken down), THEY ALLOW HIS EX WIFE TO WALK UP TO HIM TO TALK SENSE.
In short: lazy, amateurish, zero consultants or research (or they´ve just chosen to ignore the advice completely), and all in all a perfectly wasted opportunity to make a decent thriller. Well done ...",25 out of 44 found this helpful.,2.0,5 November 2018

Unfortunately it was extremely wide of the mark.<br/><br/>I'm happy to suspend a certain amount of belief in the name of entertainment but the colossal plot holes were too big to overlook.<br/><br/>The dialogue was particularly cringeworthy &amp; I found myself embarrassed at watching it at certain parts.

The quality was incredible, and the feeling was growing on me, that this could become one of those rare gems, that are hard to find these days. Episode 4 was the tipping point for me. It's as if the writers didn't know what to do with the story they created. So they let the lead character, who first was such a rational person, make irrational decisions. Episode 5 was even worse. The final episode I couldn't stop sighing and rolling my eyes. I couldn't hardly finish the episode because of all the stupid stuff they came up with. Because of the nature of the series I was expecting something that made sense. It gets a 3/10 just because the first three episodes were strong and really good story telling and acting.

1149,The Shield, Possibly my favorite drama ever,"I hate giving 10's because nothing is perfect, but a 9 doesn't do it justice. There have been a lot of 9's over the years but this show is even better than those. <br/><br/>Over 7 seasons The Shield consistently provides an incredibly diverse group of characters and more intrigue than most TV has ever provided. The web Vic and his team weaves is always winding in all sorts of directions and is often on the verge of breaking. Vic and the rest of the strike team use their authority and cunning to untangle it as best they can, almost always using tactics that are ethically questionable at best. <br/><br/>The whole thing really gets you sucked in and you're always torn because rooting for Vic is easy, facing what he really is is not. What's right and what's wrong? When do the lines begin to blur? It's not always clear, but it's incredibly entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>The other thing I really love about the show is how there's always another separate case being pursued by Dutch Waggenbach and company. It keeps each episode going in different directions and the case is always interesting or has an unexpected twist when it's resolved. I think another thing that separates this show from all the others is that you get your murder/rape case that you get everywhere else, but that only compiles about 30% of each episode and the rest is even better than that. Shows like CSI and Law &amp; Order can't even touch the content this show brings, and I haven't even mentioned the gritty, realistic style it's shot and written in. Absolutely unique and done believably and well. The finale? It's as good as you're ever going to get. <br/><br/>It really is a stellar show. I would say there was perhaps one season I thought was only above average (not exactly a strike against it) but the rest was a thrill ride that was so gripping I don't know if there's more than a handful of other shows that have ever matched it in that capacity. You're always in for a surprise when you watch it and the characters grow on you, some of them whether you want them to or not.

1150,The Shield, The best series ever written,"The Shield is not for everyone. My wife, for instance does not like violent TV shows. The Shield is raw, violent and full of incredible suspense and intrigue. A good friend of mine recently turned me on to the Shield and I will forever be grateful. I travel quite a lot and watched all 100+ hours of the Shield while on the road. I could not wait to get to the next episode. During a recent 2 week trip to India, I did not turn on the TV one time. I watched a episode or two of The Shield every night and a whole season each way on the plane. There is a lot of debate about the ending, which I thought was perfect. It's difficult to end such an epic saga but these guys did it about as good as you can. The Shield is life changing. Not all for the good.You should be prepared to be affected by this thing.

1151,The Shield, Very very very good show...top 3 series finale ever,"The shield is one of the best cop shows of all time, only behind ""The Wire."" The story line is rich and the cast is just brilliant. Michael Chiklis had a career defining role as the brutal Vic Mackey. Chiklis is so good that somehow you continue to root for the guy after all of the brutal crimes he has committed. He truly played that role to perfection. The show continues to get better as the seasons progress. They build on each other perfectly which sets up the epic and heart-wrenching series finale. <br/><br/>As the seasons build, life truly seems to be on the line for every member of the strike team. Walton Goggins, who plays Detective Shane Vendrell, continually got better as the show progressed and gave mind blowing performance in the last two seasons.<br/><br/>What also makes The Shield so rich are the other characters on the show other than the Strike Team. CCH Pounder was brilliant throughout the series and Detective Dutch Waggenbach and Steve Billings both helped balance out the show.<br/><br/>Season long guest stints from stars Forrest Whitaker and Glenn Close helped make this show a top 10 drama of the decade.<br/><br/>If you like ""The Wire"" or ""The Sopranos"" then you need to check this show out...It will be worth your time",87 out of 98 found this helpful.,10.0,17 March 2010

I would even compare the series to The Wire, it is different of course and doesn't focus so much on the social aspects, it goes more for the action.<br/><br/>It's got all you need, corrupt cops, drugs, violence, betrayal, good detective work (homicide team) and even some hot chicks occasionally ;) So my conclusion is that if you like quality series with a persistent plot and cliffhangers like The Wire, Lost, Sopranos or Oz go for this one you won't regret it!

1153,The Shield, The Shield on 2020,"I just finished this series today on July 2020 and all I have to say is that it does not look cheap, old or non interesting, just keeping in mind this was filmed between 2002-2008.
First, most of the main cast are extremely good actors. Vic, Aceveda and Shane were the most powerful.
Second, the storyline and the length of the chapters are quite good too. Probably the story could have been told with 4-5 seasons easily. But it is what it is.
Last, camera work, make up and sound are pretty cool. I can't believe this show started on 2002.
On the other hand, seems some characters were not fully developed or look like the writers didn't want to give them credit. But not a big thing.
So, overall if you're looking for an excellent cops show, brutal, raw and almost perfect, this one is for you. Now, I'm going to watch The Wire. I want to compare both shows and see which one is better.",22 out of 23 found this helpful.,10.0,31 July 2020
1154,The Shield, Nothing like it,"I know im late to the party but i just wanted to add my two cents. I have seen a lot of shows in my life from the Wire , breaking bad , sons of anarchy , downtown abbey to GOT and everything in between ( of-course not but definitely all the ones worth watching ) but The Shield has a special place in my heart. First it saw me through the corona virus lockdown and had me baited hook line and sinker like i have never been . I almost cried when it ended because i didn't want it to but also had me enthralled to the point that i couldn't wait to see what the next episode would bring .<br/><br/>I think i cannot offer any compliments and praises that haven't been offered already . All i will say is it is like The Wire in treatment but with its own unique flavour. The writing is crisp , the hand held shooting gritty with each character addng a different dimension to the storyline. Each season brought with it a different commentary on all kinds of issues be it politics , family life, friendship, duty in the line of fire etc<br/><br/>Give it a go and be prepared for one heck of a ride",26 out of 28 found this helpful.,10.0,25 July 2020
1155,The Shield, One of a kind - a TV Series that actually gets better as it progresses,"I only heard of The Shield a few weeks ago. I had only just finished watching a previous TV show from start to finish, and was after a new one to pass the time. I typed in ""The Best TV Shows Ever"", or something similar, on Google, and I noticed that this was on a few lists. I'd never heard of it, but after checking to see that it was given a very respectable 8.7 rating on IMDb, I decided to check it out.<br/><br/>When I started, I was not unimpressed, but at the same time, I didn't really get the immediately-hooked feeling like I did at the start of other TV shows like Prison Break, Dexter and Breaking Bad, amongst others.<br/><br/>However, unlike most TV dramas, The Shield got progressively better throughout its series. The characters were very complex and I can't think of a single main character who I had both rooted for at times, yet wanted to see their downfall in others.<br/><br/>As I said, the series got progressively better, but in no way was I expecting the finale to be as good as it was. I've seen a fair few TV series in my time, but no series finale that I've seen has even come close to matching this one. An absolutely incredible finale of a quality that any series would have been proud of.<br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend this show. For me personally, it was a steady 7/10 for the first couple seasons, 8//10 and 9/10 for the next few, but 10/10 for its final season. To give the actual finale a rating out of ten would do it injustice as I'm sceptical that I'll ever see one as good as that.",37 out of 42 found this helpful.,9.0,11 April 2012
1156,The Shield, The Perfect TV Show?,"I haven't watched many TV shows ever since The Shield ended, and never again with the same devotion and lack of critical attitude. After The Shield, I just couldn't go back to watching problem-of-the-week type of shows, whether it be super-duper, morally perfect policemen solving a crime every episode (CSI, Criminal Minds, The Mentalist, et cetera), or some young reluctant hero killing monsters (Buffy The Vampire Slayer, Supernatural, et cetera). I became used to long-term plotting, dynamic characters constantly changing, complex narratives developing organically, and incisive critiques of society, race, sexuality, power, politics, family relationships, and more, much more. Yes, I even became used to bleakness, a lot of pessimism and a refusal to offer viewers simple solutions to complex problems. In this sense, The Shield is less a conventional TV show and more a novel in visual form, a long story, carefully plotted, full of meditations and insights into human nature, and a mirror to our times.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Vic Mackey and the other members of the Strike Team, a special LAPD unit that deals with street crime by bending the law as much as possible without snapping it. But then David Aceveda, the new captain, arrives at their precinct, demanding better crime stats. Aceveda is a cop with political ambitions and his cleaning up crime is just the first step on the road to become the mayor. This pushes the Strike Team to start using illicit methods to control the crime in their area, which ironically prompts Aceveda to start investigating them, by planting a spy in their group. When they get wind of this, they execute their team-mate and cover it up. This action reverberates throughout the series for all its 89 episodes. The Strike Team starts planning their early retirement by stealing from Armenian criminals, deal with betrayals, frequently try to redeem themselves, skirmish with Internal Affairs, all the while uncovering corruption, forging allies with criminals and federal agencies and simply trying to sort out their messy personal lives.<br/><br/>Every character is missed dearly, for no matter how corrupt, evil or Machiavellian, they were clearly loved by the writers. Instead of stock characters, we have human beings with distinct personalities, dreams, motivations, fears, different worldviews, ways of operating and different levels of morality. It was always fascinating to see the outspoken, bullying Vic Mackey share scenes with the subtle, scheming Aceveda; or to compare Detective Claudette's by-the-book approach to morals with Vic's the ends-justify-the-means philosophy; or to compare Captain Monica Rawling's progressive but unpopular methods with Aceveda's media-friendly ones; or Vic's attempts at redemption with his good friend Shane's downward spiral into corruption. Or you can just be enthralled by the characters' personal struggles: Officer Julien's battle with his repressed homosexuality; Detective Dutch's social awkwardness and inability to become popular in spite of being a damn good cop, arguably better than Vic; or I.A. Lieutenant Jon Kavanaugh's own battle to remain a good policeman while allowing his obsession to nail Vic turn him into the criminal he despises. I could write an entire page just listing the fascinating characters in the show. And I haven't even mentioned the villains: Antwon Mitchell, whose attempt to grab power in LA dominated one of the best seasons of the series; or the final villain of the series, the businessman Pezuela and his blackmail network. Still the best villains in the show tend to be the cops: Vic, Kavanaugh, Aceveda, Shane, et cetera. Through them we get a sweeping vista of contemporary society as well as penetrating studies of morality. Season 3, which is undeservedly considered one of the series' weakest parts, is arguably the best study of greed ever written for TV, on par with The Treasure of Sierra Madre. And the fast-paced season 7, after dozens upon dozens of speeches on loyalty, ends with one of the most devastating betrayals ever. I wouldn't say The Shield is a difficult series to watch; in fact it's immensely watchable and entertaining; but unless you're prepared to accept that people are basically corrupt and selfish, you probably won't appreciate it a lot. Like many good novels, it provides an unglamorous, bleak portrayal of people that is a far cry from the soothing pabulum TV offers.<br/><br/>The Shield mixes delicate drama with fast-paced action: it's fascinating to watch not only because of the violence, the sex, the cool and badass moments, but also because of the deep inner lives of each character, so well delineated and laid bare that we almost think we know them better than ourselves or our friends and relatives. Every action and decision exists organically; no character does anything that seems out of character or just to service the plot. Frequently they do stupid things, like we all do in our lives, but always for motives resulting from their own psychologies. The characters make the story, which is a nice change from typical TV storytelling, where often it seems characters are made to fit, by hook or by crook, into predetermined plots and conclusions. In opposition, The Shield's seasons build on each previous one, just like in a novel. When the series ends on episode 89, we know it was the only possible conclusion for every character. So it demands an investment of time and patience. In the 21st century, television finally learned that Twin Peak's formula was the way to go, namely long-term storytelling. Many mediocre TV shows were quick to bank on it, like Lost, with its ridiculous twists that screamed lack of planning, and Prison Break that started rehashing the same plot every season. But there were also a few good TV shows that learned the lesson well: The Wire, for instance. The Shield, however, for me is the apex of this new way of making TV shows. Even if it's not perfect, for nothing is, anything less than a 10 would be farce.",40 out of 46 found this helpful.,10.0,7 April 2012
1157,The Shield, Confused by the strange agenda of some reviews...,"There seems to be a glut of quite extreme 1-star reviews on here, all echoing a couple of very specific points which make me think they're not genuine. They focus on 1) the camera being shaky, and 2) the 'reaction shots' being cut away from too quickly. Very strange. So in response:<br/><br/>1) Yes, this is deliberate. It gives a subtle sense of realism and makes you feel like you're an observer of a real life situation rather than a glossy film or by the numbers drama. I noticed it for about half an episode and then didn't think about it for the next 7 seasons, given the overall quality of the shield.
2) I didn't notice this for one second. There are reaction shots, and they serve their purpose. Who watches a series thinking about the fact that the reaction shots are not quite long enough? Very strange, and it makes me think someone out there has a real agenda.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Shield was in my opinion one of the best shows I've watched. I got absolutely lost in it for 7 seasons. There wasn't a slack episode, or a slow moment.<br/><br/>There are no weak or cardboard cutout characters in this show - each one has depth and humanity, and the performances are superb. It manages to take you from the gritty street level crime of urban LA through the overarching political manoeuvring of the key players, and brilliantly blurs the lines between the criminal leaders and the leaders on the supposed 'right side' of the law, in the same way that the Wire did so well, all of them power hungry, and ruthless.<br/><br/>Some shows struggle to make individual episodes gripping while keeping hold of the long-term storylines - others can make a relatively good but incongruous individual episode, while having no idea where the show is going overall (Lost, The Walking Dead, take a bow). The shield achieves that rare thing of making each episode individually great, while never losing sight of the long-term view. I would say only a handful of other shows have achieved this. The finale, when it comes, brings in threads of storyline from the very first episode, and does it with brilliance and humanity.

1163,The Shield, The best cop show written and filmed to date.,"Often you will hear people praise 'The Wire', another cop show aired at the same time as 'The Shield'; in my opinion this is the better show for several reasons. I still would recommend 'The Wire', but 'The Shield' offers more content with an excellent story that follows Vic and his corrupt line-crossing strike team.<br/><br/>Consider that this show runs for 7 seasons, and in many people's opinions it is one of the shows that actually starts strong and gets better and better each season. The writing covers various real world topics and crime wrapped up into the daily cases for the murder police in 'The Barn', as well as coving the beat cops, and Vic's strike team.<br/><br/>All the material covered is blended in together in a seamless way, similar to 'The Sopranos'; and also similarly to that show, Vic is the anti-hero who sinks deeper and deeper into his worst nightmare. The Shield offers the best ending of a show, period; and overall the show in my view is on par with 'The Sopranos'. It is slightly different, since it follows from the side of the police; although Vic in many regards is a criminal in his own right.<br/><br/>I actually like the camera work in this show, sometimes it glides across; sometimes it feels like it is a fly on the wall; just catching a glimpse of a whispering conversation. I also really like the grittiness of the film and how it matches the content of the show perfectly.<br/><br/>The acting is top-class, and there are various characters that will wind you up, make you laugh, make you sad, and sometimes sick to your stomach. The content is brutal sometimes, and the pacing of the show is fast. This is a show you have to pay attention to, missing a scene sometimes can throw you off pace with the story. That might put some off, but for me it is a different style to the slow burn shown in 'The Wire'. I feel that the team who created this show had mastered their art.<br/><br/>I give it a perfect 10/10, as the 4th item out of only 8 that I rate that highly. It is worth a watch, alongside 'The Sopranos' -- though I have to admit that show is simply the best piece of cinema that has been created so far, with no exceptions.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,26 September 2020
1164,The Shield, The Wire Meets Boys In The Hood,"The Shield in my opinion as it is in most people's view, is probably regarded as second to The Wire as one of the greatest shows on television. The Shield is not just a cop show either, just like The Wire. With The Shield, you see politics, family issues, sexuality, and many other hard hitting topics that The Wire covers also but in two separate environments; Baltimore and Los Angeles. I was lucky enough to have bought the entire season 1 - 7 of The Shield on DVD at a good price, and slowly made my way through the vice and darkness that surrounds the show and its characters.<br/><br/>All I can really say is The Wire has only barely just topped The Shield in my opinion as a hard hitting gritty show. Both are almost fully fair in greatness, if not for The Wire beating the other by an inch. Through The Shield, you are tagging along on a journey with Vic Mackey and his Strike Team, through some harrowing and disturbing stories to the finale of this amazing show. Just as the The Wire is considered to be an analysis of society, I believe The Shield is too more so through the police but you still see both sides of the same argument from the political and criminal side too. <br/><br/>No one is innocent, and no one can pretend to be either as they all hide secrets. Through The shield you will see some harrowing scenes, some gritty cliffhangers to the seasons and some life-changing decisions being made in the show by its cast. Its harrowing, disturbing, gritty, hard hitting, and so down in the dirt realistic you know this happens almost everywhere. If not to watch for the crime side to it, watch The Shield to see an analysis of family life, ones own battle with their sexuality, the ever-running struggle against the corrupt institutions. Its a study of policing in an urban environment torn by strife, violence, racism and definitely the class system.<br/><br/>As each season passes and new ones open, we are left with many questions, awaiting answers. We await retribution, vengeance, and just deserves but we keep watching as it it so addictive. The Shield barely scrapes the top of the world of policing, especially in a city like Los Angeles, but it does a good job and comes close to the scale The Wire takes on. Tear jerking acting, top-notch plots and directing. The Shield to me and many others is right up there next to The Wire.",59 out of 79 found this helpful.,10.0,20 May 2010

1168,The Shield, helluva good show....,"it's been a long time, since I've been posting on IMDb.. but this show is absolutely worth watching. <br/><br/>There were some slow yawn-full moments and episodes and a couple of overacting moments through-out the latest episodes, but some of the best parts are done in between moments, when CCH Pounder and Michael Chicklis are meeting on, face to face. It gives a real intense character-play and dispute amongst these two qualified actors and critical claims when it comes to corrupt environmental-issues. The guest-appearances were a big plus for this show also. Whitaker played his part with an emotional yet troubled authority-figure, craving to do whatever he could with his part of that show. I never expected Glenn Close to pull off a role, in the shield..that was really unexpected, but well done, after all.<br/><br/>This show portrays that, intensity doesn't always need gigantic action sequences or unrealistic special effects...it tries to deliver some sort of street value or real aspects of what it feels like, if the viewer were actually present, during busts and interrogations.

No over explaining every thing to you like you're an idiot (i.e. C.S.I.). No clear good guy / bad guy. Everyone is human. The action is there, the suspense is there, they shoot it as if you are there. Vic Mackey and his strike team are a force for the gangs of Farmington to contend with.

The Strike Team is composed of detectives Vic Mackey, Shane Vendrell, Curtis ""Lem"" Lemansky, and Ronnie Gardocki, all of whom use their identities as cops to receive bribes, plant evidence, push drugs, and kill for their own purposes. This show starts out excellent, and only gets better, culminating in, in my opinion, the greatest t.v. finale ever made.

This is shaping up to be a really good series, and with Starz you know there will be no corners cut, they have real competition out there, and they know it.

1201,Wentworth, This series gets better and better,"I was a huge fan of the first season of Wentworth Prison when it was shown on Channel 5 in the UK last year. I thought the series proved to be a great 'standalone' drama with high quality production values, excellent writing and acting. The series at the same time also paid subtle and gracious homage to Prisoner, a special and ground breaking show. Well the second season doesn't disappoint, building on the quality of the first season, and it is mostly down to the clever introduction into the Wentworth mix of one character - Joan Ferguson. Pamela Rabe is simply brilliant as Joan Ferguson - taking on the mantle of one of the most iconic of TV characters and breathing a new 21st century life into her is no easy job, but Rabe achieves it, obviously relishing the opportunity to play such an unusual female character. Rabe's on screen presence, controlled physical stillness and a real glint in the eye hides an obvious wealth of feelings, which comes out in small doses throughout the season, in carefully played scenes where unexpected kindness and sincerity adds real depth to an already complicated individual. The 'new' Joan Ferguson has obvious OCD and abhors physical contact. Her compulsion to control every part of her environment (including her office) her staff and prisoners is wonderfully realised by Rabe, with a series of subtle physical ticks, cold stares and calculating mental games with everyone around her. Great use is made of prison security cameras which become Joan's 'All seeing eye'. Clever adaption of surgical gloves is used as a visual tease (and a wink) in the early episodes of what is to come from Joan later on. The writing, production and cast are universally excellent once again, with particular mention to Nicole da Silva and Danielle Cormack who play Frankie and Bea. As in the first season, the use of slow motion image capture and end sequence music is particularly effective. I for one can't wait for season three.",74 out of 82 found this helpful.,10.0,28 October 2014
1202,Wentworth, One of the best shows I've ever watched without a doubt!,"I put off watching this for a long time, under the false impression that it would just be a different version of 'Orange Is The New Black' (which I do love, but am not really searching for shows similar to it because I don't particularly like jail/prison shows) but man was I wrong. It is NOTHING like OITNB. Their similarities begin and end with it being set in a female prison.<br/><br/>When I finally gave in and started watching, I was instantly hooked. Each episode is filled with action and drama and plenty of moments that make you either laugh or cry. The characters are unique and truly wonderfully played, you will quickly grow to love or hate each of them (sometimes both!) and as you learn their backstories you get a sense of really knowing and understanding them. <br/><br/>There are some scenes that will literally have you on the edge of your seat, with your heart racing, yelling at the TV. <br/><br/>After finishing this, I had to go find 'Prisoner Cell Block H' and give it a try. While it's nowhere near as good as 'Wentworth' (in my opinion) it was definitely neat to see the differences between the two. <br/><br/>I'd definitely recommend Wentworth to anyone, I can't think of anyone I know who wouldn't like it, all of my friends who have watched it agree that it is one of their all time favorites!

This is a completely new take on a long running series from the 1980s with the necessary level of added grit needed in 2013. Whilst employing many of the well known character names; the ""new"" version has created juicy variations to the originals. Those familiar with the original series should not allow themselves to by put off in the early stages by casting of different types to play the original characters. Ep 1 was edgy, well paced and the acting overall was very good. If Wentworth can maintain the same intensity over its remaining 9 episodes of season 1, it will be a treat to watch. As well as seeing how the initial variation to different main characters develop, perhaps growing into their more familiar traits from the original series as the new series progresses. Clearly this re-make is attempting to tell the background story as to how the likes of Bea Smith, Vera Bennett, Meg Jackson and Frankie Doyle came to be like they were in the original Prisoner series.",56 out of 66 found this helpful.,8.0,1 May 2013

The series has great characters, the storyline is on point, the script is good and no plotholes for me at least . This series depicts exactly how prison life is like and spills out every single detail about prison spicing up the drama. I love the fact that this series is both interesting and educative as well.

1213,Wentworth, I can't believe how incredible this gem is,This show is surgically executed. It builds and builds and when you least expect erupts like a violent volcano. I warn you it can be bloody and violent but that's the shock of it because you don't see it coming. Just when you think it's become stable BOOM. THIS is the best prison show hands down. The casting and acting is out of this world. Each of the seasons finales are staggering. I've watched all 3 seasons and each is a prize waiting to behold. This series is brilliant. The way the lead has grown and transgressed is so awesome. I love this show. Orange is the new black I can't even watch after I first saw this. It literally changed the game.

It makes Orange is the New Black look like Sistehood of the Travelling Pants.

While the main focus is on telling the story of Bea Smith and Vera Bennett, each episode tells a different story about how the additional prisoners became imprisoned.<br/><br/>If you loved Prisoner Cell Block H then you really will love this! Not only is it interesting to see how Bea and Vera become the infamous characters we love, the acting and stories is just fantastic.

1217,Wentworth, Wentworth,"Only started watching Wentworth Prison a few weeks ago and so far I have loved every minute of it as I have caught up to where its currently at (Series 4, episode 7). It's definitely one of my favourite TV shows right now and I'm glad it has already been renewed for a 5th series at least.<br/><br/>The basic premise is the life of the inmates but after watching a few episodes you soon realise its much deeper than that. We see their lives inside and out as well as the prison guards who all add something a little different.<br/><br/>The main characters all have strong development as the series goes on so it's important that you find some of the characters likable as you will certainly be learning a lot about them. The Freak is one of the greatest TV villains of all time &amp; Bea is a character that we see evolve massively. The supporting characters are all great too.<br/><br/>All of the story lines are captivating and most of the time I didn't want the episodes to end, I would usually watch 3 in one sitting. Each season seems to have one main story line but there is always something different going on elsewhere as well. Sometimes its shockingly violent but sometimes we just see the characters having a laugh. The tone of the show can change at any given moment.<br/><br/>There is plenty of twists and turns as characters come and go and relationships are ever changing to the point where nobody knows who to trust.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked the story lines and each character brought something unique to the show.

You cannot compare the two even though both is based around womens prison unit. You do not have to like a certain genre to watch this or be super intelligent, you can simply enjoy it. I'm really upset hardly anyone I know doesn't watch it which is why i had to write this review as to why everyone should!

It has much more depth &amp; character. It's just more REAL, although not what prisons are like here in America. I first started watching shows about prison when Prison Break came out on Netflix, and I quickly became hooked. I know that one was entirely fiction but it was a fantastic program. Each episode kept me on the edge of my seat. While Orange is the New Black isn't bad, you're often left knowing that more happened, that there were things that were omitted either from the book or the show. With Wentworth you never get that feeling. You get to learn what these people struggle with, not just the prisoners, but also the guards and the administration.

1220,Wentworth," Wentworth, worth all it's weight in watchability","Looking back now, Prisoner was a laugh riot. Dad and I were laughing when they repeated the original series, again, that seems so cheesy now, if of course unrealistic, judging by the larger than life plots, and some highly and insanely unlikely scenarios, that caused a bit of eye rolling. Oh, how times have changed. This new, better series is more modernized as now having security cameras with much better looking women and better actors, although the ones from the original must be praised too. Don't fault them, it's what they had to work with. We retain our chief characters from the original, though some, altered, here and there, especially Vera 'Vinegar Tits' Bennett, played wonderfully by a familiar Seachange face. Danielle McCormack holds her own, very strong as Bea, and a much hotter looking Frankie Doyle, is a very animated and absorbing character, wonderfully played by De Silva, up there by McCormack. Even the brief Jim Fletcher character is reprised by McCleod's Daughter's Aaron Jeffrey. But it's Pamela Rabe as the notorious Joan Ferguson, who's really scarring and creepy to the max. I was impressed and admired her take on the role, that's so creepily haunting, I prefer her to Maggie's Kirkpatrick's portrayal. It's great to see different actors do the same role, putting their own spin on it. Hey if they copied the other actors, it would be boring, and unwatchable, but when actors breath a lot of originality, life and traits into that role, you know it will be, and I'm not just saying that about Rabe's, but her performance was the one, who had the real effect on me, that sly smile, and those unreadable expressions in that steel gaze of hers, that only leaves you wanting more. This is one of those successful remakes, a much scarier and tougher Prisoner this time around, some women you don't want to mess with, the much younger ones, some real cuties. Hey, if you want laughs and escapism, just go back to the original, as this one, a much more serious and intense series, is far different from what went on 24 years earlier.

It's also incredible with the effects and acting, even though its a remake of the series Prisoner: Cell Block H. I'd have to say it's much better and more violent, which is just perfect. This also shows how girls can be as bad ass, just as boys, which is another amazing thing due to these series.

NOBODY THOUGHT ABOUT OFFERING A HORSE! They built a safe path and we already know they have horses, but, no, the episode has to last so much minutes so we need a diversion.

Maureen and John are floating on a gas planet and, out of nowhere, are hit by a  SPACE WHALE that sends them reeling and they are almost lost (almost... they barely make it... see diversion above...).
Speaking of Maureen : ""strap on guys, it's going to be a bumpy ride "" but she doesn't, because, hey, she's a super hero (one of the numerous things that don't make sense for people with a military training... including the security protocols, that are always brushed away to make room for more scenario holes... my god...).

But... unfortunately the dialogues are so poor, full of exposition and plot holes. The actors are constantly trying to pull out emotions without having enough background reasons to express them out so strongly.

1232,Lost in Space," Fun facts learned from watching ""Lost in Space""","From the first four episodes....<br/><br/>1. A sizable body of water can freeze solid before a swimmer inches from the surface gets out, while characters above in an arctic environment headed toward -60 that night are conversing without their helmets on in temperatures warm enough that their breath isn't fogging.<br/><br/>2. A forest will grow thirty feet from the face of a glacier. This delicate vegetation is untouched by the tornadic gravel-cane that imperils our intrepid cast elsewhere.<br/><br/>3. Forests, glaciers, and scrub-desert can be found within two miles of each other.<br/><br/>4. Alien robots understand English, but will speak only three words.<br/><br/>5. In a mere thirty years, we will have interstellar-capable spacecraft whose furnishings and electronics remain intact and operational despite a day's immersion in water flooding the inside of the ship.<br/><br/>6. In these 2050s, chip-implants are the basis of security access, but fingerprint- and facial-recognition redundancy has been forgotten.<br/><br/>7. Flare gun kits come with only three flares despite room for a dozen more in the case, and flares costing like a dollar apiece, tops.<br/><br/>8. The airlock you're trapped inside will audibly count down the ten seconds until the outer door opens, evacuating you into a space (and a grisly death if you're not suited up), giving you plenty of time to abort...if only you could reach the controls on the other side of the door. Because there aren't controls on your side. Because space-station designers are thoroughgoing sadists who know these sorts of things are going to happen.<br/><br/>9. Precocious teenage girls know that a handful of salt will annoy the alien, fuel-eating eels swimming around in a flooded ship's hold. (The eels are eating a delicious hydrocarbon fuel because we're apparently still using those in spaceships. And because the hole in the hull that let the eels into the fuel doesn't just let all the fuel leak out of the ship.)<br/><br/>10. The mechanic will keep a pet chicken, because the producers have foreseen the need for someone in the cast to possess a smidgeon of charisma.<br/><br/>11. Oreos bind dysfunctional families together. Until they're gone, which is quickly.<br/><br/>12. Toby Stephens was so desperate for work after the conclusion of ""Black Sails"" that he agreed to a part whose script called for him to portray a cucked moron subservient to his domineering almost-ex and disobedient children. He gets less respect than Rodney Dangerfield.<br/><br/>13. If your wife slept with the MADtv UBS delivery-guy, you'll raise his kid as your own.<br/><br/>14. Communications employ old-style corded-wire hand-sets because those looked so cool in the ""Battlestar Galactica"" reboot, which had them for rational reasons as the Cylons could eavesdrop on WiFi.<br/><br/>15. When what you really should have on hand is a big, strong male to do a man's job shoving that heavy metal cylinder home in the engine-bay, it's a good thing there's another girl available when you need her there to demonstrate that you don't need no man after all. Estrogen-bonding FTW!<br/><br/>16. Jupiter landing craft share the same quality suspension parts as a 1999 Chrysler minivan.<br/><br/>17. A planet whose orbiting satellite is either so close or so large that its diameter is about twenty times Earth's moon won't be constantly subjected to magnitude-11 earthquakes and ocean tides oversweeping its continents.<br/><br/>18. Will Robinson is the only teenage boy in the universe hesitant to accept the gun that his pet robot 3D-printed for him. --Printed on the ship's 3D-printer despite weapon schematics being off-limits to everyone, including his father, the ship's captain. Lucky password guess?<br/><br/>19. Due to budgetary constraints, the show will now be named ""Lost in British Columbia"" for the rest of the season.<br/><br/>20. When you need your robot to push a 100-ton boulder out of the way, there's nothing it can't do when the ground it's standing on provides 100 tons worth of traction. Despite this apparent fortitude, it will later come apart at the seams during a fifty-foot fall.<br/><br/>21. The mechanic is the most gregarious and winsome person in a parsec. Naturally, he will be treated like sheep-dip by cast regulars whom we'd rather see less of. Much less of.<br/><br/>22. Communications take thirty minutes to come back on after a trivial, non-worrisome power-spike of the sort that can be caused by a boy deliberately flipping a circuit-breaker.<br/><br/>23. It's OK, Will; I understand perfectly: I would love your amnestic alien murderbot (concept *totally* stolen from ""The Iron Giant"") more than the rest of your family too. In fact, I would also run away from them with it on an uncharted planet with just a backpack full of supplies, because adventure-bound like Alby Mangels.<br/><br/>24. Claps make the flowers open, roars make them close. Evolutionary reason unknown (do clappers pollinate?)<br/><br/>25. You can save serious couch-change on monster CGI by having a couple guys run through foliage under a tarp in the distance.<br/><br/>26. Predator-cam is shaky-cam.<br/><br/>27. Robots understand all manner of danger that could potentially face Will Robinson, except for that posed by gravity while balancing on a tree trunk dropped across a bottomless chasm.<br/><br/>28. According to children mistrustful of adults, the amnestic alien murderbot needs to ""remain our little secret"", and they are actually capable of persuading others of this.<br/><br/>29. A hungry monster scared away won't eat a straggler sneaking along a few minutes later, alone at night. (Granted, the doctor stole a gun...but the monster wouldn't know that.)<br/><br/>30. Solar-powered electric-battery cars are just as big of pieces of crap in the future as they are today! (Maybe you didn't need to run all ten headlights at night?)<br/><br/>31.

They fail at a basic premise of good science fiction - you never resolve issues by new magic tech, you rely on logic and on the pre-established rules of the fictional world. So far in this show the rules seem to be made up along the way to fix plot holes. <br/><br/>As for the 'PC' issues, I don't care about it much, I assumed that Judy was from a previous relationship or something.

1237,Lost in Space, Why you will love it or hate it,"Several reviews start off with the notion of not understanding why someone would like or not like the series. So I thought I'd highlight some areas of warranted and unwarranted critique.<br/><br/>First off, the series is best viewed binged. In the early episodes the plot focuses a lot on the family situation so just viewing a few episodes is not enough to feel the overall plot moving. So after just watching a few episodes the series is still in the starting pit, you really have to give the first season a chance by giving it time to unfold.<br/><br/>Secondly, the story is focus on family development in season 1, so of course the family starts out in shambles. The mother has been solely in charge of taking care of the family for years. She has had to make difficult and bad decision just to keep her family together. However, now the father is back and trying to get his place back in the family. However, what many reviews seem to ignore and dismiss as ""a dysfunctional family"" is that he deceived his family; he wasn't drafted, he volunteered to leave them and they resent him for it. They still love each other and over the first season work to get their relationships back together. Season two is on the other hand more focused on individual character's development and has a more action packed plot.<br/><br/>Thirdly, this is a reboot only by name and some premises, so all those who want a modern copy of the 60's series will not get it - for better and for worse. Some characters might be portrayed differently but they are not bad. The actors are really good. Maxwell Jenkins is amazing as Will and Parker Posey is so brilliant at being a sociopathic Dr. Smith that I can't stand watching her just as much as I can't stop. From other reviews you get sense that the reviewer loved the original so much that they can't get over that Judy is adopted in this version and that the characters are not just straight up geniuses, but smart at some things and flawed went it comes to other things.<br/><br/>Fourth, you can feel the quality put into the series; especially when it comes to SGI and quality in actors. Some complaints have been raised about the humbug-science in the series but not even CSI-shows use real science. Shows make things up all the time. The question should just be about how well they get away with it, and this series is a sci-fi about other planets so they can get away with things not working like on earth pretty well. The quality is leaps above titles like The Orville, Start Trek and Stargate SG-1, and those are good shows so I have no complaints. However, those shows have had years to develop.<br/><br/>Fifth, yes, they make stupid decisions which could have been solved better. This is common in all series though to push the plot in more eventful directions. The question is whether this it is an empty plot devise or help the characters' developments. Is the decision stupid to all or plausible for the individual character's state of being? It is surprising how many reviewers seem to get stuck on things that feel illogical to them rather to whether it is illogical to the character or to the premises of the planet the characters are on. So far, the stupidity is not more prevalent than in any other show and something that even happens to geniuses<br/><br/>Final thoughts: What draws me in more than anything is Will's and the Robot's relationship, but also finding out more about the part they play in the whole scheme of things. After seeing the first season my imagination ran wild with anticipation and possible plot developments and what the developers put forth did not let me down. The second season was above my expectations. Now my imagination is running wild again with anticipation for the third season and I hope to see even more sides to the human nature be explored.",85 out of 126 found this helpful.,9.0,15 January 2020

It has a great balance of good acting, reasonable story, amazing visuals as well as thrills. I read one review that said he binged the whole season in one day but only gave it 2 stars?? If it's good enough to not stop watching it, it deserve more than that?? 
The original was 60s fluff. You can only take the premise and bones of the show in the modern age and run with it which is why is a great property to work with.
The family work well together and you really want to know more about them. Doctor Smith is fantastic. Beautifully manipulative and one that you hate intensely one minute and then feel sorry for the next. Dark shades of grey make the best baddies.
Don is fun and will develop I'm sure as will the story and I can't wait to find out how everything connects.
We lose so many great shows before they can hit their strides because of binary reviews and ratings it really frustrates me. There is nothing except a few story driven, science bending, mistakes.

Upsetting? All of those? I don't know. While watching, the show did stir my emotions but not in the intended way. I was annoyed by the writing. It's terrible. As other's have mentioned, it's beyond sci-fi, or the laws of physics don't apply outside of our little corner of the universe. <br/><br/>The show is unappealing in it's attempts to portray the wife as the savior, genius, problem-solver, intillectual hero. She treats her husband like complete trash. So much so that I really wanted her to die as part of the series. That would have made the show so much better. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for women being powerful and heroic, but this is over the top and if the roles were reversed, there'd be another huge women's rights march. It's that ridiculous. <br/><br/>The show was upsetting because it doesn't go anywhere. The problems are all made up because none of these people listen to orders, use critical or logistical thought in decision making, and treat eachother like crap. In a real situation many of the scenarios the characters find themselves in could be solved by using logic and reason. Instead, they smother everything with emotion and rely on second-hand information to make substantial decisions. <br/><br/>The show had an interesting premise but the writers ruined it.

1249,Batman: The Animated Series, A True Masterpiece- the greatest body of animated work ever!,"When Batman: the animated series came around, it didn't take people long to see that it was something different. Here was a ""cartoon"" that was written for adults. It could be viewed by older kids, but it had great depths for the adults who took any time with it. Each episode (or couple of episodes) acts as its own mini-movie. The structuring of the story in each one is just so well executed. As well, the animation (for its time) was quite good, and still holds up well enough today. Another difference from other animation, is that the color palette is quite dark- which, again, only makes it more interesting. All of the great villains are here (and others you may not have heard of), but they get a very serious and, at times, philosophical explication. One of my favorite things about the series, is that every episode has its own orchestral score- meaning, the music that you hear is tailored to fit the exact moment you are watching. Shirley Walker manages to come up with so many sub-themes and variations on the main theme- and works them in so well with the happenings on screen. For those of you that have seen the series and remember it fondly, you might be interested to know that a box-set of the first 28 episodes was recently released- you can get it just about anywhere.",179 out of 190 found this helpful.,,19 September 2004

Groundbreaking animation, superior voice-over work, and top-notch stories have made this series into a creation too stupendous to call a ""cartoon."" Each episode was a wondrous, albeit dark, trip through Batman's world, and how he faces each and every obstacle Gotham City gives him.  Much like an amalgam of all of Batman's two-dimensional incarnations, this series' Dark Knight is tortured and driven, but not requite enough to give his enemies pithy comebacks and display romantic charms.  Definitely, this is the way the Batman should and always be depicted.",167 out of 178 found this helpful.,10.0,10 December 1998
1251,Batman: The Animated Series, The series that finally got it right!,"We longtime (read ""old"") fans of Batman have been waiting for a cinematic Batman that reflects the greatness of the comic books.  Unfortunately, we have had to put up with the worst attempts to realize this great character. The movie serials were atrocious, the Adam West show, although entertaining, treated the character as a joke.  The Filmation cartoons and the Superfriends were watered down. The more recent movies are a mixed bag. Then, along came BTAS, and we were finally satisfied.<br/><br/>Everything, from the look and tone of the animation, to the stories and voicework was first-rate.  Batman is the Dark knight Detective.  He's not a guy in a rubber suit.  He is skilled, intelligent, obsessed, tortured, and dedicated.  The villains are evil, psychotic, and just plain loopy.  We have Paul Dini's wonderful creation of Harley Quinn, the first inspired and interesting character, since Denny O'Neil created Ra's al Ghul.<br/><br/>The creators took their cue from the legendary Flesicher Bros. version of Superman, with it's Art Deco stylings and darker color palette.  It took its story concepts from the work of Bill Finger, Denny O'Neil, Frank Miller, and Steve Engelhart.  The music was inspired by the wonderful Danny Elfman music from the Tim Burton film.  The voicework featured outstanding actors, with mature direction from Andrea Romano.<br/><br/>The only criticism I can level at the show is that they avoided doing a complete episode revolving around Batman's origin.  Granted, the broadcast standards and practices limited how much they could show, but they found a way to present Robin's origin, without sacrificing story.  They did present elements, but I would have liked to have seen a complete episode, with his training and ""year one"" adventures.  The Superfriends episode, ""The Fear"" presented more of the origin than BTAS ever depicted.  Still, it didn't detract from the overall effectiveness of the series.<br/><br/>The series even improved on some of the elements of the comics.  Personally, I never thought much of Bane, but I enjoyed the BTAS version, complete with the Lucha Libre stylings; Bane as luchador hitman, classic!  The Joker was far more interesting here than he had been for some time in the comics.  The Riddler came across as deadly, rather than a joke.  Alfred provided more than window dressing.<br/><br/>This is the series that set the standard for all other cinematic Batman efforts.  Thankfully, it removed the bitter taste of Joel Schumacher.",138 out of 148 found this helpful.,,10 September 2003

He's such a tragic character as he's given up a personal life for his parents dream.  The stories are wonderfully intelligent and fun at the same time.  There are very few poor episodes in this series (but note that their are some).  Even lame villains like the Clock King and Mr. Freeze are made engaging and exciting.  Ignore the movies and watch the series.  Heck, at times it can even be much more realistic than the movies (like in ""I am the Night"") Some recommended episodes are: ""Almost Got 'Im"" (a poker game where Bat-Villain recount how they almost killed him), ""His Silicon Soul"" (a robot clone of Batman is a little too much like Batman too do a computers evil bidding) and ""the Man who killed Batman"" (in which a small time crook has seemingly killed Batman... by accident)",44 out of 51 found this helpful.,,17 August 2000

The only major problem with the series is that it is too rich for a half hour. The best episodes are the two part episodes like Heart of Steel, The Cat and The Claw, Feat of Clay, and Two-Face.

1261,Batman: The Animated Series, Batman at his best.,"Batman the animated series is one of the best cartoon series ever. Originally aimed at young viewers it also is a series that is watched just as much by adults.<br/><br/>This cartoon is different than most other cartoons. It is not just non stop action with no plot. The plots of the episodes from this series were amazingly good, good enough to be used for drama series. The dialogue and voice over work was amazing and the animation always remains the same through much of the series, spectacular.<br/><br/>Batman is well portrayed in this series. He has no tolerance for anyone who violates the law. Relentless, he will not stop until he has accomplished what he sets out to accomplish. Batman has no fear in this cartoon. Bruce Wayne is also well portrayed in this show. He is a more than capable heir who keeps Wayne Enterprises running. Has a great sense of who to trust and what to do.<br/><br/>One of the best things about Batman in general has been his villains. That is true here as well; Batman's villains in ""Batman the animated series"" are awesome. The Joker and his diabolical evil schemes. The Penguin and his various umbrella weapons. Poison Ivy and how she uses her evil plants against Batman. Two-Face(my personal favorite) and his good heads bad head coin that decides if he does evil deeds or not. The Mad Hatter and his obsession with controlling others minds. Scarecrow and his constant use of fear. Catwoman and her stealth not to mention her feelings for Batman. The Riddler and his mind twisting puzzles. Other great villains in this series are Killer Croc, Harley QUinn, Rupert Thorne, Clay face, and Mr. Freeze.<br/><br/>I found it awesome how Mark Hamill and Roddy Mcdowell are the voices of the Joker and The Mad Hatter respectfully. I have the utmost respect for Hamill and his role in Star Wars and Mcdowell and his role in Planet of the Apes. So it is good to see such notable actors as characters in this show.<br/><br/>In this D.V.D. (volume one) there are numerous great episodes, many of them two parters. Ones that I really like are ""Two-Face"", a part episode that explains the origin of how Harvey Dent became Two-Face. Also great is another two part episode titled ""Feat of Clay"", another two parter telling the tragic story of Matt Hagen who became Clayface. But you really cant go wrong with any episodes. They are all great.<br/><br/>This is a great show. Must see. Check out Batman the Animated Series.

Not only is this an amazing TV show, but one of the best incarnations of Batman ever. This isn't your mommy and daddy's Batman/Super Friends. I have always loved this show and when it came out on DVD I bought every volume and the animated movies it spawned. I love owning these sets and as I write this I'm watching an episode. <br/><br/>While this show was aimed at kids on the surface it was truly written for adults. It deals with many adult themes and situations. Mobsters, murder, schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder, earning the love and respect of ones friends and family, Bruce Wayne/Batman fighting his inner demons and the need for avenging his parents by fighting all the evil-doers of the world, etc. <br/><br/>While the campy-ness of Adam West's Batman/Super Friends worked perfectly for that show and era, the darkness of this show makes it a masterpiece. Thanks to Tim Burton's Batman this show's dark and sometimes scary themes were accepted by the networks but that is the only thing the two have in common. The action sequences are unbeatable, story lines are fantastic, this is the Dark Knight the way he was meant to be seen. If you are new to the Batman lore than this is a great place to start...here or with Batman Begins.<br/><br/>The voice-acting is immaculate, Kevin Conroy - Batman, Mark Hamill - Joker, Efram Zimblast - Alfred, Bob Hastings - Gordon, and all the others are wonderful as each character, couldn't ask for a better cast. The structuring of every episode was so well executed you couldn't wait to see what would happen in the next minute or by next week's episode.

1263,Batman: The Animated Series," A great ""Batman""","I'm a comic book reader. I also watch a lot of television. ""Batman"" is one of the great shows that has everything we love about the DC Comics character created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger combined with the visual aesthetics of modern-day television. I'm not much a reader of DC's material (Marvel Comics and their Spider-Man and X-Men are my main interests), but Batman ranks as my favorite character from that particular company. While I'll agree that Batman has had a troubled history in terms of television and film (Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman"" is my #7 movie of all time and is what got me interested in movies in the first place), I've also noticed that he has a massive base of overly rabid fans, many of whom become sore at the slightest change of the character. Well, this animated series appears to be an animation vision that they can finally be pleased with. Of course, Gotham City billionaire Bruce Wayne witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, and grew up to become the mythical ""Batman,"" the masked vigilante prowling the city's rooftops and taking out crime wherever it rears its ugly head. He's aided in his crime-fighting endeavors by his faithful butler Alfred while also nursing many personal demons. ""Batman"" carried over the 1989 film's dark and grim tone, the same tone as the comics that inspired it, as well as the revisionist re-workings of Frank Miller (like his epic ""The Dark Knight Returns"" and ""Batman: Year One""), and proved to be a hit with fans and those eager to forget the campy Adam West show from the 1960s. With this darker approach to the character, it's quite easy to forget that this is a children's show, even though it's also quite obvious that it's aimed at a slightly older audience as well.<br/><br/>Regardless, this is a ""Batman"" that we can all be proud of.<br/><br/>10/10",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,20 June 2008

There is great action sequences, suspense, character dialogue, and plots for each episode. I can watch these episodes over and over again and not get tired of them. Excellent job on each villain and vigilante. The show also brings out the best in each and every character in the show with excellent acting and voice over.

1266,Batman: The Animated Series, A definitive work in television animation; a legacy that might remain unmatched,"""Batman"", later dubbed ""The Adventures of Batman and Robin"" and then rebooted to ""The New Adventures of Batman"" after a couple years of absence, is probably the most significant animated incarnation of the Caped Crusader there ever was. To some, it is the definition of who the Batman is, stripped of the extremely complex and often retconned story lines in the comic. And while some comic book purists may scoff at the PG nature of the show, I think that most viewers, both child and adult, found a lot to appreciate in its surprisingly mature storytelling, gorgeous animation and its lasting impact on both animation and well as the overall legacy of the Dark Knight.<br/><br/>""Batman"" was the birthplace of the DC Comics animated universe, which would later spawn additional shows featuring the Man of Steel as well as the Justice League. A far cry from the more lighthearted version of Batman found in the campy old television show, this Batman had a lot more in common with the 1989 film, including its early scoring. However, it wasn't a cartoon take on the movie, rather, it was a synthesized take on Batman, bringing in characters from all over Batman's history and sometimes rewriting their history as well as creating all new characters, some of which proved to be so popular they ended up entering the comic book's universe.<br/><br/>The stories are primarily anthology, with a few two-parters here and there. However, this format works pretty well for the show and somehow, it avoids becoming a ""villain of the week"" premise by creating some very unique stories even while presenting a villain each week. Even early on, Batman provided a Rashomon-style tale in ""P.O.V."" with three cops providing their take on what happened when the Batman showed up at a crime scene. Later stories include extended nightmares, fantasies, epics, romances as well as stories that introduce Batman's allies, such as Robin. And although the show is titled Batman, it often is willing to make the Bat a supporting character in exploring the other characters in its universe, to great result.<br/><br/>""Batman"" also can't be mentioned without talking about the amazing art. Here is a take on Batman, setting it in a gorgeous strongly art-deco inspired world, which is immediately eye-catching and sets a remarkably consistent tone for the series. Furthermore, one thing you'll quickly notice is that the show is dark. Perhaps in themes sometimes, but especially in color. In the DVD commentary, you learn that the show is actually painted on black instead of white, which leads it to have an incredibly dark overall look, which further helps paint the grim world that the Batman inhabits.<br/><br/>And then there's the acting. Kevin Conroy essentially created what would become what we know as the Batman's voice, alternating between the lighter playboy Bruce Wayne and the gruff growl of Batman. Mark Hamill (yes, Luke Skywalker) also helped create one of the definitive versions of the Joker with a laugh that can't be forgotten. Almost all the acting over the show's long run is remarkable, making it hard to replace these versions of the characters with others, even from the movies.<br/><br/>Halfway through its first run, the show's title was changed and reflected the stronger incorporation of Robin and other supporting characters, but outside of a less interesting title sequence, the show pretty much stayed the same. Then the show ended and the team went on to work on the ""Superman"" series, but revived ""Batman"" again in the ""New Adventures"". This incarnation revamped the art style to be more angular, simpler and sometimes much darker--the Scarecrow especially became rather creepy. The show also changed even more to incorporate extended allies into the story, including a young Tim Drake as Robin, the persistent presence of Barbara Gordon as Batgirl and even the older Dick Grayson makes several appearances as Nightwing. Although I was hesitant to embrace the new incarnation at first, it become clear to me that the storytelling as well as the presentation remained strong, with some great episodes that would stand with the best of its previous incarnation.<br/><br/>Because of its impact on animation and the titular character, its willingness not to dumb down for children, its wise storytelling, its amazing art and the inescapable legacy of entertainment in my life, ""Batman"" remains one of the greatest animated series that I have ever witnessed. Even today, though its been well over a decade since the show debuted and almost a decade since the ""New Adventures"" ended, the show remains incredibly engaging. This is definitely a series that endures and perhaps one that I would continue to watch over the years, as an adult to appreciate the depth of the stories and the gorgeous art, and a series that I would not hesitate to share with appropriately aged children. Recommended without reservation. 10/10.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,16 November 2008
1267,Batman: The Animated Series, The Best Show Ever!,"I love this show.I remember waking up early every Saturday morning to go downstairs to watch this show.I loved it back then because of the amazing action and I was a huge Robin fan as a child.Now as I've gotten older I've bought every episode of the show on DVD to take a nice trip down memory lane,but I have found something more than just memories.<br/><br/>When I was younger I didn't fully appreciate the stories and animation,but now that I re-watch this show I notice all of the shows amazing production values.The stories are superb,very well thought out and well orchestrated.There are very few shows on in Prime Time television now with such amazing and well written stories.And the animation was very fluent and realistic,but the art style is what ultimately steals the show and makes it unique.The Art Deco look just suits the character of Batman and his world perfectly.But what holds the whole show together and adds that extra ounce of flavoring to it is the music,voice acting,and sound effects.Each fight features some new sound effect you've never heard before,and the music sells the mood of each scene(and I believe the shows theme songs,because there are two,are the best theme songs ever).And the voice acting is top notch,they cast these voices to their respective characters perfectly(Kevin Conroy IS Batman).<br/><br/>Now about 14 years or so later,I went back to watch this show to take a nice trip down memory lane and came out loving the show just as much maybe even better than when I was a kid.I love this show and it is definitely one of my favorite T.V.

I still like the series from the 1960s but the 1990s just made it the way batman was suppose to be.

Batman is my all-time favorite superhero and I think that they did a great job with this series. Batman, Nightwing, Robin, and Batgirl are awesome and so are the super villains especially Batman's arch nemesis Joker. The action and animation are very well done.

1270,Batman: The Animated Series, awesome TV series,"I first watched this when i was about 5 or 6 years old and it was one of my favorite TV shows on the air. The reason why i liked it so much was because the story line was really awesome maybe a few times the story line wasn't as good in some of the episodes but that only happened in only one or two episodes but even those were really good so you can how good this TV show is. Other reasons are the villains are really good such as the joker, Two-face, catwoman, Mr. freeze, etc. all of them are good. Also it has lots of action the voice over actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as Batman, Mark Hamill as the Joker, Ron perlman as clayface, etc. So I am sure you will not be disappointed with batman the animated series because it is really good.

1271,Batman: The Animated Series, The second-greatest cartoon ever (no prizes for guessing what's number one).,"Following the massive success of Tim Burton's ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns,"" Warner Bros brought the ethos thus brought to Gotham City's defender to the small screen, and in the process ensured that the true owner of the title ""Best Batman Ever"" would belong not to Michael Keaton, George Clooney, Val Kilmer or even Adam West, but to Kevin Conroy - he voiced both Batman and Bruce Wayne, and his convincing depiction of both sides of the man (Bruce speaks with a higher, more laid back tone than his alter ego) is only the tip of this show's iceberg.<br/><br/>You knew this was a class act from the opening - Batman thwarting a pair of robbers and leaving them for the police, in a main title all the more effective for never showing the title of the programme (but then, it didn't need to - when we saw him lit up by lightning at the end we got all the ID we needed). Written with care by the likes of Paul Dini, Randy Rogel (whose ""Robin's Reckoning"" - a two-part story, and a deserved Emmy winner for Part 1 - beats ""Batman Forever"" hands down in its handling of Dick Grayson's life), Michael Reaves and Marv Wolfman, the episodes may have been in children's slots - although the Fox Network did air some episodes at night initially - but they never treated their subject matter lightly; unlike other attempts before and (ouch) after, Batman, Alfred and the rest actually had dimension, the villains were truly menacing, and they even pulled off the feat of making Robin worth the while. It also wasn't afraid to actually kill people - unusually for Western cartoons - as demonstrated in the episode where Clayface met his end in a rainstorm.<br/><br/>The makers also brought back Danny Elfman's superb Bat-theme from the Burton movies, but only used it over the main titles and end credits - Shirley Walker and her team of composers never used it in their scores (and can I just say that it's a disgrace that Rhino's issued two albums of music from ""Batman Beyond"" - I refuse to call the show by its idiotic international title - and nothing from the original show?), with Walker's own Bat-theme taking pole position for the movie ""Batman: Mask of the Phantasm"" (which she scored) and on the TV show from the third season onwards... though on some prints of the later episodes Elfman's end theme has been put on instead. Much as I admire the great man, Walker's music is nothing to be ashamed of (case in point her excellent theme for ""Superman""), so I object to that.<br/><br/>The series set new standards for superhero cartoons (yes, I know the Dark Knight doesn't really have superpowers) that, to their credit, Warner Bros has been trying to live up to ever since - but good as ""Justice League"" is, ""Batman: The Animated Series"" is the real deal. The later video movies are also a must (I refuse to sit through ""Batman &amp; Robin,"" in part because I doubt it'll beat ""Batman and Mr. Freeze: Subzero""). If you really think the cartoons from the couple of decades before this series arrived were better, that's your loss; only one animated series in history tops this. (It's ""The Simpsons,"" obviously. What, you thought it was ""The Flintstones""?)",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,,5 March 2003

The voice-acting talent ranged from the dark and brooding Kevin Conroy as Batman, to the exciting, energetic Mark Hamil as Joker, to the cold monotone of Michael Ansara as Mr. Freeze.

1274,The Andy Griffith Show, The Life and Times of Sheriff Andy Taylor,"THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW (CBS, 1960-1968) is not only Andy Griffith's first TV show, but his best. Griffith, who made his mark on Broadway, TV and screen adaptation of NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS, might have turned that into a weekly comedy series. Instead, Griffith was offered an original premise about the life and times of a southern sheriff in Mayberry. With the show's opening shows off a father and his young son walking towards the pond with fishing poles carried over their shoulders to whistling score, ""The Fishing Hole,"" it's become one of those rare cases where a series, lasting eight successful seasons, to resume that same basic introduction. There were some minor changes over the years where it converted from black and white to color, and the growth of the sheriff's young son. During its eight seasons, this wholesome sit-com not only centered upon Sheriff Andy Taylor (Andy Griffith), but on the citizens of Mayberry, North Carolina. Naturally a series with such a lengthy run would go through some dramatic or necessary changes, such as the loss of certain characters, (Deputy Barney Fife), and addition of others (Goober Pyle, Howard Sprague), having one basic show with two different formats.<br/><br/>Andy Taylor is described as an easy-going, sometimes laid back sheriff seldom in complete uniform, unlike his bumbling deputy, Barney Fife, who not only dresses accordingly, ranging from tie, hat and a gun in his holster containing one bullet.going strictly by the book of the law. Together Andy and Barney team up for some humorous police work with Andy playing the straight man, and Barney providing his quota of laughs. At times, Barney becomes the bumbling fool in the eyes of the people. It is up to Andy to prove them wrong by helping Barney restore his confidence usually by giving Barney the credit actually due to the sheriff himself. Aside from their professions in keeping law and order in Mayberry, certain episodes would set focus on their personal lives, particularly on Andy, a widower/ father to his young son named Opie (Ronny Howard), cared for at home by his matron Aunt Bee (Frances Bavier). The first season to THE GRIFFITH SHOW did find Andy romantically involved with Ellie Walker (Elinor Donahue), the lady druggist. Seasons two and three found Andy sporadically having new love interests. By the time he acquired one in Helen Crump (Aneta Corsaut), Opie's school teacher, Andy lost his strong Southern accent for more natural tone. As for Barney, he's a carefree bachelor with his heart set on Thelma Lou (Betty Lynn). Unlike Andy (who would make Helen his bride in the premiere spin off series of MAYBERRY RFD in 1968), Barney would never marry.<br/><br/>After five seasons of black and white episodes, the remaining three seasons converted to color. Aside from that change, the Barney Fife character was gone, but not forever, making occasional returns once or twice a year for old times' sake. During Barney's absence, Andy acquired a substitute deputy, Warren (Jack Burns), written out of the show after 12 episodes, leaving Andy to sheriff about town alone and deputy position permanently vacant. With passage in time, Andy's police work would become less frequent, having ts main focus more on Andy's home-life and citizens of Mayberry. Otis (Hal Smith), the town drunk, would eventually be phased out.<br/><br/>While normally programs such as this losing a key supporting character such as Don Knotts would suffer in the ratings, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW continued to prosper for the next three years, becoming the number one show by the time Griffith gave up his badge by the end of the eighth season (1968). By then, the show acquired additional characters to the lineup: Goober Pyle (George Lindsay), Howard Sprague (Jack Dodson) and handyman, Emmett Clark (Paul Hartman), who replaced by Floyd, the Barber (Howard McNear), upon his death during the 1967-68 season; Clara Jackson, later Edwards (Hope Summers), Bee's closest friend; all new characters part of the Mayberry family.<br/><br/>What has become the secret to the success of THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW? Was it the father and son relationship between Andy and Opie, (who affectionately calls addresses him as ""Paw."")? The chemistry between best friends Andy and Barney? Or the now familiar faces and classic characters who took part as citizens of Mayberry that made the show special? One thing for sure, there's nothing dated about THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW. It could be set anywhere at anytime, since it hardly dealt with issues or political issues of the day. <br/><br/>During its initial years, THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW played funny without becoming too silly, except in some cases with the wild and crazy Ernest T. Bass (Howard Morris). The final years dealt more on serious issues without getting overly sentimental, though some early ones, ""Opie the Birdman"" (1962) and ""Aunt Bee's Romance"" (1964) went strictly on the dramatic side. The final three seasons moved towards a more wholesome, down to earth setting, even modernizing Aunt Bee from homemaker to independent woman acquiring both a driver's and pilot's license, and the teenage Opie having new friends (Johnny Paul and then Arnold), interests in girls and becoming part a rock and roll band. <br/><br/>While the Andy Taylor character had been originally introduced in an episode of MAKE ROOM FOR DADDY (1959) starring Danny Thomas, characters introduced on THE GRIFFITH SHOW spawned spin-offs as well: Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors), for GOMER PYLE, USMC, and Sam Jones (Ken Berry) for MAYBERRY, RFD.<br/><br/>After THE ANDY GRIFFITH SHOW ended its run in 1968, it has never gone from view. Many of its 249 episodes in reruns have become favorites, even classics, especially those involving Barney Fife. These and other shows can still be seen and appreciate in its seasonal package on DVD or countless other cable TV channels. (****)",64 out of 67 found this helpful.,9.0,9 January 2004

1276,The Andy Griffith Show," One of the most heartwarming sitcoms of all time. Commemorating ""Andy"" on it's 55th anniversary","In celebration of the show's anniversary this was one of the most endearing sitcoms in television history for the eight seasons that it ran on CBS. The basis came from an episode of ""Make Room For Daddy"",aka ""The Danny Thomas Show"" titled ""Danny In Mayberry""(Season 7,Episode 20) that originally aired on February 15, 1960. On the strength of that episode which was a bonafide hit the producers Sheldon Leonard along with Danny Thomas and Ronald Jacobs(who served as executive producers)gave the greenlight for this series which was placed on CBS' Monday night prime-time schedule producing a total of 249 episodes that ran from October 3, 1960 until the final episode of the series on April 1, 1968. Out of the 249 episodes,only 159(Seasons 1 thru 5)were in black and white from October 3, 1960 until May 3, 1965. Seasons 6 thru 8 produced 90 episodes in color from September 13, 1965 until April 1, 1968. Only Danny Thomas, Sheldon Leonard, Ronald Jacobs and Aaron Ruben were the producers from Seasons 1 thru 5. Bob Ross was the producer for Seasons 6 thru 8. The show launched two spin-offs ""Gomer Pyle,USMC"" (1964-1969),and ""Mayberry RFD""(1968-1971). Throughout its eight-year run the show won six Emmys and was nominated for 8 Emmys including Best Comedy Series. Between 1961,1962,1963,1966 and 1967 actor Don Knotts won back-to-back Emmys for Outstanding Performance in a Supported Role for Prime-Time as Deputy Barney Fife for the episodes ""The Return of Barney Fife""(Season 6, Episode 17-airdate January 10, 1966),and for the episode ""Barney Comes To Mayberry""(Season 7, Episode 19-airdate January 23, 1967). Actress Frances Bavier(Aunt Bee) won the Emmy in 1966 for Best Supporting Actress for Outstanding Role in a Prime Time Series. The show's sponsors throughout it's run were The General Foods Corporation and the Ford Motor Company. The Chrysler Corporation sponsored its final season.<br/><br/>The Andy Griffith Show was just that: the sheriff with a heart of gold and a big smile to match along bringing the moral values and lessons that you see in today's shows of this magnitude or any other,and it still holds up to this day. What really made that show what it is brings up to the great writing and storytelling,combining that with good ole North Carolina humor along with country comedy and add just a touch of Southern Gothic for a good measure. What really made that show hum like a fine motor for the first five seasons was the feisty spit and polish and by the book lawman deputy Barney Fife played with great precision and timing by Don Knotts who won five emmys for his work on that series. What really brought that show out was the father and son relationship of Sheriff Taylor and his son Opie(played by Ron Howard). Andy taught Opie valuable lessons on character and important values and morals as well as development of him from a boy into manhood. The characters that really brought that show out were certain individuals the gave Sheriff Taylor major fits(and Barney as well)like Goober,his cousin Gomer,and the nuttiest of them all: Ernest T. Bass,as well as Otis the town drunkard. After Knotts left the show to pursue other interests in 1965,the show wasn't the same as it was,but it never gave up on interest on the situations that went on in Mayberry. The black and white episodes were simply the greatest ever with Knotts in them,but kinda changed course when the show went to color. One of my all time best ever. Interesting Note on Andy Griffith: When the show left the airwaves on April 1, 1968 on the CBS network,it was the #1 show on television. *Commentary revised on December 10, 2015 in collaboration with the show's golden anniversary.",26 out of 27 found this helpful.,9.0,18 June 2000

It represented the ideal small town full of not only ordinary citizens but the crazies that inhabited it as well, especially characters like Ernest T. Bass and the Darlings.  The thing that really made this show great was the relationship between the ever cool Sheriff Andy Taylor and the hyperactive Barney Fife.  It was Barney as well as the characters of Aunt Bea, Floyd, Otis, Gomer, Goober and, later, Howard and Emmitt that made this show the classic that it was.  Also, in later years this show was criticized for not having any black characters on it. If you think about it, this show was merely a reflection of the times that the show took place in, the early to mid 1960's.

Sure, it's in black and white and sure it's not going to be appreciated by all but the fact of the matter is, this is something everyone can enjoy. This is a show without drug references, without non-stop violence and it's not that I'm against any of that in films today but I believe and it kind of does make sense, that if it can appeal to a wider audience, than chances are it's going to be good to a larger audience. This is a very enjoyable show and even though it's in black and white, it's still enjoyed by myself and many others. Like I said, with what's coming out on TV today, this is easily gem in television.

1280,The Andy Griffith Show," The ""Citizen Kane"" of Television Shows","""The Andy Griffith Show"" is probably the greatest sitcom of all time.  The writing, the direction, the characters, and the stories all combined to make one of the greatest television shows of any era.  Andy Taylor (Griffith) is the sheriff of a small, fictional North Carolina town named Mayberry.  He has all sorts of adventures that are so realistic and pure that one feels that they are really in Mayberry when watching the show.  Andy lives with his Aunt Bea (Frances Bavier) and his young son Opie (Ron Howard) and works with his deputy sheriff Barney Fife (Don Knotts).  The thing that sets ""The Andy Griffith Show"" apart from almost all other television shows is the realism of the characters.  Even though the characters are silly at times, often you can relate these people to actual people that you know or have known.  The amazing insight by the writers is truly uncanny.  The number of characters that are well-developed is also amazing when one considers how poor writing for television shows usually is these days.  The show started out a bit silly in the beginning, but hit a peak from seasons two to five when characters like Gomer Pyle (Jim Nabors), Otis Campbell (Hal Smith), Floyd Lawson (Howard McNear), and Goober Beasley (George Lindsey) became more prevalent in the series' plot.  However, after the departure of Don Knotts in 1965, the series went from being exceptional to being fair at best the rest of the way.  The magic that Knotts brought to the show was even more evident when he was gone.  Also Nabors left to create his own series and McNear suffered from health problems throughout the entire run of the series.  Smith and Betty Lynn (Thelma Lou) also had very little to do with the series after Knotts left.  All in all a great series for about five years, but the show's magic slowly disappeared when the series went to color.  5 stars out of 5 for 1960-1965.  2.5 stars out of 5 for 1965-1968.",57 out of 67 found this helpful.,,23 July 2000
1281,The Andy Griffith Show, Some things are better in black and white,"The black and white episodes of this program were the best, and I don't know what it was, but when it went to color, all the ""magic"" the show possessed disappeared!! I can tolerate the color episodes, but I HATED Jack Burns's character of Warren. That ""Huh?, Yeah, Huh?"" routine was a royal pain in the neck.<br/><br/>And what happened to Andy in the color episodes?? He turned into a man who was always griping about something--cranky and mean. It seemed that no matter what Aunt Bee wanted to do, Andy was there to put a stop to it, or at least, he tried to. Remember the time when Aunt Bee wanted to learn how to drive a car? Wanted to learn how to fly a plane? When she wanted to wear a wig? When she wanted to open a restaurant? Andy Taylor was a very hateful character in the color episodes. They should have stopped production of the show when they changed to color.",22 out of 24 found this helpful.,,13 November 2001
1282,The Andy Griffith Show, Great TV,"""The Andy Griffith Show"", in my opinion, will always be in the top 10 of my favorite shows, and I've watched the reruns numerous times since the first episode in 1960.  I'm sure Danny Thomas has received many accolades for creating this timeless classic.  My only criticism is that it stayed on the air three years too long.  When Don Knotts exited, that's where it should have ended.  The support characters of Goober, Howard and Emmitt never captured the comic timing or spirit of the original cast, and the storylines were bland.  I especially detested Jack Burns' character Warren.  He was very annoying.  The last three years just weren't funny or even compelling enough to bother watching.  Even Andy became more cranky and less down-home. He even lost his southern accent and laid-back ways.",31 out of 35 found this helpful.,,21 July 2004
1283,The Andy Griffith Show, One of the best TV shows ever!,"I love this show sooo much! I can't even put it into words just how great this show is. It's a classic that will be cherished for years to come. It's a shame that shows like this are rare to find on television in this day and age. It's way better than the junk we have on television today. The Andy Griffith Show is a program that can be enjoyed by all and it is generally a good, wholesome program. Andy, Barney, and Gomer were the best characters and the funniest. If you've never seen this show, than I strongly advise you see it sometime in the near future, you won't regret it. Not only will this show make you laugh, but it will give good lessons about life and the various hardships of it.",9 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,21 June 2010
1284,The Andy Griffith Show, Andy Griffith is America's Giovanni Guareschi,"The Andy Griffith show is one of the best television programmes I have seen. It presents a very gentle, humorous look on small-town America, that hasn't been equalled.<br/><br/>The earlier episodes are better than the later ones. I suppose the transition point is when they went from being in black-and-white to colour. Unlike Guareschi's books, the good sheriff does not have a Peppone to ply his wits against, though Barney Fife comes pretty close sometimes, albeit unwittingly.<br/><br/>The episodes are done with great sensitivity and betray a great acumen in human character. It is unfortunate that such programming is no longer produced in America---it cannot be because of a lack of talent.<br/><br/>The Andy Griffith show demonstrates that human nature is essentially the same. Not only is Mayberry amazingly similar to Don Camillo's village, but people have the same kind of obsessions, desires and fears everywhere. This is truly an American classic, and one wishes that it were better known to foreign audiences.",48 out of 60 found this helpful.,,23 March 2005

Even if you come in during the middle of the program, it's still easy enough to follow along!  This is one of my all-time favs.",8 out of 8 found this helpful.,,11 September 2001
1286,The Andy Griffith Show, Why don't they release more of the B&amp;W; Episodes on DVD?,"I recently purchased the double DVD of ""Andy of Mayberry"" at MediaPlay and my spouse and I had a good laugh looking at all of them.  We also saw the Andy Griffith Reunion Show on TV a few weeks ago.  I've always had a tremendous fondness for this series, and such a crush on Andy when I was a girl.  The series was ahead of itself in its day in concept and psychology; I don't think any of the other series at or around the time (""Bewitched,"" ""I Dream of Genie,"" ""Father Knows Best,"" ""Leave it to Beaver"" or ""I Love Lucy"") had quite the same combination of warmth and realism that this show had, despite its zaniness.<br/><br/>At present, there are two versions of the double DVD that you get at media stores, both with all the same episodes: ""High Noon at Mayberry"" (one of the funniest!), ""The Big House"" (""Here at the ROCK...""), ""Andy Discovers America"" (one of my faves because Griffith gives a tour de force performance in his story about Paul Revere to the rapt school boys and the credulous Barney.  This episode also introduces Helen Crump, the exacting school teacher).  ""Barney's New Car"" (terrific!  Knott's at his funniest!).  Then there is ""Class Reunion,"" which in my opinion has one of the sexiest and most romantic--because restrained and shy--kisses in all of film history besides ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  Poor Sharon and Andy, drawn to one another and drawn away from one another because of professional differences and attitudes about fulfillment.  ""I like ""A Wife for Andy"" because of the hilarious demonstration of reverse psychology: Barney gets Andy interested in Helen precisely because she is ""all wrong for him"": a modern career woman who can't cook:  ""This dame's not for Andy.  Let's get this dinner over with.""  I could do without ""Here Come the Darlin's"" (Charlene annoyed me), as much as I admire the Dillards and their fine Blue Grass music.  And why oh why do they have ""Dogs Dogs Dogs"" and not ""Opie the Birdman""?   I'd also like to see the episode where Gomer runs around after Barney: ""Citizen's Arrayest!  Citizen's Arrayest!""  And the one where Aunt Bee is eager for Andy to buy her a little cape she sees in one of the department store windows, but he doesn't take the hint and gets her pickling jars instead. Then the rotten mayor (I think), knowing Aunt Bee wants the cape, buys it himself and Andy has to negotiate with him.  In short, I want more of the B&amp;W episodes on DVD, but they seem to have stopped at sixteen.<br/><br/>
On TVL presently, it seems to be mostly the color-episodes.  I've read every comment on this board before offering my own, and y'all are right: WHAT HAPPENED TO ANDY?  It's as though when Don Knotts left the show, all the ""twinkle"" went out of Sheriff  Taylor.  Maybe it's because the rapport built up between the two, where Andy would tease and Barney would get ""sensitive,"" wasn't there any more, but like many of you said, Andy turns into a curmudgeon, a nag, constantly annoyed, inflexible in his handling of Opie, unresourceful, and lacking in that incandescent joy that was his hallmark early on--as though he has fallen into a depression.  What made the series for me in its early years (besides the incredible comic talent of Knotts!) was the steady and happy presence of this sheriff who acted as a catalyst for settling chaos, whose patience, intelligence, sense of humor, keen observation, and basic love of life--that electrifying grin!--was a stabilizing presence on the show.  Look at how he dealt with Opie's request to run away in the first episode!  When they made the color episode about ""Daisy,"" and Andy's so ticked off about Opie bringing the sick horse home, had the writers forgotten what he taught Opie about respecting animals in ""Birdman?""  In the color episode where Opie wants to take piano lessons and play football but the activities conflict, why did it take the coach to teach Andy, whose IQ seems to have declined, that an athlete can also be a pianist: just reschedule Opie's practice time!  Had the writers forgotten that Andy Taylor the Sheriff (along with Andy Griffith the actor) is also a keen musician?  Look at him playing Blue Grass with the Dillards.  Or accompanying Rafe Hollister.<br/><br/>In short, I'd like to have access to more of the black and white episodes on DVD.   Is that a possibility, O Beings In Charge?<br/><br/>Post Script:  What is ""Opie"" short for?  Is it Obadiah, or is it the initials O. P.?  Do we ever find out? :)",18 out of 21 found this helpful.,,7 December 2003
1287,The Andy Griffith Show, Best Known Rural Show of All-Time,"I remember The Andy Griffith Show well from its days as a Monday night staple on CBS to long-running reruns since the network first reran the show in daytime under the title Andy of Mayberry. To me, it was a very down home piece of life in a small southern town that is definitely the best known rural show of all-time.<br/><br/>Griffith's folksy appeal was one key to the show's success. But the main reason the show became a hit was Don Knotts portrayal of deputy Barney Fife. His hyper tense mannerisms and comedic timing have made the character one of the funniest in sitcom history. When he left the show after five years, I felt the show jumped the shark. His replacement, Jack Burns wasn't as good as Knotts and he had a much shorter run.<br/><br/>The show was also the spring board to Ron Howard's career. he started at age six as Opie and grew into his teens when Griffith quit the show in 1968. Also, there was Frances Bavier as Aunt Bee, best known for her cooking. The show also became the launching pad for Jim Nabors' career. After a season as Gomer Pyle, he got his own show, Gomer Pyle, USMC.<br/><br/>The Andy Griffith Show is a true cult classic and a show that will never leave reruns on cable or local channels. From the whistled theme song to the closing credits, viewers can get a slice of small town life via Mayberry each day.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,15 October 2012
1288,The Andy Griffith Show, The Old Fishing Hole,"The Andy Griffith Show aired back when television shows had moral fiber. Every episode had a lesson to be learned, with a good combination of humor and seriousness. The characters were likable and funny. They all had a purpose. The pairing of Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife is absolutely hilarious. And Goomer and Goober Pyle mad the show even more comical. But it had its serious points. They could obviously not air a show like this nowadays because people nowadays don't really care about moral fiber. All they want to see are the stupid and mediocre programs to day.<br/><br/>The black-and-white seasons are better than the Technicolor ones. Mostly the black and white one have Barney Fife. The show wasn't the same without him. Aunt Bee ads a moral standard to the show also. And Opie is the typical American baby-boomer generation kid. The show is great. It is as American as Aplee Pie.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,30 June 2010
1289,The Andy Griffith Show, Why this television show is loved by so many people.,"The Andy Griffith Show is considered by so many to be one of the finest examples of classic American television for many reasons, but there are basically three and one of them stands out again and again. That one reason is love. Human beings devote the majority of their time, effort, literature, conversation, thought, actions, intentions, in short, their lives to it with a few moments, in the grand scheme of things, spent in other endeavors. The town of Mayberry is the place where ideally, emotionally anyway, we would all like to live and the reason is that all of these people cared deeply for one another. They were willing to put aside all of the everyday concerns, personal comforts, monetary, personal or professional advancements to be of benefit to the others because they knew, without a doubt, that the others would do the same for them, if necessary. They all chose to really live by the Golden Rule and because they did, they were all the better off for it. It was the kind of devotion that we all constantly search for from others in our real lives. Not that there wasn't conflict for without it, as any good writer will tell you, there is no story and without a story, there is nothing to hold an audiences interest. Which brings us to the second ingredient in the success of the series. Writing. The comedy and drama which held our interest came from characters which had depth and substance, not just a bunch of shallow characters spouting bad jokes and one-liners at each other. All of these situations in which the good people of Mayberry found themselves were ones in which we have intimate knowledge. Falling asleep in church, being in too much of a hurry to stop and smell the roses, being put upon by outsiders which we were too polite to reprimand, trying to save face by bluffing our way through situations in which we were ignorant of the facts, putting up with well intentioned drunks, trying to provide a good example to children when we were really inclined to go with our baser instincts, being caught in situations which made us look guilty as sin when really, we weren't. We have all been there and that's why we find it so funny or sympathetic to see others in the same situation. Which brings us to the third ingredient in the success of the series. A talented cast. If a show is lucky, it may get by on one of these ingredients. If it is very lucky, it will have two. The Andy Griffith Show was fortunate in the extreme. It had the best comedy writers in town and they knew how to write portraying the Golden Rule and showing the characters always trying (though not always succeeding!) to do the right thing and the entire cast were all perfect for the characters which they portrayed. The show was never out of the top ten during it's entire eight year run and was number one in the ratings when it ended and was spun off into Mayberry R.F.D. There is a reason for this and anyone watching the entire series will see why for themselves. No one will have to explain it to them and that in itself is reason enough to call it great.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,,18 March 2006
1290,The Andy Griffith Show, 12/60 Christmas episode; great performance by Will Wright,"My favorite Andy Griffith show episode is the Christmas show when mean old Ben Weaver tries to get himself arrested.  (Enter ""Will Wright"" in the database search box and note #6 under Notable TV guest appearances)  On Christmas Eve, Ben Weaver (a legitimate liquor dealer) insists that Andy arrest a farmer for making some illegal moonshine to celebrate Christmas with.  Andy brings the farmer's wife and two kids to the jail and, with Barnie, Opie, Aunt Bea, and Ellie, the whole lot of them celebrate Christmas right there in the jail.  Ben becomes aware of this; feels left out; and tries to get himself arrested so he can join in the festivities.  Thanks to some brilliant acting by Will Wright you start off intensely disliking Ben Weaver and end up feeling genuinely sorry for him.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,,5 September 2000
1291,The Andy Griffith Show, Mayberry USA is a wonderful place to visit,"Despite the small town setting, this show covered many situations that one would find anywhere.  I've seen all 249 episodes- and watched as Andy always knew how to get the best out of people.  He'd keep Barney from being the laughingstock  of the town- he gave wise advice to his son and was not above admitting when he was wrong- like the time he was upset with Opie for not giving more to charity- then finding out that Opie was saving his money to buy a girl a coat.  Everything about this series appeals to me- from the show when Bill Bixby went from being a spoiled city brat to taking responsibility  for his accident. Though Griffith was labeled as the star- Don Knotts added so much with his idiosyncracies. Ron Howard added to it to- being both a good son and standing up for himself- speaking his mind when he thought he was right- like the time he knew that there was a Mr. Beavy- a man who could climb trees and he jingled. Aunt Bea also gave warmth and wit to the show.Though she started as little more than a housekeeper- she soon blossomed and got a driver's license and started a business. Its easy to see why this show is still in syndication- the Darlings- with their songs and ways added to many episodes and even Goober and Gomer had something unique to offer -- and the fun girls- Skippy and Daphne always make me laugh. From Floyd the barber to the moonshining sisters and some of the best ""criminals""- this show is one of the best that television has to offer.",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,,29 December 1999
1292,The Andy Griffith Show, Aunt Bea birthplace,"When news of Don Knotts death at the age of 81 was released today, it was revealed that he was a Morgantown West Virginia native and had in fact had to cancel a public appearance there due to ""medical conditions"" that were not made public. In the course of the show Aunt Bea was said to come from Morgantown West Virginia, which I found interesting indeed. Having been to Morgantown myself, I found it an otherwise unremarkable burg plunked down in the gorgeous foothills of the Appalachian mountains, and stayed nearby at a beautiful bed n breakfast in Glengary overlooking the Shenadoah valley. I could see how he would like to have the area memorialized, it doesn't have the timeless quality of Mt Airy (where you can visit Andy Griffiths childhood home and go eat at Floyds Barber shop restaurant!) but it is a pretty area.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,,25 February 2006
1293,The Andy Griffith Show, Andy Griffith Show's Impact on my Son,"I watch the show everyday, and occasionally my family joins me. I hadn't realized that my ten year old son paid any attention to the show until he found out during a PTA conference that he would be attending Mayberry Middle School in Wichita, Kansas. He rolled his eyes and said, ""Oh great! I'm going to be in black-and-white!"" I was the first to laugh, and had to explain it to his teacher and principal. <br/><br/>I wish more people would watch this show. It shows how single fatherhood can be a positive thing. Of course, he did have Aunt Bea to help keep the house clean and cook the meals. None of my own relatives would be willing to move in to help out and NOT try to take over, or tell me how to raise my children! <br/><br/>This show also shows us the life of a town/city official and how this effects family life. Opie deals with a lot of pressure of trying to set a good example because it would look bad if the sheriffs's son was a spoiled brat that could get away with anything. A good example of this is an episode that has a young man whose father is either rich or a government official (I can't remember) and he's arrested for speeding. When he is at Andy's house, he witnesses Andy telling Opie that he has to pay for a neighbor's window he broke out of his allowance. The young man asks Andy why he didn't just give Opie a break and pay for it himself. Andy explains that if he did, Opie would never learn that he had done something wrong.

It had the warmest most realistic characters and the best writing ever. This show created the best characters out of Andy, Barney, Opie, Aunt Bee, Otis, Floyd, Ellie, Helen and Thelma Lou. Unfortunately, it had just as many clunkers with the extremely irritating and illogical Gomer, Goober, Warren, Howard and Emmett. The best thing about the show was the camaraderie of Andy Griffith and Don Knotts; despite their fights and teasing, you knew they cared about each other. It was this kind of compassion that made everyone connect with the series. Knotts' departure from it was the removal of all the heart as during the rest of the show's run Andy went around irritated all the time. It's these color episodes that are the only thing wrong with the otherwise impeccable show. If Bewitched can be divided into two different series, one black and white, one in color, then the same ought to be done for Andy, and spare the lovers of the series from having to see the worst.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,,20 July 2001

Barney Fife is one of TV's most memorable characters and some of his bits are hilarious no matter how many times you see them:  ""Welcome to Checkpoint Chickie!"", Barney's agonizing attempt to recite the Preamble of the US Constitution from memory, Barney showing Ernest T. Bass how to enter a room and greet people at a party.<br/><br/>I defy anyone not to get choked up when watching ""Opie the Birdman"", first when Andy punishes Opie by making him listen to the cheeping baby birds whose mother Opie has killed, and then when Opie releases the now-grown sparrows.<br/><br/>The quintessential episode is ""Man in a Hurry"" where Charlotte businessman Malcolm Tucker finds himself stranded in Mayberry on a Sunday when it is totally impossible to get any work done.  Tucker rails against Mayberry's snail pace but by the end of the episode, succumbs to it.  It was the episode that introduced Gomer Pyle by the way.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,,15 July 2001

Great MORAL listen, and I wish the world could be like Mayberry! Kids could leave in the morning to play and not come back til dark, and the parents not know where they are, but they knew that they were OK! Everybody knows everybody! and it never hurts to be a comedy! This is the funniest show ever! The wits of Andy and the clumsiness of Barney make the whole show! I recommend this show!

1299,Dallas," ""Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer!"" (J.R Ewing)","Dallas has to be one of the greatest ever TV shows, because it had all of the attributes for entertainment. It had great characters, good writers and story lines that ranged from the ridiculous to the sublime. Oh how easy it was to run an an oil company! Watching Dallas was pure fantasy, it's simply what makes TV fun and relaxing, take out an hour from the real world and enjoy, for people who saw the show they know what I mean!<br/><br/>So there we were introduced to the Ewing's who were in a bitter feud with the Barnes. However it was the biggest mismatch since George Foreman pounded Joe Frazier into the canvas 6 times in two rounds in the 1973 heavyweight title fight. The Ewing's led by JR body-slammed Cliff Barnes around for the first two seasons. In reality it was not a fair contest, a multimillion dollar family with connections up against a small town lawyer were always going to come out on top! However, that was to change as the series progressed. Of course the show quickly centered on JR (played by Larry Hagman) and the writers created a character that people would really hate; he had no problem playing fast and lose with other peoples lives.<br/><br/>So what did JR do that upset so many people! Swindled and cheated the cartel on more than one occasion, blackmailed politician's and government officials into helping him with his crooked deals, had the police set people up on phony charges as he had much of Braddock and Dallas police dept in his payroll. However JR wasn't satisfied with just tormenting the powerful, his family were not spared either, he was instrumental in trying to break up both Bobby, Garry and his mothers marriage's on numerous occasions. Cheated on his wife so many times that he turned her into an alcoholic and had her committed to a sanitarium. Government regulations were also no obstacle to his ambitions. He defied a State department embargo and illegally sold oil to Cuba, instigated a military coup in some oil rich country in Asia and risked a middle east war by hiring mercenaries to blow up Saudi Arabian oil fields to jack up the price of oil, and finally had a run in with the CIA and the Justice Department.<br/><br/>It was not just Cliff Barnes he wreaked havoc on, other people were fair game too. He betrayed, conned and left many of his subordinates, business associates and former lovers twisting in the wind, either in jail, broke or on the run from the police. As a consequence of his meddling, reputations were ruined family relationships were left in tatters and ambitions shattered as he turned his back or double crossed some of his closest confidants. It doesn't get any better than this! Not surprisingly the phrase ""I'll get you JR if it's the last thing I'll do"" or ""you'll pay for this JR"" both became fairly regular clichés as they all vowed revenge! As I write this I can count at least 5 attempts on JR's life as they tried to get even. <br/><br/>Many would say that the golden years of Dallas were the 1978-82 seasons. That's probably true, all the characters were developed through those seasons and I think Dallas had it's highest ratings. However my personal favorites were the 1987-1990 (the last series was poor)! In 1986 with the series tottering on the edge, the writers took a chance and despite ridicule brought back the character Bobby by making the previous season all a dream. It was a risk but they resuscitated a series by binning the most boring and tired looking season in 1985/86 (and that's according to Larry Hagman too) as never happening and therefore having a fresh start to the series. <br/><br/>To start with not everything went JRs way he lost Ewing oil, Sue Ellen started to get her act together and fight back on equal terms, Pam left the series and Bobby became a more aggressive character without her. It was a brave attempt by the creators to revive the series and they certainly pulled it off, Dallas never would have lasted as long if they had not done it! They filmed in locations such as Austria, France , Russia and gave a higher profile to the skin crawling Jeremy Wendell head of Weststar and after his exit he was followed by the lager than life Carter Mackay, who kept up the pressure on JR and the Ewing's far more than the cartel.<br/><br/>Some of the story lines introduced scenarios from movies such as COOL HAND Luke when JR was sentenced to hard time on a chain gang , or ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST when JR in bizarre scheme bribed a judge to commit him into a puzzle house to find out information from Clayton's mentally ill sister. Even Bobby was not spared, on his trip to Paris his wife April was kidnapped very much a story similar to the 1987 movie FRANTIC. <br/><br/>With the proliferation of satellite and cable TV the major networks sensitive to their advertising revenue delved into trash TV and the half hour sitcoms which are cheap to make. Just over the horizon audience participation shows i.e. Opra, Rikki Lake and Springer and dopey half hour sit-come's were awaiting and if you were to fast forward looming ahead were the so called reality TV shows of the late 1990's.<br/><br/>Dallas was the first of the glam soaps and the second last to be canceled (1991). Was it all more entertaining than what's on today, well you be the judge!",46 out of 49 found this helpful.,,4 May 2006
1300,Dallas, The granddaddy of 'em all!,"When you think influential television shows, DALLAS should be near or at the top of your list. It is on mine! DALLAS was the first really great nighttime soap opera. In reality, it started the genre. There were later shows that followed and were even at times more popular (the spin off KNOTS LANDING, the stylish and classy DYNASTY, the forgotten stepchild FALCON CREST), but DALLAS was the first.<br/><br/>DALLAS is the tale of the rich, powerful oil family the Ewings, who reside in Braddock County, Texas, right outside of Big D. The patriarch is John Ross ""Jock"" Ewing, an old school oil baron who did it the hard way, wildcatting and working in the oil fields. The matriarch is Eleanor Southworth, ""Miss Ellie"" Ewing, the heart and soul of the family. The land that contains the Ewing's ranch and home is from her side of the family, but she and Jock own it jointly b/c Jock saved the family land when they were about to lose it back in the day. So at first, it was a marriage of convenience, but they quickly fell in love and had 3 sons: Gary, Bobby, and the eldest John Ross Ewing Jr., or as we all know him: JR! <br/><br/>For me, JR Ewing is one of the top 2 or 3 characters in all of TV history. Played by the great Larry Hagman, there has never been or ever will be another character like JR. Hagman imbibed JR with a no-nonsense, larger-than-life, unapologetic style that can never be copied. The best TV villain ever! Hagman had a great supporting cast that complimented him: Patrick Duffy (the saintly younger brother Bobby), Linda Gray (JR's alcoholic, self-destructive, but SEXY wife Sue Ellen), Victoria Principal (Bobby's wife Pamela Barnes Ewing, the daughter of Jock's old rival Digger Barnes), Ken Kercheval (Pam's brother and JR's biggest rival Cliff Barnes), Steve Kanaly (Jock's illegitimate son and ranch foreman Ray Krebbs), Susan Howard (Ray's wife and political activist Donna Culver Krebbs), Lucy Ewing (prodigal son Gary's daughter and a spitfire of a young lady) and the aforementioned legends Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie) and Jim Davis (Jock).<br/><br/>The style and set design, in addition to the great characters, of DALLAS is what really draws you in: the beautiful Dallas spots, the expansive Texas scenery, the restaurants, offices, etc. Also, the fashion is great: chic, classy for the females and cowboy boots and suits for the males! And of course, DALLAS had the ultimate cliffhanger: Who shot JR! Perhaps the most memorable cliffhanger (and maybe the real first one) in all of TV history. I remember it as a kid and it still resonates with me today. But let's face it: the greatness of DALLAS can be summed up with two letters: J and R!",11 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,11 July 2008

And keep it that way.<br/><br/>Liked it A lot when it was on screen here in Sweden during the years about 1981-1993(?). (Some 2-3 year delay from U.S prime time.) That was a usual standard for American TV shows for European watchers by then.... (National television was Russian style in Sweden too, you know.) Got curious when my mother got hooked on the Ewing/Barnes feud, myself being just seven years old at the time. (I naturally didn't get so much out of it then.)<br/><br/>What was meant by the creators of ""DALLAS"" to be a five act drama TV show with the troublesome marriage between Bobby Ewing and Pamela Barnes in center, grows to be the major series of the 80's. (The response from the viewers after some episodes were so good that the producers called for an extension.)<br/><br/>We were allowed to get into the flesh of a family, with sons and daughters always fought each other for power and wellness. Office suits mixed with rancher blue jeans. Oil business and kettle care in the same sweet melody.<br/><br/>When the DALLAS show was released over here on DVD in a ""two season per year-plan"" in the early 00's, It was time to take the trip all over again. During a six year period, I consistently dug deeply into it season by season during free time, and enjoyed it to the fullest.<br/><br/>The Southfork Ranch almost became my own living room.<br/><br/>Not A member of A fan base, I want to share my own profit of taking the trip from start to finish:<br/><br/>""The Jock Ewing Years"" are/were DALLAS at it's best. Jim Davis was the Brando of the Ewings, without doubt. The plot of the whole show was more centered and interesting while he was present. The screen writers re-grouped the three sons of an oil-mafia matriarch, surly in a ""godfather"" style. Late Larry Hagman (R.I.P) was the senior son J.R, the natural heir of the throne. Always thinking business, besides the hunger for women as a pleasure. Stone cold and calculating, he smashed every fly that came around him trying to steal his limelight. <br/><br/>2nd son Gary was placed beside in script, for several reasons. (Fans aware of ""Knots Landing"", uh?) <br/><br/>Baby brother Bobby eventually took the fight with his older brother for the captain's seat; after having his ""easy living""-years he rapidly learn the business, but a little too late to ever compete with his way too superior brother, who were always one step ahead.<br/><br/>(Actor Patrick Duffy once said that an early take with Larry Hagman, which included some physical acting, ending up with Hagman laughing at his opponent's bad acting, was a real boost to shape up, and never feel minor in acting skills to Larry in a scene ever again.) <br/><br/>Cowboy Ray Krebbs (Steve Kanaly), the janitor of SF ranch, grows highly during this long history of the Ewings. Starting as kind of a youth manservant to them, he turns out to be more family than anybody of the Ewings ever dreamed of. (My personal favorite down to earth personality figure during the whole saga.) Forced into a world he never wanted to be part of.<br/><br/>On the opposite side, One Cliff Barnes always moaning of his father's stolen piece in the Ewings wealth, him being a partner to Jock Ewing in their oil ""teen-years"". (But drank it away.) Cliff B builds his own castle, but keeps up having hard time to compete with old J.R Ewing as Texas Oil Baron no. 1. Some good strikes on the way for Clifford, from time to time, always gave the series some fresh air and a forward push. <br/><br/>The family drama went on for years and years. People comes and goes. Weddings, barbecue parties, and some good fist fights at the annual Oil Baron's Ball. Liquor for breakfast, coffee for lunch. Heavy fuel for hard people.<br/><br/>Halfway the series gets a little stalled, but the writers kept on finding new and sometimes cheer ways to keep the story going on. <br/><br/>Yes, there's alcoholic intoxicated wives on the way.<br/><br/>It's getting kind of silly around the ""dream-season"" alright. (A solution created because of the actors big egos $....)<br/><br/>But I kept on watching it after that anyway, didn't I?<br/><br/>And did I love the ride?<br/><br/>YES.

1303,Dallas, Once In A Lifetime,"Dallas is a once in a lifetime show and experience. From 1978 to 1991 the series ran on CBS. Larry Hagman was by far the standout actor. His portrayal of J.R. Ewing is without comparison. Hagman takes the role and chews it up. This series was so much better than any other prime time soap. Dynasty jumped the shark with its alien arc, Dallas never went that route. All of its plot lines were very feasible and probable. The death of Jim Davis (Jock Ewing) drove storyline for many, many more years. I am saddened at the recent death of Barbara Bel Geddes, (Miss Ellie). For anyone looking for a good, drama driven, emotion filled TV series this is the show for you. I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the DVD release of the remaining seasons. I have worn out Seasons 1 and 2, and just received Season 3. Once In A Lifetime and Classic. Enjoy!!",23 out of 27 found this helpful.,,14 August 2005

I don't care if he is too ill to play him but I can't imagine another J.R. Ewing. I remember watching Dallas on Friday nights after another southern show, Dukes of Hazzard. I always thought Dallas was great show always entertaining with a stellar cast besides Larry Hagman, Linda Gray, Victoria Principal, Barbara Bel Geddes, George Kennedy, Ken Kercheval, Patrick Duffy, Priscilla Presley, Charlene Tilton, etc. This was one show that was quite entertaining to watch on Friday nights.

1305,Dallas, The show that re-defined prime time soaps,"This show literally changed prime-time television for the better. The show centers around the lives, loves and scandals of the Ewings, a family of oil-rich barons who reside in-where else?-Dallas. When the<br/><br/>show started on CBS in the spring of 1978, the show centered around the ""Romeo &amp; Juliet"" love story of Bobby Ewing (Patrick Duffy) and Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), the daughter of the Ewings' arch enemy Digger Barnes. Story lines, and ratings. changed for the better when DALLAS refocused on the devilish dealings of Bobby's oldest brother John Ross ""JR"" Ewing, Jr. (Larry Hagman. DALLAS reached the peak of its' popularity when JR was shot in the spring of 1980. For years, the show would remain at the top of the ratings until it started getting competition first from ABC's ""Dynasty"" and then NBC's ""The Cosby Show"". DALLAS' ratings was never the same after 1986 when Pam dreamed the entire 1985-1986 season. The show ran until 1991, when low ratings virtually killed it. It also spun off the longest-running prime-time soap ever, KNOTS LANDING.",13 out of 16 found this helpful.,,17 November 2004
1306,Dallas, Sex! Oil! Family! Everything Television should be!!,"Dallas garners its own chapter in the history of television for several reasons.  In its heyday this show was very popular! (The Who Shot JR episode remains one of the most watched programs of all time.)  Dallas defined the 80's as the 'ME' generation, big hair and Republican values!  JR Ewing takes his place as one of fictions most notorious villains.  And the show itself conquered new territory.  It was trashy television ... with bite!<br/><br/>The story centers around the Ewing family.  Their lives center around oil and power (two things that mixed well in the 1980's).   Their nemisis is the family Barnes, bitter rivals continuously looking for their fair share of an empire that they claim they helped to build.<br/><br/>The series opens up as Bobby Ewing brings home his new wife Pamela, first daughter to the Barnes family.  The soap opera takes off and the sparks fly.<br/><br/>Over a 13 year run the show deals with all sorts of issues.  Alcoholism (Sue Ellen is fabulous when she is sloppy!), infidelity, (JR sleeps with just about anyone with a skirt), drugs, impotence, politics, down syndrome, sibling rivalry, neurofibromatosis, breast cancer, divorce, child custody, homosexuality and physical abuse.  And what's so great is that it deals with none of these topics well.<br/><br/>Dallas is not a show to be taken seriously, at least not on a cerebral level.  If you want serious drama, watch Hill Street Blues.  If you want something preachy, watch Facts of Life.  Dallas is best watched with brain waves turned down to their lowest level, with a grain of salt and with an ear for catty drama!<br/><br/>Best storyline:  Sue Ellen's drinking causes her to have the baby prematurely.  No one knows for sure who the baby's real father is (Cliff or JR) - but Pam had better find out soon as she has just learned that she and Cliff are carrying a gene that could kill any children they intend to have. Complicated?  Yes.  But you gotta love it!",13 out of 16 found this helpful.,,16 September 1999
1307,Dallas, Greatest TV soap ever by a long way,"Dallas was and still is a TV phenomenon. It took the model of the tired old American soap and turned it into something fresh, fascinating and compelling watched by millions of people around the world. It used for the first time the device of the cliffhanger at the end of the season to keep people coming back for more. Personally I believe the 1981-1984 central seasons were its high point with the titanic struggle between JR and Bobby for control of Ewing Oil plus other strong story lines.<br/><br/>What was the secret of its success and longevity? I believe this is down to 3 factors.<br/><br/>1. The story lines cleverly combined subjects that would appeal to a mass audience - love and sex, glamour, money and power, family problems, and controversial subjects for the time e.g. Sue Ellen's alcoholism that attracted interest and raised awareness.<br/><br/>2. Excellent writing with top notch scripts.<br/><br/>3. Superb acting from the key cast team. I have to single out Larry Hagman's performance as JR, I have never seen any performance to match it in any TV drama. He completely got under JR's skin and while he showed us what a monster the man was, he also made us aware of his redeeming features (particularly his strong sense of family) so that we never quite lost empathy for him. Patrick Duffy, Linda Gray and Ken Kercheval also gave remarkable performances as Bobby the 'good' brother who was never boring, Sue Ellen the wronged wife who eventually found a life of her own and Cliff, JR's neurotic, bungling rival who rarely managed to best him.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,21 January 2012
1308,Dallas, The Good the bad the ugly!,"I do not like Soap Operas and I liked Dallas. The Good: Character development was great. The mean, get it done boy father Jock Ewing gave a real old school Oilman feel. Jock was the only character to keep J R in line. Hagman's gave the J R character a slick, dirty, aggressive I the antagonist who plays the game better and harder then anyone else. Bobby J R 's brother was good, fair tough was J R's counter balance for the show. The mom, Ray, Lucy etc were side character which played minor roles and had side stories, which balance the script out. Sue Ellen and Cliff Barns were the punching bag characters for J R! J R stood out and was most of the show. The hat, wicked smile, laugh, and sarcasm made for a juicy script. J R would have an affair, underhand dealing with company, and fight a feud with Cliff and or Sue Ellen. sometimes both at a time. 
The bad: When Jock died J R's counter balanced died, and made the show too much about J R. After six years Dallas ran out of good ideas. Dallas became formulated. Who's having sex with who? What miss understanding/getting burnt deal is going happen now. After the who shot J R series Dallas slowly faded away. The ugly: When Bobby died and came back in the shower it was all a dream episode many people stopped watching Dallas. Cast was leaving and or being replaced with new actors for the same characters. Stories got more and more over the top. The final 3 years of the series became just ugly. Still a T V icon show. J R is a T V character icon. Even if the series went way too long, Dallas is the gold standard of T V soaps. High budget, and prime time. 7 or 8 out of 10 stars.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,7.0,25 April 2018

1310,Dallas, Good story,"When Dallas was aired for the first times in the 80s I was a child and I couldn't appreciate it yet. Since last September, when a satellite channel proposed again this Soap Opera, I had a small crush of it. I became fond of J.R.'s intrigues, his rivalry with Bobby and Cliff Barnes, the beautiful Pamela and nice Miss Ellie.<br/><br/>Dallas' strength is the plot. Not completely concerned about love and betrayals (typical but annoying), the Ewing Oil battles can move even the male audience transforming the Soap in a TV-series. Jim Davis' death (the mythical Jock, R.I.P.) put a lot of fuel in the ""engines"" with the legacy questions and relations getting worse. J.R.'s Machiavellian plans filled the script of amusing and caustic irony, always enjoyable.<br/><br/>The recitative level wasn't so great; all the actors, actually, had their height in this series, but the general quality is decent. Except for Ken Kercheval and Steve Kanaly, which proved to be good actors giving a great shape to their characters, challenging J.R. at any cost. Special mention to Charlene Tilton, which is really beautiful and should have had greater relief in the story. <br/><br/>Ending too late, in 1991 (2-3 years too many), the story was slowly plagued by script tricks and poorly credible deaths or departures, compromising its heritage made of several Emmys and 1 Golden Globe won.<br/><br/>6,5 / 10",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,6.0,10 January 2007
1311,Dallas, An Iconic show,"Dallas can be easily regarded as one of the greatest TV dramas of all time. Excellent plots and twists, acting, brilliant characters, cliffhangers and setting is what gives this show its iconic status. <br/><br/>Viewers are treated to the complications and exciting events that surround the dynamic Ewing family. From Ewing Oil to Southfork Ranch the drama and intensity never seems to stop. Dallas beautifully show us a traditional family structure largely influenced by the Patriarch (Jock) and Matriarch (Miss Ellie). But this is so ordinary or traditional family and every family can be said to have its black sheep. J.R. Ewing, played by Larry Hagman, steals the show with his incredible performance as the unscrupulous and scheming oil baron in Dallas. We are treated to a number of schemes and manipulations through the episodes as J.R aims to have his cake and eat it too. In 1980 J.R's schemes had gone too far which led to the biggest event in television history, Who Shot JR? The beauty of this cliffhanger was almost anyone in the show was a suspect, he was that evil. More people in America tuned in to watch who shot JR than vote in the Presidential election. This show also helped make the cliffhanger popular that kept audiences on the edge of their seats. Nowadays many shows use cliffhangers. While the quality of the show declined in its latter seasons the show will be remembered most for its twists and performances of earlier seasons (1-10). <br/><br/>Dallas is as entertaining and relevant as it was then as it is today. The combination of plots, twists, unique setting and great scheming by J.R makes this show timeless. His character and the show will forever occupy a special place in the TV sphere.

1312,Dallas," A groundbreaker, in so many ways","""Dallas"" created some HUGE TV moments ... J.R. Ewing's shooting, the ""Dream Season"" and Bobby returning in the shower ...<br/><br/>Beyond that, though, I especially loved the writing of ""Dallas,"" particularly in the working of J.R.'s various schemes, both at the Ewing Oil offices and offsite. He was just-plain the master manipulator, and while I don't encourage anyone to aspire to this kind of mastery(!), it sure was FUN to watch him in action! Yikes! The way he executed those deals seemed to set the show apart from rivals like ""Dynasty.""<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way the show evolved in the later seasons. In the last two seasons, in particular, there seemed to be this sophisticated edge that avoided insulting the viewer (as sometimes the campiness of ""Dynasty"" could). While ""Dynasty"" was busy being flashy (and hey, I liked that, too -- I was a teen when it originally aired, after all), ""Dallas"" was playing the game just a bit cooler, calmer, a touch more complicated.

Victoria Principal was terrific as Pam Barns Ewing known as Bobby Ewing wife, she was a good character that stood her ground. Jim Davis known as Jock Ewing J.R and Bobby's dad was a eager and strong hearted person, it was sad that he passed away before the 4th season.

1316,Dallas, Good Old JR,"It is amazing how one actor, Larry Hagman, alias JR Ewing, could so dominate a program that no matter who you put around him he'd still come out on top. That really is the story of this show. Every large family has it's black sheep. JR is the nightmare come true of them all.<br/><br/>By the time Hagman came to this show, he had plenty of acting experience. He had learned to be a straight man to Barbara Eden on I Dream of Jeannie. In a way, his deceptions of Doctor Bellows to explain the strange goings on around him &amp; Jeannie prepared him well for this role. JR is the ultimate deception character.<br/><br/>In a way if Hayden Rourke (Dr. Bellows) had been able to have done a couple of Dallas shows as JR's therapist, it would have made interesting fodder. I mean if innocent Tony Nelson could baffle Bellows, old JR could have confounded him with both hands tied behind his back.<br/><br/>The plots got me started with this show. Then the good looking women who were always waltzing through kept me interested. Finally old JR just kept me coming back for another &amp; another. <br/><br/>The highlight everyone remembers is JR being shot. That too me is one of many. When the DVD's get to the season where Bobby is killed in the accident, put the accident scene in slow motion &amp; keep a special eye on Victoria Principal (Pamela). If the scene is not touched up from it's original broadcast, you will see a little wardrobe malfunction which happened long before the Super Bowl &amp; gives you a much better look at Victoria briefly, than you could ever imagine.<br/><br/>With all the spice, all the intrigue, all the feuds, &amp; all the nasty old rich oil Barron's, this show always entertained.

1317,Dallas, Bring Dallas Back On Air,"Actually, I don't wish to see Dallas back on air. It was a superb series but I'd much rather remember it the way it was.<br/><br/>As everyone knows, the show revolved around the life of an oil-rich family which included the wicked J.R. Ewing, Gary Ewing and Bobby Ewing. J.R.'s wife was Sue Ellen who caused him no end of problems during the series.<br/><br/>The show was realistic to begin with. Well, it was realistic in a TV kind of way. It had some great stories at times including the classic 1980 storyline-Who Shot J.R.? This was a good period in the show's history. However, a short while  after that, things went downhill.<br/><br/>Everyone knows about the story where Bobby was killed but returned a season later and the viewers learnt that Bobby's wife Pamela had dream the past year's storylines. This was just a complete lack of credibility and it set a precedent for years to come both with American and British soaps. In Emmerdale in the late 90's, Kim Tate returned from the dead and no doubt a few more soap characters will return. If it happens and you feel cheated, blame Dallas.<br/><br/>However, we all kept watching it after this as the plots became more and more wacky. As for the final episode, it was just complete fantasy but interesting all the same.<br/><br/>All in all though, Dallas was a superb show. I felt cheated at the way Bobby returned from the dead but to be fair, Dallas gave us some entertaining moments and was the inspiration for future shows such as the even crazier Sunset Beach. Yes, Dallas was a good show and I think if they repeated the whole show on TV, I might just become glued to it again.",6 out of 10 found this helpful.,,13 December 2002

1319,Dallas, Who shot J.R.? Who cares?,"It was announced earlier this week that the U.S. soap opera 'Dallas' is to make a comeback. To me, its about as welcome a return as The Black Death or Adolf Hitler. I wasted much of the '80's hating not only the show itself, but the people who worked on it, and the B.B.C. for importing the flaming thing. It was the 'X Factor' of its day. You could not pick up a newspaper nor switch on the television without finding someone ( usually Nina Myskow ) gushing about how great it was. A 'Radio Times' letter writer called it: ""television's greatest achievement ever!"" ( what medication was he/she on? ). Yet I could not ( and still can't ) see its appeal. It was essentially 'Crossroads' with helicopter shots.<br/><br/>Created by David Jacobs ( not the former B.B.C. presenter ), it told of the trials and tribulations of the filthy rich Ewing family, who lived in Dallas ( hence the title ), Texas. The head of the clan was grizzled Jock Ewing ( Jim Davis ), but he had to be written out after a few seasons as the actor playing him died. He was married to simpering Miss Ellie ( Barbara Bel Geddes, then Donna Reed, then Barbara Bel Geddes again ), their sons were bad guy John Ross ( J.R. for short, played to the hilt by Larry Hagman, former co-star of the sitcom 'I Dream Of Jeannie' ), and good guy Bobby ( ex-'Man From Atlantis' Patrick Duffy ). Bobby's wife was lovely Pam ( Victoria Principal, the lady who took away Anthony 'Psycho' Perkins' virginity ). J.R. was a swine who loved two things in life - himself and money. He was married to the permanently emoting 'Sue Ellen' ( Linda Gray ), who had a drink problem, a quivering upper lip and a tendency to throw empty glasses at her husband each week after a row. The Ewing ranch - Southfork ( known in my house as 'Forkoff' ) - was augmented by juicy Lucy ( Charlene Tilton, who must have been last in the queue when they handed out necks ). Jock had an illegitimate son in the shape of cowboy Ray Krebbs ( Steve Kanaly ), adding to the existing family friction. J.R.'s main business rival was creepy Cliff Barnes ( Ken Kercheval ).<br/><br/>Promiscuity was rife, rather bizarre in an era where we were all being urged to be monogamous. 'Dallas' offered some startling insights into the high-powered world of big business. For instance, I learnt that the job of oil tycoon involves sitting behind a desk all day, puffing cigars, knocking back whisky, and trying to inject the word 'offshore' into everyday conversation as often as possible. In the immortal words of 'Yosser Hughes' ( Bernard Hill ) from 'Boys From The Blackstuff': ""Give us a job...I can do that!"". It might have been fun had it been played for laughs, sort of like the Susan Harris sitcom 'Soap', but everyone concerned took the stupid plots of adultery and double-dealing deadly seriously. When J.R. got shot at the end of one season, the tabloids went into a frenzy, attempting to identify the would-be killer. 'Who Shot J.R.?' became the most oft-asked question of the '80's. Since then, almost every soap has tried to do a 'who shot J.R.?' type cliffhanger, with varying results.<br/><br/>Howard Keel was Miss Ellie's love interest 'Peyton Farlow' and Steve 'The Baron' Forrest was made up to resemble a goat's bum as 'Wes Parmalee' ( where did they get these names from? 'Star Wars'? ) Terry Wogan was the first British 'Dallas-phile' and it is his name I used to curse each week when that bombastic theme tune blasted out of the television. I.T.V. attempted to poach the show from the B.B.C. at one point but sold it back to the B.B.C. - just as interest was on the wane. The final straw came in 1986 when, after being killed off, Bobby was famously resurrected in a shower, invalidating an entire season ( was this where Steven Moffat got the idea from for the Season 5 finale of 'Dr.Who'? ). Fans decided they'd had enough, and the last series went out in a graveyard on Sunday afternoon slot on B.B.C.-1 in 1991.<br/><br/>As if the prospect of a new 'Dallas' is not worrying enough, a 'Dynasty' revival ( Ye Gods! ) is also threatened. Good to know that Hollywood is currently bursting with exciting new ideas. To my mind the 'Dallas' series is the second worst thing to have happened to that famous city, the very first being J.F.K.'s assassination.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it kept a lot of women entertained for over a decade, and the late, great Kenny Everett did a wonderful parody called 'Dallasty' which ended each week with the credit: 'Creative Realisation Associates Production' ( spell out the first letters ).",9 out of 19 found this helpful.,1.0,4 February 2011

But ""Dallas"" had some of the strongest-written characters in television history:  ambitious J.R., dependant Sue Ellen, good-guy Bobby, prim-and-proper Pam, envious Cliff, unassuming Ray, and so many others, whose memory I cherish--Miss Ellie, Donna, Katherine, Mickey Trotter, etc....<br/><br/>Additionally, with the ""Who Shot J.R.?"" cliffhanger in 1980, ""Dallas"" created a new marketing tool the television continues to use to this day to retain audiences.  Not just soap operas use the season ending cliffhanger; it's been effectively used by such shows as ""Friends"" and ""Will &amp; Grace"" recently.<br/><br/>""Dallas"" was for many years the most watched program on TV, and continues to be watched by devoted fans, many of them discovering its greatness thru reruns.

1321,Dallas," The greatest series ever, and my favourite TV show of a ll time!","''Dallas'' is the greatest series ever, #2 is ''Knots Landing'', #3 is ''Dynasty'' and #4 is ''Dynasty II: The Colby's''. The series stars out with newly wedded couple Pam and Bobby Ewing returning to Texas state after eloping to New Orleans. Naturally, Bobby's family and her's, the Barnes's, don't exactly see eye to eye on everything. Leave that to Bobby's conniving 14 year's older brother J.R. Ewing. With Pam being the only innocent goldfish in a tank of vicious piranha-like Ewing's. She's gonna have to show and prove to them all that she can be just as tough and as determined as them all, and that she is here to stay at SouthFork for good.

1324,The Act," Brilliant, Chilling and Intriguing","First of all, the very idea of Munchausen by Proxy has always fascinated me. I kept on researching about it and learning about it. I came across the case of the Blanchards and was immediately interested. Now when I heard that there was going to be a TV series based on the real life story, I was excited.<br/><br/>And good gracious, this show doesn't disappoint. I watched the first two episode right after it dropped and was hooked! The direction and the cinematography is simply phenomenal. But what really got me and made me impressed was the acting and the production design.<br/><br/>Let's start with the production design. I know it may seem unusual but as an aspiring film student with an interest on production design, I was impressed by how the house looked so much like where the crimes happened. The makeup is simply brilliant and the actors almost look like their real life counterparts. The clothes that Gypsy wears, is identical/similar to what she wore in real life.<br/><br/>The other best thing is the acting. Great performances all around. Stating the obvious, Patricia Arquette and Chloe Sevigny are always awesome and they shine in their roles as Dee Dee and the neighbor, Mel. But someone who surprised me was Joey King. Having seen her in stuff like The Kissing Booth, I was skeptical but she completely embodies Gypsy. She is no longer Joey King, she is Gypsy now. Her voice, her walk and her talk is not hers now, it's Gypsy's. I will call it right now, she is gonna get nominated for an Emmy.<br/><br/>Overall; this is a really fascinating series and can't wait for the future episodes. It's chilling. And if you are a fan of good acting, then I highly recommend this.",215 out of 239 found this helpful.,10.0,20 March 2019

While watching, it's hard to fathom that this was based on true events. I think what amazes me the most is how convincing they really were for so long. So many people were shocked when the secrets all came out. How did they get doctors to refill prescriptions and install a feeding tube when she infact didn't have any diagnosisable illnesses?<br/><br/>If you're interested in crime documentaries or mental illnesses including munchausen syndrome by proxy, I would totally give this show a watch.

Patricia and Joey are great in their roles. For those who have criticized Joey's acting...please watch videos of the real Gypsy Rose. The voice is spot on. The glasses, the wigs and outfits, are all in line with reality.
For people who do not know the story, watch any documentary, to learn more about Munchausen by Proxy. I just feel badly for DeeDee wanting to keep Gypsy pretty much an eternal child.

Pleased that they added some new story elements or it would've just been a re-enactment documentary but for the sake of being a tv show adding fictional elements was smart. Patricia gives a chilling performance for the ages that could challenge shows like GOT and Handmaid's Tale when award season rolls around. And don't count out Joey yet either.

1344,The Act, Mental illness and intergenerational child abuse,"My Review: The Act , Dee Dee and Gypsy Rose. Rating 9/10<br/><br/>On Foxtel-<br/><br/>If I said to you it's about time a film or series was made about the condition Munchausen by Proxy you'd think I was mad ! but I'm glad I'm aware of this disturbing mental condition after watching the entire series of the Act very accurately based on true characters and incidents,I checked the Fact checker.<br/><br/>Munchausen syndrome by proxy is a mental illness and a form of child abuse. The caretaker of a child, most often a mother, either makes up fake symptoms or causes real symptoms to make it look like the child is sick.Sep 5, 2017<br/><br/>The Act portrays a fascinating and bizarre insight into Generational Child Abuse and mental illness and it's consequences resulting from Dee Dee's Blanchard's own Mother then being transferred to Dee Dee's own daughter Gypsy Rose Blanchard.<br/><br/>I waited till the series end to review this because at the beginning I thought the story may be a Mother Daughter version of the Grand Guignol classic "" Whatever Ever Happened to Baby Jane"" but the Act is much more serious and bizarre than Baby Jane .<br/><br/>Usually glamorous Patricia Arquette is mesmerising as the overweight , unattractive , mentally ill mother , who through her perception of maternal love virtually imprisons her daughter Gypsy and convincing her from birth that she is very ill .
She confines her to a wheel chair and feeds her through a stomach tube . Of course this also gives Dee Dee and Gypsy an income through welfare support and some fame for their apparent bravery and inspiration to other handicapped families.<br/><br/>Joey King plays Gypsy Blanchard brilliantly , at first her baby voice annoyed me until I read that the actress was actually trying to replicate the true characters voice ,which was not at all like her own, this is true acting skill.
Gypsy's character is fascinating, she's like a Disney doll Princess longing for her handsome Prince, who eventually appears as the incredibly disturbed Nick Godejohn , a multi personality sick teen also superbly acted by Canadian Callum Worthy.
Gypsy is incredibly complex caught up in fantasy one minute but when she realises the damage she has endured through her mothers smothering and lies, even her real age had been hidden from her she retaliates in the only real hope of escape her child/ adult mind can conjure up.<br/><br/>Mention must be made of Chloe Sevigny as the neighbour Mel (remember her from Big Love, the Mormon family Saga) Chloe is terrific as the suspicious Mum across the road who first spots proof of Dee Dee's dishonest and fraudulent behaviour.<br/><br/>No spoilers for the main plot which develops as the actual real life story occurred .
You get the drift in Episode One La Maison du Bon Reve but let's say that two mental cripples don't dance a very attractive Bridal Waltz .<br/><br/>A not to be missed series.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,2 August 2019
1345,The Act, Blown Away....,"Where do I even begin...<br/><br/>The cinematography was phenomenal. From the very first scene until the last seconds of this series, I was frightened, disturbed, and on complete edge due to the flawless filming techniques orchestrated. Every scene would raise your blood pressure, and keep you at the edge of your seat. An example of this is when Gypsy tip-toes to the kitchen to sneak whipped cream from the fridge. The directors knew how to take any given moment and electrify it to its max capacity. Whether the scene included gypsy eating junk food or being tied up to the bedpost by her mother, you felt a dark but appropriate dread.<br/><br/>The music was another superb element to the show. It seemed like every moment was matched with the perfect track/piece. The soundtrack was killer and locked me in as soon as I heard the first notes played by Fleetwood Mac. The music fit the theme and left you uneasy and simply terrified throughout.<br/><br/>To conclude, the acting was fantastic. Patricia Arquette couldn't have played a better role in her entire career, surpassing even her great performance as the mother in Boyhood. Her performance was so spot on and evil that I was left, suffering from my own bit of Stockholm Syndrome. The bipolar characteristics portrayed by Patricia forced me to love her and hate her every five minutes. Joey King couldn't have been more spot on with her character, capturing every expression naturally, allowing you to believe that you could possibly relate to gypsy's lifestyle. Very honest and believable.<br/><br/>Overall, this show blew me away.

1349,Misfits," BeautifuI, Interesting and Funny...","The season begins with the crippling blow of Robert Sheehan (who played the best character, Nathan and who often gave the show some much- needed humour) leaving the show and never really recovers, stumbling along adequately but never really finding its footing, unfortunately. Regardless, Misfits' third season is a sufficiently made, enjoyable slice of science fiction comedy-drama which is always great fun to watch, albeit Joe Gilgun can't fill Sheehan's size 55 shoes and that Hitler episode was so stupid. The finale is the best out of the three until the final moments, where stuff happens and we say goodbye to Kelly (the lovable Lauren Socha), Iwan Rheon's Simon (btw, he also sucks in Vicious) and Alisha, a slutty party girl with a heart of gold (Antonia Thomas), which is too much to take. I can't watch it anymore. I may watch a compilation of Nathan's best moments on YouTube to make me feel better, however.<br/><br/>The first season is extremely witty, dark, quirky, and hilarious. The series manages to blend plot and humour almost flawlessly. Although the latter seasons are not as good as the former it still manages to hold your attention.<br/><br/>Season 2 of Misfits is my favorite season of Misfits. Season 2 is the best due to the great humour (which is still present in the other seasons, but in this season it is at it's best).<br/><br/>Season 3 is the second best season of Misfits. In my opinion, Rudy is not as good as Nathan, but he still is a great character, and one of the best.

The rest of the cast had great chemistry, but somewhere along the lines, it just fell apart. <br/><br/>I watched season 1-3, and a few episodes of season 4. But season 4 just ruined everything that I loved about the show. Practically every original character was gone, and I had really grown fond of them, so to see the new faces get introduced killed the vibe.<br/><br/>In my opinion you don't need to see season 4 or 5, as season 3 ended quite good.

1351,Misfits, The best thing ever shown on E4,"Misfits has been described in a lot of reviews as a cross between Skins and Heroes, however, in my opinion, it doesn't contain the biggest flaws of these shows- pretentiousness or unoriginality. I'm *not* slating these shows, I'm just saying that as quite a comic-book fan, it's difficult to watch or read something about characters with superpowers without ripping it apart- getting irritated by the plot lines that are taken, or 'influenced' from other sources and neither does it have an impossibly good looking set of people living a life you can't help but envy, no matter what drama has unfolded in their life due to partying too hard. Misfits is very unique and while you can guess some plot lines of the show, you can never guess what'll happen next episode.<br/><br/>What Misfits provides is a group of interesting, likable and believable characters involved in well thought-out stories that are not over-complicated but still challenge the audience.<br/><br/>To complete the show, the episodes are also full of thick, dark humour.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an excellent show.",211 out of 251 found this helpful.,10.0,10 December 2009

I watched the first one out of curiosity not expecting much, but was hooked. At first (and second and third) glance, the characters are unsympathetic. Kelly- an aggressive version of Vicky Pollard, Alisha- a sexaholic, Curtis a disgraced track star, Simon a kid so withdrawn he's heading into creepy territory, and Nathan the smart-arse whose snark makes you laugh AND want to kill him. A disparate bunch forced to do Community Service under court orders as an alternative to jail. They get superpowers from a freak storm- and then its a thrill ride all the way.

Though it's not the most original concept (freak lightning storm strikes and gives a ragtag bunch of community service workers special powers) this show rises above Heroes and the many clones by bringing enough freshness to the table. Now I'm judging this show having just watched the first two episodes. At first it looks like your average Skins type rip-off but it very quickly establishes an intriguing plot with lovable characters and unexpected twists aplenty. The script is sharp like a razor and offers laugh-out-loud moments and witticisms to rival the best episodes of Friends or Fraiser. All the misfits are perfectly cast and brilliantly acted with just the right amount of cynicism and pathos and the situations don't seem forced like Heroes often does but emerge logically and organically from the characters. Even the powers themselves extend from the character's personas. Fantastic show. I cannot recommend it enough!,174 out of 217 found this helpful.,10.0,26 November 2009

The characters work well together, the acting and script are well done so there is nothing awkward or difficult to follow in the face of multiple characters. Very good looks into personal realizations that make the watcher wonder how they would feel in that situation.

Episode 2 made me snort my tea through my nose with laughter/horror/revulsion, it was epic. <br/><br/>I don't get the comparisons with Heroes - other than the 'superpowers', this bears no resemblance to the 'save-the-world' schtick and good-v-evil piety Heroes is full of. This is definitely black (with a collection of mottled stains that it's best not to ask about).

This show is brilliant and funny and deserves to be seen by viewers here too (USA). I look forward to watching the surprisingly fun and energetic cast perform some really great rolls. The cast work really well with each other and I hope that Misfits get the recognition that it deserves. Sure the effects are a bit cheesy but overall this is not what this show revolves around. It has potential to be something more but I still give it 10/10 for the originality. Comparing this show to Heroes (which obviously has large budgets and production value)is a waste of time as both shows are totally different. I found this show by accident and I'm hooked. I've told my friends to watch it and many are following me and saying that this show, despite its low budget and production value is worthy of a following.",80 out of 114 found this helpful.,10.0,17 December 2009

1361,Misfits, Fantastic Television,"I must admit that not once did I think of 'Heroes' when watching this programme, although now the point has been raised I can see why people would compare the two. What this programme does is show what a fertile ground British TV still is as not only is it very well cast, but the writing, direction and production design match anything that out US friends can do. Along with Skins and The Inbetweeners Channel 4 have now got another great programme that is 'yoof' but also appeals to an older audience. It is very dark, very twisted and quite often very very funny.<br/><br/>Initially I found Robert Sheehan's character 'Nathan' to be really irritating to the point that I thought he would ruin the programme, but as the show progresses he really is the heart of the whole thing and by the end of it I realised he was far and away the best thing in it !<br/><br/>Sheehan is certainly a face for the future, so too Lauren Socha who as 'Kelly' again initially seems like a real 'Chav' before blossoming into a very rounded character who you can sympathise with. Following her work in the Arctic Monkey's 'Scummy Man' promo she could also be one to watch.<br/><br/>If this was US produced I dare say we'd have had a minimum of 12 episodes to season 1, but the six we do get are excellent.<br/><br/>It would be a real crime if this doesn't reappear for a Second Series by the end of the year.",64 out of 94 found this helpful.,9.0,8 January 2010

The credit for that goes almost exclusively to Nathan, who takes one look at all the cool haircuts and pouts before tearing it all apart with filthy sociopathic charm. He leaves at the end of Series 2, and the show misses him badly. Rudy tries to fill the hole, but he is increasingly alone in trying to provide some charisma and laughs.

Then Antonia Thomas ( Alisha) follows Robert Sheehan and disappear taking another 15% value with her. Follows Iwan Rheon (Simon)... In my opinion, Misfits would have been one of the best TV series with young and talented actors. What I liked the most was the antagonism between Simon and Nathan - full of humor. When Naive Simon becomes Hero Simon, that was another unfortunate decision.

1367,Misfits, A very good fit.,"(I have revised my original draft) Now we are a few weeks in I have a better idea of what this show has to offer and it is now a clear 9/10. Misfits is a odd piece of obscene teenage drama mixed with a perfect example of a sci/fi dystopia. What you get is classic TV. The story follows a pack of rogue young adults ejected from society for a variety of problems, they have an armoury of asbo's and criminal offences and the majority are crass and vindictive. Yes, your average UK teen.<br/><br/>A storm rolls over head and the group are morphed into super humans with a peculiar talent that seems to mimic they own personality traits. There are many things good about it: Firstly the cast are supreme. The young actors clearly get stuck into their roles and are enjoying every minute. Secondly, I love the fact that this is a blend of the teen shows with sometimes extreme content. That had to be the longest topless scene in history of normal TV, yet it was acted flawlessly. The dark elements of the story mix wonderfully with the concrete foulness of the environment the group find themselves in, well done to whoever located that youth centre. What really won me over was the one episode where the Irish chap puts on yellow ski glasses and asks the misfits to guess who he is... ""I'm an annoying c unit"" - ""I'm Bonno"". And that classic bit where he throws the brick through the car window and is asked by the Social worker if he is special. ""If I was special I would have missed"". The Big Lebowski bowling scene was not lost on me either and the Misfit tribute to 'the dude'is faithfully executed. <br/><br/>This show is still clever, still very engaging and the male rape scene in the toilet is such a sophisticated take on a difficult subject that it is difficult to imagine where the writers are going to take us next. This show is becoming truly exceptional and I have no doubt that cult status is coming, we just need a few more people to see it. I still have no notable negatives at this stage beyond the fact that I will have to wait for a second series.",41 out of 67 found this helpful.,10.0,20 November 2009

Robert Sheehan leaving proves too much for this show. Whoever cast ""the new guy"" should have their CV reviewed. He's a polar opposite of who he was replacing and i could not connect with him. very bad choice of actor imo and the new writers should hang their heads in shame<br/><br/>I have watched the first 2 series in the last week and now i could care less about what happens to everyone.

'Just passing were you, Miss Marple?' 'Oh, Mr Burton!'<br/><br/>Julia McKenzie is not nearly as successful - have you noticed that her garb is far more severe, with jackets, stiff collars and plain hats rather than the cardigans, and flowery hats of McEwen?

1377,Agatha Christie's Marple, I miss this series,"I was absolutely gutted when the BBC regained the rights of Agatha Christie from ITV, there were still a few stories that could have been done to feature Miss M, The Seven dials mystery being one.<br/><br/>It's a very difficult series to rate, because the productions ranged from awful to wonderful. Why didn't they ask Evans and The Sittaford Mystery being the low points, with brilliance coming from the likes of The Blue Geranium, A Murder is announced and The Moving Finger.<br/><br/>Adaptations ranged from fairly accurate, A Pocket full of Rye and A Murder is announced, to wildly re written, Nemesis perhaps being the most altered.<br/><br/>They weren't afraid to add Jane Marple to Christie books where she hadn't appeared, in some cases it worked brilliantly, The Pale Horse and Greenshaw's Folly being about the best.<br/><br/>Initially we had Geraldine, unrecognisable for some as the character, but cheeky with a sparkle, and a sense of justice. McEwan was unable to return for series 4, so Julia McKenzie was cast to take over. More as Christie had written in her books in my opinion, and when the writing was good for her I thought she shone, in the Blue Geranium I think she was incredible.<br/><br/>They seemed to take a few risks when it came to casting, we had Elaine Page, Griff Rhys Jones, Harry Enfield, Lisa Stansfield, all actually worked brilliantly, cast against type. The performance highlights came from Zoe Wannamaker, Sharon Small, Shirley Henderson and quite a few others. The only time I felt the acting was in question was during 'Evans,' for that one I blame the script and poor direction.<br/><br/>Glorious scenery throughout, I loved the house that was used as Miss Marple's residence, such a pretty place. The period detail was spot on so many times, in terms of outfits and styling they nailed it, Bertram's wasn't my favourite adaptation but it's a beautiful looking episode, the clothes were beautiful.<br/><br/>The music was a little overdone at times, more so in Series 1, but a lot of the time it was enjoyable and melodic, The Body in the Library and Murder is Easy being better examples.<br/><br/>You need to watch these adaptations with an open mind, purists of Christie's work are likely to watch with unease. The acting throughout the series was excellent, it was the writers and producers that made the episodes great or poor.<br/><br/>People will always compare these adaptations to the BBC's, I did myself, but try to enjoy them without the comparisons, there'd have been no point making them identically, so plaudits for trying something different, sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.",11 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,20 October 2015

1379,Agatha Christie's Marple, Entertaining and interesting but not an easy series to rate,"As a big Agatha Christie fan, whenever a new Marple is on regardless of any initial dubiousness I never miss it. The ITV Marple series does have some good entertainment value and is not as bad as it has often been dismissed as, it is well made, has good acting on the whole and is fun. But it is also very difficult to rate, because the adaptations are a very mixed bag quality-wise. And this has little to do with infidelity to the books(which is the biggest and most common criticism of the series), even as a fan of Christie I have always been a firm believer of judging adaptations on their own terms as long as it doesn't feel dull and makes sense.<br/><br/>Admittedly some of the adaptations do not fare well with some of the changes made, the worst case being the ending of Body in the Library, still absurd even when you haven't read of the book, this viewer has, my parents hadn't and were pretty dumbfounded to the final solution of that one. Sleeping Murder also would have benefited much better if the incredibly haunting ending of the book was maintained rather than the Poirot-like denouncement that the adaptation had, the excellent Joan Hickson adaptation had it and it was done brilliantly, why wasn't it here(trying to solve the problem of having too many characters is my bet)? And then there's At Bertram's Hotel that if you took the period detail, Miss Marple and that it was a mystery drama you could have sworn it wasn't Agatha Christie.<br/><br/>But some of the adaptations that really disappointed did so on their own terms. Sittaford Mystery did have good production values and acting but it was very difficult to get into when the mystery didn't really ever come to life with a first half that took forever to get going. Why Didn't They Ask Evans?(Secret of Chimneys to a lesser extent too) had a different problem in that it was incredibly convoluted(even when watching it again since reviewing the adaptation the ending made little sense at all). At Bertram's Hotel manages to be both, as well as being far too broad, with perhaps Nemesis also faring the same. The adaptations that added Miss Marple into the story also had a mixed effect, Towards Zero incorporated her quite well but Why Didn't They Ask Evans? for example had her too much into the background.<br/><br/>The Marple adaptations for all the problems they have are not to be dismissed entirely. Because there are some faithful adaptations out there like A Caribbean Mystery and The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side(both better than the Hickson adaptations), and the third murder in A Caribbean Mystery works much better in the later adaptation than in the book and Hickson version where the murder was rather too much by chance. Some might find the exploration of Miss Marple's early life overwrought in Murder at the Vicarage, I thought it was genuinely touching. The Blue Geranium, A Pocketful of Rye and The Mirror Crack'd were really excellent as adaptations and on their own merits, A Murder is Announced is very good too. And while it did get confused and had too much padding at times, though it did keep to the core of both stories remarkably, Greenshaw's Folly was a brave attempt at merging two short series into one big one, doing it far better than the Poirot(a far more consistent series) adaptation of The Labours of Hercules. The series is well made, the locations and scenery from stately homes to more picturesque locations are stunning while the photography is pretty and atmospheric and the costumes are evocative and well-tailored.<br/><br/>Good also is the music, the theme tune is catchy but can get overused like in the early Geraldine McEwan adaptations. The background music and snippets of music from the period fare very well. The scripting- though Sittaford Mystery and At Bertram's Hotel in particular are exceptions, stilted and underwritten- does have some nice doses of humour and has the right amount of intrigue, generally making an effort to make the mystery make sense. The stories come from truly great source material(A Murder is Announced is an example of Christie at her best like The Murder of Roger Ackroyd and And Then There Were None) and they are mostly compelling and fun to see unfold, with some suspenseful and humorous parts. Geraldine McEwan and Julie McKenzie fare nicely as Miss Marple. I do have a preference to McKenzie(whose adaptations are more consistent) who has more charm and more of a twinkle, McEwan is always knowing, appealingly spunky and steely and makes the most of her screen time but can have a tendency to be over eager. Neither to me are as good as Joan Hickson who IS Miss Marple.<br/><br/>Most of the support acting is good, Zoe Wannamaker, Sharon Small, Lindsey Duncan, Timothy Dalton, Derek Jacobi, Jane Asher and Fiona Shaw very good(I'd go so far to say Small and Duncan were revelations), while Harry Enfield, Allan Davies and Elaine Page worked surprisingly well. There are exceptions however with some over-acting(Warren Clarke, Samantha Bond, Joanna Lumley, Shirley Henderson, Catherine Tate), under-acting(Freddie Fox, Jonas Armstrong) and a few wastes(Richard Briers, Jane Seymour- she was still quite good it was screen time really-, Joanna David). So all in all, very difficult to rate seeing how mixed the adaptations are- hence the lack of a rating- with a lot of good things and a lot of problems.

This fiasco is nothing like the story told by Ms Christie and makes a mockery of a decent book. Geraldine McKewen is awful as Marple ( but then wait until you see Julia McKenzie she's even worse). In this 3rd rate adaptation we have a band of actors who have no reason to be there. It seems the makers had budget problems and spent it on poor script writers and even poorer actors (Dawn French!) It should state that it is LOOSELY BASED on the novel. It's a gripping tale of a woman from New Zealand who comes to England with her husband.She was told she was born and raised Iin NZ, but on house hunting she is drawn to a particular house and buys it. As she decorates and makes changes to the house, lots of coincidences occur and memories of being in the house before..........Please buy the Hickson version.

1381,Agatha Christie's Marple, A very worthy series despite being controversial.,"As many negative reviews as this series has received for taking too much liberty of Dame Agatha Christie's original work, I must admit that I find it quite enjoyable to watch. I personally don't mind it changed some of Dame Agatha's below-average original novels, and find a few of these adaptions quite interesting and even can be said as an improvement of to the original, especially for her late work such as At Bertram's Hotel, By the Pricking of My Thumbs, Nemesis and so on. The only one in my opinion goes way too far is Murder Is Easy. The incest element in this story could have made a decent episode of Midsomer Murders, but it's never for Agatha Christie adaptions and never will be! As for the cast, I like the portray of both McEwan and McKenzie, but find the two actresses too much of a contrary to each other, especially for the same character in a consecutive TV series. As for regular writers, Kevin Elyot's scripts are always relatively faithful ones, but sometimes it makes the film feel rather dull, most notably being A Pocket Full of Rye. Stewart Harcourt could always do some interesting changes while keeping the core of the original stories, I like most of his work except for Ordeal By Innocence. Paul Rutman wrote two episodes with quite different styles: They Do It with Mirrors is a rather faithful adaption to the original story, while The Secret of Chimneys is a total rewrite! As for Stephen Churchett, he's the one that brings many of his own ideas to the source material, sometimes they work to me, such as Nemesis and The Sittaford Mystery, and sometimes they don't, most notably being Sleeping Murder and, of course, Murder Is Easy, due to their incest themes. But dare I say that as many people might criticize this series for its ""reinventing"" attempts, I still praise ITV's courage of trying to seek a new way to make Christie's work being accepted to the audience, despite the controversial feed backs.",10 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,3 August 2016
1382,Agatha Christie's Marple," Watchable, despite the blandness of the lead character","A series of adaptations of Agatha Christie novels, with Miss Jane Marple as the central character. A seemingly innocuous elderly woman with no background in criminal investigation, she has a knack for solving crimes, particularly murder.<br/><br/>Not in the same league as Agatha Christie's Poirot (the series starring David Suchet), but generally quite watchable. Miss Marple herself is quite bland, and certainly does not have enough colour or presence to carry an entire episode, let alone a series of 23 episodes. This is regardless of whether we are talking about the first 12 episodes, when Geraldine McEwan played Marple, or the final 11 episodes, when she was played by Julia McKenzie. McKenzie was the better of the two, having more gravitas and presence than McEwan, but neither inject much colour or engagement into proceedings.<br/><br/>To compensate for Marple's dullness, the main secondary characters are given depth, and are often made the focus of the episode. This includes some potentially interesting sub-plots and backstories. Marple is a fringe character for much of the episode and then swoops in towards the end to solve the crime. This strategy is not always employed, unfortunately, and, when it is, is not always done well, depending largely on the writing for the episode and the quality of the performances. <br/><br/>The mysteries themselves are generally quite intriguing. In some ways, this is where the Marple series is better than Poirot. Poirot mysteries were often highly complex, to the point of implausibility, with far-fetched back stories. Marple mysteries are more relatable and plausible.",13 out of 25 found this helpful.,7.0,28 July 2016
1383,Agatha Christie's Marple," ""Geraldine McEwan"" Is by far the Greatest Miss Marple.!!!","I too read the Agatha Christie books as a teenager, especially the ""Miss Marple"" books, and I can honestly say that Miss Geraldine McEwens version of Marple is the epitome of everything I envisaged Marples character to be. She is Fabulously Intriguing, Mystifying, and Spot-On.! I love her facial expressions when she is deliberating her calculations,queries and suspicions, it really does make one excited and intrigued...🤔 How any reviewer could ever state Geraldines version is not a Spot-On performance is in a daydream, and watching another channel or programme, or either they must be upside down...😶
I was so disappointed when Geraldine left the series and was replaced by Julia McKenzie, it was a disappointment! Her version was so far less effective and an inferior outlook with regards to Miss McEwans, and her attire was confusing; a far cry to what Marple had been potrayed as previously (by Mckewan)
I know each actress likes to incorporate their own take on a character, but Julia McKenzies version of Marple is of a much more cold and disconnected Marple; not at all like the homely, warm and a comforting Marple character played by Geraldine McEwan. A less connective performance I would say. One would believe she had forgotten her lines mostly, due to each of her performances taking too long to materialise. Those unflattering suits were so unappealing and drab, and those awful hats...unlike McEwans lovely cardigans, cosy flowery hats and knitting bag; well, what more can you say...😊 I just didn't think McKenzies Marple worked. I really didn't enjoy the Marple series after Mckewan left, other than the episode ""Endless Night"" which was one of the better episodes of the last three series.
My favourite episodes are "" 'Bertrams Hotel' 'The Sittaford Mystery' 'Sleeping Murder' and 'By the Pricking of my thumbs'. loving the re-runs of 'Miss Marple' on Itv3, I never tire of watching them...😊
I Recommend anyone and everyone who loves mystery and suspense, to watch at least the first three series of 'Marple' then follow-it-on until the end of the six series.. then, judge for yourself... you'll really enjoy them all and be in for a remarkable treat.!

1384,Agatha Christie's Marple, One of my favourite television series of all time.,"'Agatha Christie's Marple' is a fantastically directed, wonderfully filmed, all-round SUPERB TV series that retains both the atmosphere and irresistible charm of the author's source material, even when it deviates from the strict plots. As Joanna Lumley says in the 'Behind the Scenes on Series 5', as long as people will read and enjoy things, they will read Agatha Christie, and as long as people watch things, they will enjoy productions of her work. She is one of the best authors to have ever lived. I think it's something of a shame that BBC have regained the rights to her work because ITV and Agatha Christie are a match made in heaven. They nailed it with David Suchet's Poirot and they nailed it with Miss Marple too.<br/><br/>Geraldine McEwan and Julia McKenzie are both phenomenal as Miss Marple. Miss Marple generally has been very well-served by performers over the years. I loved it when the character was played by Margaret Rutherford in the '60s, as I did when she was played by Angela Lansbury in 'The Mirror Crack'd' (although they are incredibly different interpretations!). Every actress brings something different. Geraldine McEwan is our pixie-like, eccentric, but oh-so-loveable Miss Marple (probably the closest to the books) and Julia McKenzie is like your lovely grandma down the road. Whenever I watch one of them, I think, ""no, THIS is the best Marple,"" and then I change my mind when I watch the other.<br/><br/>As I have now finished every single episode, here's a very brief breakdown:<br/><br/>The Body in the Library - amazing. Fantastic. Brilliant. It retains the novel's atmosphere superbly (even after they changed a killer).<br/><br/>The Murder at the Vicarage - wonderful.<br/><br/>4:50 From Paddington - very good.<br/><br/>A Murder is Announced - another wonderful one, with Zoe Wanamaker (or Ariadne Oliver, as I know her) playing Letitia Blacklock.<br/><br/>Sleeping Murder - hmm...not one of the best. A bit of a weird production, with a bizarre addition of a band called the ""Funnybones""? Maybe I'll like it on a rewatch.<br/><br/>By The Pricking of my Thumbs - Miss Marple meets Tommy and Tuppence! Fantastic, perfect for Halloween, and very funny.<br/><br/>The Sittaford Mystery - not the best by a long way. Regardless of novelistic accuracy, the film itself is just not great. Enjoyable enough if you're in the mood.<br/><br/>The Moving Finger - brilliant production, one that improves upon the book.<br/><br/>Towards Zero - BRILLIANT. Surprisingly faithful to the source material, even with the addition of Miss Marple.<br/><br/>Nemesis - no. Again, don't care about accuracy, just as a film in its own way it's so weird...maybe this is another I need to watch again.<br/><br/>At Bertram's Hotel - my favourite episode in the whole series. (Yes I've read the book.)<br/><br/>Ordeal By Innocence - good film, with a brilliant performance from Juliet Stevenson.<br/><br/>A Pocket Full of Rye - Julia McKenzie shines in her debut, one that translates the novel almost verbatim.<br/><br/>Murder Is Easy - this is...okay. Very atmospheric and gripping, just not a standout.<br/><br/>They Do It With Mirrors - not one of the best, although it's not one of the best books either.<br/><br/>Why Didn't They Ask Evans? - indefensible. Appalling episode. (That final scene, ridiculous.)<br/><br/>The Pale Horse - fantastic! Julia McKenzie and J.J. Feild are superb, as well as pretty much every other actor.<br/><br/>The Secret of Chimneys - despite bearing no resemblance to the novel whatsoever, a truly phenomenal film which ranks very highly.<br/><br/>The Blue Geranium - an effective and highly enjoyable embellishment of the short story.<br/><br/>The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side - one of the very best episodes; a true and emotionally heartfelt adaptation of the novel.<br/><br/>A Caribbean Mystery - fine. I think this story works a bit better as a book, but it's certainly a decent film.<br/><br/>Greenshaw's Folly - massively convoluted but still good. Not the most memorable or the best though.<br/><br/>Endless Night - a horribly bleak and disturbing one, but then that's not out of keeping with the book. Superb performances and a great adaptation.<br/><br/>Bravo! The only question now is...having loved ITV Marple...do I now need to watch its rival: BBC Marple with Joan Hickson?",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,12 November 2020
1385,Agatha Christie's Marple, Let Go of Your Expectations,"My best advice for viewers of this series, especially for diehard Christie fans? Let everything you know about Miss Marple GO. Let it go, forget what you've read, what you've watched. Give up on comparisons. Let the 30's become the 50's. Let the artistic liberties override the canon. Stop being the Christie aficionado, expert, fanatic. Put your expectations in the bin and relax.<br/><br/>I basically learned to read with Christie novels...she introduced me to a lifetime obsession with detective stories, especially British-based adventures. I grew up loving Poirot, Tommy and Tuppence, and Miss Marple. I read and reread all of the stories. I also watched all the PBS/BBC adaptations over the years and yep Hickson was, in my mind and obviously in the minds of the majority of the raters here, the best personification of Jane Marple.<br/><br/>But in letting go of what I expected to see, and in allowing myself to NOT compare McEwan to Hickson and canon to plot changes, I was able to enjoy this series for what it is: a delightful, campy, visually wonderful entertainment opportunity. If you have any questions about how the look and feel of this series is, just watch the introductory titles. <br/><br/>Just. Let. GO. And allow yourself to enjoy the fun. If you can't, well, you're definitely going to be disappointed, which in and of itself is....disappointing.",6 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,3 September 2018
1386,Agatha Christie's Marple, Mediocre At Best,"Geraldine McEwan was a young looking 70-yr-old woman when she started making this series. For this part she was trying to be older which is all too obvious. She also speaks in a most peculiar and affected way; as though she is trying to put on a crusty accent but failing to do it without looking as though a great deal of effort is involved. It all adds up to terrible acting which could be forgiven were other actors pulling their weight. Unfortunately this is not the case. There are many ""guest actors"" (putting it politely) throughout the series who come from other backgrounds. Russ Abbot is a terrible comedian but a truly dismal actor and almost the same can be said for Dawn French. The whole series is rife with ""jobs for the boys"" (and girls) and this does Agatha Christie's stories a gross injustice. Don't bother with this series. It is absolutely abysmal. Yes, production techniques had improved by the noughties and yes... there are many lush flashback scenes that one doesn't find in earlier adaptations but this is not enough to make up for the sheer lack of any acting worth its salt. Instead of wasting time watching this series I'd urge anyone to watch the 1980s production instead with Joan Hickson playing the main part. It may be a bit dated but it's full of real actors who take a pride in their profession rather that egotists who are all trying to steal the limelight at the same time.",32 out of 90 found this helpful.,2.0,31 March 2012

""Political correctness has gone too""...oh please shut up! Review the entertainment, not your cliched social outrage. I'm a little less annoyed by AC devotees since theyve earned some proprietary rights and I'm interested in plot and character changes.

1389,Agatha Christie's Marple, Worst Miss Marple ever,"Miss Marple, as written by Agatha Christie, was not proactive or aggressive. She was written to seem very fluffy-headed.

She did so while watching events from a distance.",4 out of 9 found this helpful.,2.0,4 January 2021
1390,Agatha Christie's Marple," An impeccable series, that only loses by the little strength and charisma of the main character.","This British television series adapted all the tales and novels where Agatha Christie included, as the main character, Miss Marple, an elderly lady, who never married, and who lives alone in a village house. She's particularly gifted as the subject is to solve complicated puzzles, which allows her to almost always solve crimes and find murderers when the police don't know what to do. I didn't do an exhaustive research to know, but I think there may be a connection between this series and ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"", which did the same work with novels of the same writer, but with another main character. It would not be something extraordinary.<br/><br/>In fact, it's very difficult not to compare both series. Marple is played by two notable actresses. During most of the series, the character was incarnated by Geraldine McEwan, replaced at the time of her death by Julia McKenzie, for the last two seasons. I confess that I liked much more the performance of the first actress, very elegant in what would become one of her last works. However, Marple is a character who lacks Poirot's charm and charisma. Poirot has much more impact, strength and presence than this little lady, who is of such quality and intelligence as he is, but never delights us or give us the humorous touch present in the manias of the Belgian detective. This kills the series at birth, partially.<br/><br/>The performance of the cast is reasonably good. I would not say that it's extraordinary, but it complies with what it should and doesn't disappoint the public. Unsurprisingly, the costumes, scenery and film locations aren't to be missed either. Technically flawless, the series only loses by comparison with Poirot, and by the lack of charisma and strength of the main character.",2 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,9 February 2019
1391,Agatha Christie's Marple, good except the portrayal of MM,"I'm a lover of all A C's works,and enjoyed this with the exception of the portrayal of Miss Marple by Geraldine Mcewan. For me she brings absolutely nothing to the wonderful character that is M M. She succeeds only in making everybody else in the play seem exciting and interesting. So many actresses have bought their own particular take on Miss Marple. e.g Julia Mackenzie- warm,humorous, Joan Hickson-stern,forthwright. But you could be forgiven for assuming that Miss Mcewan is the deceased! And yet does seem to never receive any criticism for bringing nothing to what is a wonderful character that a lot of actresses would delight in playing.Sorry to speak ill of the dead but that is my overwhelming feeling. I've never seen Miss Mcewan in anything else to pass judgement on and do not have a grudge. But needed to say this as almost in a state of disbelief about this.",5 out of 20 found this helpful.,7.0,16 August 2016
1392,Agatha Christie's Marple, versions,"The key for taste this serie , in my case, was to ignore the portrait of Miss Marple created by Agatha Christie. because each actress in this role, gives her nuances and colors and accents to it. so, the war was between Geraldine Mc Ewan and Julia McKenzie. both are admirable. the difference - maybe the manner to define the character. in the case of lady McEwan , the good intention was the lead aspect. the hard try to give to her character consistence. the result was decent and honorable.

1393,Agatha Christie's Marple, Trashy liberal soap opera,"11FEB2020 {1/10 stars F} Recommend? No; Homosexuality added that did not exist in the books. This series is like a soap opera and romance novel with thin easily repeatable plots that include gossip, rumors, affairs, murder etc.<br/><br/>I did not choose to play this TV series but still watched some of the episodes. Jane Marple is a lousy ""sleuth"" even by TV standards. She conducts her ""investigations"" by talking with people in public and social situations where information can easily be overheard and misused. When a new piece of information to solve a crime is discovered it isn't long before everyone is gossiping about it.<br/><br/>The format of the show is wash, rinse repeat. Many of the actors overact their part, some to the point it is comical. The actors play out their scenes and the show is wrapped up by Miss Marple giving a recap of how the crime happened while relevant scenes for the crime are replayed. Each episode could have easily been an hour if it weren't for the Marple Recap and useless time wasting gossip from characters every time something happens or a new piece of information is discovered.<br/><br/>CONTENT ADVISORY: Alcohol, smoking, affairs and a passionate lesbian kiss toward the end of S1E1.<br/><br/>{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}",5 out of 24 found this helpful.,1.0,12 February 2020

1396,After Life, A perfect display of the grieving process,"Ricky Gervais continues to surprise me. I know that he's very funny, with his own brand of humor that many people find offensive, but I like most of his stuff. And I think of him as a comedian - both as an actor and a writer/director. So every time he does something serious and thoughtful, I am amazed at the level of depth, humility and kindness he brings to his creations.
""After Life"" is the story of a man who just lost his beloved wife, and with her, the will to live. He probably would have killed himself immediately, if he didn't have a dog to take care of. So he manages to get out of bed every day, and lead an existence devoid of any shred of happiness or hope. He titters on the brink of death, yet doesn't cross the line; he manages to anger, but not completely alienate those closest to him. People annoy him, probably because they go on living despite the fact that his world has ended. Worst of all, he claims to not care about his own life to the point where he deliberately puts himself in harm's way, yet the only people that he's hurting by his behavior are the people who still care about him.
I recently lost the person that I loved most in this world, and who loved me the most, and this show displayed so precisely all the feelings that I've been going through. All the terrible feelings and thoughts that you don't share with anyone, because they are too dark to put into words.

A New York Times story indicates that there were a number of people, including some outside the FBI, working on the textual clues that the miniseries has Fitz solve almost singlehandedly.<br/><br/>The series portrays Fitz in a formulaic manner. For example, his profiling duties lead him to identify too closely with his target, just like most series about profilers. <br/><br/>There's also an amusing scene where a bunch of men yell at each other while the one woman in the room asks the only intelligent question and becomes a major help to Fitz. This seemed a little too perfect (when you see a scene that perfectly illustrates something, it's often, as in the case of some scenes in Hidden Figures, completely made up). The woman is probably just a composite character, since I read an article saying there were numerous people contributing information that in the series all comes from her.<br/><br/>The only thing the producers have admitted to making up are the meetings with Fitz and the Unabomber. The reason for the first meeting makes no sense, which would be a good reason to have not done it, but the producers wanted to make sure there was a setup for a second meeting in which, in the final episode, Fitz cracks everything wide open. Of course.<br/><br/>The series drifts a bit off course towards the end. One episode leaves the investigation to show us the Unabomber's life, but since the series tight focus on the technical aspects of the investigation didn't make me wonder about the man, it just felt like the investigation grinding to a halt. And the final episode, while generally satisfying, felt far too pat.<br/><br/>Does historical accuracy matter? Overall it is an entertaining series, (although it virtually ignores the mystery of Fitz's downfall as set up in the beginning, which felt like a cheat). Personally, though, I often find the sloppiness of historical truth more interesting than the neat packages we get from Hollywood. I wish the writers had been less interested in creating a hero and more interested in the chaotic, collaborative nature of true investigation.",115 out of 148 found this helpful.,7.0,26 August 2017
1426,Manhunt, Interesting,"While the treatment might have been better.. I thought it was fine. What was amazing to me, the depth of detail, the insight, the development behavioral analysis techniques.. Especially the FBI figuring out when he went to college, and finding the 'writing rules, used by a world renowned Newspaper') to track down Kazinski <br/><br/>That part of it is amazing. I thought this was very informative, and entertaining. I'm glad they focused on the discovering who the Unabomber was rather than focusing on the bloody aftermath of his actions (would have been a cheap way to boost ratings.. The writers and producers 'took the high road' in creating this outstanding insight",32 out of 38 found this helpful.,7.0,11 August 2017
1427,Manhunt, One of the best based-on-fact dramas in recent times,"Alongside Narcos, The People v. O.J.Simpson and The Looming Tower, Manhunt: Unabomber joins some impressive contemporaries. This is way beyond a standard tv drama based on fact. What unfolds is the full intensity of what must have been one of the most researched shows in recent history. The tension builds from two main directions (alas no spoiler) each with their own barbed wire paths to follow, as well as a brilliant insight into the killer's mind, one that aside from being highly unusual, has got to be one of the most sensitive portrayals of the 'why' I have ever seen. Another highlight for me was that the damage done to the detective's life is distilled into poignant moments rather than being incorporated into one of the driving dimensions of the overall drama (a feature of crime drama these days one has to take for granted). This is likely because the breaking of this case was using highly unusual methods, or at least, one's not typically employed. It's all rather brilliant.<br/><br/>Everything from the acting to the sound design to the photography to the script is truly professional. Sam Worthington, Chris North and Paul Bethany were particularly brilliant in very difficult roles. And overall the filmmakers have created something of profound balance. There are several perspectives here.<br/><br/>To be honest I hadn't heard much about this case from my reading. It was truly illuminating, and edge of my seat fascinating.",30 out of 36 found this helpful.,10.0,12 October 2018

The show have a really slow pace, but it comes alive thanks to the performances of the principal and secondary characters.

In the process he is up against the entire FBI bureaucracy who is mired in the old ways and who reject Fitz's new techniques. Even with all that without the brother turning him in there still might not be an end to this case.<br/><br/>The battle of wits between Fitz and the unabomber during their interviews is almost worth the entire series. The unabomber has many ideas that will fit well for many potential jury members and so the FBI wants a confession and not merely going to court with their mountain of evidence.<br/><br/>The ideas presented in this series about linguistics are interesting of themselves, the concepts of just what is meant by freedom for instance resonated with so many people.<br/><br/>I give this a big thumbs up!",35 out of 46 found this helpful.,8.0,9 August 2017

1433,Manhunt, Okay as fiction - far from being accurate,"Apparently the producers thought that the UNABOM hook would pay off - and the high rating for this series certainly seems to validate their low opinion of viewers' interest in accuracy. <br/><br/>From the perspective of someone who knows a fair amount of the real story, this dramatisation is somewhat annoying. In addition, unnecessary drama just makes certain aspects so tedious. In particular, the negativity that was guaranteed any time that agent Stan Cole (Jeremy Bobb) appeared on-screen, and the weak-willed, moping ""composite"" characterisation of 'Fitz' ""I can't work this way!"" Fitzgerald (Sam Worthington) made the FBI look like an amateur group of drama-queens and back-stabbers. <br/><br/>So, instead, treating this as a fanciful alternative-universe take on the UNABOMBER investigation, it's a fairly mundane FBI profiler flick chopped up and stretched into seven mildly interesting episodes. Some reviewers have been very dismissive or derogatory of unenthusiastic reviews.

1436,Manhunt, grinding away,"The line between Reality TV and traditional scripted series is officially blurred. On August 1, Discovery Channel will begin airing an 8 episode anthology that provides the backstory of the Unabomber and the unprecedented resources the FBI devoted to the investigation and manhunt from 1978 to 1996. Billed as ""Based on True Events"", the latest from Producer and Showrunner Greg Yaitanes (""House"", ""Banshee"", ""Quarry"") delivers some impressive TV tension through a talented cast and a fascinating and tragic true story that gripped the country for nearly two decades.<br/><br/>Mr. Yaitanes also directs all 8 episodes, and perhaps it's his consistent approach that allows Sam Worthington (Avatar) to deliver his best and most believable performance as Jim ""Fitz"" Fitzgerald, the FBI profiler and language expert assigned to the case. Of course, as you would expect, the most interesting character is Ted Kaczynski. A child prodigy, Harvard educated, socially misfit smartest guy in the room, Kaczynski at times seems to tease or make fun of the FBI and their futile attempts at tracking him down. Paul Bettany (a Brit) is terrific and terrifying as the wild-eyed, extremely quiet recluse who uses mail bombs to attack those he holds responsible for the technology takeover.<br/><br/>We see Fitz as an ""old"" FBI rookie who spent years as a beat cop, and never really excelled as a family man (his very supportive and patient wife is played by Elizabeth Reaser). His talents as a profiler are through language and it's quite interesting to watch the progression of what he labels ""Forensic Linguistics"" – in an effort to gain respectability within an organization that only places value on hard evidence. Worthington initially portrays Fitz as an eager and nervous puppy overly anxious to prove himself to his superiors (played by Chris Noth and Jeremy Bobb). As time passes, he goes through periods of confidence, professional disgrace, reclamation, and finally as a victim of the self-centeredness so pervasive in a bureaucratic morass.<br/><br/>The UNABOM task force is explained, as is the enormous pressure to track down and stop the Unabomber. Over the years, his 16 bombs resulted in 3 deaths and 23 injuries. It was the largest and longest manhunt in FBI history, and might not have ended without the assistance of Kaczynski's brother David (Mark Duplass). Much of the investigative procedural will likely surprise those who thought it ended simply after David 'turned him in', and most will be surprised at just how much tension can occur with little more than a conference room and white board.<br/><br/>Be prepared for bouncing between timelines. The segments include numerous FBI meetings, a tense meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno (Jane Lynch), interrogations of Kaczynski by Fitz, the uncertainty of what to make of the Unabomber Manifesto (""Industrial Society and its Future), and the stress of needing an admission of guilt to prevent the uncertainty of a jury trial.<br/><br/>It's impossible not to make the comparison with Silence of the Lambs when Fitz interviews Kaczynski  more proof that the good guys aren't always the smart ones. It's Episode 6 that provides the backstory and profile of Kaczynski. In Lincoln, Montana (his infamous cabin is located nearby) we note he is friendly (quite ironically) with the local mailman, as well as helpful to the librarian and her math-challenged son. Through the letters to his brother and mother, we learn how his childhood, education, and Harvard psychological study impacted his later severe reaction to societal changes. He felt betrayed too many times, and admits that his ""life was not supposed to go like this"". Fitz later experienced some similar type betrayals.<br/><br/>Other notables in the supporting cast include Lynn Collins, Keisha Castle-Hughes (15 years after Whale Rider), and Michael Nouri as Bob Guccione. Despite the inclusion of a few clichés, there is a feature film style to much of the series, and it is certainly an impressive entry from the network best known for ""Shark Week"".

He did not require all the panic and resources spent on him. His bombs were meant to harm individuals not groups.

2. Terrible acting. The folksy bomb guy is pretty good, but even he wears thin with his homespun wisdom and cringeworthy parables.
3. Egregiously bad Southern accents and dialogue. Are there no Southern actors in Hollywood? The dialogue sounds like how a Hollywood screenwriter thinks Southerners talk. Note to Hollywood, not all Southerners say ""ain't"" or spout nonsense about the government.
4. A bloated script that could have been at least 2 fewer episodes without all the traipsing in the woods and puke-worthy bonding moments.

The whole town aids a murderous fugitive because of their religious zeal and distrust of the ""guvmint.""

1446,The Fosters," Exceptional 1st episode, fills a gaping void in the family show genre","What an excellent start, i was gripped within the first 2 minutes of watching the excellently paced 1st episode. This show wants you interested right from the start but there's no tricks or flashy style, just good solid drama. The acting is superb, especially from the 2 moms, it was nearly like watching a documentary of a family in action. I also remember thinking the music the show used was particularly appropriate and very complimentary to the visuals.<br/><br/>As the title implies, The Fosters is a show about a foster family but with a nice modern day twist - there are two moms instead of a mom and dad, the eldest son is the biological son of one of the moms from a previous marriage, and then there are the twins, a boy &amp; girl, recently adopted by the family. This is a show concerned about all the people who fall outside of the traditional family existence, about the children who need another family to take them in. And they make it interesting! Really can't emphasize this enough, there was obviously a great effort employed to combine the serious and complex issues with the need to entertain to tell the story, and they did brilliantly, i wasn't bored for a second.<br/><br/>I have to thank the reviewer who summarized The Fosters as ""filth"", i may not have ever watched it but after reading his/her review i felt it my public duty to actively counteract this act of douchebaggery by watching the show and then actually saying something objective somewhere in my review. I was so glad to see that 0 out of 12 people found his review useful (lol) but because this poorly-disguised rant against homosexuality was the featured user review, and also because there were only 2 reviews at time of writing, i felt it would be useful to be number 3 to let you guys know you won't be wasting your time with this one :)<br/><br/>I really can't think where they fell down, apart from a small complaint that 'who was who' was a little hard to follow at times, even though that by the end you know who is who.

1449,The Fosters, Great family drama,"I'm fast becoming a fan of ABCs drama shows, they always have a normal enough setting with such a deep undercurrent you just have to tune in to find out the secrets that everyone possesses. The show revolves around a lesbian couple that foster children, they have twins who want to spend time with their birth mother, a boy from one of the mothers previous relationships, and when the show begins they take on a girl who just got out of juvenile detention.<br/><br/>The kids are good actors and have good chemistry together, they have the usual teenage problems, pushing the boundaries with their parents, trying to find out who they are etc. The story about Callie, the new girl from juvenile detention is very interesting. At first some people judge her as being a violent young offender but we start to see that she comes from a very troubled home life and just wants to fit in and be loved.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the two mothers is fantastic, it's not camp or overdone, it's a normal representation of a couple struggling to raise kids who just happen to be women. They embrace, they argue and apart from the mild surprise at the start, it feels like watching any other parent duo. In particular I have to praise scenes that take place between the two moms and the ex husband and father of one of the boys. They all have equal rights to the raising of their children and they are trying to figure out how that works with three people, something that happens frequently for any divorced parent with a child that remarries.<br/><br/>Overall I would say it's a very interesting show, it's not an over the top teen drama where they all get pregnant, it's kids dealing with a lot of normal problems and also trying to gel with so many people under one roof from different backgrounds and walks of life.",65 out of 86 found this helpful.,8.0,19 June 2013

1451,The Fosters, Best New Family-Drama of the Year,"I am one to be very cautious when watching a teen-drama on ABC Family. After all ""Pretty Little Liars"" isn't the most enthralling teen murder-mystery show and ""Secret Life"" just wasn't sophisticated enough to be smart TV fare. However, ABC Family has blown me away with it's brand-new television series ""The Fosters."" The show starts off telling the story of Callie, a girl in foster care, she's just getting out of juvie and is now sent (her younger brother Jude will join her) to live with another foster family but this one is a little bit different from her other homes. The house is made-up of three other teenagers: Brandon, the biological son of his mom from a previous marriage; Mariana and her brother Jesus, twin Latino teenagers who were adopted when they were children; and we round it up with Lena and Stef, a bi-racial lesbian couple raising the children together. Stef is Brandon's biological mother but that doesn't stop him from referring to Lena as mom too. So now Callie is in this whole new situation that is something she never even considered possible until now. Now the insane weekday mornings getting ready for school and work can begin.<br/><br/>In the very first episode it is as plain as day that this family isn't the definition of what is considered a ""traditional family"" but that doesn't matter, people are too busy getting breakfast ready and skateboards out of the kitchen to really care. The show has done an immensely wonderful job at describing how much the definition of family has changed throughout the years. When you think of the perfect family you think of ""The Brady Bunch"" but as Stef elegantly put it during a conversation with Lena ""We're not the Brady Bunch."" Instead of being ""perfect"" they're real which is very refreshing for family drama.<br/><br/>The maturity in this show is also very surprising considering it is a teen drama from ABC Family, which (except in the case of Switched at Birth) usually always ends up being a soap-opera. The writers obviously take their time in crafting convincing characters that we will love and absolutely relate to. But this would definitely end up being a stereotypical, cheesy show if it wasn't for the amazing cast assembled on the screen. Even in it's most melodramatic moments the cast finds a way to keep it one of the most grounded shows on television.<br/><br/>But probably the main reasons to keep watching are because of three women: Maia Mitchell (Callie), Sherri Saum (Lena), and Teri Polo (Stef). Teri Polo and Sherri Saum have natural chemistry that easily transitions on screen with their performances. Both women are equally convincing in their roles as caring mothers raising the five teenagers under one roof and as a loving, married couple who would do anything for each other. To see that kind of affection is inspiring. However, it is Maia Mitchell who steals the show as the reserved and tough Callie. Maia Mitchell brings a subtlety to the role that makes her performance all the more powerful. Maia breaks the stereotype that all foster children are delinquents bent on destroying everything in their path and showing that not all foster kids are like that. She shows that Callie has a wisdom beyond her years because of her experiences in foster care and that she is a capable young woman with true issues from her past. Such honesty is something rarely seen in any young performer these days and to find it in an hour show every week is a dream come true. She definitely has a bright future ahead of her.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Fosters"" proves to be a wonderful family-drama about love, trust, and just living life. There was much potential for this to go wrong but also just as much potential for this to go right. And I am pleased to announce that this has gone right indeed. With wonderful performances, smartly written script, and sensitive direction ""The Fosters"" sores beyond the usual expectations of family-dramas. And yes, Stef was right when she said ""We're definitely not the Brady Bunch"" and thank God for that.",41 out of 59 found this helpful.,10.0,16 July 2013
1452,The Fosters, Love is thicker than blood,"I am so happy that this show exists. It does a great job at bringing foster life to light. There are some fantastic foster families out there, but there are also lots of abuses. This show gives an example of both in a very accurate way. Bravo to the fosters for taking that leap. And bravo to the actors for doing such a fantastic job at playing such emotionally charged roles and doing it so flawlessly. I can't wait to keep viewing and see how their stories unfold. There is so much pain in the world, but the Fosters' house seems to be the cure and can be a model for all families to go by. Regardless of where you come from, you are worth love and the sense of belonging.",37 out of 55 found this helpful.,8.0,16 July 2013
1453,The Fosters, Simply fantastic!,"This show is amazing not because of its progressive stance (a multi-racial family that includes same-sex parents), but its ability to avoid stereotyping. We could've had a show that took a political standpoint for or against gay marriage, but instead we get a series that paints a loving family going through the trials that all families have to go through. Everyone's different background (the Latino twins, the delinquent foster child, the son from one of the partner's previous marriage) could've been used to create one dimensional characters whose behavior was predicted based on label. However, this show doesn't resort to that. It has a well- rounded cast in terms of acting and has you empathize with every P.O.V. :] Thank you ABC Family for giving us this rare gem. Sad we had to wait till now to get something like this on television.",41 out of 62 found this helpful.,10.0,14 July 2013
1454,The Fosters, Worth your time.,"I first heard about this show at episode 3. I wasn't that impressed with the one episode but thought this is a show I'd like to know more about, so circled back to the pilot and ep. 2. I must say, not only did I change my mind but I want to thank ABC Family for putting this show on the air. It's unique, delightful, real, impressive in all it's warts of family life and a wonder to see unfold.<br/><br/>It is rare, indeed, to see lesbians on screen in any capacity. To see a series devoted to moms and their family is noteworthy. To see a real life depiction of a foster situation, and all the inevitable anger and acting out against the ""good guys"" (in this case, the good moms) is even more rare and wonderful. I have no issues with the acting, only with the preposterous scenario of setting up ex-spouses as police patrol partners. Never gonna happen. For good reason.<br/><br/>To be a foster parent means, by definition, to show great patience and love with children who need it more than you can imagine. I think this is exactly what you see on screen. And ultimately, what you see is children who appreciate that, and show it in ways large and small. As much as they can muster on any given day.<br/><br/>Well done ABC Family.<br/><br/>Update: The first half of season 1 was pretty great. And then they took a six month break and came back with a second half of the season that appears to have been written with focus group feedback and/or merchandising potential in mind. Not much of it was believable except that emotions run high amongst teenagers. It was a big disappointment. I'm hoping for a return to better writing with the new season.<br/><br/>2nd update: 2015 - Quickest demise of a noteworthy series on my watch. Bad writing has ended my season pass. What first brought praise now brings scorn for shoddy workmanship. Come on, Hollywood. You know you can do better.",41 out of 62 found this helpful.,10.0,2 July 2013
1455,The Fosters, Bananas Fosters,"Every person in the show, every week, has a life altering situation to deal with. Everyone is so somber. They all love each other, but there is very little joy or happiness in this family. Both parents constantly drone on about communication, yet they and everyone else in the family are always telling lies or keeping secrets (but it is always purported as to spare others feelings or as an act of complete selflessness toward someone else). In spite of all this, the children are spoiled, selfish, misguided, and care little about others. They continually make foolish decisions and basically turn situations that any normal person would just shrug off into personal catastrophes. The young boy seems to blankly stare off at the ceiling all the time and rarely has anything of substance to say. The parents, if you could seriously call them that, handle every situation in as irresponsible manner as possible. I'm sure they are supposed to represent modern, hip parents, but instead come off as total failures. And enough already with the Dance Team storyline. What educational institution would let students solely audition and pick participants for a sports team? For a show that is set up to offer an endless series of interesting stories, the writers of the Fosters have chosen to take every person, in every scene, of every episode and inject as much melodrama into it as possible. That doesn't make for compelling TV, it makes the show predictable and tiresome.",37 out of 57 found this helpful.,2.0,25 March 2015
1456,The Fosters, Mediocre Family Drama,"This show definitely has possibilities. The key word is drama and the set up for this show should allow for many seasons worth. The biggest problem for me so far is the acting. While some members of the ensemble are great, several of the younger actors are so bad it is distracting. While this may be acceptable for a comedy, where overacting is often part of the charm, here it detracts from the drama. It deadens some moments that were meant to be (and should have been) serious. And though I haven't watched the show from the beginning, I wonder how a teacher and police officer can afford the extremely large and appointed home they reside in, especially on the west coast.",22 out of 33 found this helpful.,6.0,7 July 2014
1457,The Fosters, If These Were My Children I Would Run Away,"Don't get me wrong. This show is very entertaining, but it also crowded to insanity with way too much teenage angst into it's four seasons and that is also its weakness. A top-notch cast led by Terri Polo (Stef) and Sheri Saum (Lena) as lesbian parents of five kids--one of them, Brandon) is from Polo's earlier marriage before she came out and they have adopted two twin Latino kids, Mariana (Cierra Ramirez) and Jesus (Jake T. Austin and later Noah Centineo), who have been through the system of foster homes following the abandonment of their parents to drugs and other issues. The show opens just as they come to care for a sister, Callie (Maia Mitchell) and brother, Jude (Hayden Byerly) who have been in numerous foster homes and been rejected for adoption numerous times. Stef is a cop--competent, almost swaggering him her zeal to be right, while Lena is a teacher for a Charter school. The family lives in one of the most gorgeous Arts &amp; Crafts houses in San Diego you've ever seen. There's no way in hell they could afford this and five kids. Stef and Lena try to instill parental control but it's a losing battle from the get-go as these kids do the dumbest things over and over again. They are in constant peril whether through the foster parenting system that sucks, assumes the kids are screwed up, and doesn't protect them to the constant shifting of their own personal stories. So Jude is gay and has all those attendant issues. Callie can't help her attraction to her older foster brother, Brandon, and the two of them nearly wreck their chances at a solid family life through the first two seasons. Mariana is an insecure, if smart and talented young lady, but she's also a bitch and a troublemaker and can't ever keep a secret, which leads to insane plot lines that cause the family no end of troubles. Jesus is sweet and sexy to the girls but dumb as a post. And if that isn't absurd enough consider: <br/><br/>Callie, whose mother died when she was fourteen has a rich father who never knew of her existence. He comes on the scene to imperil her adoption. <br/><br/>Mariana and Jesus have birth parents too, The mother is a neglectful drug addict and their father is a man who has been false accused of being a sexual offender by the twins' mother and her parents. <br/><br/>These young teens--ages 14 to 16 couple, split up, change partners, and do some really dumb stuff. Typical of teenagers, you say? If I were the parent of any of these kids, I'd like them up. They are a danger to them selves and need to be protected--FROM THEMSELVES. This kids experience it all--car accidents, confrontations with the police, show their lack of respect for anyone older than they are, and still the mothers here, though stressed out all the time by the antics of their kids, forgive them. Encourage them. Love them. And wait for the next wave of disasters that are sure to come. <br/><br/>I grew up a very sophisticated teenager with a lot of freedom from the age of 12. It was the 60s and I never managed to get into the kind of trouble these siblings are enforced to do by the writers of this show. Marianna is a particularly annoying, but oh, I said that earlier. This lady needs to be locked into her room, her phone taken away, and her outrageous send of entitlement frozen until she's at least 25. Callie can't take on too little causes to justify her need to fix kids lost of the foster system. Brandon needs to be kept away from needy girls. He cannot help but run to their rescue, often with disastrous results. Jesus is just a dumb teenager who never seems to have had a reflective moment in his life. That leaves Justin, the quietest of the quintet. <br/><br/>Everybody's ex's show up in this show and the end up living together. It's so weird. THE FOSTERS is good about exploring all subjects: teen pregnancy, gay sex, teen self absorption, the pathetic stage of the foster care system. We see a an attractive, committed lesbian couple taking care of their kids and believe me, these kids are not nearly grateful enough for the little that is asked of them. The show tackles very adult themes. And that's good for teenagers.",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,5.0,1 August 2017
1458,The Fosters, Started out strong but losing it quickly,"I enjoy shows I can watch with my daughters whom now are 18. I love discussing things with them and having good conversations. That is how it has been with this show. None of us are lesbian (at least that I know of lol) but can all enjoy peoples differences. We have been pretty open in watching but now I have an issue. In these last couple of epsiodes it tells the story about the twins dad being a sexual offender. It makes light of megans law because although he was over 18, they will still close in age and had sex. This does NOT represent the MAJORITY of sex offenders. If one kid thinks it is OK to date someone on the sex offender list bc they are told of this scenario - it is wrong! Are you kidding me Jennifer Lopez? Think of your daughter! Young girls (and boys) brains are not yet fully developed. They want to believe everyone is good. This scenario is NOT OK. Glorifying a sex offender because he was ""in love"" with someone underage is not romantic but that is how it is coming off. Sicking. It is against the law for a reason. There are other ways to approach this but again glorifying a sex offender is really disheartening to those whom have been abused in real life situations. My heart goes out to those whom are under aged and have or are being abused in real life. They have a voice too you know.",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,5.0,6 March 2016

Don't do it,"" and of course, they did. She finally stopped watching because of the inability of any of these people to exhibit self control or to learn from their mistakes, the same one's they make in EVERY episode. Meanwhile, the parents are telling the kids, ""I trust you to make the right decisions."" Really? Why is that?

I love that it shows that in our homes and our hearts, ""there is enough to go around"". I hope that it encourages many people to open their homes to children who need loving families.

In fact, most of the plot is plot device driven when the characters make the most illogical choices, it ruins suspension of disbelief and just plainly unrealistic. I don't know, in summary, I liked the show at first and now I hate it. At best I recommend only one season or just avoid the show altogether, that is I would not recommend at all.

1464,The Fosters, Sweet story but a little too dramatic at times,"I´m watching on netflix, so I haven´t watched the whole series. What I can say so far (after 4 seasons): it is like a soap opera, in which you get attached to the characters and want to see what happens to them, you will root for some couples, be annoyed with others, and get mad with some of them. In the beggining, it is very interesting, mostly because of the topic about the foster system and the family formation. I just think that they exagerated a bit with the ""important issues"" and the story gets a little artificial. I understand that it is important to talk about some matters, and the show does it in a really gentle and sensitive way, but sometimes it just seems like too much; it becomes hard to believe that EVERY TIME something really problematic is happening with a group of teenagers.

Everything they do or say is analyzed and misinterpreted by the other to the point of utter ridiculousness. One can not even smile at another adult without suspicion by the other. And, for a family that stresses open communication, all everyone does is lie. Just a few examples: lie about buying a car, lie about going to Mexico, lie about relationship with brother, lie about relationship with sister's boyfriend, lie about foster care license, lie about party when parent's away, lie about getting fired, lie about shoplifting, lie about going to school, lie about getting kicked out of school. Lie after lie. And that doesn't include all the things they do behind the others backs. If this is the typical modern family, it's no wonder every episode is about losing one of the children.

Second, I am a mother of 5, now all grownup, so I have dealt we many of the issues presented. First season, was quite nice to watch but then it turned into a spiral of bad choices made by adolescents that were seen as normal by parents without proper management. <br/><br/>All the kids started having sex at 15 years old with the knowledge and acceptance of parents, making the sex act a trivial achievement with no emotions attached to it. The character is Callie is annoying. She makes one bad choice after another and when caught parents and figures of authority, like Rita, praise her as a hero. She is an irresponsible adolescent that needed education in controlling her impulses. I wish she is sent to some program that help her realize how irresponsible she is. She is rude with her parents and all the others also. Even though their parents are the most understandable people I have seen. <br/><br/>I am watching season 4 and it is horrible. Do they have one kid, only one, that is regular and mature? The way they handle situations assures that they will be irresponsible adults. I have read other critics and most are attacking the LGBTT issue and they are wrong. That is no problem in this show, the problem is the triviality by which they handle important and strong issues our youth go through.

1467,The Fosters," Starts great, becomes tiresome","This show is about two lesbians, one a police officer with a teen son from a previous marriage, one a vice principal. To get a sense of things upfront, note that one is white, the other black. This show is full of that sort of thing -- it covers a lot of ground, has a lot of subplots and issues to cover. Each episode is likely to have multiple subplots.<br/><br/>Anyway, the couple (in the first season, we learn how they met &amp; so forth) eventually adopted a pair of twins (Hispanic) whose mother is a drug addict (the father is missing - at least for now!). The show starts with Steph and Lena taking in -- for just a little while surely! -- a troubled teen as a foster child. BTW, the name of one of the women is Stephanie Foster.

1470,The Fosters, A Superb Idea Ruined by Bad Acting and Terrible Writing,"My wife is an avid watcher of just about anything that airs on ABC now simply because that is what she would watch in Jr. High. Because of this, I've had the ""pleasure"" of watching these shows, including The Fosters. I'd first like to state that the idea behind the show is very interesting, which seems to be the only part that ABC is good at because every other aspect of this and their other shows are absolutely abhorrent. I've never been a fan of drama shows, but ABC seems to be able to ruin every show that could be incredible if it was done by any other studio or company.<br/><br/>First things first, the acting is down-right awful, there's no way to sugar-coat it. I understand that things need to be a little over-the-top to create drama, but it's almost like watching a middle-school play. However, the acting is nowhere near as bad as ""troll 2"", so I guess I could count my blessings.<br/><br/>Up next, we've got characters that have absolutely no character. The children are made out to be geniuses in comparison to the parents, yet suddenly change to ""dumb as a box of rocks"" for the producers to push a story or because drama. No part of the drama or the story seems to flow naturally.<br/><br/>I'd like to take this time just as a warning for anybody like me. I've almost got my bachelor's in Computer Science. Computers and programming are a big part of my life. Throughout the show, one of the kids really gets into the ""computers and programming"" thing. It's clear that the producers didn't do any of their homework in this subject, because every sentence will leave you cringing and grinding your teeth, especially if they think a child could ""program up"" a 3-d holographic dance routine choreographed with real dancers in a couple nights using nothing more than Java.<br/><br/>10/10 for a good idea, but a -10/10 on performance and execution, so I'll be leaving a 1/10.

1471,Orphan Black," Great, fun, smart sci-fi – and what a lead actress!","The premise of 'Orphan Black' probably wouldn't even have to be half as intriguing as it is - and yet the show would still be fun to watch. Some TV-shows have such a great cast, you'd keep watching simply for the joy of seeing an outstanding ensemble act. To get those kinds of actors is a rare privilege for any show, and 'Orphan Black' is very privileged, indeed. Thankfully, it also has a fascinating story to tell, and that combination makes for one of the most entertaining and most original shows on recent TV.<br/><br/>This review won't contain any spoilers, so I'm not going into plot details - just know that 'Orphan Black' delivers a perfect blend of mystery, sci-fi, thriller, drama and comedy elements - and many wonderfully colourful characters - that will make you want to binge-watch entire seasons. And while everybody in the cast does an outstanding job, one thing can't be stressed enough: Tatiana Maslany, the lead actress, is a revelation. It's hard not to spoil anything for those who still have the joy of watching 'Orphan Black' ahead of the them (and I think the first few episodes are enjoyed best without knowing what the show is about), but let me just say: you're not likely to see so many different aspects of one actress' amazing acting capabilities in any other show or film. <br/><br/>So my verdict: Worth watching for the quality of the acting alone, 'Orphan Black' offers dark thrills, edge-of-your-seat suspense - and more than a few laughs along the way.

1472,Orphan Black, Tatiana Maslany should have been Emmy Best Actress in a Drama,"As this series aired on BBC America, it seems to me it should have been part of the Emmy candidates. However I wonder about that since it received no mention and as a minimum, Tatiana Maslany's performance in the lead character role is one of the best ever in any media. Tatiana plays the multiple clones effortlessly. Whether American, British, Eastern European, anti-social, nonconformist, conformist, straight, LGBTQ I am never questioning the character. I was a fan and regular viewer of United States of Tara, but Tatiana's performance eclipses Toni Collette's. As I watched each week of the first season, I went from mildly entertained by her transformation to completely believing there were multiple actresses in the show. I would watch the opening credits thinking there were missing actresses! Jordan Gavaris is also great as Tatiana's brother. He brings just the right level of doubt yet support to the character. The story lines, settings, direction are also very good. As video science fiction, I think this is one of the best shows I have seen. It explores many different ethic and moral views - personal, scientific and social - with just enough creepiness to both entertain and make me think.",88 out of 97 found this helpful.,10.0,6 October 2013

There is no BS in Orphan Black. Not a trace of the fake beauties that overpopulate our TV screens, there is a great rhythm between the actors, the plot got me hooked by the end of the first episode and there are no unnecessary digital effects whatsoever. <br/><br/>Now, the best of all is Ms Maslany's acting. She plays several roles and each one of them has a characteristic and unique trait. It's not just the wardrobe and the hairdo that change, it's the whole personality and she does it beautifully. Not to mention the accents that go from British, to American-English, to Ukrainian and German! She is just a treat! She obviously takes her job seriously and it's refreshing to see such professionalism on screen. No egos there. You'll even see her playing character A passing for character B and she makes you forget that it's the one and same actor! Talk about a mind-numbing job, but again... she does it perfectly.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good story with great acting, lots of humour, action and drama, all in one, that's the show for you. <br/><br/>Kudos to the rest of the cast too. Lots of respect goes to Jordan Gavaris who plays a kind of stereotypical gay guy but hey... as a gay man myself, I have nothing against it. There's all kinds of people around the world so... lighten up.

I am in awe of her ability. She absolutely needs to get an award for this performance. The premise is unique and a welcome addition to the sci-fi genre. Truly it is one of the best sci-fi shows I have seen in a very long time. There is mystery, romance, danger and with the promise of more characters to be played by Tatyana Maslany, Orphan Black just has to continue for as many seasons as possible. PLEASE. I love the rest of the cast also, (especially her homosexual foster brother who provides some timely comic moments). The excitement just builds and builds as the season unfolds.

1480,Orphan Black, 1 Nominee 5 Times at the Next Emmy Awards,"Really, at the next Emmy Awards, Tatiana Maslany should be all 5 nominees for Best Actress. This has got to be one of the world's all-time most virtuoso performances by anybody anywhere. Not only does she make each of her clones a distinct and memorable character, you can actually tell when one of the clones is assuming the role of a different one - something that happens quite a lot!<br/><br/>So the acting is phenomenal, but if it were only that you could turn it into a kind of FaceOff competition. Instead there's much more. The plot is layer upon layer of intrigue, and every time one layer is peeled away and you think you're down to what's really going on, it turns out to be just a deeper layer.<br/><br/>A Canadian production made with a limited supply of Canadian dollars, ""Orphan Black"" proves that you don't need megabux worth of fancy special effects if you've got truly inspired writing.<br/><br/>One thing I really admire is that this is a serious show for serious adults, not children or the squeamish. Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel used to bemoan the absence of an ""A"" rating for movies, for films that were intended for adults and didn't deserve the kiss of death that was the ""X"" rating (now wussified as ""NC-17"" but still just as deadly). This series earns its ""A"" in both meanings of the letter.<br/><br/>Really, the only thing keeping ""Orphan Black"" from being the best TV series on the air is that it had the misfortune to share the current decade with ""Game of Thrones"".",30 out of 41 found this helpful.,10.0,3 January 2015

Such a fast-paced first season as well, the thrills never stop, the twists and turns never let down. But what's most remarkable is Tatiana Maslany, who plays these various characters brilliantly. It's not just that she plays many characters though, it's how she does it, and how when you see a different one you can see the difference in characterization that she's able to give them. She honestly deserves to win the Emmy at this point, and I truly hope she gets the nomination. Still, the first season of this sort of reminds me of other shows' first seasons where the quality takes a drastic downturn.

1485,Orphan Black, Would Like to See Multiple Emmy's For Orphan Black,"I do not recall ever being as captivated by a television program as I have been by Orphan Black. It is a masterpiece among the science fiction genre; with dialogue as good as any dramatic program. I enjoy watching scenes shared by more than one of the clones played by actress Tatiana Maslany. Each has very unique mannerisms, vocabularies, accents, confidence levels, etc. The personalities among the clones are vast, from the orphaned Brit Sarah, to the psycho-killer Helena. Other clones include: the repressed suburbanite Allison; the dread-locked PhD student Cosima, the drab cop Beth and still others. For a young actress (28), Ms. Maslany ranks in my estimation with acting greats such as Helen Mirren and other classically trained actors with extensive, big theater experience. It is noteworthy how the egos of the clones have been shaped by nurture (or lack thereof) more predominantly than by nature. For example, Cosima is self-confident; with a beautiful countenance that radiates from within. Helena is at the other end of the spectrum, with ugliness that is equally staggering, and facial expressions that reveal her instability. With each of the clones being from different walks of life, the supporting characters in their lives also bring tremendous breadth to the story. This might seem a bit messy, but they manage to make it work seamlessly in the context of a great story, with direction and acting unsurpassed in former years of television. In the 19th century, Robert Louis Stevenson broke ground introducing us to an unfamiliar dichotomy with the characters Doctor Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde. That story has always intrigued me, but Graeme Manson and John Fawcett transcended that duality to a degree without label, except perhaps, 'multi-faceted.' If you shun most science fiction as too incredible, requiring viewers to put reason on hold, I am pleased to report that although Orphan Black breaks novel ground, it manages without an affront on your intellectual capacity. I recently spoke to a friend who has not watched British programming since Benny Hill originally aired on his 13 inch Black &amp; White. If you haven't watched the BBC in recent years, they have a tremendous line-up. They have become known for having clever programming with exceptional casts. Though when all of the actors appear as brilliant as in Orphan Black,credit must be given to the direction from the top. I would sincerely like to see actress Tatiana Maslany, supporting actor Jordan Gavaris,who plays Sarah's eccentric brother Felix, and Executive Producer/Co-Creator/Co-Writer/Co-Director John Fawcett receive Emmy awards for their work on this premier season.<br/><br/>A warning: someone wrote that it was offensive; while another denounced it entirely. Those fearful that sparse nudity may drive a person into utter depravity, or those that believe the BBC permits some vocabulary so vulgar that it has the capacity to corrupt a soul,may find this program to be too European for their tastes. Personally, I would have no problem with my grandchild watching.",53 out of 83 found this helpful.,10.0,12 May 2013

The characters are amazingly well written and completely distinct from each other, but each is acted beautifully, and each complement each other so well that they are each part of the puzzle. Down to the last shot, each is set up and beautifully filmed to the tiniest detail. As this season goes on, the show has not become stale, and each episode provides tiny bits and pieces to add to the whole story.

1494,Orphan Black, Absolutely Brilliant,"A show about clones, seems like an overdone theme in sci-fi, so what does Orphan Black offer that trumps all other stories of a similar nature? Two words. Tatiana Maslany. If you aren't a fan of sci-fi, but appreciate exquisite acting, then I highly recommend giving this show a chance. Whatever TV awards are out there, Critic's Choice, Emmys (albeit the Emmys are incredibly biased against genre specific shows), Golden Globes - anything and all should DESERVEDLY head Maslany's way. <br/><br/>Not only is Orphan Black well written, serving up some of the best performances on TV of late (I'll be remiss not too mention Jordan Gavaris' amazing portrayal of Felix), it provides an unflinching look into the human mind, posing the fundamental Nature vs Nurture question, among many others. <br/><br/>Maslany's performance can entirely capture the audience, in every little nuance,from a character's nervous ticks to their ferocious defence of loved ones, but the most astonishing thing about it is possibly when she plays a character playing another character. It's simply mindbogglingly brilliant. She manages to completely engross the viewer with such distinct individuals, that you are forgiven for forgetting its one person.<br/><br/>10 out of 10.

1495,Orphan Black," Regardless of the storyline, this show is a masterpiece.","I have to say that I wasn't immediately sucked into the storyline when I started this show; the thing that really pulled me in was the acting. Tatiana Maslany is an INSANELY talented actress. You actually forget sometimes that it's the same actress playing however many roles - that's how good she is. Each clone has a completely different set of mannerisms, and their speech, habits, language, and accents are all distinct.<br/><br/>And when one clone is impersonating another, there are subtle nuances in the acting that blow me away every time. For example, when Sarah is taking Beth's place, you can hear little bits in her speech where the American accent falters ever-so-slightly. When Allison is covering Sarah, you can see the point where her posture completely shifts. It's nuts.<br/><br/>I pride myself on being able to spot a phony accent, but I genuinely couldn't pinpoint where Maslany was originally from wthout having to look it up.<br/><br/>If anything, watch this show for the acting prowess. It's brilliant to watch. The CGI split-screen effects aren't forced at all; you can still pick out where the line was drawn in the shots if you look hard enough, but to the untrained eye, it's truly seamless.<br/><br/>The story can seem a bit convoluted at times, but to those of us who like a bit of scientific mystery, this show is great.<br/><br/>Seriously though. The main plus here is the stellar acting on Maslany's part. I'm glad to see that she's won awards for this role.

Margo's besotted face is a delight, Leslie's imperialist stomping around with guns and suitable opaque wit is a hoot, Larry's fey artist trip just sucks you in and gets you ready for the 'Quartet', Mrs Durrell is like a real Mary Poppins and Gerry (well he, sacrilegiously, is the weak link for me, I don't really care about the animals).

1500,The Durrells," Lovely, Quirky Show","I really enjoyed this first season and am baffled by the bad reviews. A few people actually seem angry. This is a very charming show set in 1935 about a family who move to Corfu from England. A widowed mother with four children, all trying to grow up and find their way not only in new culture but as teenagers discovering themselves. The youngest, Gerry, is a love with his big heart for all kinds of animals, as he tries to rescue, home them, love them and learn from them. It's really a shame that some reviewers find him self centered for he is the least self centered of all the children. The island is beautiful, the characters (including the wonderful Leslie Caron) are quirky and real all at the same time. All of life comes to play in this series. I plan to watch it again and hope for a second season. It's an adventure of life, family, evolving, friendship, love and nature.

1503,The Durrells, A different perspective on the story,"Like many others, I repeatedly devoured the books by Gerald Durrell as a child, especially the Corfu trilogy, and was very sad to discover that the author passed away in my late teens. I also read some of Larry Durrell's writing and watched a documentary ""Gerald Durrell in Russia"", however I did not see the 1987 TV show (nor the 2015 movie). I am not English, so the Durrellian universe was much smaller in my reality of a post-soviet CEE country; nevertheless I regard it a vital part of my growing up and it brightened many a day back then. So I was really happy when I stumbled upon the TV show on the Durrell's tonight, keen on being reunited with little Garry, mercurial Les, Larry the intellectualist, girly Margo and all the other strange, goofy and dear characters roaming the emerald Greek island . I understand that expectations are high when it comes to childhood favorite reads and after the first episode it's pretty safe to say the show did not overwhelm me either, but I really enjoyed the different perspective on the adventures and struggles of this eccentric family I feel I know almost like my own.<br/><br/>While in the books you watch the family story through the eyes of a young boy keen on nature, in this show it's the grown-up perspective of a mother trying to survive with 4 intense teenagers on a beautiful yet unfamiliar island with no electricity, little money and very basic language skills. It's not all blue skies, sparkling green see, dazzling sun and the perpetual summer holidays feeling the books enchant you with. But watching the show, it's easy to imagine the small and bigger dramas behind Gerald Durrell's lighthearted and funny family portrait, making it a more real and less funny account. The show seems to unravel in a somewhat bumpy and chaotic way, with some originally hilarious scenes becoming more awkward than funny and I can't help the feeling the actors are neither able to play to their full capacity nor do they seem to harmonize with each other particularly well. But slowly the familiar feeling seeps in and the moment you see young Gerry's (Milo Parker) bright eyes widen up in thrill with some odd wildlife, you know you will want to watch the next episode.

1504,The Durrells, A nice Masterpiece,"There has been substantial criticism of this series' failure to accurately portray the source material about the Durrells. Not having read the books, I cannot use them as a comparison. So I am judging on the series itself, and comparing it to other presentations of more modern material on Masterpiece. In that light, I have thoroughly enjoyed it. The actors, especially those portraying the children bring real spirit to the four quirky kids. The photography captures the brightness of Corfu, the sky and sea are brilliant blue. The countryside captures the rustic life of the 1930's. The animals add a realistic and fun realism to the family's life. Is it the best Masterpiece ever? No, because the story doesn't lend itself to high adventure and suspense. But it is an enjoyable series that kept me interested in the family's story.",32 out of 39 found this helpful.,8.0,23 November 2016

Period stuff even more. Yet this is nice to watch. They are a nice family and get on most of the time. They occasionally fall out. They don't spend their time trying to get one over each other or others. There is little swearing and sex (no nudity other than the odd bare shoulder). It is just a nice program to watch. <br/><br/>I have never read the books and never would.

1506,The Durrells, Not My Family and Other Animals,"Louise Durrell, still missing her late husband and in financial straits, moves her family from dismal Bournemouth to the Greek island of Corfu. It is 1935, the world unaware of the calamity over the horizon, Corfu is sunny, easygoing, and cheap. The oldest son is Larry, an as yet unpublished writer. He is tall, clever, and witty, rather like a young Jonathan Miller. The next is Leslie, a bit dim and with a fetish for firearms. Margo is a tempestuous girl impatient to grow up. The youngest is Jerry, fascinated by wildlife and liable to bring it home with him. Add to the mix Spiros, taxi driver, protector, and general fixer, Dr Theo, also a naturalist, the enigmatic Sven, and Lugaretzia the housekeeper. These contrasting characters are well drawn, and well cast, the acting is fluid and convincing. Although this is essentially a comedy, nothing is played for laughs, the viewer must pay attention to get the full flavour of events. The standout performance is that of Milo Parker as Jerry. Milo oozes character, convincing as the intense and focused future renowned naturalist and author. The episodes follow on from each other, but are mostly self-contained. While certain themes recur, each story is unique. With only the years 1935 to 1939 available, The Durrells will never become a franchise, though a second series is on the way. Many years later Gerald Durrell described these years in My Family and Other Animals and two sequels. As the foreword admits, his brothers and sister remembered things differently, and the books are not historically accurate. My Family has been twice adapted for television, under that title, but The Durrells is not a third, though obviously it borrows the characters and situation. It is many years since I read My Family, some of the stories look familiar, but the writers have mined, rather than adapted, the material. It is probable that they have referred to Lawrence and Margo's writings. What we see on the screen is not an accurate account. For instance Larry was already married to Nancy and they lived in a separate house, Margo was eighteen, here she seems much younger. Lawrence was actually noticeably short. But I'm not complaining, this is a fictional evocation, not a dramatised documentary. Lawrence is portrayed much, I suspect, as he would have liked to see himself, and Keeley Hawes does a lovely job as the harassed, hopeful, scatty Louise. Gerald went on to fame and fortune, his books must have outsold those of his upmarket big brother many times over. Leslie, I read once, became a professional big game hunter in Africa. Margo lead a more interesting life than most of us. Louise never did re-marry. But who knows what the scriptwriters have in store for her? Many of the disappointed reviewers here are fans of Gerald's books who wanted a straight dramatisation of them. I am a long time fan of Lawrence's books, if not of the man, so I don't come to the series with the same preoccupations. So forget for the moment everything you've read, and enjoy the ride. Then if you haven't already, go out and read both Gerald and Lawrence.",28 out of 35 found this helpful.,7.0,17 September 2016
1507,The Durrells, Idiots that grow on you.,"I only read one Durrell's book an it is not from the Corfu trilogy, so I was not familiar with it. On the first watch it was painful to see how obnoxious and stupid those children are. They started to live in the house with no water and electricity which is falling apart, with no money and most of the time without the proper food, and they are no help at all. Just concerned on their own selfish interests. I don't know if this is done for the comic effect or it is described like this in the books, but it was really annoying to watch. Fortunately series does have some charms and actors are good in portraying idiots in unusual situations in foreign country so I have stuck to it and after fourth episode I have learned to love it. As they adjusted more to the life on Corfu it became much easier to watch they predicaments and strange reactions and eventually they grow somehow on you.

Honestly this is the best thing to watch on a Sunday night with the family. Although it doesn't strictly follow the books accurately, and as a fan of the books that could of irritated me, however I thought the greater depth in which it explored the character was wonderful and made for great TV. The actors have a genuinely convincing chemistry that makes it even more enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this to everyone of all ages.

1510,The Durrells, Splendid but loosely adapted TV series based on Corfu trilogy,"It is positively mind-boggling that there are so many negative reviews of this delightful adaptation of Durrell's equally delightful books (just finishing up the trilogy), and that so many of them come from Australian viewers.<br/><br/>Yes, the adapters took liberties with Durrell's books. For instance, Sven, who plays such an integral part in the 1st series, is homosexual, but he doesn't live on Corfu in BIRDS, BEASTS, AND RELATIVES. He's one of Larry's many eccentric friends who come to stay briefly, his story over in about 5-6 pages. Gerry describes him as bald and ugly, and Luise certainly never had a relationship with him. <br/><br/>But what really puzzles me is the hostile attitude of so many reviewers toward the Durrell siblings. Leslie, Margo and Larry were all young men and women by the time they arrived on Corfu with their mother, so why anyone should be surprised they were often less than thrilled (even Larry, who seldom has a kind word for his English homeland) to leave their old lives behind for a new life in a foreign land is beyond me. I experienced it a couple of times growing up, and it takes some getting used to. They're young and going through a period of adjustment. Their bouts of moodiness and often bratty behavior come with the territory. <br/><br/>In any case, that's the way they comported themselves in the books. Larry was a bit of a libertine, Leslie an angry young man who still missed his late father, Margo boy-crazy and a bit dim, and Gerry obsessed with his nature studies. <br/><br/>The series isn't completely faithful to its source material, but so what? It captures the spirit of Durrell's books just fine. Hating it for not adhering faithfully to them is just silly.",22 out of 28 found this helpful.,10.0,10 May 2017
1511,The Durrells," Actually enjoying a ""basoned on the books by..."" series","I've read the Corfu trilogy written by Gerry. It was a wonderful series of books. Normally I don't much like a movie or tv series ""based on"" on the books. They tend to lose the nuance and feeling of reading the entire narrative. In this series (I'm only on season 1), I feel like they've captured the characters AND are giving us what we missed in the books: a more adult perspective. When reading, I really wanted to know more about the mother and siblings and the series adeptly takes on the challenge. It's like being able to find out so much more of what happens to your favorite characters. Highly recommend.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,27 February 2019
1512,The Durrells," It is not 100% following the book, and I love it!","Gerrald Durrell's Corfu trilogy is the most influencial book of my childhood, which helped me to refine my interests and pursue a conservation career . I must have read each book at least 15 times. As a young naturalist myself, I felt connected with the animal stories and I felt I am not alone in my passion. You can imagine, I did not care too much about the other characters. Just recently I re-read part of one book and I found it full with humor and cheesy stories, that I totaly missed out as a child. So now when I started watching the series I am delighted to find out more about the whole family and not just little Jerry. I love that the Mother is presented as a younger (than I imagined) and capable woman. I love the Margo character. And Lesley is looking just the way I imagined him. And it is really refreshing to give a bit of happiness and romance to the Mother (something that was not in the book). I think I am ready even to start reading Larry's books.

1514,The Durrells, I sooo want this to be good...,"I'm nuts about anything Greek, and I'm trying my best with this series- but I'm struggling.
Firstly the 'children' are completely off-putting(apart from the youngest - Gerry- who is yet to develop an 'attitude') I can't warm to any of the others.
It's the 1930's- yet the children consistently refer to their mother as not having enough sex - and other over-sexualised comments - really?
Again- it's the 1930s -and almost all the islanders they talk to have a good grasp of English. Really?
I go to Greece regularly- and even In 2019 it's unusual to find anyone over 50 who speaks English.
The supposed humour is, well, poor and tiresome. I'm 4 episodes in and genuinely haven't laughed - the only reason I continue with it is I'm hoping it gets better.
The island setting with the Greek backstory is the only reason I'm sticking with this.

1515,The Durrells, Enjoyable adventure,"OK, this is not a true TV adaptation of the book by Gerald Durrell which I read 10 years ago. There are lots of things that make me cringe. The middle son kissing a Greek girl in public... the way the children behave towards their mother... the daughter sunning herself in front of a monastery... the courtroom based on an American courtroom layout. However, if one takes a step back and forgets about the book and looks at it as an entity on its own, it is not too bad. I like the acting and the script has its funny moments that make me laugh out loud. I read some other reviews which were scathing and thought they were unfair to the actors. The actors do not decide how to act - the director tells them how he wants them to play their parts. So if the director wants hysterical, they have to portray hysterical; if he says 'sweet and naive', Gerry has to be sweet and naive. I think we should allow people to watch the series and make up their own mind.

1517,The Durrells, Now I know why tigers eat their young,"As a parent, I find this series to be a horror show. I began watching it because I absolutely adore Keeley Hawes, and I have always delighted in her countless, fabulous performances. I had hoped to enjoy a faithful rendition of the books, but was horrified by the way the children were portrayed as entitled wasters who refused, in the most impolite fashion, to help their widowed mother who was willing to uproot her entire life and move to Corfu in order to save them from a life of poverty in England. Considering how disgustingly the children behave, I can only assume that she has overindulged these monsters since day one. I detest them all, and they manifest the most hated stereotypical behavior of English speaking people, expecting all cultures to adapt to the English language and customs, even when those people are in their own countries. That being said, due to the location, the cinematic quality and the outstanding performances of the supporting cast - who doesn't still love Leslie Caron (the enchanting ""Gigi"" of my youth) as the darling Countess Mavrodak? Anna Savaa (Lugaretzia), Alexis Georgoulis (Spiros Halikiopoulos), Yorgos Karamhios (Theo Stephanides)are outstanding actors and create adorable characters. I have now finished episode 4, and my disgust with the members of the entire Durrell family is beginning to subside. For some unknown reason, the brats have suddenly become aware that their mother would do anything in the world to bring them happiness. So, if you can make it to episode 4, the series may improve enough to be a worthwhile expenditure of your viewing time.",39 out of 67 found this helpful.,6.0,26 April 2016
1518,The Durrells, It's Entertainment NOT Real life,"This show is based on the childhood memories of Gerald Durrell, written up later as novels.<br/><br/>In viewing this programme we have to bare in mind, how accurate can a child be in their recollection of times passed. They tend to view their existence through a prism shaped by their experiences.<br/><br/>My knowledge of Gerald Durrell. is through his book My family and other animals, or more accurately others ideas of it. And of his zoo in Jersey which I finally saw for myself much later in my life. The zoo was an attempt at the preservation of endangered animal species.<br/><br/>I watched and enjoyed this as escapist television entertainment, and will continue to do so as its great fun, well scripted, cast and acted in idyllic locations. I find it a good way to whittle away an hour per each episode, its a great ensemble piece of TV, the cast is perfectly matched gelling well together as a totally believable family unit.<br/><br/>Yes they are bratty its to be expected given the family circumstances, dad dying and the mum dislocating the family to up sticks and move abroad. The kids are spoilt precocious and awkward, given far too much latitude by a mum, who cares a bit to much for her offsprings for their own good.<br/><br/>From watching this I get a different view of Gerald Durrell, he should never have have been allowed to keep wild animals as pets, and definitely not in the family home.

Virtually nothing that happens in the series was in the books, but what they did is bring all the modern agenda into it, from feminism to gays, you should (not) hear how they speak on those subjects - in the 1930s! And as some reviewers already mentioned, everybody is obsessed wit sex. The way the Greek are portrayed is simply offensive. The acting is bland, the dialogues are awful, and the whole script is just plain stupid. It takes a special evil talent to turn such warm, charming, funny books into this pile of garbage.

1520,The Durrells, Fun and amusing but not a patch on the book,"This bears no resemblance to the book. 1930s Greece has had contemporary mores imposed upon it.

I'm of a generation of Englishmen who wouldn't use that word (it's modern American. Even I know this!) never mind those of us from the 1930s. All that said, it is nevertheless entertaining and amusing at times, if one can also get over the patronising portrayal of the locals. The book is a far superior work. If you don't like this series, don't let that put you off the book. The book did not need modernising. Lazy, sloppy scriptwriters with no grasp of history.

1522,Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet, Wtf was that 5th episode?!,"Overall the show is about a 6.75/10, worth a watch but kind of all over the place in tone. It takes a break for the 5th episode though with an entirely different cast (Jake Johnson, etc) to tell a totally different, unrelated story over 20 years and that episode alone was a solid 9/10.<br/><br/>Why didn't they make that the show and stick with that tone?! It was directed by Rob and written by his sister Katie, so it's not like it was an outside team pulled in to do one episode, and it was amazing, and also very serious unlike the goofy, sitcom vibe of the show. The regular show is entertaining enough, but this story had me invested from the opening scene, reminded me a lot of Halt &amp; Catch Fire. Anyway I would say the show is worth a watch but if you don't have the time just watch episode 5 as a stand-alone.",84 out of 140 found this helpful.,6.0,8 February 2020
1523,Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet, I am not believing any of the 10 star reviews here...,"It says something about the show that the most highly reviewed and enjoyed episode is an episode (ep 5) that takes place completely outside the actors/story/timeline of the first four episodes. It also says something that the show is supposed to be a comedy, and that same highly reviewed/enjoyed episode is basically drama with very little comedy. When the turn to drama is appreciated much, much more than your comedic episodes, a show runner should wonder if they need to regroup on how to inject more funny each episode.<br/><br/>Ok - now for a positive about the show? Actress Charlotte Nicdao (plays Poppy) is someone I had never heard of and she is clearly the best performer of the whole bunch. In some respects, she carries the show.<br/><br/>The show is trying to be everything to everyone. It tries hard not to be offensive, but it wants to substitute anything that would resemble incisive or edgy comedy with an amping up reactions and volume. So much so it almost feels like they should be piping in a laugh track at times. I am not exaggerating.<br/><br/>It wants to be ""fair"" to all the women, and it does the classic men-are-idiots and women have to suffer because of it. But, it goes further with an especially bizarre subplot that is shoehorned into an early episode where the two female game testers have some ""Home Alone"" lesbian dating sequence/montage when they realize everyone has left the building for the night. I reference ""Home Alone"" because they act like 10 year olds would act and it actually *is* a montage of whacky shenanigans, not two grown women that I presume have apartments and cars...refrigerators with food.<br/><br/>This subplot is rushed into, lingered on for minutes, and then kind of disappears - which is what makes it bizarre. It would have been just about as bizarre (if not even more so) if the two game testers were hetero male and female and did this weird late night ""Home Alone"" sequence complete with raided refrigerators, stolen ice cream, motor scooting around the office, graffiti on walls...etc.<br/><br/>Again, before someone cries ""foul"" - it's not the concept of a possible workplace romance between two women that is weird, the show itself makes it weird and self-conscious.<br/><br/>The inevitable comparison to ""Silicon Valley"" isn't fair. That show was grounded in a recognizable reality, while this show wants to play as broad comedy...the problem the show has is a problem that seems to plague most TV comedy recently: Nothing is interesting, nothing is surprising, characters and their choices don't illicit any response because they aren't really characters so much as mouthpieces that say things loudly that others react to with shock, disbelief, faux outrage.<br/><br/>There are a lot of ""whacky situations"" where the characters are supposed to be embarrassed and they stammer and they appear flustered. The problem is that none of what is happening to the characters rises to the level of us feeling embarrassed for them. It feels like I am watching a TV show that is trying to imitate an older and no longer airing TV show about similar material, but doing so only by vague memory.<br/><br/>The gaming/game development aspect of the show is treated as an afterthought. We don't get to see much of the game, we just know they want us to care about this game. I can't care for something that no one in the actual show seems to care about, much less care about something I barely see.<br/><br/>There was one moment where I thought the show was finding its comedic footing and this was an episode where they discover an enclave of white-supremacy types gathering inside their game world. To flush them out and identify them Ian decides what the game needs is some more Nazi symbology to attract them - thus making it easier to identify the in-game players they need to get rid of. This joke about actually adding Nazi symbology to a game could have stretched past one episode because of all the places you could take it - while still, obviously, condemning that movement and ideology. The episode was fairly amusing as it played out, but this was just one episode.<br/><br/>This show feels like they want a ""Community"" vibe, but ""Community"" had a degree of edge to it and this show wants to occupy this warm middle area that is flat, easy and safe. I am wondering if Apple, one of the few companies that actually tries to pay lip service to morality and ethics, is simply not going to be the place for comedy other than the safe/bland model. I can't imagine them (irony) greenlighting an ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" or a Dave Attell comedy special or even a ""30 Rock"". Those shows are too fast, too unsafe. Sadly, this show is both too slow and too safe.",47 out of 82 found this helpful.,5.0,20 February 2020

This show looks at the insane ego a person in these positions can get, and how they are willing to sacrifice their employees work conditions to get the results that they want. I'm a huge IASIP fan so I'm familiar with the humor they usually go for. The idea of a video game company isn't something we have never seen before, but every other time it's used as a gimmick without actually knowing how games work. In no way is this a perfect show, but, this is a pretty intelligent show. It's almost to gaming, what Silicon Valley is to tech companies.

There is a trend in US comedies to think that putting a bunch of people with loud voices and strong opinions in one room, constitutes good comedy. It does not. I think it stems from the popularity of Seinfeld, where the plot involves making mountains out of molehills. But unlike Seinfeld, this is not well written.

Also this is written before Season 2.<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>As I said, Danny Pudi and Rob McElhenney are great, even though the writing could be better they are charming and funny enough to steal the show with what they're working with. John DiMaggio is great whenever he appears. The character 'Sue' has a tiny role but is in general very funny.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>Poppy Li is not a good character generally but she has her moments. 'Jo', Ian's assistant has funny moments but can get pretty annoying pretty quick. The boss, 'David' is conceptally funny as a de jure boss with no real power but unfortunately this concept is underutilized and he does very little in the show.<br/><br/>The ugly:<br/><br/>The testers are the worst, most uninteresting, one-note, pootly written characters I have seen in a long, long time. Hopefully we see less of them or none at all in the future. I do not even see any potential of them being interesting, they are just boring.<br/><br/>The writing is mediocre throughout, with most of the jokes falling flat unless Pudi or McElhenney delivers them, but even that has exceptions. I do not care about any of the characters except the aforementioned two. The interactions between the characters feel fake and contrived. For the show to ever reach its true potential and justify its talented cast the writing needs to get better. Right now the weakest points of the show is the writing and the testers.

1546,Top Gear, Hands down the greatest show about cars in the world.,"Top Gear is, without question, the single greatest show about cars on TV. What sets Top Gear apart is the attitude the presenters have. Other shows tend focus on reviewing all of the various technical details and specifications of the particular car they review... They'll give you more information yes, but they do so in a cold and clinical manner. That comes off as being a bit, well, German doesn't it? Top Gear on the other hand, refuses to take itself seriously, which is what makes it so great. Sure, Top Gear will talk about how many newton meters of torque the Mercedes AMG CLS65 has and how that makes it the most powerful production car in the world, but how will they convey that? By showing you just how many men it requires to beat it in a tug of war contest. They'll try to explain why the Cadillac Escalade, arguably one of the worst cars you can buy, is one of the coolest. They'll see how many motorcycles you can jump with a bus. Yes, you read that the right way 'round: How many parked motorcycles you can jump over while driving a bus.<br/><br/>But Top Gear is more than just goofing around in cars. It's witty, it's funny, and it makes you feel like one of the guys. The three presenters all poke fun at one another, at cars, at themselves, and all the while you feel like you are right there in the studio hanging out with them. Oh yeah, and you don't even have to like cars to like the show. There's something in it for everyone. For sheer car freaks, the filmed review segments of the cars have seriously high production value- You'd think you were watching a $150 million dollar film directed by Michael Bay. The are just that slick. The music selection used in the filmed segments is also top notch, with some of the coolest cuts from both then and now. The news segment, where the presenters sit down to discuss what's new in the world of cars, traffic laws, or motoring in general is riotously funny. You may not know who the Chief Constable of Wales or the British Minister of Transporation are, but trust me- You don't need to in order to laugh at them. Then there's the ""Star in a Reasonably Priced Car"" segment, where each week a guest celebrity will come on to do an interview and then race around the Top Gear test track in a budget priced sedan to see how they compare to other famous celebrities who have done the same. And for the girls that tune in? Well, there's co-host Richard Hammond.<br/><br/>It is the presenters (hosts) that make the show though. You'll love to hate Jeremy Clarkson, possibly the worlds most opinionated and boastful man. James May, in sharp contrast, is almost a stereotype of an English gentleman. Reserved, witty, and refusing to run on television, May is cursed with quite possibly the best narrative style and voice I've ever heard. Bringing up the rear is Richard Hammond, the youngest, shortest, and most enthusiastic of the lot. Women will love him, because he's also the cutest.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to mention their tamed racing driver who tests all of the high powered cars on the same track to see how they compare to one another, a mysterious creature dressed in white that is only known as ""The Stig"". Well, apart from that mention of The Stig. I won't do it any more.<br/><br/>But please, please please, make sure you watch the full, unedited, hour-long version of Top Gear, which in some markets is known as ""Top Gear Xtra"". There is a trimmed down 30 minute version of the show which omits the news, the celebrities, and trims the filmed reviews for time. It's still good, but nowhere near as brilliant. And avoid the horribly edited and mangled US version of the show. Arguably the best Car show on in the states, it is an affront to the glory that is the raw, hour long series that is broadcast in the UK.",232 out of 254 found this helpful.,,6 July 2005
1547,Top Gear," Simply the Best Television Program and DVD Series Devoted to Automobiles, Ever","As an American, your selection of automotive programming is quite limited. On one hand there is the SPEED Channel that is not available in every market, and on the other there is the ""Powerblock"" on Spike TV that offers little more than how to add a bit of power to your Grandmother's '81 Caprice.<br/><br/>Even as an import, Top Gear simply blew my mind away during my first viewing of the show last year when The Discovery Channel ran a season of the show slightly altered for the US Market.<br/><br/>For one, the personality of the show is unlike anything I have seen before. The show's lead host, Mr. Jeremy Clarkson is rather opinionated on everything, and although he will never hide the fact that he does not like something, he himself is quite likable as a person. On the opposite side of the spectrum, there is Mr. James May, quite possibly the most British man I have ever seen on television or in the movies. He isn't offensive in any way, and although he may be known as ""captian slow,"" his presentations are quite enjoyable as they always seem to come from someone with a level head. Caught in the middle is Mr. Richard Hammond, a rather young Briton who embodies the current generation of automotive fandom. All together, the hosts balance each other out, and each offer their own perspective to the show, appealing to a wide range of people.<br/><br/>Outside of the ""acting,"" the cinematography of the show is breathtaking, given that it is a weekly event in the UK. Occasionally the segments rival that of some of the best television shows or movies that I have seen, and although they are primarily focused on the car and the hosts themselves, the surrounding environment often plays a large role in the different reviews.<br/><br/>...But then you add the great soundtracks of the reviews, the quirky setups to the different tests (such as a Bugatti Veyron racing a plane from Italy to England), and the great test laps done by the Stig... It all adds up to one of the greatest television programs, well, ever.<br/><br/>It truly is a shame that the viewing of Top Gear is generally limited to the internet via You Tube or Google Video here in the US, but there was a pilot filmed for The Discovery Channel in the US for an American version of Top Gear, but thus far, nothing has happened.<br/><br/>If you have the time, I highly suggest you take a look at the show, interested in automobiles or not.",176 out of 194 found this helpful.,10.0,12 June 2006
1548,Top Gear, You don't even have to like cars....,"Yes, this show is about cars, but then again it isn't. Mostly it's about extremes of opinion, dreams and fantasies, dares, one-up-man-ship, and taking everything just a little bit further. And it's also entertaining - very entertaining, which is what television is meant to be, and so often is not. I'm not all that interested in cars, and my son doesn't even drive, but we both love the show, and watch it religiously.<br/><br/>The balance of presenters: Jeremy, the loud-mouthed, cuttingly funny, over-bearing older guy; Richard, the young, cute, quirky, adolescent one; James, the sensitive, quiet, contemplative, intelligent one; is nothing short of genius!<br/><br/>It seems that no expense is spared, either on the experiments and dares, or on filming, and this adds to the visual experience. This show is funny, even hilarious at times, classy, controversial, and hugely entertaining.

1550,Top Gear, Worth every penny the BBC invests.,"While it can be argued that more substantial programmes exist, whether fictional or not, it is certain that Top Gear is an extraordinarily entertaining show with plenty to keep most on their bolsters. This is certainly due to the faithful backing of the BBC, but more importantly, to the three crazed bloody lunatics who host the series. Clarkson, May and Hammond share between each other many decades worth of experience in broadcasting, as well as motoring, and are impeccable contrasts well matched for their respective opinions 'n roles. The various features included in the shows and the involvement in these &amp; all motoring matters, are exemplary, and quite frankly, unmatched by anything television has yet seen.

1551,Top Gear, The best show on TV just keep getting better...,"I've been watching this show for over 7 years now and I have to say it just keeps getting better. Many people spit and shout about the show not being about cars and more of an entertainment show than a car show. Well firstly let me say that this show began in 1978and went on for 12 seasons and the one complaint about that show was that it was boring and Clarkson picked up on this and changed the show (in my view) for the better.<br/><br/>What is it about the show that makes it so outrageously good? Well lets discuss the characters. Jeremy Clarkson - the man you wish was your friend. A sarcastic, cheeky and rude individual who is hilariously funny. His ideas are genius and he is not afraid to speak his mind - that is what i like most about him. He does not and will not lie and say a car is good and/or bad on bias alone in which many people think he does. Take Alfa's for instance, he loves them, but he will not sugar coat what he knows about the electrics in the car you just have to actually listen to what he says. Richard Hammond - The quirky one. Tends to be more positive about things but my god he is funny. His outrageous ideas and creations like his Narrow boat are fantastic. He is critical when reviewing, yet entertaining when necessary. James May (Captain Slow) - You have to love him really. He is a more precise critic on cars but tend to take, Unfortunately for him, more boring cars like 4 door saloons but in recent episodes we have seen him show his true colours and passion for cars by taking the Veyron up to top speed twice. <br/><br/>You have to remember that this is no the reason why this show is still a highly rated show 8 years on is not just because of these 3 personalities. When Clarkson was asked why is this show so great he gave FULL responsibility to the camera crews (who do absolutely stunning wok and should set a benchmark for cameramen around the world), the producers (who supposedly stay in work until 2am working) and all the back-room staff that organise everything.<br/><br/>You have to remember that these people have a passion for cars. Anyone who loves cars and has that inner child inside which allows for that bit of fun would realise that this truly is one of the best shows on modern TV and always will be. It is also every 10 year old dream job and also mine!",74 out of 82 found this helpful.,10.0,28 July 2010

I totally recommend watching if it is from before 2016. Why put an unfunny American on this show when there is already an unfunny American Top Gear, and still I, being American, choose to watch the much better Top Gear UK? Plus to replace 3 super attractive, hilarious men with 2 losers is a dumb idea if you want your show to be successful. Or at least remain on air.

1555,Top Gear, This is one of the most well made stylish shows on TV.,"Let me say that this is easily my favorite show on TV...ever. It's not just because I am a huge ""petrol head"" automobile fan either. More importantly, each episode is so finely crafted. The cinematography, music, commentary and choice of subject matter is second to none.<br/><br/>Top Gear could have easily just shot a car sitting on some asphalt and talked about it. Instead, they use all types of lens filters to color shots, cloud part of the shot, etc. They use high speed cameras to show a tire spinning in slow motion with the smoke wafting off the pavement. They take shots from helicopters high above through patchy cloud cover as a car cruises down a winding race track. Every shot is beautifully executed.<br/><br/>This camera work would be beautiful alone, but it has been paired with a fantastic soundtrack. Every song is picked to illustrate some sort of emotion. For instance, the main presenter, Jeremy Clarkson is driving his beautiful Aston Martin DB9 through the French countryside and he begins to speak about the beauty of the car and how it is like no other driving experience. It is his favorite car. As he is talking, the sun is setting and they use a soft filter on the camera with an amber tint. To top it all off they play Massive Attack's ""Heat Miser"". If you know this song it is a slow, warm, almost sad mixture of simple piano key notes and deep string instruments. It fits perfectly and really conveys the emotion of the moment. I can't stress enough how NO show on TV would even think of using songs from little known artists like Massive Attack. I could go forever but just know that they play punk, classic rock, new wave, classical, hip-hop and obscure UK electronic...and it all fits beautifully. Producers of TV and even movies should get some guts and learn that we know this music and it has a huge impact on the depth of a show.<br/><br/>With all of this fine camera work and music as a backdrop comes some great commentary from the 3 presenters. Jeremy Clarkson (the older know it all), Richard Hammond (the young wild one), and James May (the conservative middle age guy) combine to bounce intelligent and very opinionated commentary off each other. This is all mostly scripted, but they do it in a natural way. It all comes off as fun and off the cuff. They don't pull punches either. They regularly attack the government officials, protest groups, auto execs, and other countries. It is great to see a show that is not afraid to say whatever it wants without fear of offending.<br/><br/>Lastly, the choice of cars is fantastic. If you watch this show, likely you have some interest in cars (you don't have to...it's great entertainment). If you do, you'll appreciate how they pick everything from exotic supercars to econo boxes. They pick not only the obvious in each car class, but also some lesser known and interesting cars as well. Vehicles from all over the world are put to the test. I really love the fact that they pick some wildly expensive exotics and some extremely valuable collectors cars and actually drive them hard. Car shows usually show you these valuable cars, but then drive them slowly around because they are afraid of damaging them. Top Gear does a fantastic job of keeping the car reviews interesting. Want to see how fast a Ferrari 612 Scaglietti is? Well, lets put Jeremy in it and race it against a passenger jet carrying Hammond and Mays from London to Switzerland. How agile and fast is a Mitsubishi Evo? Let's put a champion rally racer in it and race it down a snowy mountain road against a championship bobsled team on a equal length chute. It's ideas like this that have kept this show fresh for so long. <br/><br/>There are many more aspects of this show I could talk about (ie. The Stig, Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car, the news, etc) but I am being a freak. I will end by telling you that the Discovery Channel has already aired a number of ""edited for the USA"" UK original episodes here in the States. They were chopped up and lost a lot of their flow and character. I was thrilled to see that Americans could get a chance to see this show. I was disappointed in Discovery for editing out a lot of the British slang, foreign cars, and worst of all the fun jabs at American culture. Are we Americans that sensitive that we can't handle pokes at our weight, love of anything big, gas guzzlers, and that our auto industry is falling behind? Are these secrets? Apparently Discovery execs think so. Well, Top Gear has announced they are making in conjunction with Discovery Channel a ""Top Gear USA"". They have said that the UK test run on Discovery was well received but (in their infinite wisdom) they think that a new USA version will go over better here. They have pulled the edited UK originals from Discovery and have already started shooting the new Top Gear USA. It is complete with a new trio of hosts, their own test track, and the Stig from the UK show. The biggest differences will most likely be no studio audience, only cars that we've heard of here, and a lot more US made cars. If you ask me this is a huge mistake. This show works as it is. Everyone I know here in the US that watches the unedited originals loves it. It goes to the old saying, ""If it isn't broken, don't try and fix it."". I believe we will end up with a watered down, poorly conceived, cheaply made variation of a good thing. Wait...isn't that why America's auto industry is falling way behind? Ironic isn't it?",118 out of 135 found this helpful.,,11 January 2006
1556,Top Gear, Best Car programme ever!,"If you like cars, then this programme is just simply amazing. Unlike most programmes that are in this genre, the programme has survived a beyond 20 years at the top, and not many programmes come close. 5th Gear on five does come close, but it just doesn't have the heart or the dedication that Top Gear does.<br/><br/>While the people on 5th Gear only talk about cars, the Top Gear crew talk about everything that is to do with cars, and not just the cars themselves. For example, they have ""Star in a Reasonably Priced Car"" where a celebrity goes round their track to see how fast they are. And once, they decided to test the Toyota Pickup's claim of being the ""the toughest car on the road"" by basically ramming it into stuff, and putting it on a building that got demolished etc. and it still actually run. They also once tested if you can run your diesel car off of Vegetable Oil (you can, although your exhaust smells like a bag of chips).<br/><br/>Overall, this programme's great and a show you must fit into your weekly schedule, gets 10/10",109 out of 126 found this helpful.,,27 June 2004

1568,Top Gear, Used to be incredible; Ruined by terrible new hosts,"Chris Harris is brilliant and is the only true car guy -- he knows his stuff and his passion comes right through the screen... his back must be in tremendous pain from carrying this show by himself.<br/><br/>The other two -- Paddy McGuiness and Freddie Flintoff -- are painful to watch. Their voices are annoying, they're sometimes hard to understand, and they're just not funny. There is no chemistry with these guys, no character buildup or development, and no reason to care. The old trio (Clarkson, May, Hammond) were friends -- and enemies -- and there was conflict and resolution. It's like Paddy and Freddie were just two generic bodies swapped in to host... which is likely what happened.<br/><br/>In the old Top Gear, there were moments were you had to suspend some disbelief as to whether certain vehicles were truly built by the hosts or whether certain things happened on their adventures... but at least you felt they were somehow deeply involved... in the new Top Gear everything is unbelievable. Again, aside from Chris, they're not car experts or handy guys.<br/><br/>It would be the exact same show if you had Chris driving/competing along with the camera guys or other Top Gear staffers.<br/><br/>To be fair, the other hosts post Clarkson/May/Hammond and before this crew were a mixed bag... but a moot point since they are no longer hosting.<br/><br/>Aside from the hosts, the writing/ideas feels a bit unoriginal but again, I'm wondering if that's partially or fully due to the current hosts.

1571,The King of Queens, King of comedy,"I am from England and have only been watching KOQ for the past 4 months, yet already i am hooked. This show has two things that other great sitcoms don't or didn't, Kevin James and Jerry Stiller. Kevin must be one of the most underrated comedy actors there is, his comedy timing is perfect, he is insensitive yet endearing and basically just damn funny, the scenes between him and Leah Remini are just fantastic. But the scene steeler every time for me is Jerry, he is just amazingly funny and his unpredictability is comic genius. I was a huge fan of friends and was bitterly disappointed when it finished but now i think i have found a sitcom which surpasses it.

1572,The King of Queens, Could it be anymore under rated?,"I consider myself to be a connoisseur of sitcoms, and used to spend many long hours wasting my life watching them all. Sense Seinfeld, Friends and many other great sitcoms have left the scene I am left with wasting my life on the one great series that is left, ""The King of Queens"", and in my humble opinion beats them all. I have to admit, as has been mentioned before, it takes a couple of shows before you get hooked but it doesn't take long before you start realizing the brilliant comedic performance and timing of Kevin James, Patton Oswalt, Jerry Stiller and Leah Remini. I don't think the few people criticizing the show realize just how much talent it takes to make the world laugh, they really don't. However, I'm puzzled only about one thing, ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" but I don't, and it is hovering around #5 in the ratings but The King of Queens, which totally kicks ass on Raymond isn't even showing up in the top 20, what's up with that? Don't get me wrong because I've watched Raymond and I think it is ""okay"" funny but not nearly the caliber that KoQ's is. CBS needs to give a little more respect and focus some PR on the show and especially Kevin James because when movie goers get finally get tired of the very funny Adam Sandler I predict Kevin is next in line (or at least I secretly hope).",190 out of 235 found this helpful.,,19 October 2004
1573,The King of Queens, A damn funny show!!!,"I never thought I would ever say this, but...the funniest sitcoms out right now (2002) are on CBS!  The network used to broadcast only shows that the 65 and over crowd would enjoy.  This is a very, very funny show! <br/><br/>
Now, most sitcoms depend a lot on forced humor.  This show doesn't.  The writing and performances are very natural.  And I never watch the show without getting at least 10 good laughs.  <br/><br/>Kevin James is a great, underrated comedian.  He should really get more recognition for his talent.  He always cracks me up.  Kevin's not a bland comic, yet he doesn't go over-the-top.  He has just the right anecdote to produce big laughs.  By the way, he hosted the ""People's Choice Awards"" and he was great!  It was hilarious when he walked off stage in his boxers. <br/><br/>
Jerry Stiller, thankfully, gets the chance to once again display his incredible talent.  He was memorable as Frank Costanza on ""Seinfeld"" and he's actually given a role that lives up to it.  I guess you can say he's the one ""Seinfeld"" cast member, as of now, who's still a television success. <br/><br/>Leah Remini is a beautiful actress.  She is great to look at, and has a superb sense of timing.  She holds her own, not getting upstaged by the two professional comedians.  <br/><br/>If you haven't checked out the show as of yet, I really suggest you do. It's one of the few funny shows on television.  I'm really discerning when it comes to sitcoms, so take my word for it--it's great! <br/><br/>

1574,The King of Queens, The King of Queens is the best ever,"I have not seen a better comedy than the King of Queens for many years. I rate it one of the best ever. I've just returned to Ireland from Arizona on American Airlines from a biz trip and by chance they showed several episodes. I laughed my head off and later I asked the stewards to play again and they did. Thank you AA. The acting from all the team is first rate and especially from Kevin James, Leah Remini and Gerry Stiller, but from all of the cast in fact the acting is superb. I love all the cast, they are so funny. There is a hard edge in the King of Queens that I love and is seldom seen in today's TV comedy. Both Leah and Kevin play off each other so well that every situation is believable and hilariously funny. I have just purchased the 2nd season while I was in Az this week and I intend buying the full set the next time I am in the US. My son who is 20yrs old also loves this show and its brilliance is that it has the magic to reach out to different generations. I would like to thank all those involved with this amazing show - it's so appreciated to see this kind of TV show in what is in my opinion an era of poor TV fair in general these days with the exception of re-runs of Seinfeld and such like...

1575,The King of Queens, Comedy Gold,"In the best sitcoms, the comedy arises not just from the situations, but from the characters. Consider ""Friends"", ""Seinfeld"", ""Frasier"" and ""Cheers"", for example. Each series has humorous characters, which are necessarily played by excellent actors. ""The King of Queens"" is on the list of best sitcoms precisely for that reason.<br/><br/>Kevin James plays the titular head of the household as Doug Heffernan, a prototypical, jock-centric male who works for a delivery company like UPS. James expertly plays the buffoon with delusions of coolness.<br/><br/>As his wife, Carrie, Leah Remini is the perfect foil. With a voice that sounds like it comes right out of the Bronx, she is his whip-smart nemesis, always calling him out for his bad decisions. Their chemistry compares well with the gold standard---Ralph and Alice Kramden.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is terrific, and it is headed by Jerry Stiller, who plays Arthur Spooner, Carrie's live-in father. His role is similar to the part he played on ""Seinfeld""---an opinionated irritant who never fails to raise his voice at the slightest provocation.<br/><br/>This is one of those series that can be watched again and again.",16 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,24 July 2019

1577,The King of Queens, Comedy from the New York suburbs,This show is hilarious. You've got Doug played by Kevin James who is the loving and sometimes self-centered husband to Carrie played by Leah Remini. Now Carrie her character is witty and somewhat high-strung. Living with them is Carrie's father Arthur who appears to be one of the highlights of the show. This show was released in 1998 and I didn't start watching it until about a year ago and found it interestingly funny. Out of mostly all the sitcoms on TV this show has a realistic quality about it. King of Queens is a show focus on everyday life of a middle working-class couple. It's very rare to see a sitcom like this within the past decade. The humor is full of satire which makes the show catchable to enjoy. Arthur played Jerry Stiller is a well-known comic and as a supporting cast member he is terrific. King of Queens is definitely a show to watch week nights after a days work. Even the repeats are still enjoyable.,41 out of 54 found this helpful.,,24 November 2005

1579,The King of Queens, One of the most creative sitcoms on TV,"When this show first came on the air, I saw it once or twice and thought it was another ""fat guy, skinny wife"" show that seemed to populate the networks at the time. It was just ""okay"" upon initial viewings and I didn't watch it again; however, once it went into syndication, I caught several episodes (simply because it was on twice a night), and I'm telling you, the more you watch this show, the funnier it is. Once you see how all of the great supporting characters are connected, this show makes you laugh out loud. Every new episode I watch is more creative than the one before--people who only watch this a couple of times will not notice this. The writing and story lines are much more sophisticated than they appear at first (this is far from ""According to Jim""). First of all, Kevin James is hysterical, incredibly charming, and a talented comedic actor, as is the supporting cast. Leah Remini has excellent timing, and Patton Oswalt's Spence is one of the funnier characters on the show. And of course, Jerry Stiller is brilliant as Arthur. I was shocked to read comments that he was the worst part of the show--he's a gigantic part of why this show is so great--his delivery of these ridiculous schemes (rounding out the crazy dad character) are beyond hilarious. And the yelling--the best episode is when they show him as a kid yelling ""Lemon Icee!!"". That episode, during which Carrie takes him to a therapist in hopes to get him medicated (to make Doug less stressed out), guest star William Hurt decides that Arthur yells because he's never been validated. The latter part of the episode where Doug beats up his childhood self in a therapy session is beyond funny, it's one of the most creative scenes I've seen on a sitcom. I feel the strange need to defend this show, because it is severely underrated--while ""Friends"" was sometimes amusing, and ""Raymond"" has some great episodes and characters, they both lacked the creative touch that ""King of Queens"" has. In an era where most sitcoms have canned jokes and are on the whole mediocre, ""King of Queens"" continues to push the sitcom envelope and show real comic genius. Critics of this show obviously don't get it--or haven't watched the show enough to give it a chance, because anyone with real comic and creative sensibility has to laugh out loud while watching. It's certainly on par with my other two favorites, ""Seinfeld"" and ""The Office"" in its ridiculous tone. It's the Arthurs, Kramers, and Michael Scotts of TV that keep us watching, and laughing out loud.",32 out of 46 found this helpful.,9.0,3 September 2006

1586,The King of Queens, The Best!!!,"If you put Seinfeld aside, this is The Best Comedy ever, no doubt! Just Great!<br/><br/>""The King Of Queens"" just finished its eighth season of domestic bliss. Set in the working-class suburb of Queens, New York, the show follows Doug Heffernan (Kevin James), an amiable delivery man, and his wife, spitfire legal secretary Carrie Heffernan (Leah Remini), as they explore the everyday challenges of love, life, family and marriage. <br/><br/>Doug and Carrie deal with day-to-day domestic realities that reflect our times and enable us to laugh at ourselves. Their love for each other ultimately carries them through each dilemma they face, whether it's Doug's fixation with food or Carrie's obsession with expensive clothing. <br/><br/>Doug and Carrie also have to deal with the third, high-maintenance member of the Heffernan household ­ Carrie's twice-widowed father, Arthur Spooner (Jerry Stiller), who lives in their basement. His constant presence and often bizarre behavior add to their daily adventures. Doug and Carrie have stumbled upon an unorthodox solution to reduce their burden and keep Arthur happy ­ his regular excursions with gullible dog walker Holly (Nicole Sullivan). Doug's friends Deacon Palmer (Victor Williams), Spence Olchin (Patton Oswalt) and cousin Danny Heffernan (Gary Valentine) round out the cast with their ""guy"" humor and diverse perspectives.<br/><br/>In a manner that evokes ""The Honeymooners,"" THE KING OF QUEENS finds inspiration in life's everyday situations. Last season alone saw Doug ""loaning"" Carrie to a wifeless Deacon for help with Thanksgiving dinner; the Heffernans suffering through the annoyance and financial strain of mold damage to their house; and Doug and Carrie striving to copy a couple whose photos ­ of a more adventurous life than Doug and Carrie's ­ they accidentally took home. We also watched Arthur grow jealous of a new dog that Holly added to her route, and Doug finding out that his overprotective parents replaced his childhood dog Rocky three times behind his back. Throughout, the series showcases James' incredible physical comedy, Remini's hard-edged wit, and Stiller's unique comic presence.<br/><br/>You can't...

1590,The King of Queens, An absolute gem of a show which more people should know about.,"Let's get this out the way now - this show is basically a fat man's fantasy. It involves a very overweight and petulant manchild who just happens to be married to a stunning model-like wife, who not only has regular sex with him, but heavily mothers him too. He constantly indulges in underhanded and emotionally hurtful tactics to hang with his buddies and drink beer, or even just to get out of responsibility, and she regularly forgives him for it.<br/><br/>The saving grace is that this show is absolutely hilarious! Kevin James and Leah Remini work great together, and their comic chemistry is absolutely spot on. James is highly physical despite his large stature and he puts his all into a skit. Remini matches her co-star with impeccable timing and vocal mannerisms which had me belly laughing. She's playing the typical straight character, but she can absolutely do the goof just as well as the others.<br/><br/>Of course, one cannot review this show without mentioning the late great Jerry Stiller - father of Ben Stiller (who makes a guest appearance in the show). Jerry's portrayal of the ""crazy old man"" is spot on, and having someone who has worked in the business for such a long time is a huge asset. There is some question to portraying his awkward madness as a socialist (as hinted in the show) but I don't think it was malicious.<br/><br/>The show is heavy on the laughs, but the stars can reign it in and go serious when the occasion calls for it, and all the performers have the necessary dramatic acting chops to handle some of the more heavy storylines.<br/><br/>King of Queens (despite sounding like a great name for a gay sitcom) is far better than 90% of other American TV shows, most of which I find very dreary, safe, and generic. For me its up there with Friends and Frasier in terms of comedy, yet it was always seen as a third-tier show with many people having not even heard of it.<br/><br/>So, do yourself a favour and check out this absolute gem of a show!",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,24 August 2020

Perhaps more focus on the inner character developments so we can get really attached to indivudals backstory and their life choices. <br/><br/>But still I am hanging out for the next season and I recommend at least watching the whole first season before making a judgement call - if it aint your thing fine but dont rain on others parade.",74 out of 89 found this helpful.,8.0,20 February 2018

1601,Shadowhunters, Shadowhunters: from ZERO to HERO,"I've been a fan of the books years before the TV show started, so I had high expectations. But I also saw enough book to TV adaptations to know what expectations were realistic. Did Shadowhunters blow me away? No, but it did manage to pull me in, very slowly. The show begins with a lot of potential but also with a lot of issues. It's cheesy, the acting was a bit off for some of the actors, it doesn't have the best special effects and the script lacks here and there. And yet I didn't give up on it and I'm so glad I didn't.<br/><br/>While season 1 certainly has it's issues, the show also proved that it keeps evolving. It keeps getting better. And when you see the progression they made from the first episode to the finale, you can be sure that this show will deliver once it returns for season 2.<br/><br/>Compared to other book to TV adaptations, Shadowhunters stayed very loyal. They stay true to most of the characters and the story, they just told it in a different way so that even book fans can be surprised, which is a good thing in my opinion. The first few books are (mostly) from Clary her point of view, so I was very happy to see characters that I love get more attention. To give an example: the show made us part of Simon his journey to becoming a vampire every step of the way, we got to delve deeper into the Lightwood family dynamic and the parabatai bond between Jace and Alec. But mostly, we were part of Malec (Magnus &amp; Alec) their love story from the first time they saw each other to their first kiss. The episode of the same name – 1x12: Malec - is probably one of the strongest they did.<br/><br/>There is a great balance between the books and the TV show; some things I like better in the books, other things in the show. Which makes both enjoyable for different reasons.<br/><br/>In a lot of ways Shadowhunters reminds me of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Maybe people won't remember this but Buffy didn't have a great start. Season 1 was cringeworthy and it needed time to find it voice, and it did. There is a reason why Buffy was the pioneer of this genre. I feel the same way with Shadowhunters, not that it will ever get the same impact as Buffy had, but that it needed a bit of time to find its strength.<br/><br/>Cassandra Clare created a wonderful world, where the characters and their relationship are the beating heart and the show was able to bring this to life. And mostly, Shadowhunters is fun. It has a great sense of humor and likable characters.<br/><br/>I wish people wouldn't have rated the entire series based on the pilot alone. Hopefully people will give it a chance. Just binge-watch season 1 and by the end of it, I'm sure you're gonne wanne see what happens in season 2. If the books are any indication it's gonne be one hell of a roller-coaster.",76 out of 96 found this helpful.,10.0,12 April 2016
1602,Shadowhunters, Just get through S1,"Get past S1 and its smooth sailing. I think it needed to find its legs and the actors needed to discover the characters more. And S2 doesn't disappoint. The cast and characters are diverse spaning across the spectrum in personality, ethnicity, and sexuality. Strong women who support each other, men who break free of the stereotypes of true masculinity, badass fight sequences (come S2)...its just good. Though it's a fantasy show, it deals with real world problems with care. The special effects and writing improve greatly in the second season. And this current third season just keeps getting better.

I'm sick of all the reviews that were published right after the first episode was released and people are listening to it as they think that is for the entire show when it is not. So, do the people who actually have waited for this show since March and are actually enjoying it, and don't spread negative hate around social media and whatnot because I surely am not the only one to see the show expand and explore.

1604,Shadowhunters, Don't let negative reviews persuade you,"Don't let the negative reviews on this show persuade you not to watch it. May of the people that have watched Shadowhunters and disliked it didn't do their research before the show came out. The directors and creators said many times you had to come to this show with an opened mind. The show is slightly different than the books because they creators wanted it to be fresh and for the book readers not to know everything that is going to happen. I'd recommend reading the first book before you watch the show to freshen your mind or while you watch the show because there are many things that you don't notice in the book that they bring up in the show. I's better for you to see what the show is about yourself then to see it through what others tell you. Stay opened minded, distance yourself from the books, and don't be quick to judge from the first episode, the show gets better after each episode.",173 out of 256 found this helpful.,10.0,16 February 2016
1605,Shadowhunters, Not your typical fantasy: gets better with every episode,"The show can't be judged based on the pilot and a comparison with the movie or books will lead to a bias. The show needs to be seen with an open mind and although it started off with cheesy lines and poor visual effects, the improvement is evident with each episode as actors find common ground with their characters and create chemistry on screen. The visual effects also seem to be improving and more realistic over time. We see the vulnerable side of many characters as the season is progressing, such as the Lightwood siblings, whereby Alec learns to open up and come into terms with the feelings he has been compressing and Isabelle is torn between her fun-loving persona and finding approval from her family. Not to mention humor is off the charts with sassy remarks from the warlock and mundane! The twists, turns and deviations from the book gives the show an edge of suspense. Looking forward to the next episode and hopefully another Season because some amazing characters are still yet to take center stage! As a reader of the series, all I can say is.... it's about to get intense and emotionally empowering!",61 out of 85 found this helpful.,10.0,21 February 2016
1606,Shadowhunters," Improving every week, absolutely obsessed now!","I personally love this show so much! It took about five episodes to get above just decent, I'd rate the first five episodes a C- or 5.5/10 but after episode 5 I give the show a B+ or 8/10! Clace finally get a bit of chemistry in episode 7, Alec is perfect, the script gets slightly better with every episode I promise! The plot deviates from the books but that just keeps it interesting! The key points and incidents are definitely still there though. Malec is my favourite part of the show. I'm honestly so obsessed with this now and seriously hope it gets renewed for a season 2! That's when the storyline and character development would really get brilliant in my opinion. The cast are getting better every week and the only thing I have against it now really is the CGI/special effects but I get that they're on a low budget so I forgive that. Script still needs work but already seeing improvements as I said.

1607,Shadowhunters, I had low expectations anyways. Suddenly liking the movie more and more,"If you've read the book there aren't any spoilers. There is nothing specific.<br/><br/>I find it hard to blame the actors for this poorly written script. The most obvious problem is that there were amateur actors playing pretty difficult roles. As a bookworm, I am accustomed to not being happy with movies based on YA books. <br/><br/>""Shadowhunters"" is no exception. They did not choose characters well, besides their lack of talent there are certain characters whose personalities are key to character development and the bond that forms between characters and audience is just not here.<br/><br/>Jace was not portrayed well in this show, we don't see any of his ""wounded, mysterious, arrogant"" self other than people saying he's that way. Once. I've always pictured Jace somewhere between Jamie Campell Bower and Dominic Sherwood. So at least they got a little closer. <br/><br/>I didn't even know Luke was who he was because I was looking for a curly haired, middle aged, dorky guy. Isabel was unbelievably slutty and Alec was barely there. Hodge was a disappointment all around. Almost as disappointing as the Institute was. One of the top five most important parts of the book is that there aren't very many Shadow Hunters left. In the show, they're everywhere.<br/><br/>I think the movie had a better idea by making Clary more relatable. In the show she goes from ""I'm so confused"" to ""Oh it's okay they're just helping"" in one scene. We don't ever see her struggling with the idea that her mom lied to her or that she's scared that there are demons everywhere. <br/><br/>I noticed that because of the actor's lack of talent they didn't allow close up shots very often. My favorite part of watching a movie is seeing an actors face shift so that we can literally watch the character's internal struggle. They don't ever do this. They didn't play with shadows or lighting or color. Which doesn't take a lot of money to do. Just skill.",262 out of 409 found this helpful.,2.0,13 January 2016

1609,Shadowhunters, Don't give up. This is a great adaptation.,"When I saw the previews I was nervous it would be like the deplorable movie. I am a huge fan of the series.It makes sense to keep it a series instead of trying to make movies of all the movies. I will be interested to see how they will follow the books. Will each season be a single book? Will they combine books. Either way, I'm excited to keep watching. The casting in the movie was horrible. Magnus was a joke. The casting for the series is spot on. I'm pretty picky when it comes to casting. I am disappointed with the institute as others have stated. I enjoyed Simon and Jace's humor. I find the use of the different weapons interesting and didn't think the effects were cheesy. Please please remember that it is very difficult to make an adaptation of a book into a movie or series. We were spoiled with Harry Potter and the Hunger Games. I'm definitely going to keep watching.",138 out of 210 found this helpful.,8.0,17 January 2016
1610,Shadowhunters, My masochistic tendencies start to show,"Yes, I continued watching even though it pains me. I have read the books, watched the movie and now I am watching the series. I like to tell myself it is only because I like Cassandra Clare's concept of Shadowhunters livin off the grid protecting ungrateful mankind. I also like to think this is the only reason why there are 9 or 10 star ratings - people love it when their favourite books get put to the screen, no matter how abyssal the result.<br/><br/>Otherwise I cannot understand why the series has such high ratings since
the ACTING is AWFUL- who shall I blame, the casting director?- the actors?- the writer of the dialogue? - to be fair everyone but McNamara (Clary) and Sherwood (Jace) has been cast satisfactory- it is just a shame that the whole series is based on the Lovestory between Clary and Jace. Duh... I was hoping Sherwood would melt eventually to McNamaras girly, pinky, 'I am so insecure' approaches but NOPE he is not getting it (neither am I). I can see how the casting director typecasted everyone but the two protagonists. They just appeared because the series needed some 'more famous people' to attract viewers. No surprise than that the series is drifting off to focus on other lovebirds and continues to introduce more and more couples with better chemistry than the protagonists. Better chemistry is quite easy to achieve and can be recreated at home: just pick two different socks and put them on TADA better chemistry than McNamara and Sherwood. It is not just the chemistry though, I am sorry to say that I barely get through a scene with McNamara. Funny how there are more and more scenes with her either being angry or crying, remember how in drama class when people were out of their depths, they started being angry? Yeah...- and WHO PAINTS DANCING.<br/><br/>Some other notes (no worries I cut my criticism back a bit...) Shadowhunters are avoiding technology and dying out- yet he institutes full of both high-tech and shadowhunters. Hmph. Why are all the shadowhunters SO WEAK- I mean they get beaten up all the time- have they forgotten to activate their runes or something? Also, with primarily shadowhunters dying...- wouldn't the institute be somewhat deserted by now?",22 out of 29 found this helpful.,2.0,3 April 2019
1611,Shadowhunters, Delivery lacking,"After the wife and I saw the movie we were disappointed to find out they weren't going to make the next in the series for the big screen. Our woe was turned to hope when we learned that it would instead be turned into a TV series. Sadly the good news stopped there. The sets look good and the story seems to be staying loyal to the book (for the most part), but the major downfall is both the acting and the special effects. The acting seems like that of your average high school drama class, lines that need pauses between them are blurted out quickly and with sloppy delivery, even the body language is lacking in any real commitment. While some of the fight scenes look good for the most part the entire feel of the acting, fighting and effects can be easily summed up as power rangers. To touch quickly on the effects, while TV shows have much smaller budgets than feature length movies I feel some effects should have been left out in favour of old school tricks rather than cheap looking garbage. By far the worst part was seeing the Shadowhunters tech, mixing high tech gadgets with this magical world feels like Bilbo Baggins texting Gandalf for advice.<br/><br/>If even just the acting improves this show could really impress but for now it's underwhelming to frustrating",172 out of 274 found this helpful.,4.0,13 January 2016
1612,Shadowhunters, TV Series Is Redemption For The Awful Film,"Shadowhunters is a Excellent TV show and it needed to be after the awful attempt of adapting the books into a movie franchise. The Character casting for the parts have been made by people who fully understand the characters from the book unlike the film (In the film isabelle, jace, clary, Simon all where played by the wrong characters, it was like whoever cast them had not read the books). The TV show is different, the characters do the books justice. Season 1 is a slow burner and the show comes into its own in the following seasons and like all good TV shows you develop a relationship with the characters (Only good TV shows allow that to happen). I don't want to say much more because I don't want to spoil it for anyone reading this. All I will say is give it a go, you will not be disappointed.

1614,Shadowhunters, I love this show! I have no idea what people are complaining about!,"I really like this show! I honestly have no idea why people are complaining about how they picked the characters and that the show isn't following the book. They SAID they were going to add more twists and turns to make it better and more fun for the people who already read the books. I am currently reading city of lost souls and I think that the cast and the director and everybody else who puts in work for this show is doing an amazing job! I love the way they chose the cast for the series! I think everybody fits their roles perfectly! In the movie I had problems towards Jace's character since he looked nothing like I imagined while reading the books (besides the fact that his hair was blonde). The characters in the show really lend themselves to the characters in the book. But, the only problem I have is with Jace. He is a really good actor and I think he delivers his lines perfectly! But, where did all the arrogance go? I haven't seen that much arrogance in Jace throughout the show so I hope the script writers will try to incorporate more arrogance in his lines throughout the next couple of episodes/seasons. Besides that, I love the show! I love how even though I read the books I still don't know exactly what's going to happen! Thanks for making this show! Definitely an improvement from the movie!",79 out of 125 found this helpful.,10.0,16 February 2016
1615,Shadowhunters, People are being too ridiculous and harsh.,"I enjoyed the pilot, despite the changes I really liked the pilot. So many other people are complaining about changes made to the TV show but guess what? They said ahead that there were going to be changes so many other people should have anticipated these changes. And apparently they did not, even though they claim otherwise. Yes, spoiler alert, they did change Clary's age, Luke's occupation and other minor stuff like that. Plus they have to make changes to appeal to everybody, not just book readers which I am. So really most of the changes are small, it's still following the same storyline so I think people need to chill out and realize that there were going to be changes anyway. And people are also complaining about the acting. Look, I'll be the first to admit that no one is going to win any Oscars or golden globes here but let's remember that about 60% of the cast is not very experienced. They are extremely new actors and it does show but I would not call it horrible, maybe shaky at some parts but overall I thought it was decent and I've seen much worse before believe me. And now for my final complaint: the ignorant people that are comparing this to twilight, calling it another twilight, and someone even saying that it was twilight fan fiction??? First of all TMI is WAY different from twilight, don't know where these certain people are getting that from. Second of all, I believe that TMI is WAY better than freaking Twilight. What, it's similar because it has romance in it and because there are vampires in it? Oh okay so every book, movie, or TV show that has romance and vampires is a twilight ripoff right? Get out of here with that. The vampires here DO NOT sparkle, in fact they burn if the sun touches them, and the romance? It's way more fleshed out and way more organic that the twilight romance, I can tell you that. So really I think people need to calm down and accept the changes. Plus, this is a pilot people, pilots are not always the best, sometimes they aren't very good and even though I thought the pilot was decent that still may have been the case here. Give the show a shot, don't just give up after the first episode because it could very well get better as the actors will have time to grow into their characters and maybe all of the people moaning and complaining will adapt to the changes. Believe me I HATE when I read a book that I really like and the adaption is no where near like the book but I don't feel like they changed so much here to warrant so much complaining.",171 out of 287 found this helpful.,8.0,13 January 2016

I see much resemblance with the movie ""the mortal instruments:City of bones"" and I like it I give that movie 8/10 I think that the TV show is better because of the characters and how much they're involved I didn't noticed the other characters in the movie it was all about the main characters.Im positive for this TV show .

1617,Shadowhunters, Cringetown,"I'm not exactly the best critic who spots a terrible actor or bad shot from miles away. Usually, I'm quite an unfussy viewer. Or at least I'd like to think so.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I do get pretty fussy when someone's taking on one of my favourite series of books and after watching the film and the pilot of the show, I just decided that this series just looks way better in a readers head than on screen. That, or it'll take a seriously talented team of people to give justice to every single aspect of this concept.<br/><br/>If you thought the film was bad, then don't even watch the show because it's like a supermarket brand version of your favourite cereal. Horrible. Now I understand you can't 100% keep the books and that's not the problem here. The major issues with Shadowhunters was that its basic foundation, which would be the cast and the writing was utterly horrible. Actors were all stiff, unable to convey the depth the characters had at all. They all mainly looked like Ken and Barbies given wigs. I have no issues with attractive people but they just... didn't feel right for the role. For example, Simon is this geeky mousey sort of character and what we got was basically a hot guy with amazing cheekbones (hello papi) given a pair of 'geeky glasses'. Jace who is that chip on the shoulder guy with sarcasm as a self-defense mechanism trope just... didn't come across. His deliveries were so dry and bland, not in a good way.<br/><br/>The only notable two actors whom I found to be great on screen was the guy who played Luke and Valentine. I know Alan van Sprang who plays Valentine also played King Henry in Reign so we know he can get into the crazy of the character. Other than these two, the rest of the cast is an absolute bummer.<br/><br/>The writing? Don't get me started. You can't even blame the actors when even the script was bad.<br/><br/>Then there was that bit of the headquatres being filled with people like it was the M16... which is collaterally incorrect to the plot. The only reason Valentine wanted the Mortal Cup was so he could make more Shadowhunters out of people. Now why would he bother making more when it looks like they're tons of them in the headquatres? While I can understand and accept changes to the plot, this change just doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Suddenly, I feel like we should give the movie a lot more credit. It was done a lot more aesthetically pleasing, with better actors, with better writing. In fact, I didn't even hate the movie as a lot of people did. Sure, it didn't came 100% amazing but I was grateful for all the visuals after re-reading City of Bones at least 5 times. As a fan, I'm fine. Even disappointed that it didn't get continued but alas.<br/><br/>So yeah, it's a big no from me -- especially if you're someone who constantly treats oneself with good television and film. You'd notice how terrible it is within the first five minutes.",148 out of 250 found this helpful.,1.0,16 January 2016

This episode has a cinematography that could very well be featured in a movie. Still too early to tell anything about the plot, but I can already see which characters are going to be relevant based solely on the way they're framed when they show up. That's the director stating ""Hey! Pay attention! This guy is about to do something!""
Hard to tell if they used a double for the acrobatics, but if they didn't and that's actually the actress, then she an extra mark for that.
The only ""but"" I give it, is that they essentially rebooted the JSA we've seen in Legends, Arrow and Flash, which opens the possibility of introducing a new Arrow, a new Flash, and new *everyone else*s, which is not something you do when you have another version of the same character already developed.

Its an origin story and sets up Courtney becoming Stargirl as well as moving into a new town and school.<br/><br/>I will say that we start off with an action packed Justice Society America (JSA) fight with the Injustice Society set 10 years in the past. They show us the 4 members who will eventually get 'new' replacements in future episodes as well as the sidekick of Starman - Stripesy (and Courtney's stepdad).<br/><br/>The dialogue throughout is great. It feels natural and is also very funny at times (Joel McHale was very good!), you wont be able to stop yourself smiling as you watch it.<br/><br/>Also, great special effects, from the opening (and closing) fights, to Courtney's training montage with the Cosmic Staff.<br/><br/>As well as the 4 main family leads, we get introduced to a lot of potential friends and rivals at school. We get the mean popular girl and her '2nd' in command - both were very funny. Then we get the over the top mean jocks (hey, you need the small time school villains to counter the actual supervillains - so I gave it a pass) - and then we get a hilarious bit at the 'singles' table. Beth was great here, as was Yolanda's subtle glare at being called one of the losers.<br/><br/>Also, it has to be said, this feels like it was made pre 2015 (in a very good way!) - which means there is no heavy handed identity politics, social justice or man hating, its just a fun story that's well acted and highly entertaining.<br/><br/>If you thought about giving it a miss because you are over the DC CW, this doesn't feel like one of those shows at all.

As if this was NYC and they would never meet again. At that point, I was done.<br/><br/>Again, lazy writing makes for horrible, redundant, and predictable situations, as well chalkboard-scratching torture when trying to watch. For example, episode 8, Pat goes to the basement to have a one-on-one with the staff. So he seats himself with his back to the stairs.

1637,Stargirl, Cringeworthy to no end...,"So, it seems that DC has finally decided to go after the bright and colorful superhero segment that marvel dominates with its MCU, in particular the segment for pre-teenagers who really don't want to use the brain cells they have. What a shame.<br/><br/>Stargirl is cringe-inducing from the getgo. The actually quite well done SFX are immediately underlined by the poorly coordinated action scenes that stand out with its VERY obvious fake swings, but then only get worse by basically repeating the same sad moves which obviously were filmed with a pulley system.<br/><br/>But what's really killing it for me is the acting. The main heroine does a great job channeling her inner teenager, because she is nothing but annoying in terms of acting, has poorly written lines that do nothing to her character but portray her teenager angst and rebellious ""you are not my dad"" behaviour, and generally her character actions are just ""dumb"" (aka on point for a teenager), making it really hard to sell the story.<br/><br/>I gave it an honest try for 2 episodes, hoping it would pick up, but seeing a teenager without personality wielding a cosmic staff while literally blabbering the dumbest lines I've heard in a while in a superhero show, just kills it for me.<br/><br/>If you are an overly protected kid whose mommy forbids you to utter the words ""damn it"" an instead wish to be protected and only hear ""golly gee"", then this is show is for you. Turn off your brain and be amazed that there is a box with moving images and sound, because that's about all the excitement you'll get from this.<br/><br/>Yes, it's that bad, save yourself the time.",126 out of 251 found this helpful.,1.0,29 May 2020

1642,Stargirl," IGNORE THE NERD HERD, THIS IS AS GOOD AS COMIC TV GETS...","I got to see this pre-release. And it was pretty mind-blowing for a CW show. I don't think they can keep the same production standards throughout the series; the pilot looks as good as a movie, it really does.<br/><br/>And it's from the same bunch that all the CW DC shows are from. Justice Society stuff is kind of a hard sell; it based on comic nostalgia and old school comic fans, not really the CW demo. But the story is solid (yeah, lots of new girl in high school stereotypes, jocks, mean girls, geeks, etc., but that's basic comic lore stuff), the acting is great, the cast is SPOT ON and the effects are next level for a network show. And it's SMART production Notice how you never see Solomon Grundy's face? That's because there's a TON of money in making a CGI face look realistic...and they used that money to incredible effect over all.<br/><br/>It does what the CW aimed for: Updates old DC property for a new audience, and they really, really sold it well. I don't know if the series can or will keep up the level of excellence that this pilot set....but if it does, we're in for a whole new world of comic based shows from CW.<br/><br/>It was WAY more than I expected, and if it's not as much as you expected, you expect too much from a network comic show.

1645,Stargirl, Visually Stunning,"The newest DCTV show that hit the small screen is ""Stargirl"" starring Brec Bassinger, Yvette Monreal, Anjelika Washington, Cameron Gellman and Luke Wilson. It is a fun and refreshing take on the comic book character Courtney Whitmore portrayed by the talented Brec Bassinger. The first season maintains its momentum and is entertaining from start to finish. It is fast paced and invigorating and gives us all hope and optimism in dark times.<br/><br/>Brec Bassinger is unequivocally the full embodiment of Courtney Whitmore aka Stargirl. I honestly cannot imagine any other actress portraying this character. She brings out a different side of Stargirl. Brec Bassinger's character is zany and zealous and portrays a young version of Courtney Whitmore. Her optimism and spirit is one of the reasons why she might be one of my favourite comic book characters.<br/><br/>It was quite anticlimactic when Courtney's real father was revealed in episode 11. I thought that it would be someone related to Starman, like his cousin or brother perhaps. Courtney's real father is just some drifter who only visited her to get the necklace and to pawn it.<br/><br/>My favorite episode of Stargirl so far must be the sixth episode titled ""The Justice Society."" It showcased the new JSA consisting of Stargirl, Wildcat, Dr.Midnite and Hourman all suited up for the first time. What amazed in that episode was the fight sequences, the costumes and how each character used their abilities. The costume department did a terrific job at designing each individual character's look and made it aesthetically appealing.<br/><br/>Courtney and Pat are a great duo. Their quips and back and forth banter lights up the mood and sets them up as great partners. Their father-daughter chemistry is undeniable. They had quite a rough patch at the beginning, but made it work after Courtney wielded Starman's staff. The season finale's ending showcased Courtney's acceptance of Pat as a father figure. It was so heartwarming when Courtney gave Pat ""the world's greatest dad"" mug.<br/><br/>Every recruit of the JSA has such a rich and exciting backstory. Beth Chapel is the exception, although I love her over zealous personality. Yolanda Montez aka Wildcat and Rick Tyler aka Hourman are phenomenal characters. I loved how each character had a brief moment in the season where their backstory is revealed and how they came to be their present selves. As Pat stipulated in episode 7, Stargirl, Wildcat, Hourman and Dr.Midnite are all novices in crime fighting and need proper training. As the first season progressed, it became evident that they have improved their team working skills and are much better and intelligent fighters.<br/><br/>The first season introduces the Injustice Society of America right from the get-go and they are truly awesome and menacing villains. Icicle, The Dragon King, Sportsmaster, Tigress, the Gambler, Brainwave, the Fiddler and even Shiv are all superb villains. I love how each ISA member has their own prodigy. The Dragon King has his daughter Cindy aka Shiv, Brainwave has his son Henry aka Brainwave Jr, Icicle has his son Cameron, Sportsmaster and Tigress have their daughter Artemis and the Wizard had his son Joey. Icicle and Brainwave are the best villains of the series as they got the most development and have intriguing powers.<br/><br/>The production value, visual effects, acting, writing, story and characters are all superb. The characters are all extremely likeable and the camaraderie they share is perfect. Stargirl has become one of the best DCTV shows out there. It is quite apparent that this television series has a higher budget and is more aesthetically pleasing than any of the other DCTV shows. Fingers crossed that there will be countless more seasons of this brilliant series.<br/><br/>What struck me as astonishing, is the soundtrack of the television series. It makes the scene and each subsequent scene so much better and empowering. I still have the soundtrack of the season on loop.<br/><br/>The season 1 finale cliffhanger was insane and definitely unpredictable. It revealed that Stargirl's predecessor Starman is still alive. This raises a number of questions. How is he alive? Why is he only showing his face now? Is that really the real Starman? It could also be a shapeshifter who disguised himself as Starman. I am enthused to find out how Starman has returned from the grave.<br/><br/>The season 1 finale teased the villains Eclipso and Shade. Cindy aka Shiv found the crystal that makes her able to succumb to Eclipso's darkness. It seems like Shade will have a prominent role in the second season. He is probably the new leader of the Injustice Society of America.<br/><br/>To conclude, ""Stargirl"" is one of a kind and serves as a different kind of escapism than the rest of the DCTV shows. It is right on par with the Flash and Arrow. Hopefully there will be a crossover between the Flash and Stargirl in the foreseeable future. Stargirl is just as light-hearted and fun as the Flash and will brighten your mood. It has the perfect blend of humor and action.<br/><br/>Final verdict: 10/10 (would recommend it to literally anyone, especially DC and Arrowverse fans)",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,15 November 2020

None of the characters are perfectly likable, though all are well-played, but somehow the ensemble is endearing.

It's easily her best work since Seinfeld, and that's no put down of her post Seinfeld work. It's a commentary on just how brilliant she was on that show.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is up to the task of keeping pace with a comic and actress as strong as their leading woman.

You don't get the crappy, tepidly funny one-liners you get from most comedy series nowadays, you get incredibly intelligent situational humor that really makes you wonder about politics in the US and around the world.

Highly recommended. <br/><br/>This show is only funny if you actually pay attention to the plot of each episode, you simply won't get it if you pay half attention, because every line has a twist of humor, and every line builds on the last, which is so rare in comedy in the US.",58 out of 79 found this helpful.,10.0,28 May 2012

1668,Veep, The best thing on recent politics,"Selina, surrounded by some incompetent allies, looks as a self-destructive person at first, but then the opportunity hits her and she emerges as a politician who is kind of a nightmare for any democracy. Self-centric Selina, as if her personality were there to reinforce her dwarf-like figure, is the face of many politicians of modern age, to the world who are merely a two dimensional cut-out deliberately nurtured with the help of the media.<br/><br/>She really doesn't value the people she relies on. Many a time she needs her bagman Gary to feed the information in her ears about the person she is talking with, even during the conversation with her own daughter. That is just pathetic.<br/><br/>Despite all these, undeserving and ungrateful Selina is not an evil like Underwood from House of Cards. S03E03 is a key episode for her journey, which shows her compromising with one thing she likes to care for to gain some advantages. It's not new in politics, but crossing the border of satire, it really hits hard. At one point, she is confronted by one of her most close allies, Amy, who tells her: ""You have achieved nothing, apart from one thing. The fact that you are a woman means we will have no more women presidents, because we tried one and she fucking sucked!""<br/><br/>Like in every best sitcom, there is an eccentric character here; poor thing Jonah Ryan is hated by everyone. Always anxious Amy, a strange combination of ""lacking self-worth and narcissism"", is such a charm! Gary is stupidly blind worshiper of Selina. His innocence makes him sort of a wallflower in the deceitful environment. (""A 12 year boy trapped in the body of 12 year girl."") All the characters in VEEP are in such a fine balance.

1671,Doc Martin, A delight every week!,"I thought that the story of an arrogant top-flight London surgeon trying to run a practice in a chummy town in Cornwall would make for a one-note fish-out-of-water series, but instead it has been a delight every week. Doctor Martin Ellingham, for a reason that will be revealed later in the series, decides to transplant himself to a seaside village in Cornwall where he spent a few summers as a child with an aunt, who presently runs an organic farm there. Being a terse, intensely closed, firmly impersonal fellow, he is appalled at the ways of the village people who consider themselves as one big, happy, nosy family. Of course, in a series like this, we expected the clash of cultures between the coldly efficient doctor and the quirky little town to be the main storyline, but it is the diversity of their quirkiness (some of which will surprise you!) and the inventive medical cases that call the doctor's attention, and the personal incidents that test his patience, that will keep you coming back for more each week. While there is a lead cast -- Doctor Ellingham (who intensely dislikes the too familiar ""Doc Martin"" that people insist on calling him), the head schoolteacher who develops an interest in him, despite herself, the affable teddy bear of a police constable, the exasperating receptionist with a chip on her shoulder, and the jokey, prank-loving plumber played by the wonderful Ian McNeice -- none of the characters that show up fleetingly in the beginning is actually a one-off. Eventually, everyone's back story is brought to the fore. This makes the town more and more three-dimensional and you may find yourself caring quite a lot for the individuals that make up this engaging little village; yes, even for the irascible doctor, whose own back story is rather quite poignant and makes his unbending personality more understandable. The best thing about the series is that it accomplishes all this without the schmaltz that usually ruins programs of this genre. For intelligent, humorous and charming entertainment, spend an hour in the village by the sea of Doc Martin. Who knows? Maybe someday, people will be trying to find Portwenn in the same way that fans of veterinarian-writer James Herriot have been looking for his fictional Darrowby. I would certainly give it a try.",151 out of 159 found this helpful.,10.0,3 May 2006
1672,Doc Martin," ""That's Dr. Ellingham, if you please, and what's all this moaning about a little diarrhea?""","Curmudgeons, if blessed with good writers, can be satisfying house guests. They're irascible, oblivious, often insulting (sometimes unintentionally), but usually with a hint of endearing rehabilitation. Dr. Martin Ellingham, formerly a top-rank London surgeon who now practices general medicine in the Cornish town of Portwenn, not only has first-rate writers, he's blessed by having as his impersonator the actor Martin Clunes. <br/><br/>Dr. Ellingham (""Martin or Dr. Ellingham, please. Not 'Doc Martin!'""), during one simple operation, found himself overwhelmed and unable to continue. The sight of blood suddenly sickened him, not a good thing for a surgeon. It stopped his career cold. He retrained and accepted the job of Portwenn's GP, far away from London and from the people who'd learned of his phobia. <br/><br/>But Doc Mar...Dr. Ellingham...seems to have a gene missing in his make-up. He is all too frank, oblivious to human courtesies, awkward, means well but has one of the worst bed- side manners in miles. If you're a young boy who has sprained an arm, an elderly gentleman whose wife is using too much hormone cream, a well-intentioned busy-body who stops by for tea or a cancer patient, don't expect much from the doctor by way of chit chat or hand holding. Even with an actor as good as Clunes, this could be a tiresome one-joke premise, except that Portwenn has a classic collection of idiosyncratic residents, all played by some skilled British actors. There's Doc Martin's aunt, Joan Norton, played by the fine Stephanie Cole, so good in Waiting for God. Joan is an elderly, brisk, no-nonsense woman (wise, too, of course) who wrings a chicken's neck to prepare it for dinner. She lives by herself competently on her farm. There's Bert Large, played by the equally fine Ian McNeice. Bert is Portwenn's handyman and plumber. He's a short man so fat he prefers to give the orders while he sits and trains his son to do all the work. There's the town's policeman who is big, competent, young, shy and concerned about...ah...size. The town's schoolteacher, who cannot understand how Doc Martin can be so obtuse, is about Doc Martin's age, not married and... we'll have to see. Maybe something will happen in season two. It certainly didn't look like romance when, at the end of season one, Doc Martin helpfully mentions to her the possible causes of bad breath right after she unexpectedly kisses him, something he was too ill at ease to initiate himself. There's an assortment of small town biddies, blokes and giggling teenager girls who all love a bit of gossip. Periodically showing up for one-time parts are such established actors as Richard Johnson, Celia Imrie and John Alderton. <br/><br/>Doc Martin finds that in Portwenn he has to deal with human nature as often as he has to deal with diarrhea. But with human nature he hasn't a clue. Still, when he suspects something is wrong with a patient, he's not only usually right but he'll do whatever it takes whoever he offends to get good care for the person. Because the quality of the wring is so high, the installments are amusing and satisfying. Good actors make Portwenn's residents more like odd but possibly real people than the usual cut-out yokels. Portwenn itself is a star, too. The town is right on the Cornish coast, picturesque as all get out, with a friendly pub, sea air and easy jaunts down country roads to some beautiful scenery. <br/><br/>Most of all is Martin Clunes as Dr. Ellingham. Clunes is a big man with a large head, large ears and a wide mouth. He's not handsome. Clunes, however, is a fine actor who can dominate a scene. He also can effortlessly project cluelessness, umbrage and impatience...and do so while he also makes us realize Doc Martin is almost an innocent when it comes to human interactions. <br/><br/>Doc Martin is superior entertainment.",41 out of 42 found this helpful.,9.0,2 September 2009
1673,Doc Martin, What a gem,"This gem of a series is lifted out of the sickly-sweet genre of medic/policeman in small quirky country community (often with 'heart' somewhere in the title and 'heartwarming' in the reviews - ugh!) by the spectacular social ineptness of the lead character, Doc Martin, perfectly played by Martin Clunes. Imagine the series if Doc Martin was an ordinary GP, and you'll see what I mean. I was first attracted by the wonderful scenery of Port Isaac in Cornwall (Port Wen in the series)but quickly got interested in how he was going to put his foot in it this week. The story lines are average I would say, some better than others, usually centred on a different medical incident each week, but the real interest is in the relationships between the villagers and the doctor, and how they develop over time. It is always entertaining (and even the not-so-good plot lines are enlivened by the beautiful landscape) and sometimes extremely funny - something to look forward to.",89 out of 95 found this helpful.,9.0,24 May 2006
1674,Doc Martin, The Brits Know How to Do It,"Doc Martin is so unusual and wonderfully off-kilter that it becomes addictive within 20 minutes of exposure. <br/><br/>The titular Doc is a guy who was probably a curmudgeon before puberty. He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.<br/><br/>The foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.<br/><br/>Martin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)<br/><br/>Portwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).<br/><br/>Dominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.<br/><br/>Don't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.<br/><br/>And a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.",122 out of 133 found this helpful.,10.0,11 December 2007

Others like the plumber come restaurateur Bert Large, Aunty Joan, PC Mylow, and the swathe of slightly odd characters that make up the village are what I've come to expect from these sorts of ""seachange"" stories and are what round the shows off so well.<br/><br/>Do yourself a big favour and watch this show if you haven't already.

1677,Doc Martin, Doc Martin delivers!,"I do not understand why some people do not understand why they love this series nor understand why they love Doc Martin. Some dedicated viewers really don't understand why they are so hooked! So I shall tell them why they love Doc Martin. Doc Martin is real. I am a registered nurse and have worked in the Operating Room (theater, if you are picky) and I can tell you this man exists. That is why I switched to the Medical Floor, to get away from the Doc Martins of the hospital. Good grief, they are intimidating. It takes years to find out how weak and vulnerable and sad they are. When a patient codes and doesn't make it, the Doc Martins of the world are left to handle their grief and feelings alone. Isn't that sad? We notice (and love) Doc Martin first of all because he oozes alpha male chemistry and we react to that with a mixture of love and hate, contempt and admiration. We love him second of all because he has transcended most of his feelings (unlike us) and has moved to a higher plane of capability because of it and we benefit from his capability and confidence. We love him thirdly because he needs our love and he has been so mistreated and has such voids within him. There are all kind of subtle clues that Doc Martin is wonderful, but none so telling as the fact that dogs love him and are not impressed by his screams and sneers. You cannot fool a dog! Why does America love this series so much? Because the British do a much finer job than we do at so many many film endeavors. From the impeccable casting to the brilliant writing and believable dialogue to the ability the British have to plumb the depths and soar the heights of human drama and comedy without having holes and gaps that need filled with obscenity or worse. Thanks to the British for their genius. They are even brilliant in the way they use color to match the characters to the environment and create an ambiance that disarms the viewer. I love British films and ""Doc Martin"" best of all. I suspect another reason America is enthralled with the Doc Martin series is because we Americans are having socialized medicine crammed down our unwilling throats, and watching socialized medicine in action adds a certain little touch of horror spice to the story that Brits probably do not even notice.",43 out of 47 found this helpful.,10.0,4 June 2012
1678,Doc Martin," ""House"" in an alternate (and much sweeter) universe","A British friend tipped me to this show, claiming it was the ""original"" House -- which somehow (typical British subtlety) implies that House is itself a knockoff...? Be that as it may, this show is an undiscovered gem. Martin Clunes, who is very empathetic in real life, plays an uptight Asbergery London surgeon with (no kidding) a phobia about blood. One way or another he ends up in coastal England in a charming little village called Port Wen. It is supposed to be temporary but, hey, every TV series ever made is temporary when it starts. He interacts with the locals and adventures ensue. Kind, gentle, interesting adventures, adventures that at the same time intrigue you on an intellectual level and also make you wish you actually lived in Port Wen. Caroline Catz as the local schoolteacher who our hero falls in love with, in spite of the fact he can barely handle a relationship with himself, is pitch perfect. Brilliant.

The photography is always skillful, but I just love the beautiful, almost picturesque scenery. The music is lovely too, not just the accompanying music in scenes but the main title theme too.<br/><br/>Where Doc Martin also scores is in the writing. Of all the shows on ITV, this for me is one of the most consistent in terms of written quality, always being funny, subtle, honest and touching. The story lines are also very well explored, any issues or problems the characters face are done in a gripping way that doesn't patronise or offend.<br/><br/>The direction is great too, while the pace is never too rushed or too slow and each episode is a perfect length and leaves you satisfied when it ends.<br/><br/>The characters are always engaging, especially the title character, who is really quite lovable once you get to know him. The acting helps to make these characters likable, Caroline Catz and Ian McNiece are always great, but it is Martin Clunes who holds the show together and he is brilliant. I quite liked Clunes even before this show, especially in Goodbye Mr Chips, but after seeing him here I confess I love him even more now.<br/><br/>All in all, just wonderful and I am amazed how consistently strong it is. 10/10 Bethany Cox",49 out of 61 found this helpful.,10.0,1 March 2011

I can find no reference to John Coleman on the Doc Martin website. I am guessing he was one of the writers. Am I right? By the way, I loved the series, but one or two things bothered me. The plots were interesting enough and the most of the characters were beautifully drawn, but to some extent some of them were a bit two-dimensional. For example the professionally super-efficient Doc Martin was so rude to everyone that one could hardly believe that any of his patients would ever come back for more. The policeman was (at least until the final episode) unbelievably inept, if not dim-witted. Sorry but I couldn't accept the snake bite episode, when the Doc displayed more patience with the mad forest ranger than he had with the entire village of (reasonably) sane people. The final episode was by far the most believable and the best. On the credit side I found the casting perfect, the setting idyllic and the photography exquisite.

1694,Doc Martin, Plenty More to Do,"I love this show because, as quirky as it is, it is one of the greatest love stories of all time. However, up until now, the story is about the ""feeling"" of love that the Doc and Louisa have for one another. This series would do the world justice if it continued for a few more seasons that centered around the two of them learning how to love and what the true meaning of ""loving"" another really is. This would take it from ""best series"" to ""classic series"". And...in these troubled and confused times, would greatly help us all.<br/><br/>I think they have begun to scratch the surface by living together. All I know is that my brilliant husband begs me to watch another episode of Doc Martin every night and he's not the most romantic sort.

1695,Doc Martin, From Fabulous To Farcical By Series Six,"I don't know what it was, but my heart, was not in it anymore by S6 Ep3. There seemed to be something wrong with the dialogue and, to a lessor extent, the plots. But the thing that mostly bent my enthusiasm was Ellingham himself. <br/><br/>His grumpiness was inspirational to an old grump like myself and there was much to like about this attitude of his from the perspective of his role amongst the rest of the village idiots. And best of all, this grumpiness was equally balanced with a comforting sense of warmth. <br/><br/>BUT - from the opening scene of the wedding, the grumpiness was turned up several notches and the warmth was turned down to near freezing. From then on things just became downright stuffy. As if they had lost their initial enthusiasm for the show and just pushed the absurdities a little too far out, not least in the performance of PC Joe Clouseau Jnr.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,2 July 2017

I've loved every episode through 5, though to be perfectly honest here and there I found myself wishing for more techie jokes, but i guess they can't chase away the non-techies just yet.<br/><br/>Personally, Moss is my fav.

It was almost surreal and had it's connections to ""Father Ted"" equally weirdness.

There are so many nuances that you have to pay special attention or you'll miss them, which is difficult to do when you are busting your gut laughing with tears pouring down your face.

The cast is so perfect, from the nutty Denholm (the boss man) to the eclectic pair of nerds that was the IT department. I am so lucky to have seen an episode on the net, because I would have never seen this on the BBC as I live in the US. You do not have to be a computer nerd to laugh until your sides hurt. However, having any exposure to life inside a company of any modest size will certainly make you appreciate what goes on at this company. Even the elevator, or ""lift"" as the Brits call it is a source of much laughter, as are the bathrooms and many other props. But the real genius of such great writing and comedic delivery on the part of the cast is magnificent.

But despite the size of the company, the two seem banished to the basement of the building.

The characters are likable, and the script is a joy. Further proof that Mr. Linehan has a good eye for great actors and actresses, and that his writing skills have not waned with time. After all of his previous successes (including Father Ted, Black Books and material for Harry Enfield And Chums, The Fast Show, Big Train, Coogan's Run, Brass Eye and Jam) The IT Crowd is another triumph.",69 out of 77 found this helpful.,9.0,22 November 2006
1704,The IT Crowd, One of the Funniest Sitcoms I've Ever Watched,"For those who complain that ""The Big Bang Theory"" is too artificial and panders to mainstream audiences, there's a fantastic option for getting your geek/comedy fix in the U.K.'s ""The IT Crowd"". The sitcom, from writer/director Graham Linehan, is one of the funniest shows I've ever watched. In my opinion, sitcoms have always been a cheap form of laughs that cater to the lowest common denominator with themes reused over and over again for the same gags. But this one felt genuine and original with a fun twist on common life foibles as seen through the eyes of two antisocial computer techs toiling away in the basement of a major corporation. We introduced to their world in the beginning with the arrival of Jen Barber (Katherine Parkinson) when she's hired as the manager of Reynholm Industries' IT department. A computer- illiterate woman intent on faking her way to success, she meets Roy Trenneman (Chris O'Dowd) and Maurice Moss (Richard Ayoade): the company's crack IT team. Over the course of four series (and a total of 25 episodes), the three of them will endure everything from cannibalism to viral menstruation as they attempt to break out of their sheltered world and, you know, do things grown adults are supposed to do. The show has a fun balance of humor that will appeal to the more geek-centric viewers while keeping most of it broad enough that anyone can find something hilarious. This show is everything I'm pretty sure ""The Big Bang Theory"" wanted to be.<br/><br/>What makes ""The IT Crowd"" so much fun? The characters. I freakin' love the characters in this show. All of them. The show manages to keep the roster down to a manageable four (five, when Richmond is around) to give each plenty of screen time for us to get to know them. Roy is the IT team's more socialmember, and that's not saying much. He has a general hatred for the common populace (which I can get behind) and finds most people to be blithering idiots, but he's also a lech who uses his position to try and troll the upper floors of the building for his next hot (unsuccessful) date. Chris O'Dowd (who I'd only previously seen in BRIDESMAIDS) injects the character with the perfect level of charm and exasperation. The fan favorite of the show is Moss and his endless list of eccentricities. He's a more prototypical nerd: hyper-intelligent, naïve, and utterly inept when thrust into social situations. He's the sort who'll faint at the thought of a woman opening discussing her unmentionables or find a website to aid in engaging in casual conversation with sport fans. Richard Ayoade is perfect in the role. Every time Moss is on screen, you can bet the best laughs will come from him. Fun fact: Ayoade was the only cast member to be ported over to the States to star in the American version and even he couldn't save the unused pilot from becoming an inferior copycat of the original that saw a fast, merciful death before reaching air. The final member of the IT crew is Jen. She's the ""normal"" one. She's got no computer experience (outside of checking her email) and she can actually engage in personal relationships. She's a manipulative go-getter who initially hopes her management role in the IT department could lead to bigger and better things. As Jen, Katherine Parkinson is the audience's vessel into this absurd show and the best moments are when it becomes apparent that she's become ingrained in the world of geek culture. The final character (or characters, I guess, since we went through two over the course of the show) is the big boss of Reynholm Industries. The first series featured Chris Morris as Deynholm Reynholm, a hyperactive man with a few screws missing and a passion for motivating his workforce. I honestly can't find the words to describe Morris's bizarre line deliveries and the quirks he brings to the character but they're awesome. Morris was with the show until the beginning of the second series when Matt Berry stepped in to run the company as Douglas Reynholm and we got a whole new level of insane. Rather than ape what made Morris's character of Reynholm so fun, Berry's Douglas is sexist (renowned for his collection of sexual harassment suits), melodramatic, and a total buffoon. While I can understand why people seem to love the character of Moss the most, I'm honestly torn between Moss and Douglas Reynholm as my favorite character in the series.<br/><br/>""The IT Crowd"" is more than just it's fantastic characters. I was also impressed that its plot lines never seem to retread old sitcom ground. Each of the episodes felt more original than you're average TV comedy. Granted, most of the episodes are focused on the same thing: the IT crowd attempts to integrate/interact with normal people and it goes horribly wrong. The IT crew is invited to a dinner party at Jen's flat when her usual guests were unavailable. Roy establishes a bogus dating site profile to win a bet against Jen and prove that women only want bad boys. Moss and Roy become friends with a group of ""real men"" and bond over soccer, beer, and armed robbery. It's a common thread in the series, but it's not their only trick. Graham Linehan has got enough material that it kept the series fresh over the course of its four-series run. If I had to choose a personal favorite, I would agree with a good portion of it's fan- base and go with ""The Speech"", wherein Jen is award the title of Employee of the Month and must give a speech on technology to the company's shareholders. When Jen's ego inflates and the boys decide to have a little harmless fun with her acceptance speech, it'swellit's just perfect. I can't recommend this show enough and only wish that it would've continued on longer than it did. Four series just wasn't enough.",38 out of 42 found this helpful.,9.0,22 November 2014

If you want to check out complete and utter comedy watch the episode where Jen goes to the theater with a man who she thinks is gay. The schematics that Roy and Moss get into will make to you laugh until your stomach hurts. I have heard that they are making an American version of this show...and I've seen the cast right here on IMDb and it pains me to say it. The American cast appear to be a cliché and too cute to work in IT. That is one of the things I love about the show is Jen's natural beauty. Her individuality is what makes that character special.

There are, as with any series, a few episodes that go so far over the top you groan from pain, but the chances of a deliciously laid out bit is well worth the endurance. <br/><br/>Given the simple premise of the show, the script stays remarkably fresh.

1716,The IT Crowd, Excellent British comedy,"I first saw The IT Crowd after a friend recommended the show to me, and I'm glad I watched it. I was hooked onto the show right after the first episode, and each episode kept getting funnier. The IT Crowd is definitely one of the funniest comedies I have seen in a long time. I have even recommended it to friends and family and they have found themselves hooked.<br/><br/>The IT Crowd is about three staff members from an IT Department located in the basement of Reynholm Industries which everybody from the office relies upon but frequently ignores and often looks down upon the staff as inept losers. Roy Trennerman (Chris O'Dowd) is a laid-back but very lazy Irish IT worker a love for wearing geek T-shirts that represent the latest trend in computers which reflects his personality however he goes to great lengths to avoid work so he can do nothing but play video games, read comics and play around in the office. Roy puts in very little effort in helping others in the office which is evidenced by his standard IT suggestions such as ""Have you tried turning it off and on?"" and ""Is it plugged in?"" whenever someone calls up the IT Department with a computer problem. He also proves to be luckless in love. Maurice Moss (Richard Ayoade) has a brilliant technological mind when it comes to computers yet he is very socially inept when it comes to dealing with people. Moss struggles with basic communication skills and also lives with his mother who also dresses him and packs his lunch. The attractive Jen Barber (Katherine Parkinson) was a new worker assigned to the IT Department as the boss after she claims on her CV she has experience with computers however it is shown throughout the series that she has zero technical or technology management experience. She even lacks basic computer knowledge such as not knowing what IT stands for, how to plug into a computer or telephone, infecting her laptop to make it look attractive, as well as making outlandish statements about the internet.<br/><br/>The original director of Reynholm Industries Denholm Reynholm (Chris Morris) has very little IT knowledge but always thinks up of new and often ridiculous initiatives aiming to improve performance and morale in his company yet he frequently makes impetuous and rash decisions and pays little attention to other workers, unless they were attractive. Later in the series his long lost son Douglas Reynholm (Matt Berry) takes over Reynholm Industries. Douglas speaks very loud and dramatically, and also has uncontrollable sexual urges to other females he finds attractive which has resulted in a history of many sexual harassment accusations levelled against him. He has also seemingly inherited his father's impetuous and arrogant personality.<br/><br/>Chris O'Dowd and Richard Ayoade made a great duo as the socially inept IT workers Roy and Moss. In particular, Moss was my favourite character out of the entire series as there was never a dull moment with Moss. Katherine Parkinson was great as Jen, the new manager of the IT Department despite her lack of knowledge of basic computer skills. Chris Morris and Matt Berry were hilarious as the father and son of Reynholm Industries.<br/><br/>I've always has a soft spot for British comedy. It doesn't try too hard and there is no overacting required, but it's kept simple yet the humour is brilliant and clever. The IT Crowd is an excellent example of comedy kept simple and does not rely on over the top humour nor does it rely on sexual jokes or strong profanity yet it works perfectly on all levels.<br/><br/>10/10",19 out of 23 found this helpful.,10.0,1 February 2015
1717,The IT Crowd, Series 2,"I'm writing this, assuming that people already know about the 1st series.<br/><br/>Series 1 of The IT Crowd was good &amp; showed lots of potential too. In series 2, it really comes alive. With the characters firmly established, Graham Linehan pushes them into wonderfully absurd situations &amp; realises the full potential of the series.<br/><br/>Episode 1 of the second series is probably the funniest thing I have ever seen. The office trip to the Theatre to see 'Gay' a gay musical is pure genius from start to finish. It delivers huge laughs throughout &amp; I had to watch it twice because I missed so many bits of the episode through uncontrollable laughter. Many of the laughs in The IT Crowd arise from awkward social situations which are beautifully played out by the cast. The writing seems to be far more tuned into this aspect compared to the first series &amp; everything gels together with apparent ease. The move away from obvious IT based gags will also broaden the audience but the show's unique identity is retained. A few jokes fall a bit flat, but every episode is packed with absolute corkers that easily cancel out the weaker parts. Other particularly good episodes are the 'Peter File' one &amp; the one with the German Cellist.<br/><br/>I'm constantly amazed by Graham Linehan's ability inject so much vitality &amp; originality into the mundane sit-com format. However, a lot of credit has to go to the cast. They all play their roles perfectly &amp; the characters compliment each other rather than competing for laughs. The dynamic is much like that of Red Dwarf, where every character is an essential part of the whole. Also, Matt Berry slips into Chris Morris' shoes with surprising ease as the new Boss &amp; is delightfully mad.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,26 March 2008
1718,The IT Crowd, Another British Great!!!,"After stumbling onto this show, on the More4 channel in Ireland, I was instantly hooked! Very clever tongue-in-cheek humor, along with all-out wit and banter--it is a must-see. Moss, Jen, Roy (and later Richmond) are a great ensemble, each lending their own unique humor to each scene and easily playing off each other. Life in 'middle earth'(as the IT department is referred to in one episode)is a great concept,the clichéd idea of 'computer geeks' taken to a new level. With Jen leading the department, and knowing nothing about computers, it is up to Moss and Roy to answer the very few phone calls from the corporates upstairs(to which the immediate response is: ""did you try turning it on?"") then fix the usually minor computer problems. Later discovery of the once junior CEO-turned-goth hiding behind the red door(Richmond), adds an extra element of fun and a clever twist of someone being a nerd and a goth at the same time.

Cool, we're fine with that, no reason for us to try to escape.<br/><br/>Just found out we're witches: we're cool with that.

1726,Charmed, Adding injury to insult!,"1) The insult: I was a HUGE fan of the original ""Charmed""- I even recorded EVERY episode on dozens of VHS tapes (this was back before DVR)! In my opinion, their series finale episode ""Forever Charmed"" is a prime example of a flawlessly written closer, concluding the show perfectly. Everything was neatly wrapped up, there was no need to rehash anything. Also, why reboot a show that only ended a little more than 10 years ago and is STILL on TV, airing in syndication? However, out of morbid curiosity, I attempted to watch the ill-conceived reboot tonight. Unfortunately, I was not disappointed in my disappointment. The reboot serves only as a both obvious and pathetic attempt by the network to prove how ""woke"" and diverse it is by simply recycling a previously (and RECENTLY) proven show with a PC cast. That will NEVER be a good enough reason to reboot a show and actually is an insult to the original that it is ripping off!<br/><br/>2) The injury: The same year as the ""Charmed"" finale season, the WB/CW introduced the show's thematic successor, ""Supernatural."" The gist of both shows is predestined siblings battling unnatural evils, and it was an easy transition for ""Charmed"" fans who were preparing to bid farewell to latch onto ""Supernatural."" Since then, TV Guide has begun calling ""Supernatural"" the ""show that will never die."" It has been such a success for the CW that this past season they aired a backdoor pilot for a spinoff, ""Wayward Sisters."" As great as ""Supernatural"" is, they NEEDED this spinoff to finally spotlight the female characters who have been woefully neglected and/or misused in the original, and fans desperately WANTED this spinoff. However, CW execs made the incomprehensible decision to turn down ""Wayward Sisters"" and instead green lit this pointless ""Charmed"" reboot, a show NO ONE wanted or needed. By choosing this useless retread over a show that already has an established, extremely loyal fan base ready and waiting for it, the network has actually hurt its own chances for a bonafide hit.<br/><br/>In conclusion: SHAME ON YOU, CW execs for wasting one of your limited programming spots on this farce!!!! Hopefully it will be cancelled after its first 13 episodes, the network will realize the error of their ways, and replace this turkey with ""Wayward Sisters""!!<br/><br/>PS- We see what you're doing CW, airing an encore of the ""Charmed"" pilot after this week's ""Supernatural"" episode, hoping we'll stick around for it, but we're not falling for it! You are NOT going to turn ""Supernatural"" fans into ""Charmed"" fans because we KNOW you sacrificed ""Wayward Sisters"" for this waste!!",338 out of 510 found this helpful.,1.0,15 October 2018

1731,Charmed," The original was feminist, this is misandric","My biggest issue with the reboot, as the original actors have expressed, is that the new series has been continuously marketed as ""feminist"" since its inception as if the original was not. The feminism in the original was subtle, strong, and deeply embedded in everything the three women did. It didn't have to be the entirety of dialogue for one of the sisters to be a major part of the series, which is what I hope gradually happens with the reboot, so the message feels more genuine. For premiering in 1998, Charmed was very ahead of its time, so why is the network constantly dragging the show down as if it isn't still relevant today?<br/><br/>In the pilot of the reboot, Mel, the middle sister, has such terrible dialogue that everything that comes out her mouth feels incredibly forced and almost like it's there to prove the series is conquering feminism, whereas the lines should feel like a natural part of the story. She's extreme to the point of it almost coming across as disingenuous and satire, which is counterproductive to the message the show was trying to send. And, at times, her lines about consent and empowerment came across as a mockery of very real issues.<br/><br/>The family dynamic doesn't feel the same either. It's been teased that the oldest sister, Macy, was given up at birth by their mother, and the premiere doesn't give any insight into this, either, which makes the show feel less about the familial bond and more about being witches.<br/><br/>Charmed is supposed to be a show about three sisters who happen to be witches, not three witches who happen to be sisters.<br/><br/>The change of one sister's powers was an extremely poor choice. Premonitions were arguably the most important power for the Halliwells as it helped them save hundreds of innocents from death.<br/><br/>Maggie's ability to read minds seems like a way to make identifying demons a bit easier, but will lead to much more death. Without premonitions, these girls are much more open to demons ruling their life because they're not going after the demons before something bad happens.",123 out of 181 found this helpful.,1.0,21 October 2018

Mel is supposed to be Queen Feminist Gender Studies Legend, yet she - and the show itself - makes fun of sorority girls and mocks the decision to rush. Pretty sure putting other girls down for wanting to be apart of a sisterhood isn't feminist. Speaking of Mel, good LORD is that actress terrible. The other girls aren't winning any awards either, but Mel certainly takes the cake for forced lines and half-baked characterization. Obviously, this show is attempting to capitalize on the feminist witch craze sweeping through America's young femme population.

It was very entertaining!<br/><br/>This one is a cheap remake with a bunch of women who like college roommates with zero chemistry. Also, the latina who can freeze time had more power than Piper! Piper and the girls powers evolved within the show as they grew as witches and built stronger family bonds. <br/><br/>Also, there's way too much feminist extremism being built into poor dialogue. I'm all for girl power and strong women, but this was cringe worthy. We get it they are women fighting the patriarchy of demons. It's interesting to note that the original Charmed had better writers who portrayed the sisters as strong, powerful women without having to resort to tacky violence (the latina punches a man on campus) or having to say she's a feminist every 2 seconds.<br/><br/>Also, what's feminist about a Whitelighter who gags, drugs and kidnaps the girls and dictates to them about their Wicca ways?

1747,Penny Dreadful, Strikes the perfect balance between Gothic art-house horror and gory B-movie action; visuals look great,"Well, I'm trying to write a completely spoiler-free review here, but I guess it's safe to announce that 'Penny Dreadful' looks positively gorgeous. Great production design and cinematography: by the time we get to see Victorian London as night descends upon the city and the fog starts creeping through those narrow cobblestone alleys, nearly every frame looks like a beautiful, Gothic painting (and not once did I spot a fake looking CG-background). As far as the actors are concerned, they portray their obscure, troubled characters with a certain kind of ""theatre"" intensity that fits the story and the turn-of-the-century setting very well.<br/><br/>Story-wise I don't want to give away anything – but of course, there are unholy things lurking in the shadows that need to be fought (and they look rather convincing: the make-up effects are another strong point of this show). Like the iconic ""Hammer Horror"" films of old (usually starring either Christopher Lee or Peter Cushing – or both), 'Penny Dreadful' draws its setting, characters and general inspiration mainly from some famously dark tales written by Mary Shelley, Bram Stoker and Oscar Wilde (and to a lesser extent from sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories). And just like the Hammer films - who may seem rather tame now but were shockingly violent for their time - this show is neither for purists of said literary works nor for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>While some scenes are genuinely scary in a tension building, ""old school"" kind of way, we also get blood soaked action sequences that will probably put off some viewers, but seem entirely appropriate given the show's title (in the 19th century a ""penny dreadful"" used to be a booklet of cheap, sensational fiction printed on pulp paper which could be purchased for - wait for it: a penny).<br/><br/>My overall verdict: 'Penny Dreadful' dishes out a hefty mix of gory violence, classic horror creatures, sex and action, but it never forgets to build atmosphere. The B-movie elements are undeniably there, but they're deliberate (the title says it all), and this is by no means a cheap affair. Beautifully crafted and with a great cast, I strongly recommend this show to anyone who likes the old ""Hammer Horror"" movies as well as films in the vein of Tim Burton's 'Sweeney Todd' and 'Sleepy Hollow'.<br/><br/>But not just for the fans of ""Goth Horror"" is this well worth checking out; I would say that after 'True Detective' and perhaps 'Fargo' this is one of the most promising new TV-shows of 2014.<br/><br/>Favorite Films: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054200841/<br/><br/>Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",250 out of 306 found this helpful.,,11 May 2014

Rare are those moments. There may be many that do not share my perspective, nor do they taste my words and vision, but then again, I am sure that some are like me. Hungry to feel, to truly feel life, and thirsty for ambivalence, for the evil to have a good face and vice versa and more importantly to see that even flawed ones have a faith to preach and fulfil. <br/><br/>The story captures you entirely, it tenses your moral beliefs and makes you see a side of you which, in some cases, has never emerged, or, if it did, it will be like candy for children. The characters are immortal, at least the main cast. The way they can evolve is a tribute to the writer, director, producer and more importantly to them, as they go beyond themselves as individuals and become even more than a true character, they become immortal. Eva Green...was made for this role, or maybe the other way around...

1749,Penny Dreadful, A promising start,"The first episode of Penny Dreadful does a number of things right, making me hopeful for the future of this series.<br/><br/>1. The atmosphere is perfect: dense, Gothic, surreal and unsettling. The camera work is fluid and imaginative, and the grimy London settings are really well designed, almost expressionist at times. I was particularly impressed by the scenes in the gentlemen's club, shot from a high angle, and laid out in a curious Victorian grid-pattern.<br/><br/>2. The characters range from predictable but very welcome, to genuinely unique. Timothy Dalton is the former: a generic British adventurer, about equally suggestive of Alan Quatermain, as seen in Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and Sir Richard Francis Burton, real-life explorer extraordinaire. But the pink-haired Egyptologist is a character I've never quite seen before. His dialog is colorful, erudite and truly off-beat.<br/><br/>3. The dialog, now that we're on the subject, is literate and dense. This alone would make the show worth watching. There's a Victorian flamboyance about it, but also some real intellectual content. When's the last time you heard the word ""outré"" spoken by a character in a TV series?<br/><br/>4. The pace, the steady evolution of the plot, are a refreshing change. Too many shows are forced to rush ahead because they're not really about anything. Moment-to-moment activity is all they've got. Penny Dreadful feels like it's building up something more than that. (Time will tell.)<br/><br/>5. Finally, a very welcome omission: the shortage of jump-scares. There's really just one, and it's placed in such a way that it's almost a spoof of itself. Several other situations, which most shows would have exploited for a cheap shock, are handled with admirable subtlety. There is some gore, but no more than needed to establish a seriously scary tone, a sense of danger.<br/><br/>Penny Dreadful isn't exactly going where no entertainment has gone before. It's clearly 'inspired by' two previous efforts. Most obviously, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, a comic that came off rather poorly on the big screen. But also the very under-rated film Van Helsing, which brilliantly re-imagined the classic horror movies of the 1930s, but failed to find an audience perhaps because of its highly energetic style.<br/><br/>Penny Dreadful seems to have learned from both of these sources. Where League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was lightweight and loose with logic, Penny Dreadful is atmospheric and well-plotted. Where Van Helsing was kinetic and flamboyant, Penny Dreadful is quietly creepy.<br/><br/>All in all, it's off to a great start. Let's hope the producers can continue 'in the same vein.'<br/><br/>UPDATE: Closing in on the end of the 2nd season, my admiration for this series continues to grow. The atmosphere of Victorian menace is denser than ever. The characters more flamboyant, the dialog more poetic. I'm not sure where the story is going, or, indeed, if it needs to be headed for any specific destination, when every moment of it is so enjoyable.

This show loves the grotesque and downright sinister nature of storytelling and can depend on its actors to do the job right. <br/><br/>I am highly intrigued by what's to come.

Where Green can be both cold and beautiful Treadaway does an equally good job as a young Dr. Victor Frankenstein especially in the ""plant the flag on truth"" scene.<br/><br/>With the show currently in its initial stages much remains to be seen as to how it unfolds with so many characters (monsters??!!) to be introduced into a single plot. But as of now one thing is for sure that this show seems more about thrill and gore than horror. If that excites you then this show might be for you!",141 out of 220 found this helpful.,9.0,11 May 2014
1754,Penny Dreadful," Stunningly Beautiful, Powerful Gothic Horror","Where do I begin? This series is in a class by itself..Cinematography and music score from the opening credits to the episodes themselves is stunning and breathtaking to behold...Someone creating this has the heart of a poet and the eye of an artist..The dialogues are Intense, deep and soul stirring and the entire collection of actors here come across the screen as Absolutely giving their All to the performances...their heart and soul emote thru the scenes like no other production ive ever seen..its that intense...Some people have said its centered around eva green, and while Noone can do possession like eva, she is electrifying and terrifying to behold, id still say that ALL, each and every actor in this series has extraordinary screen presence and bring an incredible level of realism and feeling to their roles..This is gothic horror at its best...The dialogues between John clare and eva or dr frankenstein are heartwrenching and gut moving to hear...the beauty in the soul of ""the monster"", his aching lonlieness is palpable and makes you feel for him, despite the horrors he has committed. I am loving this series, as you can surely tell..its my 2nd time watching it,as i watched it 1st when it came out and now a few yrs later im even More impressed..The opening credits and score is so beautifully done, the timing of image to music and the choice of imagery, that i find myself Wanting to watch it and listen to it...Many other shows ,one skips thru the opening credits but Not this one!...This show is Art and poetry , beauty and horror told with great depth at levels that will move ur soul...Its a treat to the senses ...It is Gothic horror storytelling at its Very Finest!",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,8 July 2019
1755,Penny Dreadful, Excellent top quality production,"Well I'll try and not reveal much however Penny Dreadful is most certainly one of the best series on our screens at the moment. It is somewhat of a slow burner at times however it absolutely burns with a restrained ferocity very much like it's actors and characters. There's a palpable energy in every performance as there is a lot of meat to each character. Everyone is an anit-hero and personally I find all the performances very engaging. Timothy Dalton radiates a commanding and duplicitous presence that matches Eva Green's which is hard to do. Even more surprising is Josh Harnett and Harry Treadaway keeping toe to toe with them both also. Billy Piper's just warming up too. I'm a veteran Horror fan and rarely have I seen such quality in feature length movies. I just watched the last in the current series and it was emotional, the trick to the P Team is that the monsters are center stage and they are very human. Rory Kinnear induces both horror and extreme pathos that very much surprises. Logan has crafted something special, something very well thought out and acted and executed in every aspect with care. The script is the only one on screen at the moment that reminds me of The Game of Thrones in the fact that every line of dialogue is loaded with meaning, coupled with the Victorian setting means that everyone is hiding something and every word is crafted. Very unusual and highly recommended, nothing is as it seems in Penny Dreadful and the characters are all the more relatable for their failings and apparent monstrousity.",76 out of 116 found this helpful.,8.0,2 July 2014
1756,Penny Dreadful, A MASTERPIECE IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. Deeply misunderstood / underrated series.,"Penny Dreadful is NOT a trashy Splatter, nor a b movie with some weird scenes without any meaning.
I think a tv show as rich and complex as Penny Dreadful is not easy to advertise on a poster or a 10 second clip.
This is a reunification of all Classic gothic/horror classics, as all these stories and characters (for example Frankenstein and his creature, Dorian Gray, Characters from Dracula and much more) get intertwined in a new thrilling case. At it's center the mysterious Vanessa Ives, outstandingly played by Eva Green.
The main question that is asked is: What is it that makes us human?
It's so fascinating, so new - you don't have to know gothic literature, in fact this is an Amazing way to get to know all those iconic characters - I was fascinated when I found out that Frankenstein wasn't a monster, but a doctor who created a man, named Frankenstein's Monster. (Is he though?)
Every story, every character, although not being the center of the story anymore is presented in a authentic way that is true to the classic Material.
And the screenplay could be a classic or a poem itself, John Logan, the showrunner put all his literature knowledge and love for language into this piece and it shows and it is masterful.
Penny Dreadful is thrilling, adventurous and gives you all those gothic vibes, and a entertaining story without even being interested in the language or the references.
Nonetheless this tv show never loses its substance.
It pays homage to all those classic characters without letting them appear boring, but it feels like John Logan is giving every character a new possibility to shine and be unterstood in their new storylines.
Penny Dreadful is classic and visionary. Although some scenes are gruesome, it also has the most beautiful, philosophical, beautiful scenes in the world. It captures the melancholy and world-weariness of the romantic era and seems like a romantic classic itself.
Please watch! (And don't be intimidated by the opening sequence!) have fun!",16 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,2 August 2019
1757,Penny Dreadful, AMAZING!,"I'm so confused on how anyone could hate this beautify created show. Everything from story, to acting and cinematography are on point. You wish you could jump into the TV set and join the gang as they defeat evil. This show will capture you, frighten you, and even make you cry. It's got all the aspects of horror but has this beautiful way of also being a drama. Not just a drama, a drama that really shows us the Victorian era with all it's splendor and all it's unfortunate struggles with poverty. You will grow very attach to these characters and their inner demons. It's worth watching!!!!",17 out of 23 found this helpful.,10.0,29 October 2018
1758,Penny Dreadful, Really good Supernatural/Horror show!,Penny Dreadful is one of the better Supernatural/Horror TV series I've ever seen. While I have to admit that I'm not the biggest supernatural fan this hooked me from the start and kept me coming back for more until the next thing I knew I binged the entire series! Eva Green &amp; Josh Hartnett are the stars here as they lead a pretty stellar cast! I'm glad I finally gave it a chance as should you.,7 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,1 September 2020
1759,Penny Dreadful, One of the year's more pleasant surprises,"After a slightly shaky start, (I think trying to encapsulate the stories of Frankenstein and his monster, Dracula, Dorian Gray, not to mention a rip-off of ""The Exorcist"", with a werewolf thrown in for good measure, might have been going a creature or two too far), ""Penny Dreadful"" turned out to be one of the year's more pleasant, as well as nastiest, surprises. Unlike the pretentious, art-house gore-fest that is ""Hannibal"" this was imaginative, fast-moving, just the right side of silly when it needed to be and intelligent, (and suitably gruesome), in just the right proportions, adhering very much to the spirit of the originals if not to their text. It was also very well acted by a decent and starry cast, (as a young Victor Frankenstein and his creature both Luke Treadaway and Rory Kinnear were outstanding while even Josh Hartnett acquitted himself quite well this time round), written and directed. For once I'm looking forward to Series Two already.",63 out of 101 found this helpful.,7.0,12 July 2014
1760,Penny Dreadful," Surprising, and exciting, well written, and beautifully produced.","If you have watched a lot of TV and you have ever asked what it would be like to mix Ripper Street with Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Supernatural, putting the whole thing on an unrated cable station, then you would possibly have had a show like this in mind. That nonsense aside this is a really well produced, and seems to be quite deeply thought out show that mixes all of the sense of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the opening act gave me a sensation of an early days origin story for R.I.P.D. some sort of Men in Black for the supernatural types. I Enjoyed this show quite a bit, it really does stand out in it's heavy levels of gore, and violence, and the acting Eva Green alone is just completely Ice on fire, but the rest of the cast are just as fantastic. I recommend this movie to fans of the science fiction mash-ups, as that is exactly what this is, if you like action, and can appreciate truly adult horror the corrupt, and dirty kind, then this is for you. The entire production is cinema quality, if you understand how many levels Banshee is above most TV, you will appreciate this show in a very similar way.<br/><br/>Jesse of Jesse.ca",89 out of 151 found this helpful.,9.0,10 May 2014

1762,Penny Dreadful, Incredible television-A modern Classic,"Few shows are able to bring to life inside of me a love of poetry, Shakespeare and the theater as this. This is truly a masterpiece of writing, acting, directing, costume and cinematography. Simply brilliant. The weaving of multiple story lines, each such rich and powerful stories on their own yet fused together to create a new uniquely powerful saga is the brilliance of the writers shining through. The acting of every person involved in the show is beyond reproach - I found myself feeling sad knowing this series was going to end and I would be back to American drivel. The actors are so given to their craft that they bring this series to life and create a heart wrenching, philosophical and spiritual piece of art into form. The cinematography, costume, set design and directing create a truly believable London and America of old. All of these elements tied together create one of those few and far between gems that live on to be classics.<br/><br/>Thank you to all involved in bringing this to life.

1763,Penny Dreadful, Don't be so sure you'll like this show.,"This show has everything to make an awesome show. I was expecting a lot but after watching the first season I ended up quite disappointed. Problem is that I should have liked this show. I like this type of shows, I like Showtime shows, I like the period and the theme. I even like the main actors. <br/><br/>This show is strange, awkward, slow, doll, lame, boring and often quite stupid and frustrating. I was always hoping it would get better but it never did. I fell asleep many times trying to watch the whole thing. I don't get how some people can claim this is scary even a little, I've seen spiders scarier than anything in this show. Everything in this show was done better so many times...<br/><br/>They mix creatures like vampire, werewolf and demon and characters like Van Helsing, Frankenstein or Dorian Gray. Yet the only thing I actually found interesting was this Dorian Gray which is really just some eccentric British dude...<br/><br/>At first characters are interesting cause you don't know anything about them so its the mystery around their story that is interesting. Yet the more you get to know the more they become lame and boring...<br/><br/>There's not a lot of action and when there is some its quite ordinary, banal and lame. The main story is quite messed up, slow paced and not interesting. Again the more you understand what's going on the more you think they had nothing to say and just wanted to mix things together to make a dark Gothic show.<br/><br/>On a more positive note its visually awesome, the costumes, accents, scenery and everything 19th century-like is really well made. Actors are all very good. Also I like how its always dark, dark colours and dark mood. Its nice that its a very mature show for adult.<br/><br/>Still, if they make more of this I hope they'll come up with a story that is actually a little bit interesting...

1764,Penny Dreadful, Don't know what a show can give you more,"I'm not a fantasy/fairytale fan or whatever, but Penny Dreadful is by far my most favorite tv show ever, along with Peaky Blinders (different genre, I know). You just can't imagine how good the acting is, the cinematography, the insane plot twists,... I often had to pauze the episodes because I had a big 'O M G' moment. I even had to cry sometimes. If you're doubting to watch the show: please do watch it.

1765,Penny Dreadful," The pilot is worth your penny, the rest is dreadful.","The rule of not judging a show by it's pilot seems true once again, except this time it's the other way around. Penny Dreadful starts out strong, with beautiful scenery, eloquent dialog, mysterious characters, drama, romance and the perfect amount of gore and horror. The show starts out in the fast lane, it leaves you wanting more. But then it takes a turn right into the traffic jam. The story lines unfold extremely slow, and although they provide some depth for the characters it also loses the element of surprise and the wonderfully set horror and action scenes from the pilot are scarce throughout the rest of the series and when they return, they are exactly the same. Of course, this series is based on well known horror stories so predictability is to be expected, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is no room for interpretation. The makers of Penny Dreadful seem to think otherwise, for the only thing that surprised me was Proteus demise. The grand storyline, the saving of Mina, is a quest that takes the guys from Supernatural or Buffy (with all respect) a mere episode of 40 minutes, and it would probably end in the exact same way. Penny Dreadful's league of extraordinary gentlemen takes 8 one hour episodes to do the same. This show is great for people who enjoy seeing Eva Green make funny faces and becoming less attractive each episode and for people who enjoy the anticipation of an undead monster losing it if his master doesn't do what he wants while having the patience to stand outside in the snow for 3 months. Oh, and if you thought that this first season would end with a bang, you will be disappointed. There is nothing that will leave you wanting more, no cliffhanger, nothing except for a few small confirmations of what you've been expecting to happen some 3 or 4 episodes ago...",74 out of 146 found this helpful.,4.0,8 October 2014

1767,Penny Dreadful," Very engaging, but some annoying odds and sods...","I like the programme considerably, but find little bits and pieces quite distracting, unfortunately. It brings together characters from many different pieces of literature, in particular gothic novels, written around (I use the term loosely) the Victorian era.
We have Victor Frankenstein and his monster(s), Count Dracula and Van Helsing, with other vampires too, Dorian Gray, Dr Jekyll, and Witches, some of which could be said to be from Macbeth, due to the lines they utter.
Historical inaccuracies can be annoying to some degree. I don't wish to pull apart what is already fiction, but some features are difficult to ignore, eg, women didn't have short hair, ie above their shoulders in the 19th century. In the Victorian era, smoking wasn't thought of as bad or something you needed to ""quit"", as it is now, and the use of morphine &amp; other opiates were acceptable.<br/><br/>Changes in the literature that Penny Dreadful is based on I find unforgiveable. Dr Jekyll wasn't from India - in the Victorian era that would have been unheard-of. Even if what took place then is now thought to be politically incorrect, we can't change history. Robert Louis Stevenson(the author) was Scottish. Dorian Gray viewed a portrait of himself which aged, as he remained young, unlike like the painting shown, which he referred to as his secret. Victor Frankenstein wouldn't have appeared like a modern day junkie through his use of morphine in the 1890's.<br/><br/>A period piece is that, whether factual or fictional. Throwing modern day nuances may make it feel more relevant to those who are viewing it now, but they remove the historical essence from the story.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,7.0,26 June 2020

1771,Castlevania, Possibly the first good video game adaptation.,"I'll cut this short. Castlevania is only 4 episodes due to it being the prequel to the actual show, Season 2 will feature 8 episodes based on Castlevania 3. Adi Shankar might have questionable taste in makeup, but his work ethic is incredible. Every person working on Castlevania was made to play Castlevania 3 on an NES from Ebay. This show wasn't made to rake in dollars, its first and primary concern is to make it into a goddamn masterpiece and while its not finished so I really should be more responsible with the way I'm rating it, from what I've seen I'm damn impressed. The animation quality is incredible, above most Japanese anime which this show clearly mimmicks. Voice acting is perfect across the board, the action is visceral and gory, but not mindless. The story and its pacing is unique and doesn't pick up on many generic tropes. It's a unique prequel to what is yet to come. <br/><br/>This show is for adults, its almost objectively the best western ""anime"" (Korra was primarily animated by a Korean studio, that said I'd still rate this higher) and unless you like good bad movies enough, its the best video game adaptation I've ever seen. <br/><br/>Honestly I haven't felt hyped for anything for possibly a decade now, I've learned that hype results in nothing, but considering the directors work ethic, his past work, experience and what Castlevania is right now, I can't feel anything but hype.",265 out of 313 found this helpful.,10.0,7 July 2017
1772,Castlevania, A review of Season 3,"You know, I never imagined Netflix's Castlevania would turn out to be such a solid series back when the first season came out. Season 2 was phenomenal and Season 3 might be even better.<br/><br/>Taking place not long after the events of the last season, Castlevania Season 3 starts off strong with a focus on dialogue and character development which continues on for the majority of the episodes in a slower pace than what we've been used to before but justified and interesting since now there are several new characters, the world and lore is expanding (amazing worldbuilding), and the characters we know already getting further development (well-written and voice acted). There's also a lot of politics and scheming, kinda giving you early Game of Thrones vibes, and all of it was intriguing.<br/><br/>And while that's great and all, we are also treated to some truly magnificent fight sequences where the animators flex like crazy. And since the story grows and flows properly, those sequences become even more enthralling and thrilling aptly personifying the world 'Climax'.<br/><br/>On a technical level, it's a straight-up bump across the board. The art, the animation, the sound design, the soundtrack, all of it has been improved and I loved it.<br/><br/>It's hard to say whether I prefer season 2 over season 3 or the other way around because my favourite character is Dracula. But what I can safely say is that if you've enjoyed the previous two seasons, Season 3 will surely blow your mind. There's so much in it I didn't even expect or imagine that I'm purposefully being vague in order to not spoil anything. Watch it asap, I highly recommend it. And if I were to rate Season 3, I'd give it a 9/10.<br/><br/>P.S Trevor and Sypha are so cute together. And BADASS!",69 out of 81 found this helpful.,9.0,10 March 2020

On top of that, it follows my favorite Belmont, Trevor. While of course it had no ""Vania-esque"" music like the games, it did not need it. It felt in every way like a faithful Castlevania anime.

And really, really good voice acting! I know there have been good American animated shows and movies made, but to me, the last time I saw such great English voice acting paired with Japanese (style) animation was the Spawn animated series. I consider that series a classic and outsider... and now we may well have another!<br/><br/>There are obviously a number of quality pieces put into place to make this series - production, cast, writing. This is exactly the type of project a fan holds their breath and hopes, but does not have too high of expectations. Expectation shattered - this is high quality stuff! Very brutal content including horrific deaths of innocents, graphic violence, and no mercy shown... Hooray!!!<br/><br/>The villain, Dracula, is humanized immediately, which gives him cause and texture - not just a mindless slayer. The hero has a number of anti-hero qualities, which just makes him more interesting. Undoubtedly this series will unfold with a number of awesome battles and conversations that question morality, cause and purpose.<br/><br/>The content obviously will not be for everyone - wholesale slaughter of religions figures, women and children may prove to much for some, but for others?

Everything is in place for success, production wise, but the content (by comparison to the first season) is restrained, common, Boring. the charm of the first season was how refreshing the content was, which included exciting, entertaining, sinister content. The first scene in season 2 attempts this, but does so in a completely anti-entertainment manner! All the fun of the first season is absolutely smashed right to begin with, then the viewer gets 2-4 episodes of dialog, with very little action, and when thing finally do get going? Not that interesting! What happened? It's like the main creative force behind the first season was intentionally fired, and someone more PC was hired to make a generic, boring (albeit well produced) sequel!

1780,Castlevania, This is what Berserk (2016) should have been.,"Really solid production from Netflix that knows its target audience and doesn't pull any punches. Make no mistake; this is animated fare strictly for adults. And that's perfectly fine.<br/><br/>The 2016 production of Berserk has sadly skimped on production values, leaving fans of the longtime manga series with a sour taste in their mouths. Castlevania, however, scratches much of that same itch. It's gratuitously violent, dark as pitch, and set in a medieval fantasy world. The writers go straight for the jugular and pull no punches, obviously inspired by Berserk and other series like it. It's refreshing considering that the original owners of the Castlevania IP, Konami, have taken an obvious downturn in the quality production of their various legendary properties recently in favor of instead developing pachinko and gambling machines and firing longtime creative leads such as Hideo Kojima. Fans of the series need not worry, plenty of the classic Castlevania feel is here, treated with proper reverence by the shows writers and directors.<br/><br/>The animation is very good, and the art in particular is superb. Animated features and series have been steadily improving since the dawn of the HD era, and Castlevania continue to represent them well. The English voice cast shines as well, with Armitage's performance standing out among the others. He does a fantastic job as Trevor Belmont.<br/><br/>My only complaint here is the brevity of the series. Four ~23 minute episodes is not that much content, and it makes me wonder whether Netflix wouldn't have been better served to put this ""season"" out as a feature-length prologue film instead in order to advertise a lengthier season 2. But all-in-all, it's worth the time, especially to those interested in the Castlevania series, but even to those unfamiliar with it and in search of a gritty, well-animated, well- acted piece of dark medieval fantasy.",84 out of 120 found this helpful.,8.0,8 July 2017
1781,Castlevania, Low for the series - still possible to redeem.,"Blunt right from the top, season 3 was a mess.<br/><br/>I'll start with the lows and end with the highs.<br/><br/>Dialogue was hammed up really hard, they tried way too hard to make Trevor and Sypha a familiarized couple and it lands poorly a lot of the time despite some good lines here and there. The quirky schtick was a bad gimmick that might have been funny if they only dropped it once and did not carry it on so long. I'll add in the sisters here too, every last one but Lenore was unbearably presumptuous and stupid. Carmilla was reduced to a whiner, Striga did literally nothing but state obvious crap as if it was genius and Morana did even less than that. Lenore was at least tolerable in that she appeared to have multiple facets in being a character. She enjoyed being cruel but realizes you capture more with honey. In other words she's at least believable in that you may get some ""walkies"" if you do what she wants and so you probably shouldn't stab her in the back as soon as you can. The rest of the characters have some seriously ambiguous and vague motivations that I won't spoil here but lets just say if you read someone as rubbing you the wrong way, your instincts are probably very correct. There's some real mustache twirling levels of cartoonish villainy in just being so predictably evil.<br/><br/>Then we have Alucard and literally everything going on around him... Everything about him this season should have been scrapped and I'm not even harping on the bi sex scene at the end. I'm talking about how completely and totally useless everything that happened there was other than to give us a reminder that he still exists and trying badly to give a storyline to justify looking back to him every now and then. Taka and Sumi were terrible. All around they were completely grating. Their dialogue was trash, their motivations were nonsensical, their turnabout could be seen coming from the very first sparring match... Total garbage that did nothing but waste time. God don't let that be a setup for Alucard being the next big bad when Trevor and Sypha come back to question his yard decorations.<br/><br/>Now after that mega pill to swallow, the high points. Despite some clear drops in quality the fight scenes remain clever and brutal. Sypha has got to be one of the most OP characters in the series by now. Ice magic shields used angel vivisection, she is a meatgrinder. Can't stress enough how much damage she can do. Trevor shows he's a capable man with just his hands several times over, he can and will fold people up like a lawn chair. Classy bringing the OG whip back alongside the vampire killer for a bit of fanservice. The music for the finale is absolutely up there with Bloody Tears in season 2. The final showdown definitely shows where the extra effort missing from the prior animation went, it is phenomenal with some dynamic camerawork and gruesome kills.<br/><br/>Isaac is by far my favorite of this series, he chews the scenery, his dialogue is stellar, his story is the best. I would easily watch a season of nothing but Isaac and the Captain. He's the most compelling antagonist the series has set up so far. He pulls this rating all the way up to a 7 for me, I want to see where he goes.",38 out of 51 found this helpful.,7.0,10 March 2020

1784,Castlevania," 🏰 Castlevania, A Helluva Good Show!!!🗡","Well after having watched the first three segments of ""Castlevania"" I feel like I can say they get progressively better with each season. I'll briefly mention the first season and review the second and third seasons soon. In season one we are introduced to Lisa of Lupu. She is a brave woman who is seeking knowledge of medical science in hopes bettering mankind. She goes to the castle of Vlad Tepes, also known as ""Dracula"" by the locals, to seek his guidance. Even though Vlad is known to despise humanity and slaughter people who bother him Lisa confidently goes to his door and introduces herself to him. Dracula becomes infatuated with her and they soon marry even though he is vampire. They have a son they name ""Alucard"" (Dracula spelled backwards). For twenty years they are happily married and Vlad travels abroad (Lisa's request) to better know mankind. However in the twentieth year religious fanatics from the Archbishop capture Lisa and declare her science ""witchcraft""! She is publicly burned at the stake, crying out for Dracula to not take vengeance on them because they don't know what they are doing. As expected Dracula returns from his travels and is ENRAGED when he finds out what has happened. He goes to the city in a giant, red, fiery form in the sky and gives them exactly one year before he unleashes total HELL on them. Next we are introduced to Trevor Belmont. He is the last of his lineage from a famous family of vampire hunters who seems down and out of luck. Trevor's luck changes when he rescues the magic wielding Sypha Belnades from a dungeon where she had been petrified to stone by a cyclops. She then decides to stay at Trevor's side for the meantime since they presumably have the same interests. Together they slay various undead monsters and creatures of the night. They finally manage to free Dracula's son Alucard from his imprisonment and get his help (after a brief skirmish). This pretty much ends season one. Will continue season two and three soon.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,12 March 2020
1785,Castlevania, Starts off strong.,"I watched season one and the first few episodes of season two. The beginning is pretty interesting, but over time it just gets more boring. All the technical aspects, voice acting, animation, and music are fantastic though so there's that.",11 out of 14 found this helpful.,7.0,6 January 2019
1786,Castlevania, Somewhat decent start - downhill from there,"The animation is decent for the most part. Some of it is really good, but sometimes the quality really drops and has some choppy bits. The English as well as the German dub (I switched halfway through) are rather weak. Some of the voices are good, but some are just annoyingly bad.<br/><br/>If you don't want to be spoiled in terms of the story, then stop reading right here.<br/><br/>Regarding the story I'd describe the three seasons as follow:<br/><br/>Season 1:
Dracula falls in love with a random woman that has basically no personality and wanders into his castle because she likes science. He becomes a ""Simple Insignificant Male Peasant"" travelling around. The woman is just there to give birth to his son (Alucard - how ""clever"") and then to be burned at the stake for witchcraft. This pisses Dracula off and he wants to kill all humans. The basic theme of season one is ""humans and especially Christians are bad and must die""<br/><br/>Season 2:
Dracula has now a gender and racially diverse cast of generals and is depressed. He basically wants to everyone and himself to die. At the end of the season he dies with most of his diverse cast of generals. The ones that die haven't spoken a word in 8 episodes. So they are just there to die and I guess to fill a quota. Also the general them of the season is ""Vampires are also just bad and actually worse than humans"". We got three main characters traveling together and somehow two of them get into a romance (feels kinda forced to be honest)<br/><br/>Season 3:
It's basically filler to set up season 4. We have four completely separate story lines that never come together at any point. Alucard is in his castle and gets a Japanese girl and boy to play, later have sex with (guy on guy action included) and then to impale them. The hunter and the mage go into a local town and deal with a cult of dracula worshipping monks who want to get him back from hell. Very obvious stuff and not very clever in terms of the writing. Then two story lines go to the bad guys where one is about manipulation and control and the other about getting ready for revenge. The basic theme again is basically ""humans and vampires are trash"".<br/><br/>
It's kind off funny how the third season is the longest with ten episodes even though it is literally just filler because Dracula died in season 2 and everybody split up. The behavior as well as the dialogue of the characters feels very ""modern"" which is not really good. There is a lot of ideology driven stuff in the show as well. Look at the character of Striga and then tell me what exactly defines that character as a woman. There's literally nothing feminine about that thing. Then we have Alucard in a threesome with him being serviced by a guy and a girl including anal action. There is Carmilla complaining several times about ""old men"" standing in her way. And the way Sypha as a character is handles is also very annoying. She supposedly is the brains of the trio that knows magic and can read books. The hunter Trevor Belmond is basically just a fighter that can neither read properly nor has any decent education. He's mostly there to fail at being sarcastic and have melee fights with the creatures. Sypha is basically much more powerful in the fights due to her magic.<br/><br/>There is also a lot of inconsistencies when it comes down to power levels. Normal soldiers, guards and towns people are never shown to stand any chance against the monsters and vampires. When the main characters come in and start fighting suddenly the monsters are much more easy to handle. Trevor even though related to monster hunters is based on the story just a normal human being with knowledge on weapon usage. For some reason he can get really close and hold creatures with pure physical strength. Other soldiers seem to be incapable of that. So a lot of the fighting just feels boring once you get further into the show. Also the way weapons and especially that magic metallic whip Trevor uses handle is very inconsistent. Sometimes it's an explosion right away after a hit and sometimes that weapon feels awfully weak with what is being shown. There is a certain consistency with the inconsistency in this regard though.<br/><br/>Anyway I watched through all three seasons which I guess is a positive as I didn't outright turn it off. Still The more I think about the show and its content the more problems I see there and I don't know if I'll look at season 4 once it's out.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,4.0,6 May 2020
1787,Castlevania," I expected an okay, fun ride. I got a masterpiece.","I went in expecting a fun romp, perhaps with a nice homage or two. What did I get? Video Games answer to Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>I am not too heavily invested in the original Castlevania series. My first and really, only game that I played was ""Symphony of the Night"". Truly a work of art, a masterpiece but I didn't play the games prior and only saw the games after on YouTube walkthroughs. Though I learned a bit about the rather rich lore.<br/><br/>When I heard this was being made, I didn't know what to make of it. There are way too many bad movies and TV shows based on video games (which is sadly nearly all of them) and some of them had NO RIGHT to be bad. Max Payne, Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed immediately come to mind in that regard. Even the Final Fantasy movie, Spirits Within was rather lackluster and it was directed by the series creator and visionary, Hironobu Sakaguchi (Though I think there were production issues and ""too many chefs in the kitchen"" during that time)! I had just given up on VG to screen adaptations.<br/><br/>Then after many friends told me to watch these few episodes, I was curious at most... but then it grabbed my attention when I heard that after the series premiered and got critical acclaim; a second season was confirmed and announced IMMEDIATELY after it was released. So I made time for it... and I am so sorry I didn't watch it earlier. It is nothing short of spectacular!<br/><br/>It opens up with a scene which was heavily inspired by Symphony of the Night (I won't dare spoil it) and it shows WHY Dracula is the world's enemy... and it's really friggin' heart breaking! Then we're introduced to Trevor Belmont in a way that is both epic and hilarious!<br/><br/>I think that's where I should stop because I don't want to spoil even the slightest detail. The characters are great, the voice acting is absolutely brilliant! Kudos to Armitage, Reynoso, McTavish, Frewer and ESPECIALLY Callis! I did not expect that voice to come from James Callis, so low and rich and he's surprisingly intimidating when he wants to be.<br/><br/>The score is great too, but it's Trevor Morris. I've come to expect good work from him. Seriously, I don't get why he hasn't composed a score for something like a Marvel movie yet he really knows how to work the scenes.<br/><br/>The writing is outstanding. Warren Ellis is a very solid writer, his work on the 2011 X-Men animated series is truly something to admire. The animation is BEAUTIFUL! Absolutely stunning! Anime inspired styles done by a Western is something I do have a soft spot for, even the ones which are a bit ""standard"" !but this is just gorgeous-and where, WHERE did they find Sam Deats!? What an incredible debut! Apparently, this is the first thing he has ever worked on as a director... That is hard to believe. This is definitely a love project, you could FEEL the respect that was being put into this!<br/><br/>It goes to show that when creative freedom is given to the right people, you really can make artistic magic with ANYTHING! Right here is proof that video game to screen adaptations can work. It took nearly two score and twain, but they finally did it!<br/><br/>Kudos to Sam Deats and the entire cast and crew for this masterpiece! Also, expect a few Annies to go to this series. I'm expecting Callis to get the award for voice performance as Alucard.",37 out of 57 found this helpful.,10.0,24 August 2017
1788,Castlevania, Amazing so far!!,"There is a lot happening in Castlevania and not much of a backstory has been provided in the first season which works as a positive for the show and one of the reasons that make this show quite intriguing. The characters may not feel fresh to some viewers but the storytelling has been an absolute treat in this season.<br/><br/>On some research, I got to know that it is based on a horror fantasy video game series of the same name and I have a feeling that it will definitely be living up to the game's standards or may even surpass that.<br/><br/>P.S. - I'm not sure why the trivia mentions that 'The series is in the vein of Game of Thrones'.

1789,Castlevania, A good show hindered by its budget,"In four short episodes that amount to just over one and a half hour, Castlevania does a good job of introducing its basic plot and characters. Due to time constraints, this is all the first season does, and they couldn't have made a better decision. The atmosphere is great and the static backgrounds are a treat to the eyes. The biggest problem is in the animation. Often, movements are limited and stilted. The voice acting is great, but the almost static faces fail to live up to what the characters are saying. Hopefully, the creators will have a larger budget in season 2(the show has been renewed for 8 new episodes), and will address the technical issues that prevent Castlevania from being as thrilling as it should,",50 out of 81 found this helpful.,7.0,8 July 2017

1791,Castlevania," Season one was great, season two...ehhh","Alright, lets get this out of the way, I've already left one and praised the series and I still think it deserves it. However, as good as it was, Season two was a bit of a disappointment. I went in expecting Dracula to be a genuinly threatening villain who actually DID something, rather than being a lifeless plank of wood. After his explosion at the start of Season One, seeing him so broken and depressed was disappointing.
Not only that, but the entirety of season two felt rushed and the fights, while visually impressive, were also somewhat underwhelming. I would have liked to see Dracula's generals get some character development and maybe give them all time in the spotlight. That may have resulted in the series ending up as a bit of a saturday morning cartoon, but I dont think that I even know what most of them were called!
It would have been a better option to have the three heroes have to fight their way through Castlevania to Dracula and actually fight them in half decent fights, rather than getting taken out by two Humans and a Dhampir like complete idiots.
In short, the second season was visually stunning with decent characters and dialog, but lousy fights and a general sense of being rushed out the door and a completely disappointing Dracula. Certainly no match for Hellsings Alucard.",31 out of 51 found this helpful.,7.0,31 October 2018

The main character is simply amazing and the complexity of the story just captured me 100%. The first episode and the way it ends was just brilliant and clever. Instantly I was invested in all the main characters and their own stories and how they came together. Loved the way it was shot as it was stunning, the story has so many unanswered questions.

1805,The OA, Cryptic Dimensions!,"The OA left many questions to be answered behind with the first season finale and was highly appreciated by the audience. The OA's second season is quite chaotic and confusing.<br/><br/>In the first season, all the theories that came to mind were refuted and an unexpected scenario was written. The OA, which is the most watched series at a time in Netflix, arouses your curiosity with its unexpected plot and never lets you get away with it. In the second season of the series, you understand that the first season is an impressive story in its own right, and it is a preparation for the complex concepts that will be put ahead. In the first season, we find ourselves in a more complex world while watching the life and death issues after death; multiple universe theories and when we die we wake up in one of the parallel universes. In the first season, while watching the life and death issues after death, and in the second season we find ourselves in a more complex world; multiple universe theories and when we die we wake up in one of the parallel universes.<br/><br/>The second season brings together the universe we remembered from the first season and the universe where Prairie wakes up as Nina Azarova after being shot in the school. So the characters we know from the first season are the same but the events developed with small differences. This caused Prairie to wake up in a universe where Nina Azarova's father did not die and she was not adopted. In this universe, the main tasks of Prairie are to find Homer, in which she has come through difficult ways to integrate with Nina Azarova and to be together.<br/><br/>The fact that the first season ended with Homer's name was a clue to us. Yes, Prairie finds Homer in this new universe, but in a completely different way: Homer is not aware of anything in this new universe. In spite of Prairie's efforts, Homer's recollection of his past life is entirely through the integration of Prairie with Nina Azarova. According to Elodie, one of the new characters in the series, the lives of Prairie, Homer and Hap are interdependent. They will find each other in whatever universe they are. This is the truth that prepares us for the third season. In the final episode, we are moving to a completely different dimension. While this dimension answers the question of what's behind the mosaic glass in the season, it also prepares us for developments in the third season. I hope that future seasons will be enriched by adding new layers. 8/10",170 out of 203 found this helpful.,8.0,19 May 2019

This is not a show to simply pay half attention to, or to have on for background noise. This show demands all of you, it will pull you into its vortex. If you enjoy cinema that can truly move you to your core, like Into the Void, Inception, or even Requiem for a dream; really shake your perception of reality, then please give this a chance.

1820,The OA, Overview response may contain a spoiler by accident.,"I binge watched all 8 episodes, and am now reviewing them more slowly. Another reviewer stated that this series is slow and boring ... well, not to me. This show gives a lot of interesting insight into questions like what is madness, what is sanity, what happens to the psychology of people when they are trapped in impossible circumstances of all kinds, when are emotions helpful when are they harmful? There is a lot more I am thinking about, but I do not want to accidentally want to include a spoiler. I could see a second season but it stands alone well too. The psychology of the ""parents"" and the ""adults"" is as interesting as any other part of the story. They show different kinds of traps, differing ways of being a prisoner and differing ways of breaking free.There is a lot of psychology and philosophy being explored in this series. Lots of referential material to quite a few cultures. The many subtexts are every bit as intriguing as the main text.",191 out of 272 found this helpful.,9.0,1 January 2017

But of course; it's not perfect but then again, nothing is.<br/><br/>Gaten is perfect for this show so I'm really happy that he is taking part in it, but I feel as though quite a few of the 'actors' who are meant to be in on the pranks, are a bit on the amateur side when it comes to acting. The first episode was good and different to any of the pranks that I've seen before (and I've seen many), but the actors just didn't seem to act normal and in a way. It's important for them to not appear too strangely otherwise the people who are being pranked, will of course suspect something is going on.<br/><br/>Anyway, while the first episode wasn't great on the acting side, the story was really good and it did have me laughing out loud at one point! Yes, I was shocked.... and I believe this show is worth watching since the second episode was more believable (with an improvement on acting).<br/><br/>So it's a thumbs up from me.

Content like this would have been so beneficial to me, and others like me, if I was able to watch this at a younger age. The movie it's based off of is one of my favorite movies of all time but where this show really sets itself apart is how it handles the familial experience. I'm completely captivated by the journey the character takes and can relate to so many aspects of this. It's so important that this story is being told on this platform and I hope they continue to expand and diversify the telling of it. Straight people had so many examples of love and friendship while growing up and the LGBT+ community were left to journey through the dark. I know this just came out but I came here to praise this in all of its excellence before the career trolls arrived to attack it and minimize its efforts.

It's not another stupid rom-com. It's nice to see a lead character who is gay, most LGBT characters are in supportive roles. Seems like most of the LGBT characters in network and streaming series are lesbian characters, perhaps because two women kissing doesn't make hetero men uncomfortable like watching two men kissing does. The main thing that I disliked about Love, Victor was it's 30 minute episodes, too much time is lost to the opening intro and ending credits.

Flat characters and a played out plot do not make for good tv and here we have another example of content that fails to bring anything new to viewers. Sometimes it would be nice when the coming out experience isn't the main plot. Maybe a little focus on something good would be a nice change in a mainstream show aimed at a queer audience.

I started watching this before 10 am this morning on June 17. I wasn't thinking it was gonna be on when I had turned Hulu on thinking one ep will be out later on in the day. But to my surprise it was available to watch when I turned on Hulu for the first time at about 10 am. I watched the first episode and was like this is great, it cute watch. After I finished watching that ep there was a second one so I watched it. I was excited to see what was happening next in the story. Then when that was done there was a another so I looked it after that and realized that Hulu had put out ten episodes which make up the first season. So I binged watched it all. There are some many things this show touches on like lgbt love, being confused about who you love, about there parents not being perfect, about having trust in people after they cheat, moving in the middle of the school year and what that like, being pregnant, dating, and older people with there belief and stand up for what you believe in and so much more. I could relate to victor being confused about what gender he loved. I loved the fact that show was talking about more then just victor loved. I loved that not all the characters in the show were white. That showed diverse. All of the couples had great chemistry together. Victor and the girl were good together but they almost seem more like friends then lovers Becuse victor wasn't full end on the romance with her from the beginning. There was ton of drama like when the parents fought for example. There was enough drama to keep the show entertaining. Every character had a good storyline and plot. The story had good acting, storyline, plot line, messages, editing, characters development, characters in it. This is a lgbt story. But there also straight couples in it. High school can be hard so I can understand some of the things the character did in the story when it come to the students. I couldn't believe when benji (might spell that name wrong). Broke up with his boyfriend and kissed victor. There so many lose ends that the last episode give us. I loved when victor stood up for benji and his was boyfriend at his birthday party in front of his grandparents when they asked benji not to be his self basically. His parent were proud when victor did that. I did take off a star Becuse they mentioned love Simon way too many times in this show. So I do hope there another season that going to come out. This show to great for everyone no matter the age. I think this will inspire a lot of people. Plus it will make people feel like they can be themself no matter who they love Becuse of shows that normalize lgbt people.

1872,Hanna, [7.5] Season 2_ Little Alias with teens,"Though I hoped that this season would be better than the first, as per my review about 5 months ago, I was kinda let down.<br/><br/><ul><li>The story is not better than season 1.</li><li>We've got sort of 5 episodes of fillers and 3 more serious and better ones.</li><li>We do not see Hanna more in action (aside the last 3 serious episodes). She should be more on the spotlight, with shininess and more crazy good performances. She is like a human ""Bionic"" girl with awesome abilities and amazing aiming. The producers &amp; writers really need to understand that and give her increased brilliant spots to shine (martial arts and guns alike).</li><li>Sandy (Áine Rose Daly) was one of the highlight of the season. She's a talented and beautiful actress who has the potential to become a really bad yet powerful smart girl in the series.</li><li>Nothing of real interest for Marissa, aside adding mother-like behaviors to her collection in the show; Although, her personal style of handling guns are one of the best I saw in women and men alike.</li></ul><br/><br/>

I loved everything about this TV show. It was shot well, the scenery and locations were amazing. Finally something different than USA. Europe is also beautiful and worth exploring.<br/><br/>The screen filter was not the typical one you see for European locations by American film/TV makers. Unlike other productions shot with this grainy, darker filter, making you thing that streets of Europe are polluted, dirty , always dark locations - here everything has natural feel to it. Forests, cities are full of charm which is even more striking during spectacular action sequences.<br/><br/>The story will take you all over Europe. You will be following steps of Hannah, a fugitive teenager chased by CIA. All the dark secrets are waiting for you to explore them. Awesome. All of the actors did a really good job. Joel Kinneman and Mirelle Enos playing Marrisa Wiegler are spectacular.<br/><br/>There are no good/evil characters here which I really like about the show. Hannah did a great job too.

1881,Hanna, Solid thriller/action series,"Overall, Far did a pretty good job expanding his creation. Season 1 does an excellent job in recreating and expanding the original story, balancing action and chills with greatly gratifying character development, that ends with an impressive (altough stormtrooper-aim-ish) action packed chapter. Season 2 only gets better, slowly building up character and plot until it reaches a really satisfactory finale, if you got invested in the characters (I may understand that people who came for the explosive action might not like the slower, character building chapters, but I can only find them awesome from an history telling standpoint, and everyone who hasn't got the attention span of a jellyfish between action sequences will surely do)<br/><br/>The cast is also superb: Esmé gives a very convincing portrayal of the leading role, which seems to fit her perfectly, and Mireille Enos (Marissa Wigler) and Aine Rose Daily (Sandy) make two of the best antagonistic figures I have seen lately. Joel Kinnaman (Erik) altough a little wooden, seems to be recovering the talent of yore. The cinematography is also on point, with the photography and the locations giving a really aesthetically pleasing feel. Minor plot contrivances and character inconsistences deprive the series of a whole 10, but its nonetheless one I would eagerly recommend.",21 out of 28 found this helpful.,9.0,25 July 2020
1882,Hanna, S2 = Teenage Drama Series?!,"So far four episodes into season 2 I am not enjoying this one bit. How did this show go from being about an assassin girl military project to being this teenage drama crap? It originally appeared to be a good series for adults included but now it appears to only be trying to appeal to young teenage girls! I mean for fcksake all the girls staying at The Meadows getting trained have signs all over their bedroom walls about female empowerment and putting men down. Oh but of course they have the conversations about being lesbians and how they are attracted to women blah blah blah.
How did this show get ruined? Why was this allowed to happen? The directors, writers are all to blame for this crap!
Also, Hanna is now being kept at The Meadows with all the other trainee girls and everyone is surprised that she is so skilled and awesome at the drills and killing people? Why would she be thrown in with the trainees when she's been out in the real world killing people for years? That was just stupid... Clara screwing her over and setting her up was also pathetic. Hanna should have killed her! Oh but now they're best friends again. Right!

1883,Hanna, I liked it quite a lot,"I liked the movie. The TV show is not the movie, but both share the same creator/writer. IMO that makes the changes okay: different mediums require different drafts of the same story.<br/><br/>The acting is different, especially in the case of portraying Hanna, but it's fine because: different actors working in a different medium with different scripts/stories. The acting is good, even very good and IMO viewers should not worry about the differences and focus on what is presented.*<br/><br/>What is presented is very, very good. Good script, good narrative structure, good direction, good editing, good musical direction, good acting and good cinematography add up to much more than the sum of it's parts.<br/><br/>There are some potential plot holes, mostly having to do with recent and rapid technological advances, but S1E1 was both enjoyable and intriguing.<br/><br/>*The main difference people will notice is in how in the movie, Hanna was characterized as somewhat other-worldly and aloof, due to her upbringing and, as we find out, possibly due to her real origins. In this show, Hanna is different, and the only problem I had was that she came across too much like a regular teenager, which she is not. I suspect that aspect will become moot as she moves thru society, since part of her upbringing includes being able to blend in. Based on that, I just tried to ignore my annoyance and focus on the positive aspects of the portrayal as I watched.",122 out of 198 found this helpful.,9.0,5 February 2019

I'm not even finished with the second season and the lapse of logic has been astounding. Character growth is dumb inconsistent. One episode she does things that she has no justification for knowing how to do, the next she's throwing a temper tantrum like if she was still that dumb little girls from episode 1. This isn't just her thought, almost all main characters go from overly cautious &amp; or super competent to incredibly careless &amp; or incompetent the next.

I just finished episode 5 and I am bored out of my mind.<br/><br/>The show is about troubled teenagers suffering from teenage angst. It is about teenage relationship drama. At one point Hanna is reading a magazine with an article telling her how to know if she likes a boy. The adults, figure less and less prominently in every episode, to the point where it is just teenagers drinking and doing drugs at parties and nightclubs for WAY WAY too much of the movie to be interesting, in an attempt to show Hanna growing up - Ya we got it 4 hours ago, move the story along now.<br/><br/>The show tackles teenage homosexuality, bi-racial relationships, divorce, teenage loss of virginity, teenage drug and alcohol use, and more, and I still have 3 episodes to suffer through, if I can survive the boredom. What the show doesn't have is one normal, well-adjusted, likeable character- and that is with some fantastic actors, so I guess we have to blame the director.<br/><br/>If you are a teenager, and probably a female teenager, this show might kill a boring weekend for you if your parents have taken you to the cabin far from civilization; otherwise, it is hard to imagine how anyone could like this show.",153 out of 275 found this helpful.,2.0,2 April 2019
1893,Hanna, Starts out good but quickly falls apart and become a young teen drama,"The action scenes in the first season had me hooked and I could look past the backstory and coming of age scenes for a new girl learning about the world. Maybe a 6 star 1st season, some annoying parts for sure.<br/><br/>Now season 2 is a whole lotta mess. Constant teenage banter and each episode is chock full of it with maybe 5% action. The complete reverse of the first season. This tv series is for 12-17 year olds who are struggling with teen problems such as social media issues, sex, drinking, lesbian love and anything else that I missed.<br/><br/>It's shocking how this got greenlit. I had to tap out after 4.5 of the 8 episodes and no doubt they will extend it to season 3 and 4, much like 13 reasons why. Just make up teen problems and keep going.

1895,Hanna, Interesting interpretation then divergence from the movie. Good series.,"The 2011 movie ""Hanna"" is one of my favorites, but in reality a lot of story is compressed into its running time.<br/><br/>Here Amazon Prime is offering roughly 6 hours of story over 8 episodes. The first one, which I saw last night, is a good start. The actress who plays Hanna is the daughter of Samantha Morton and she is fine in the role, but quite different from what Ronan brought to the role in the movie. As the series progressed I found myself liking the new Hanna character more and more. By the end of season #2 she owned the role.<br/><br/>The basic premise is the same but it is told somewhat differently. It is a bit darker and grittier and the scene where Hanna is discovered and captured is done quite differently from what is depicted in the movie. Neither good nor bad, just different. Also throughout they added enough ""salty"" language to get an ""R"" rating if this were a movie.<br/><br/>Now that I have watched the whole series I can say ""pretty good effort."" While all the storylines are consistent with the movie most are depicted quite differently, a lot more depth and extrapolation are added to the basic story lines and, most of it works quite well.<br/><br/>It is not useful to directly compare this 8-part series to the 2011 ""Hanna"" movie because they had different goals and they accomplished them differently. I say ""kudos"" to Amazon for bringing us this very entertaining series.<br/><br/>Season #1 ended close to where the movie ended so season #2 had to do an extrapolation of ""what might have become of Hanna"". It does a credible job of inventing something new. The experimental program to train young girls to become expert fighters has been restarted and Hanna becomes part of that, plus a handful of new and very interesting characters. This has become one of the better ""invented for streaming"" series. Hanna has the last line in season #2, at the swimming pool, ""So, what now?""",59 out of 100 found this helpful.,,4 February 2019

This show is full to bursting with fantastic and lovable characters, witty humor, great writing, beautiful animation, and mysteries, fantasy, and little Easter eggs around every corner. In addition, there are a few elements that could easily give me nightmares, but which, oddly enough, the kids I babysit find more hilarious than anything. Guess it's the age difference. If you haven't yet, you definitely need to give this show a shot.

They're all simply fun and the way they get along and interact with each other is great! The setting is pretty cool too, there's always the potential for something completely new and supernatural to occur.

The characters are all very entertaining and funny, and the humour is very funny, quick, and breezy. The ONLY problems with the show is that it's rated tv-y7, it should really be rated p.g, if it were it would bring in the crowed it is more suited for. Some things in the show make me think ""wow they got away with that?! In this day and age?!"". Not only is there several jokes that would fit just as well in the simpsons, there's references to the simpsons too! Even a couple jokes that hint at pornography. The other problem is it airs on Disney. This is NOT a Disney show nor should it be treated like one if this show doesn't last long, its because its on Disney. It would be much suited to a p.g rating and on CN. Or at least if it was Disney, rated it p.g and air it late at night.

My little cousins love it and when they found out I was watching gravity falls at home they flipped out. Now when I go visit we will sometimes watch on episode from the DVR.

1901,Gravity Falls, One of the best cartoons in recent years...,"Over the years, many shows have let me down in terms of storyline, humor, and originality. It seemed to me that every major children's network disappointed in all three aspects. I actually anticipated this show months before it even aired because, despite the fact that there wasn't much information available about it online, the premise sounded promising.<br/><br/>As my rage towards Disney's mediocre attempts at teen-comedy and music grew infinitely stronger, I held my breath and awaited the release of that which is Gravity Falls. (Keep in mind, only two cartoons made up Disney's regular schedule prior to the airing of this fantastic show. Disney brings to mind animation, not anorexic twelve-year-olds dancing in miniskirts. Shame on you. Walt would be appalled.) Anyways, I was thoroughly impressed by the pilot episode, ""Tourist Trapped"", which pulled you right into the action of the show and delivered its characters in a quick and convenient manner.<br/><br/>Gravity Falls is about twins, Dipper and Mabel, who are sent to the quirky woodland town of Gravity Falls, Oregon to their greedy Grunkle Stan over the summer. While helping their great uncle run his tourist attraction - the ""Mystery Shack"" - the twins also discover a secret book that sheds light on the many paranormal and otherworldly oddities found throughout their bizarre, new setting. The show also focuses on a number of other topics, including the struggles attained through youth.<br/><br/>Viewers are provided with a balanced amount of mystery, action, humor, and suspense within each of the episodes. The characters each serve their purpose and contribute their roles to the storyline, which many other cartoons fail to do. I like the animation and the art in general, as the style is very appealing. <br/><br/>Gravity Falls treats its viewers with respect and regard to their intelligence. The plots in each episode are complex enough to keep adults interested, all while providing enough laughs for the children. In other words, Gravity Falls is a show that can be enjoyed by any age. Most certainly recommended.",30 out of 31 found this helpful.,10.0,7 September 2012
1902,Gravity Falls, So far a Near Perfect Show,"Disney has been making some radical changes in recent years. Back in the day Disney was always known for its films and amusement parks, its original creator driven content always seemed to take a backseat. For years the only decent original Disney channel series were Fillmore! and The Weekenders. However like I said recently Disney has been taking a bold new direction. The addition of Disney XD has led to the creation of some great shows Phineas and Ferb and particularly Chris Prynoski's new show Motor City. Their current original content mirroring the 90's shows that put creator driven series on the map. Their latest play in this new direction the creation of what so far promises to be perhaps their best creator driven series yet Gravity Falls.<br/><br/>Emerging from the ashes of the Marvellous Misadventures of Flapjack (another quality show, however not Disneys) where series creator Alex Hirsch served as writer and storyboard artist, Gravity Falls is perhaps the best instalment in a series of programs crafted by current Cal Arts Alumni since Adventure Time. <br/><br/>From a cartooning and animation standpoint the series feels refreshing. The character designs feel like some superb mixture of The Simpsons, Classic Disney animation with a bit of The Marvellous Misadventures of Flapjack thrown in. The Characters are drawn in a very fun way and they lend themselves to the quality character animation the series has produced. From a character animation standpoint the work is spirited. It is fluid and comedic exemplifying how much the character animation can be integral to the characters themselves. <br/><br/>Cartooning and Animation aside though I feel the true greatness of the show stems from its writing style, approach of comedy and characters. Alex Hirsch and his writing team have made a show that conjures to mind the character driven humour of the classic Simpsons with the weird and often creepy nature of a 90's kid show called Eerie Indiana. The end result is a show with unique and weird story lines and a level of humour that does what many of the 90's shows did best, transcend its target audience. This show produces jokes that will work for both kids and adults. The characters are also very likable. We have seen characters like Dipper, Mabel and Grunkle Stan before but on Gravity Falls they are crafted so believably that we can forgive that. These are not just funny characters, they are characters with defined personas, they are oddly relatable and they have even in these 9 episodes shown some semblance of character development something that is usually left out of many North American animated series. <br/><br/>So far this is a near perfect show its only misstep so far the episode entitled Dipper Vs. Manliness, which I won't spoil it for you, has a great concept but is too much build up and not enough pay off. <br/><br/>For me this is a show that makes the kid in me smile. Watching this now is like tuning into my childhood favourites (Hey Arnold, Ren and Stimpy, Courage the Cowardly Dog) only now I am old enough to appreciate it.",110 out of 123 found this helpful.,10.0,22 August 2012

The ciphers that the show offers are amazing and fun to solve they don't give away plot,at least not yet, so you don't need to decipher them, but personally I enjoy doing it. I enjoy everything about this show. There's never been any terrible jokes and no clichés in the plot which is always great. I recommend that you watch this show, but if you don't enjoy mystery in the plot, which I don't know why you wouldn't, or weird random humour, more understandable, then you probably won't enjoy this show as much as I have but it is still defiantly worth checking out.",27 out of 28 found this helpful.,10.0,13 February 2014
1904,Gravity Falls, Fantastic,"Gravity Falls is a new show on Disney Channel, and the only reason I heard about it was because of a friend I have on tumblr. While I haven't been a fan of Disney's recent...ventures, I have to say that Gravity Falls is absolutely fantastic.<br/><br/>Gravity Falls is about two kids, Mabel and Dipper Pines, who are currently living in one of those ""middle of nowhere"" towns called Gravity Falls with their uncle Stan, who appears to have a very mysterious past. Plenty of other mysteries lurk in Gravity Falls, and you, as the viewer, look to figure them out along with Dipper and Mabel. Along with dealing with their eccentric uncle, the kids also encounter the extremely snarky Wendy as well as a host of other quirky residents.<br/><br/>The tone of Gravity Falls's humour is very similar to Adventure Time - very strange and mostly situational, but I feel that a lot of the time the dialogue is much more clever and mature than that of Adventure Time's. The voice acting, animation and art style are also great, and the theme song of the show especially is fantastic.<br/><br/>What I enjoy most about this show, however, is its tone. This show is a total mystery - there's clues hidden everywhere. I'm completely enthralled with finding everything out before it's addressed in the show - mainly Stan's past.<br/><br/>This show is great, check it out!",65 out of 72 found this helpful.,9.0,4 August 2012

Because I want to make sure every person who reads this understands how shocked and delighted I am by Gravity Falls.<br/><br/>Gravity Falls takes place in a remote Oregon town of the same name. It features Dipper and Mabel Pines (voiced by Jason Ritter and Kristen Schaal respectively), a pair of twins, staying with their Great Uncle (or Grunkle, a term I believe needs to be used more often) Stan (voiced by show creator Alex Hirsch), a sleazy con-artist that runs a tourist trap called the Mystery Shack. Stan rips off gullible vacationers and townies with ""supernatural"" attractions and a less than stellar gift shop, overseen by man-child Soos (also voiced by Hirsch) and a down-to-earth slacker teenager Wendy (voiced by Linda Cardellini). It looks like a dull summer for the twins, but they soon find out that there is quite a lot of strange goings on in the little town.<br/><br/>This show has that right mix of humor and adventure every family program ought to have. It's written in a way that can engage people of all ages without pandering to anyone.<br/><br/>The voice actors were chosen masterfully, especially in Mabel Pines. I can't imagine anyone else but Schaal (who also voiced Trixie in Toy Story 3 and plays Mel in Flight of the Conchords)playing the bubbly, effervescent Mabel.<br/><br/>This show also features DIY voice acting from Hirsch, a seemingly common occurrence in animated shows today (Regular Show creator JG Quintel voicing Mordecai and High Five Ghost and Adventure Time creator Pen Ward voicing Lumpy Space Princess as well as a myriad of side characters). Hirsch shows quite a bit of range voicing miserly Stan and obvious Soos.<br/><br/>Gravity Falls is also able juxtapose the supernatural and the normal growing pains of adolescence. On a nearly weekly basis, the observant and intelligent Dipper finds a way to crack a mystery involving gnomes and crystals that change an object's size, yet he can't muster the courage to ask his crush, Wendy, on a date.<br/><br/>There are a lot of TV shows and movies that try so hard to reach that sweet spot where they can appeal to kids, parents and young adults, but fall painfully short. Gravity Falls, though, hits that spot brilliantly.<br/><br/>Like his fellow CalArts alumni Quintel and Ward, Hirsch's product is one made out of love and care and it's made clear in every episode. Most impressively, though, is that it gives me a reason to watch the Disney Channel.",99 out of 112 found this helpful.,9.0,1 February 2013

1908,Gravity Falls, This is the greatest show I've ever seen in my life!!!!!,"In an age where Disney Channel seems to be stuck in a rut when it comes to making good shows, I've never seen, not only a cartoon, but a show in general as hilarious and ingeniously thought out as Gravity Falls. When I first saw the trailer, I honestly thought it looked pretty dumb, but once I actually gave it a chance, I was absolutely blown away! <br/><br/>The story of the show is actually similar to Avatar, in which it continues its story rather than just making episodes without any continuity whatsoever. When the show began, the story was clearly fleshed out with very likable characters and surprisingly great humor, and it only seemed to get better the more it went on. The mystery element has only grown, giving us so many questions and small clues, and letting us come up with our own theories (speaking of which, I'm pretty sure that Gompers the goat is Bill Cipher in disguise.) When the show DOES give answers to questions though, it does NOT disappoint! <br/><br/>When it comes to the animation, the world that the show has created is 100% fascinating!From the creatures, to the locations, to the backgrounds, to the magical elements, it's all incredible to look at! I've already mentioned that the show has hundreds of clues as to where the story is going throughout it, and the animation often gives many away, even though we may not even realize it. All the amazing sites, cool places and crazy creatures will make you wish the town were real! <br/><br/>It probably isn't surprising when I say that the characters are all fantastic. You'll really root for the good guys and you'll love to hate the bad guys! You'll want these characters to be real just as much as the town so you can go on a mystery hunt with Dipper, knit a crazy sweater with Mabel, let Grunkle Stan show you around the Mystery Shack, play Laser Tag with Soos, chill with Wendy and more! Now with the addition of Great Uncle Ford, who has already began to set himself as pretty solid and likable, these guys are classic examples of timeless characters.<br/><br/>I don't even know what else to say; I simply adore this show! I recommend this to everyone; kids, adults, and especially people who love a great mystery! It's a show that's only gotten better, and I hope it continues to do exactly that!",15 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,9 August 2015
1909,Gravity Falls, Just West of Weird,"Somewhere in the Middle of Nowhere in Oregon, two twins exit a bus. A flashy showman, their Great Uncle, greets them, and invites them into the paranormal epicentre of the world. While it seems he's too much of a trickster to believe in the supernatural he promotes, the kids explore the town, and find enough adventure, mystery and conspiracy to last a thousand lifetimes. It's an experience that will change the both of them forever.<br/><br/>Gravity Falls' intro has no lyrics, and yet, in roughly forty seconds of screen-time, we already know the settings, the major characters, their virtues and flaws, their relationships, and a whole lot of foreshadowing for things that won't even be touched on until the very end. This very effectively sums up the show; a lot being thrown at you, even if you don't recognise it at the time. It constantly thinks back to itself, with some of the most in-depth continuity, background or foreground, of any show, animated or not. Characters casually appear in the background several episodes before an episode revolves around them, minor plot-points are revisited dozens of episodes later, and damage to both people and property doesn't vanish after a single episode. Almost every major plot twist (and there are many) involves a heavy degree of foreshadowing, stretching back into the first season. Thankfully, it's never quite enough for the casual viewer to pick up, but enough to reward multiple viewings. Being a show that revolves around mystery (the creator, Alex Hirsch, had the intention to blend the episodic mysteries of X-Files, with the overarching mystery of Twin Peaks), every episode is littered with codes and riddles that are used both for comedy, and hints about upcoming confrontations. The more one dissects each episode, the more one realises the dedication and effort that was put into every one.<br/><br/>But regardless of the mystery elements that define the series, the heart and soul of the show is the relationship between the twins, Dipper and Mabel. Both on the cusp of puberty, Dipper is introverted, adventurous, and deeply precocious, while his sister is extroverted, more interested in the prospect of summer romance than the supernatural, and has an infectious, childish optimism for life. So many pitfalls that beset other twin/sibling relationships in shows are avoided in their writing: identical characters, every episode being a conflict between the two, one of the two always being right, etc. While very different, the two compliment, rather than conflict with each other. When they tease, they know when to stop, when they fight, it's a big deal, and when they see the anguish the other goes through, they sacrifice. What a relief from the endless cynical jibes that define character interaction in the modern era; here, the two unquestionably love and cherish the company of each other. It's the most affecting twin relationship one could write without straining believability. Both have insecurities about themselves, and both are deeply flawed from the outset, which they learn to overcome together. Hirsch said one of the most amazing things about the show for him was the sheer amount of people calling him up to thank him for their getting closer to their siblings, after having drifted apart, or never having been together at all. The relationship between Hirsch's own twin sister and himself as the obvious inception for Mabel and Dipper gives a deeply authentic vibe, creating one of the best written sibling relationships in all fiction.<br/><br/>This allows the show to do something really well; humour. Hirsch never intended to do a kid's show, and constantly wrote the show from the perspective of what would children get into, and what would make adults laugh, a formula which enabled the show to have the entirety of the top ten broadcast ratings on their channel. Consequently, the strong characterisation and connections between the characters, (the twins, their con-man Great Uncle, the practical but dim-witted janitor, and the tomboyish counter-girl) allow for miraculously high-quality character-humour. However, this isn't to pigeon-hole the show's comedic writing, which has an incredible range from slapstick, to visual gags, to fourth-wall breaks. There is not a fart joke to be found, but there are jokes that no child could possibly get that will send older viewers into uproar (such as the Great Uncle giving the names of his hands as ""Scratchy and Shaky."") When asked which episode in particular the censors most objected to, Hirsch replied ""All of them"".<br/><br/>While the humour can often be adult, including some of the most depressing, nihilistic monologues one can get away with given the rating, the level of darkness in terms of horror is something that shocks most people who watch the series for the first time. With a shape-shifter morphing into a spider version of the main characters, screaming severed heads, and lines like ""I've got to turn some children into corpses"", Gravity Falls never shied away from nightmare fuel. Yet even then, the show never forgets that it is primarily a comedic series. In the midst of extreme drama, there will be isolated comedic moments that are just enough to make you laugh, but integrated enough not to detract from the tone. The intensity of the drama cannot be underestimated though, with major life and death decisions having to be made by children who are clearly not prepared for the turmoil they are going through, which makes us all the more heartbroken to see their anguish.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the show concluded on the creator's terms; he envisioned a beginning, middle, and ending, and saw it through to the (highly emotional) end. Gravity Falls will never suffer the same zombification that overcame once great shows like the Simpsons, leaving one of the most consistent high-quality programming across not just children's, or animated television, but the medium in general. It's a show for all ages, and an adventure in itself.",14 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,16 February 2016
1910,Gravity Falls, Amazingly strange...and funny.,"While I am 50 years old and WAY outside the target audience for this show, my 24 year-old daughter is hooked--so much so that she always insists that I watch ""Gravity Falls"" with her. And so this is how I came to see the show--and I assume most who have reviewed the show are much younger than I am!<br/><br/>The plot is a lot like the old show ""Eerie, Indiana"" in that the main characters, who are kids, keep stumbling upon weird cases of the supernatural in this bizarre little town. However, and this is important, unlike ""Eerie, Indiana"", the characters are far more likable and funny. In particular, Mabel is a hoot--and is among the best things about the show--as is Gruncle Stan. But the others are all quite charming and weird. The writing, therefore, is a very strong suit about the series and, oddly, will appeal to just about all age groups. Sure, it's a show for kids--but oldsters like me will like it too, if they give it a chance. Well worth your time.",33 out of 36 found this helpful.,9.0,27 July 2014

The intro's animation is impressive but the actual show isn't as amazing but still good.<br/><br/>The show has a eerie atmosphere, but still has the heart of most of Disney shows.<br/><br/>So overall, The show is great.

1917,Gravity Falls," Gravity, ""Falls"" right in with good quality animated cartoons!","Last Halloween, a friend of mine cosplayed as Dipper (The main protagonist aside from his twin sister Mable and their Grunkle Stan) from the show and told me it was worth a watch. Needless to say I got into it and enjoy it very much. Just finished the first season too! The character designs are sort of reminiscent of older cartoons and definitely some Ren &amp; Stimpy influence thrown in there- big differently coloured noses, googly eyes and lanky bodies. The background artwork is surprisingly innovative and versatile. The characters, Grunkle Stan, Mable and Soos are amongst some of the best characters in the show. The writing is witty, humorous and even touching at times. Continuity plays a big responsibility in this show as characters will address past events and the show teaches good morals without being too preachy. Gravity Falls has a strange and mysterious history that plunges Dipper and Mable into all kinds of adventures and foibles. This show comes as ""recommended to watch"" by this old Saturday morning cartoon watching veteran!

1918,Gravity Falls, Watch Gravity Falls!,"I had always heard that Gravity Falls was a great show, but I didn't watch it till recently. And it's AMAZING.<br/><br/>I love the humor in this show. There's jokes for both the younger and the older audience, which is part of the reason so many people enjoyed this show. The self-aware jokes (like when Stan was talking about Duck-Tective and said that the show ""has a big mystery element, and a lot of humor that goes over kids' heads."") were just HILARIOUS.<br/><br/>The humor is also always balanced well with the mystery, which is what the show is at its core. Especially during the end of Season 1 and throughout Season 2, we got to learn about Stan's connection to the weirdness in Gravity Falls.<br/><br/>But I think the main thing that I enjoyed about the show was the characters and their relationships. The brother/sister relationship that Dipper and Mabel has throughout the series was incredible to watch. I loved seeing them fight and then make up afterwards, watching them solve mysteries together, and help each other out. Not going to spoil anything, but the scene with them in Weirdmageddon pt. 2 actually had me feeling emotional.<br/><br/>The side characters and side stories were always enjoyable to watch. I love that those side characters were also often mentioned, there in the background, or turned out to have more important roles later on.<br/><br/>Above all, this show was interesting, funny, and relate able. Each episode had a moral, whether it be about growing up or realizing your identity. I'm going to miss Gravity Falls. It's one of those shows where you're left wondering, what happened afterwards?...<br/><br/>Also, the theme song is just fantastic. The voice actors too. Oh, and plot twists?

1920,Gravity Falls, The Most Underrated Disney Channel Show of Present Time,"I say this as a child who watched Disney Channel during the period it brought its live-action properties to greater prominence: I never thought Disney Channel would have any good cartoons. I never grew up with Ducktales or the popular Saturday Morning lineup from the late 80s, and so when I watched the channel the only running cartoons were the likes of 'Kim Possible', 'Lilo and Stitch' and 'American Dragon'. The first two were decent cartoons, and while I didn't get into American Dragon much, the couple episodes I watched did feel action packed. Unfortunately, when it came to quality they couldn't compare to shows on channels like Cartoon Network. The characters and stories didn't leave much of an impact; a lot of it because the same archetypes and plots have been done better in other cartoons, but also because it never took that many risks. <br/><br/>And then this show comes along.<br/><br/>The premise of Gravity Falls is that a pair of 12 year old twins from the Pines family, a brother named Dipper and a sister named Mabel, go on a summer trip to a rural, woodland town in Oregon to visit their 'Grunkle' Stan (who I'm guessing is both the twin's grandfather and uncle. I'm trying not to think too hard about it). The uncle runs a museum of faux paranormal objects, and the twins have to help him run the place, with help from a deep and hilarious handyman named Soos and a teenage girl named Wendy. Ironically, the town of Gravity Falls turns out to really be home of numerous supernatural anomalies and creatures, and the twins have to deal with them each episode; all the while trying to discover the source of all the town's strangeness.<br/><br/>As childish as it seemed, the precise moment when I perked at Gravity Falls was when one of the characters openly uttered the word 'Sascrotch'. Obviously, adult humor does not equal good quality writing, but the mere fact that the Disney Channel let a show get away with such humor indicates that they've given this show much more freedom in its development. And as proved with shows like The Simpsons and Animaniacs, giving creative freedom to a talented crew of writers, animators and artists can produce amazing results. <br/><br/>And while we're on the subject, so much of Gravity Falls reminds me of The Simpsons in both humor and the animation. Gravity Falls's creator Alex Hirsh even stated that The Simpsons was a major influence of the show, and it definitely shows in all the right ways. The characters themselves resemble Simpsons characters, except with pink skin, slightly smaller eyes and with an added extra finger on each hand (except the kid protagonists. Seriously, look at the hands of the twin characters and the adult characters: THE KIDS HAVE LESS FINGERS THAN ADULTS). All the characters have distinct traits, and all of them take part in the show's hilarity. Mabel especially is the quirkiest character of the show, and I think it's charming to see an animated young girl who's wacky and not always purely innocent. The humor and writing themselves also recalls the Simpsons, with a pinch of pop-culture references, a dash of slapstick and plenty of unpredictability and wit without getting too cynical. I've never cracked up so much to any Disney Channel cartoon other than Gravity Falls.<br/><br/>The animation itself is amongst the best of Disney 2D animation I've seen outside of their films, even if there's a bit of 3D animation for any vehicles in the show. The movements of the characters are extremely fluid, while the backgrounds themselves are full of meticulous detail; fully capturing the nature of the Oregon woodland while evoking the show's dark, unknown mystery. <br/><br/>Speaking of dark and unknowing, the overall nature of the show is one of the strange and paranormal, and there's a consistent cryptic atmosphere in each episode (complete with decodable codes in each of the episode's credits, the appearance of the 'All seeing eye' and hidden clues). This is one of the few Disney channel shows with genuinely scary moments, but all the while there's a coating of lightheartedness that makes it so much fun. Some of these moments came from the 5th episode ""The Inconveniencing"", which is also the episode that completely won me over to the show. Without spoiling much, this episode is about the Twins, Wendy and some friends visiting an abandoned convenience store that turns out to be haunted, and it packs a couple of the scariest and hilarious moments of the show into a single episode.<br/><br/>But what gets me the most is that this show is full of heart, especially with the relationship between the sibling protagonists Dipper and Mabel Pines. I drew up the Simpsons comparison here earlier, and in this regard it's similar to the relationship between Bart and Lisa Simpson. But unlike the Simpsons (and many other animated shows depicting constantly quarreling siblings), there's almost little to no rivalry amongst the Twin siblings except for a couple of episodes. It's not to say that there's no trouble relating to it: one of the themes around the show is how the Twins deal with maintaining their relationship with one another while going through adulthood. The Pine Twins genuinely love each other as siblings, and whenever they express that love it's extremely heartwarming without ever coming close to saccharine. <br/><br/>To sum it up: It's a shame that Gravity Falls often gets the short end of the stick when it comes to Disney Channel's scheduling (there's sometimes a month-long break between episodes. Why, Disney, why?), because this isn't only THE best show currently running on the Disney Channel, but also one of the best animated show currently on TV. It's humor, horror and heartwarming packed into a fun, wonderful package, and I highly recommend it to anyone missing the days of the classic Simpsons and animation with optimism.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,4 July 2013

It is a remarkable balance between love, regret, loneliness, debauchery and moral value, the likes of which I have rarely seen.<br/><br/>Duchovney's character has this amazing combination of I-don't-give-a-f**k attitude (stemming from his obvious depression and regret over his ex and several other things), conceit, vulnerability, bitterness, and misogyny, while simultaneously being utterly moral and upstanding, especially in his desire to do the right thing for his ex and daughter, as exemplified in the final scene when he rushes to crash a house party that his daughter is attending and literally carries her out of there when he saw her smoking pot with some boys.<br/><br/>It is a remarkably refreshing change from the usual 'cool-parent' liberal permissive attitude that one has come to expect in these situations. And coming from a character like Hank (Duchovney) its especially redeeming. He is an amazingly complex character, and Duchovney pulls it off flawlessly.<br/><br/>The writing is nearly perfect, as is the casting and acting. The soundtrack is as brilliant and evocative as anything I've experienced thus far in television or film, and it all comes together in a hilarious, poignant and extremely entertaining package.

Things come at you out of nowhere, delivered in Duchovney's signature deadpan to great effect here. The writing does credit to the English language, albeit it well salted and peppered with expletives. The very best part of this show is that the characters felt well fleshed out from the first 5 minutes and they have continued to feel real.

1924,Californication, I Did Not Want to Like This Show,"Maybe I missed something, but the promos of this series made it look like one long ad for a freewheeling guy living a hedonistic Hollywood lifestyle. That's SO not what Californication is about, and frankly, it's a stupid title. There is definitely a high volume of disreputable behavior, and the show is not for kids, but there is a good story here. Hank Moody (Duchovney) is a Los Angeles-based writer whose long-time girlfriend, with whom he has a child but never bothered to marry, has left him. The whole series is about his desire to win her back, his writers' block at the loss of his muse, and his role as a father all in the context of his emotional instability. Duchovney's girl-getting eyes have the same effect on every female opportunity that comes his way in the story as they do on his millions of female fans. The series calls for a bit of a stretch, asking the audience to believe that his power to attract women never once led to an indiscretion while he was living with his non-wife. I loved the characters and although it is not realistic, it is an interesting venue for the observations made about what destructive behaviors women are willing to put up with. It also gets very far away from the Jerry Seinfeld, man-child type characters that are romantically inept. Hank is a ladies man AND a man's man. He's the lovable bad boy with a heart of gold. For those concerned about content for kids: DO NOT WATCH THIS SERIES. There is constant language, smoking, sex, frank discussions about sex, drug use viewed as acceptable, nudity, and references to all forms of adult themes. But the story line is not as prurient as all of that suggests. Hank is a family man who engages in behaviors because he has no brakes to stop him i.e. his family living with him. He doesn't actually LIKE the behaviors and wants to marry the woman who left him and spend more time with his daughter.

In Californication Showtime has one of its strongest hits . . . ever. The writing is bitingly crisp, intelligent and fresh. Duchovny's delivery has the timing of a master comic actor and his portrayal of Hank is winning. As with the very best of comedies, beneath the bubbly surface of Californication is a show that in a single episode reveals richly drawn characters of depth and purpose. Hank's lecherousness, womanizing, wry wit and in-your-face bluntness succeed only partially in covering up a complex (or perhaps merely complicated?) man who appears to be facing all of his mid life crisis's at once. Every note in this comic symphony was perfectly struck and I look forward to getting to know Hank - and the rest of his gang - better as the weeks go by. Bravo Showtime!",130 out of 179 found this helpful.,9.0,18 August 2007
1928,Californication," Fresh, witty entertainment","I just watched the pilot on-demand and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed by this show. David Duchovny was a pure gem to watch as the sardonic and hapless writer in the surreal realm of Southern California. The dialogue is top-notch, the plot is thick and juicy. Hank is a deep, 3-dimensional character that we seldom see on television. Though he is definitely damaged, there is something in his tribulations that audiences can relate to. His difficulty in writing is a situation I have felt many times when I sit down at the keyboard. Similarly, I empathize with his relationship problems. The problems he faces are problems that real people face brought to life in a very funny, unique way.<br/><br/>With this show, Weeds, The L Word and Dexter, Showtime is becoming the new HBO. That being said I really hope this show keeps the spark that made the pilot so good for the full run of the series.",93 out of 130 found this helpful.,9.0,15 September 2007
1929,Californication, Wonderfully entertaining!,"I am greatly enjoying this show and hope it will run a very long time. There's something about this show that seems so real. It makes me laugh, it makes me think, and it brings something to the table for everyone. It has emotion, sex, passion, hard times, and complexity. Hanks character is absolutely great, and all the other characters are developing very well, and becoming very unique. I also enjoy Nip/Tuck, but this show is like a much more tangible version, with more depth, and somewhat on Valium (as it is much less over the top!). I believe that anyone can relate to this show with all this depth, diversity, and complexity. I highly recommend this show to anyone, and I am in love. I will definitely not miss an episode and look forward to buying the DVD releases in the future.

1930,Californication," Funny, cool, one-of-a-kind show for adults!","If you have Showtime and you're not watching Californication, you're definitely missing out. I'm so glad I watched the first episode because I was hooked within the first five minutes and haven't missed an episode yet (I think it's up to 8 episodes now). I'm getting Showtime for free right now but just because of Weeds and Californication, I would probably continue paying for it after my free time is up.<br/><br/>I've never seen a show quite like this...the humor totally rocks; I especially love how witty it is, like when Hank says something like, ""Shrivel me testes"". The characters and their interactions are top-notch and I enjoy every minute of it.<br/><br/>I totally enjoy (most of) the actors, especially Pamela Adlon, who plays Marcie; she's mostly a voice actor (cartoon boys, mostly) and I love seeing her in an on-screen role; we need to see more of this talented woman! Sometimes I'm shocked at how hardcore the show can be and I LOVE THAT about it. It keeps me on my toes and is rarely predictable (even though whenever you see a hot chick you just know Hank will be doing her within five minutes...not the most realistic, but hey, it's a TV show with a title that includes the word, ""fornication"")!<br/><br/>I hope there is a Season 2 for this awesome new show...any many more seasons beyond.

1931,Californication, A solid new comedy series with top drawer performance from Duchovny,"From its controversial opening scene to its excellent finale, the first episode of ""Californication"" sets the tone for the series. Stylishly directed by the always-reliable Stephen Hopkins, the pilot is thoroughly entertaining adult comedy. Watching the first episode reminded me a little of a modern Blake Edwards' production.<br/><br/>The cast are excellent, especially David Duchovny as the seedy Hank Moody, a man whose mid-life crisis is on display for all to see, from his Porsche to his constant bed-hopping.<br/><br/>The script is sharp and the whole show exudes quality.<br/><br/>Recommended.",101 out of 146 found this helpful.,,11 October 2007
1932,Californication, A review of what used to be my favourite comedy.,"""Californication"" was once a promising comedy, something that spoke to my love of classic rock, English, Bill Hicks, Bukowski and Hunter S. Thompson-style self-loathing.<br/><br/>I wanted to write a bit of a rant, however, on why this now may be the worst comedy on cable. <br/><br/>This season is better than last, but that's not saying much. The sexual hijinks and gross-out factor is getting insulting. Last episode has Charlie basically getting raped by a drunk woman up her butt (haha! it's funny because it's anal!), which is pretty disgusting (how funny would it be if the genders were reversed?). Female-on-male rape can be kinda funny just due to the novelty of it, but it has to be handled well, and in this episode it's just dumb and sleazy. Meanwhile the Sex Pistols guy is making out with a couple hotties, the Russell Brand dude is talking about drugging his wife so he can screw another girl, and Hank is trying to get into Maggie Grace's panties while cracking jokes about bodily fluids on the floor and butt-****ery. It isn't funny or clever anymore.<br/><br/>A big appeal of S1 was that Hank, while a womanizer, still respected women. He had that whole ""Hell-A"" rant about how the city corrupts its women. He loved Karen and Becca and often found himself in sexual scenarios where he tried, but failed (his relationship with the adulteress, for example). <br/><br/>But now, he's taking oral sex from drunk grieving widows behind tombstones and his apathy is sort of comical rather than earnest. The show has developed little trademarks for the characters (I can't quote Hank's - it involves profanity) that is turning it more and more into a silly sitcom. It's no wonder that Hank seems to be appealing more to the masses now as a character, since he is essentially turning into a caricature - a sort of idiot manchild that Hank in season one would have railed against. They've basically ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love'd"" Californication, and viewers of the show will understand what I mean by that.<br/><br/>Also, as much as I love Runkle and how pathetic he is, his relationship with Hank has become more ridiculous than ever. In the early seasons Hank had a brotherly relationship with him, but they were still pretty straightforward with each other. Runkle still acted respectfully around Hank, to preserve his status as an agent, and inquired into his personal life when he thought he had hit rock bottom. (Remember in the pilot episode how he asked Hank whether he was OK, needed help, etc.? Told him to get it together?) Now, Runkle is basically just the butt end of jokes when Hank is around. And he doesn't seem to care much about his friend's spiraling out of control, such as when he brings him pot to his rehab center.<br/><br/>I'm truly shocked that Kapinos is still the one writing this show. It amazes me that the creator of season one would allow the show to devolve like this, let alone be the sole person responsible for it.",25 out of 36 found this helpful.,9.0,20 February 2013
1933,Californication, One of the five greatest shows of all time.,"It's one of the five greatest shows I've ever seen. The writing is absolutely perfect and does a great job with both the comedic and dramatic scenes. David Duchovny's Hank Moody is one of the finest characters ever put to the silver screen and his performance is really what makes the show just so damn enjoyable to watch. The sex scenes were hilarious, and the entire story with Charlie (Moody's agent played by Evan Handler) and his secretary (Bully's Rachel Miner) started off very hot as they indulge in a Secretary-esquire relationship and then got hilarious once they started having a threesome with Charlie's wife Marcy (the hilarious Pamela Adlon) and his nipple gets ripped off and then Marcy actually sleeping with the secretary on her own.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there was the squirting scene when Charlie and Hank have a threesome with a girl they meet at the gym and things get...very wet. So perfectly handled to make the final result gut-bustingly hilarious.<br/><br/>But what holds the show together so wonderfully is the perfect balance of Moody's crazy sex life and the hilarious suplots of his agent with Hank's attempt to get the woman he loves back and try to raise his daughter right. Hank was in love with Karen, they had a kid, never got married and broke up. She's now dating the douchebag Bill and planning to get married. Natascha McElhone plays Karen with an excellent blend of deeply emotional work and an adorable, comedic touch that makes the audience understand why Hank is just so madly in love with her. Their child, Becca, is played by the very young Madeleine Martin with a level of grace and maturity that is incredibly surprising for her age. She hits the comedic notes perfectly but also knows how to deliver some great dramatic work.<br/><br/>Rounding off this pitch-perfect cast is Madeline Zima as Bill's teenage daughter, Mia. We first meet her when Hank picks her up at a book store (not knowing her age) and takes her back to his place for some good ol' fashioned sex. And then, just as he's about to finish, she punches him in the face. And does it again. The shock of this is only increased when we learn later in the episode that she is the 16 year old daughter of the man Hank's love is currently sleeping with. Over the course of the season Zima turns Mia into an absolute bitch who we, although I've always disliked this phrase, love to hate.<br/><br/>It's an absolutely marvelous, unique show that hits every single note perfectly thanks largely to the flawless cast and the expert writing.",40 out of 64 found this helpful.,10.0,10 August 2008
1934,Californication, A Showtime Wonder,"I have watched 3 seasons of this show now, and I have to admit it is one of the most well written shows. Along with the nudity and the explicit nature of the show, it most importantly has a beautiful storyline. Its not just one of those shows with sex, drugs and booze. Its also about love, father-daughter relationship, loneliness, infidelity and regret.<br/><br/>David Duchovny is the soul of the show (no wonder he got a Golden Globe for it). He plays 'Hank Moody', the f**ked up, vulnerable, dysfunctional writer. He tries to grapple with his feelings for his ex, played by Natascha McElhone (who is absolutely stunning), and also tries to raise their daughter by trying to be a 'cool dad'. At the same time, he deals with his desire for beautiful women by charming his way through to them and mostly ends up f**king them. His agent Charlie Runkle (Evan Handler) helps him with his writing career which just didn't take off after his first book. Runkle and his wife Marcy (Pamela Adlon) are involved in some hilarious sub-plots together.<br/><br/>It is difficult to classify this show in a particular genre as it has everything from dark comedy, sex to family drama. Californication and Dexter have taken cable TV to an all new level making Showtime as good as HBO. I strongly recommend this show for its lovely plot and amazing cast especially David. Season 2 may get a bit boring but please keep going as season 3 is outstanding. The soundtrack is really soothing.<br/><br/>Finally, the show is a must watch and very well scripted. I would like to give it 9 stars most of which are for Duchovny.",15 out of 22 found this helpful.,8.0,25 February 2011
1935,Californication," I know this comment will be bashed, but... awful beyond words.","Like a kid suddenly dropped in the middle of Disneyland, I don't know where to start.<br/><br/>Make a TV series full of boring, one-dimensional characters, lots of nudity and cussing, and you've hit the jackpot. You'll be number one, you'll make millions. Plot? Hey, we have naked women, drugs and swearing, who needs a plot? Would it work? Of course. The proof is here: Californication.<br/><br/>Where to begin? We have a writer, Hank Moody (yes, the name gives a hint from the beginning) who has problems with the woman he loves. He does love her, but has lead such a carefree love life that it's hard for him to give up. After all, it's California I guess. Every episode, we watch hunky Hank's suffering (he's an artist after all) and the women dying to steal a night (or 10 minutes?) from him.<br/><br/>That's the whole plot. The main character is played by David Duchovny, who proves that any signs he had shown about being a decent actor(on the X-Files) were totally coincidental. Here he has the acting abilities of an average tree. He is a writer but we never see him write or work. (WORKING? LIKE REAL JOBS, AND ON TV? HEAVENS FORBID!) Like all TV characters, his job (e.g. artist, writer, fashion designing consultant, artist, aromatherapy counselor, artist, creative department head expertise fumgubator, and did I mention artist?) allows him to drift all day long, without doing one bit of the work that %99,9999 of the world does.<br/><br/>During his driftings in his fancy car****, he comes across some woman from his past every five minutes. And boy, do they want him back. Apparently Hank has a habit of changing his bed partners more often than his facial expression. Also apparently, apart from his writing abilities, he is so gifted in bed that all women are desperate to have him back. And the ones he hasn't met yet are so turned on by his wooden acting and porny name that... you get the idea. They are all ready to do it right there and then in 30 seconds.<br/><br/>The whole Hank Moody character, in every aspect, is right out of some 14-year old's horny dreams. He has a cool-sounding job that does not require him to do anything, he is rich, and all the women are wet and hot for him. But please don't get me wrong: I don't mean that he is popular, or well-liked among women. I mean women are ready to open their legs for him the second they see him. Yes, even without foreplay. Doesn't this strike as porn to you as well? <br/><br/>America must be full of women who are dripping wet and horny for the only real man: Hank Moody. Those puffy cheeks (which make him look like a Charles Bronson - Santa Claus hybrid, or a mutant squirrel-man), constant smoking, drooping shoulders and never-changing expression must be the biggest turn-on for women. Also, it seems these women have not had any happy relationships at all. Like there are no real men in America other than Hank Moody. The women are all unhappy, unsatisfied, un-everything.<br/><br/>The writers (yes, this stuff is actually written) try to blend in some drama, but it does not go beyond your average soap opera. Hank's gf still loves him and wants him to be faithful. Hank wants it too, and at one point he actually gives up others for her. But somehow, for some unexplicable reason, in every episode she catches him in a rather naughty-looking position with another woman. So finally she dumps him, and he goes to live with another rich-but-not-working guy, rock producer Lew Ashby (whom he's writing a book about). Hank is out of his home and desperately in need of consoling, so we have more excuse to see the token pubic hair and orgasm scene (at least once in every episode).<br/><br/>Other characters include Charlie, the something-producer (who looks very much like a twisted, retarded version of Peter Lorre. Also contender for the most annoying, pointless character in TV history) and his coke-snorting wife, etc. <br/><br/>I have nothing against sexuality, profanity or drug use on movies, or TV. As long as they are in the right context, proving a point. As long as they are a part of the plot. (Like Deadwood, or Entourage) But in this case, they are not. I guess Californication was supposed to be a series about some people's lives, involving their affairs, sex lives and drug habits. Instead, it is a series about sex, with no characters in it. And you may tell yourself it is not so, but there's a name for that: porn.<br/><br/>I'm trying to imagine the target audience for this show. Certainly not kids. There's almost no action, in fact, no story at all; so I'm guessing not men either. Women? Only bored housewives who'll watch any dull fantasy, I guess. Although no fantasies here either: just Hank exchanging dirty implications with women and trying to give the ""It's oh so hard to be rich and loved by every woman, I'm sooo artistic and world-weary"" look.<br/><br/>I try to find one bit of entertainment, at least one ingredient that works in this hodge podge of a series. Yes, the soundtrack. The songs are cool. That's it.<br/><br/>Final word: I've read quite a few hundred, perhaps thousands of comments on various movies and TV shows, but no show's fans use the word ""witty"" as often as fans of Californication. It seems to mean: ""I love seeing breasts, but I'm too sophisticated to admit it, so I call this 'witty' instead of 'titty' ."" <br/><br/>**** Hank has a Porsche but it is always dirty and one of the headlights is broken, yet he never gets it fixed. WOW! How profound. He is soooo artsy, sooo different from the rest of us.",108 out of 205 found this helpful.,2.0,28 March 2009
1936,Californication, Much more interesting when I was younger,"So, back when this was all new and fresh, I was absolutely maniac about it. 
Even dreamed of moving to LA just to experience the non-stop sex and discovery with very young, beautiful and wiling ladies.<br/><br/>Well.. Now I'm closer to 40 and much more knowledgeable of life, in general. For the life of me I can't understand what I liked about it and why. It was rather interesting in the first and maybe second season, about how one can re-trace his shattered life and can re-make his broken family. And even the ""seduction"" parts were not weird and porno-movie-speed inspired. <br/><br/>But after that, it just became one lame excuse for nudity. In fact, it's the very prototype of how you can prolong a show's life using excessive nudity. And while in the first seasons the writing was witty and funny and entertaining, it just got stupid afterwards and if that was the point.. whoever tried to make it was stupid. 
Case in point, one of the very last scenes, in an airplane, where Hank declares his love to Karen, some random young girl offers herself up if Karen does not respond in kind. It's porn-stupid, without the nudity. But stupid and unrealistic. And misogynistic, come to think.<br/><br/>I have no idea if I rate it back then, but in this day and age, I'll give it 6 for the excellent cast, first two seasons, cinematography and general quality in making it.

1937,Californication, The series is boring to death,"Well, I have probably not understood ""the magic"" of this series. I do not see the theme as ""controversial"". Sex? Marijuana? ""Controversial"" these days? The Sons of Anarchy are controversial, because they depict ""collaboration"" of police to gang members, cover-up of murders etc. <br/><br/>The Californication, on the other hand, is more similar to Sex in the City, but there are only two ""leads"" instead of four, one pathetic, one outgoing. The parts of the series seem almost identical to me: It is series of unfunny sexual debates of ""supercool"" Duchovny with some random woman, then short sexual encounter with that particular woman, then they got discovered during the sex or shortly after it, then Duchovny tries to cover up the situation, then he wants to ""educate"" his daughter, and finally he becomes sad and wants to return to his wife. This repeats every part of the series.<br/><br/>If you deduct the sex and sometimes drugs or vomit (ie. ""the controversy""), then NOTHING remains in the series. Nothing. There is no progress, no fun, no drama, simply nothing. It is more collection of ""short alcohol-inspired sex stories"" which are being discussed on colleges than some REAL life story. Duchovny's character is not a writer solving his problems, he is very shallow womanizer with no direction and with no strong theme in his life. If he would try to sell drugs or weapons, he might be at least tracked by the police which could put at least some marginal drama in the series. But he does not cross any line except for common sense and some decency. He is just ""too old teenager"" with his own daughter. Otherwise he is completely irrelevant. <br/><br/>There is no drama, no catharsis in the series, only endless trip from party to party. If you want to get more reasonable controversy, go for Bukowski. He is miles better than this... boredom.",79 out of 150 found this helpful.,1.0,5 March 2011
1938,Californication, Who Cares?,"So yet another LA writer is depressed. So Hollywood, yet again, couldn't remain faithful to LA writer's original story. So, yet again, LA writer seems able to get any woman but his wife into bed as he flits from mansion to mansion. Which of course means that, yet again, LA writer has conflicting emotions regarding his ex. And, yet again, LA writer's daughter is struggling with her emerging sexuality and maybe dabbling in drugs.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but it all seems to have that ho hum, been there, done that feel about it. Unlike the rest of us, LA writer can well afford a shrink so why doesn't he just see one and sort himself out? (And if he's sold his book rights to Hollywood why can't he afford to fix the headlight on his Porche, hell, why doesn't he just buy a new car? And, yes, I got the metaphor they wanted us to get.)<br/><br/>How often does TVLand seem to display an ignorance of a world outside of LA? And the problems of one obviously-not-struggling-financially writer really don't amount to a hill of beans to anyone in this other world.<br/><br/>If it is difficult to sympathise with the problems of the main character, who cares how well a series is written, or how well acted? Or how fabulous the sets/costumes/camera-work etc. etc. are?

1939,Californication, TV for the easily entertained.,"A show that guest stars: Marilyn Manson, Tim Minchin, Heather Graham, Rob Lowe and has David Duchovny (X-Files) playing the lead role sounds like an amazing show, right? <br/><br/>The first season is fantastic. It has everything going for it in terms of plot, characters, and witty dialogue. The main character is the writer, Hank Moody, who seems to have reached a peak after the success of his magnum opus: God Hates Us All. After moving from New York to Los Angeles, he has not continued with his writing at all. The show starts with Hank separated from his girlfriend Karen with whom he has a teenage daughter. Karen is now engaged to her new man, Bill, and Hank is trying his best to win back Karen and his daughter, while masking his despair with alcohol, women, and sarcasm.<br/><br/>The story moves at a quick pace with plenty of tense situations that need resolving as Hank gets himself into trouble over and over again as if by nature. Along for the ride is his sidekick agent and best friend, Charlie Runkle. <br/><br/>The show employs no subtlety when dealing with adult themes. There is nudity, crass language, drug taking, and hedonism at every turn. It somehow works with a sort of charm that comes with the troubled ""writer stereotype"". Each episode leaves you eager to carry on; to watch this odd circus act bounce around. <br/><br/>You feel for the pathetic Hank Moody, and there is a hope for him to get his happy ending. The finale of season one is almost perfect. Although it does leave some curiosity as to what could possibly happen next, it has an ending all of its own. <br/><br/>After the first season, there is a sigh in the show, as Hank continues to make trouble around, and for himself. With each consecutive season, the show only gets worse and worse. Any emotive connection that may have been felt for Hank flies out the window as he turns from a troubled, interesting human being to a ridiculous caricature. The show is not for adult audiences anymore, it's for immature giggling teenagers. There seems to be a growing urgency to shock and entertain, and sex becomes the one thing that can just happen for no good reason. If you spot a new female character in the show, Hank will have sex with her, all while acting unsurprised and deserving. It becomes sickening fast. <br/><br/>Charlie Runkle, the agent, also becomes a cartoon character who bumbles along after Hank, making sly deals, getting into embarrassing situations, and saying stupid lines. And oh, he has a small penis. Hank, on the other hand, is the hero who can bed anyone, and they all love him immensely. And oh, he has an enormous penis. The part about Hank being a struggling writer is no longer important, and his troubles with Karen and his annoying daughter, Becca, become a reoccurring banality. <br/><br/>Any heart this show could have had was thrown in the trash. There is something disgustingly ""Hollywood"" about Hank Moody's character. He is the man with the cool head who can crack wise in tough situations; he humiliates other people and is only friends with the coolest, edgiest rock n' roll types. All women want him, and the men are either jealous or think he's awesome. It gets so ridiculous, that you start to suspect that Duchovny is secretly writing the show all for himself and his ego, or at least has a say on what his character does. If you've ever watched a Steven Seagal movie, you might have an idea of the cocky American hero that Hank Moody does so well. They are not characters at all, but something that kids cheer on while jumping on the sofa. <br/><br/>Most of the guest stars mentioned at the beginning of this review only show up towards the end of the show, as some last ditch attempt to make the series interesting. By then you won't care how it ends because you no longer feel anything for the characters. There's no sense of anticipation, and the series works backwards to how a good show should.<br/><br/>Truly awful.",33 out of 58 found this helpful.,3.0,6 November 2014

1944,Californication, just like sugar in bread,"Gorgeous women are infatuated by an average looking guy called Hank Moody. It just doesn't work – in real life they wouldn't look at him. It seems that the script was intended for someone who looks like David Beckham, but they settled for this unattractive actor. I think there is too much sex and swearing in the show. If the audience wants to see sex- they'll just rent a porn tape. The story is about Hank Moody who's a writer and is supposedly an intelligent person but everything that comes out of his mouth is filth. It's intriguing in the first episodes but then it feels like the writers of the show have nothing to say except have him swear and talk about sex. Having said that – there where some good scenes- like when the cop pulls him over and overhears their argument I think this show had potential. The problem is - that the only thing they seem to be focused on is high rating by having a lot of sex scenes, just like they put sugar in bread (in the States) to satisfy your taste buds.

All this withuut the other character doing wrong.<br/><br/>This was just a small example, she keeps making decisions like she's a 11 year old child, just going against everyone, not explaining anything, just because she's the strong main character.

1948,Van Helsing, Ok to watch until 4th season,"It's amazing, how this series flops. Originally I gave it a six as it was sort of fun to watch.

The same people heal from gunshots almost immediately but can't do anything to a soldier with a stun baton ;D<br/><br/>Poorly written, total waste of time starting from the 4th season. Just watch 4th season and 10th episode and you hope you'd never started to watch this series. It just makes you angry.

1949,Van Helsing, By episode 7 it has great potential,"Give it a chance....Yes if you watch only a couple of episodes you might say, ""eh, can take it or leave it"". However I like to put in at least a few episodes to see if a new show develops. Many now popular shows started out slow. Even the huge hit, Seinfeld was iffy the whole first season. In fact they didn't have their breakout season until season 4. It's a shame that shows are chopped so quickly these days. Sometimes it takes a few episodes to even start developing characters. I recommend just watching at least to episode 8. By then, you will see the characters are finally developing and there are also a few surprises. Now at episode 10, it's practically a different show. Hopefully you will give it a chance too and then by episode 10 you will know for sure if you like it. For me, it's a show I look forward to and I am hoping this will develop into something even better!",124 out of 176 found this helpful.,9.0,21 November 2016
1950,Van Helsing," First episodes are typically SYFY bad, but it gets better.","Even though I didn't really like the first episode(s) I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt. Of course it's not a top rated series but for SYFY standards it actually gets pretty interesting as soon as the character roles start evolving. I wrote this since the last couple of episodes really got my attention. <br/><br/>If you don't like series in apocalyptic settings, skip this. If you keep in mind that the budget for this was A LOT less than for the top rated series.. you might actually appreciate it. <br/><br/>Final judgment: The acting gets better The whole 'feral vampire' thing is kind of overdone. I think more people are annoying by the stupidity (and constant growling) of the vampires. The story line gets interesting so curiosity about what will happen next will make up it. <br/><br/>If you already finished the better series out there and like the setting of this story, it's worth watching.",107 out of 152 found this helpful.,8.0,19 November 2016
1951,Van Helsing, Looking forward to see how story unfolds,"I have just finished season 2 and my review is based on that.<br/><br/>First season, awful. Don't get disappointed, it gets better and has potential I think. While watching season 1 it felt like watching a bad version of walking dead. But what walking dead lacks, van helsing tried to capture. A story moving somewhere. I am not bad mouthing walking dead, but I got so irritated with it's repetitive storyline I dropped it. Yes I dropped it in the middle. In the beginning of van helsing, I thought another wanna be walking dead. To be honest I wasn't even watching it, it was just running in the background. But by the end of season 2 it got my attention. It looks like story is going somewhere. It's not like walking dead season after season running around and blah blah.<br/><br/>Anyway, a lot depends on the audience. If you are into vampire shows and movies like twilight or vampire diaries, this show is not for you. But if you are one of those who enjoyed Underworld movies or the strain, give it a try. Things get interesting by the end of season 2.<br/><br/>Based on season 1 I would have hated it under 5, but season 2 influenced me to rate it at least 8.",39 out of 53 found this helpful.,8.0,15 September 2018

1953,Van Helsing, Plain WRONG reviews from overcritical people.,"Hi, <br/><br/>I'm another of those ""I made an account to write this review"" people. Why? Because I see a decent horror TV series getting bashed into oblivion for the wrong reasons and by the wrong people.<br/><br/>This series needs a few episodes to understand it's direction. I've seen just plain dumb and wrong conclusions about the vampires and characters because people don't give this series more then 1 or 2 episodes (which ARE very average indeed).<br/><br/>Let me set some things right here:<br/><br/>-The vampires are NOT dumb homeless people who run and bite. They have several layers of society, ranging from dumb ferals to ancient old vampires who resemble the more known vampire monsters.<br/><br/>About the ferals; I have never seen better acting in a zombie/vampire flick. Some of these actors are godlike portraiting feral vampires. They deserve respect instead of these shallow ""reviews"" by people who cling to original story lines and monsters.<br/><br/>I won't say give this show a chance, I'm saying that you have to look past the dirty, shallow, nerdy reviews it has been getting.<br/><br/>This is my guilty pleasure next to TWD, and there is no better for me.",73 out of 108 found this helpful.,8.0,30 January 2017
1954,Van Helsing, Ven Helsing is not bad,"The trick to watching certain genres in film is not to expect too much. You watch Van Damm or Schwarzenegger, you don't expect much. The Mechanic was entertaining, but it wasn't George III, right? It isn't reasonable to expect a TV show to be more than what it is. That's the case with Van Helsing. It is what it is: a SYFY channel original program with probably not the biggest budget in the world. Almost every TV show is rocky in the first season. It takes awhile for everything to shake down. Van Helsing is shaking okay. I watch it weekly, love the characters, and it's always a treat watching Christopher Heyerdahl. So hang in, be patient, give the show a chance. I think Season 2 will be much better.

Watch The Expanse. <br/><br/>Better recent Sci-Fi in general? Check out Humans (BBC/AMC co-production). <br/><br/>Looking for a vampire fix?

If more people would watch it, more people would like it. just like with any other show, while only the picky dicks are around you get bad reviews but when people start watching just for the fun of it.

1958,Van Helsing, Watch Passed the First Episode,"Firstly... I am a critical viewer, there isn't much that captures my attention. That said, I have thoroughly been enjoying the mystery behind this series.<br/><br/>Yes, this is not the classic story of Van Helsing but rather follows a mysterious woman named Vanessa (Van). I can't quite get into detail about how in depth her character is due to immense spoilers but it is fantastic thus far. Some folks mentioned the poor take on vampires, without watching more than a few minutes of the first episode I imagine.<br/><br/>The vampires are regal, composed, elegant and event ancient. The rabble running amok on the streets are blood starved vampires that have gone feral due to a lack of a feeding population. This is not an uncommon theme with vampirism!<br/><br/>This series, unlike the vast majority, actually has me asking questions! For the first time in decades I am excited with regards to the vampiric lore. Where did -these- vampires come from? What is Vanessa's origin story? What is her relation to the Van Helsing of yore? This show offers a fresh perspective on an apocalyptic situation and vampires, weaving both together in such a way that I feel I am watching something NEW.<br/><br/>Heck, I even made an account to post a review after avoiding account creation here for many... many years. <br/><br/>Summary? -Excellent make-up -There is nothing wrong with the acting -Fresh and interesting take on vampirism -Riddled with intrigue -Worth a watch for vampire and apoc fans alike<br/><br/>Conclusion?

It is a sad combination between a zombie dressed as a person who lives on the street, crawls like a monkey, growls like a rabid dog and surprise : IT BITES.<br/><br/>There is a couple of ""ancient"" ones.

1960,Van Helsing, VanHelsing I think NOT,"First of all this has nothing to do with the story of Van Helsing and in fact this show does a great disservice to the very name. Set in 2019 the vampires act and look more like zombies, the main characters aren't inspiring and the script is just plain awful. The whole thing stumbles along at a very slow pace and even the action parts are slow and predictable. As for Van Helsing well he's a woman who's been laying on, what appears to be an operating table, for quite a long time in a laboratory of sorts. Van Helsing is guarded by a lone soldier who feeds the once doctor, now vampire, with his own blood via an iv line. Sounds ridiculous? well it is.

1961,Van Helsing, disappointing,Tuned in thinking I was getting a 1800s style show about van hellsing with sophisticated vampires (admittedly all I tuned in for was the name and knew nothing else about the show). I love the story of van hellsing.<br/><br/>What I got was a terrible walking dead rip off. Turned off half way through. The vampires came across as zombies with intelligence. And not much intelligence at that. Yawn. If I wanted to watch that kind of show I would have tuned into walking dead or another zombie related show. Which there are many of.<br/><br/>If this was a zombie show ... it might add something to this genre. It doesn't to the vampire genre. I was confused half way through the first episode as to what was happening and why things were as they were. There was no explanation offered.

Right off the bat I felt pretty scared watching this show because I am from Seattle, and the idea of Yellow Stone blowing up is a reality I am afraid of! Who is to say that it doesn't contain some sort of chemical that will turn people into Zombies..? Well that wouldn't be as big of an issue as VAMPIRES who can think and destroy defenses with tools. I feel like they really nailed a Fallout 3/4 atmosphere on the Television, which is pure awesome. I like how the Vampires aren't retarded and can think for themselves, making the survival situation that much more intense. Let's not forget about the cool line of up cast :) Axel is da man, and we all love Vanessa. Personally I think if you don't like this show, you're just like those people who hate on Rick and Morty.

At first it does seem as if vampires have been demoted to very feral beings - this not quite being the case later on.

1966,Van Helsing," Not bad, give it a chance.","*****Only mediocre spoilers***** I don't review often I just read them, but felt compelled to put some light on all the negativity surrounding this new series. <br/><br/>I've given it 8 because of all the bad reviews on here. I think people watched 2-3 episodes and decided it wasn't worth more viewing time. <br/><br/>On axel (Jonathon scarfe)- he was the lead for a good while and lead well, until Vanessa took over and found her feet. His acting far outweighs any negativity shared here, and it's worth watching from his viewpoint just to get better understanding of what's happening around them. <br/><br/>Vanessa ( Kelly Overton) - a bit chalky at first, but she settles well into her character and played her well. Her leadership takes over and her powers become more clear to her toward the end of the season, where she starts to understand her heritage. <br/><br/>The good doc - at first felt compelled to watch to find out her outcome, but her character ends up being more disappointing nearing the end, not because of her courage, but the lack of in her case. But it's interesting. <br/><br/>Mohammed and Sam - these two were great to watch and see their stories unfold, the history to the two and how they came to be so close is quite a story. Mohammed shows great survival instincts as does Sam, but they both go in very different directions and Sam's motives become clearer, as does Mohammed's... I think these two will be interesting in season 2. <br/><br/>The two vampire clans... what can I say, there acting is kinda rubbish but I think that's where the tackiness of van helsings history comes into it. They have all the mediocre bits, the past and the present. They also have this new way of living, they still hide from direct sunlight, but walk, talk and run. It's more like a new age vampire which has evolved from just being hungry to some sort of story line. All we know is they are all afraid of Vanessa, but want to know what more she can do to to/for the vampires. <br/><br/>Yeah it's not like the age old van helsing. Yes, she's a woman. It works. No, the vampires aren't stuck in the past (apart from Dmitri and his followers) Yeah they act like zombies, brutal and uncaring and hungry.

1967,Van Helsing, Not as bad as the ratings reflect,"This honestly isn't as bad as the ratings indicate. I enjoyed most of it, save for the last episode. Axel wasn't the generic good guy who wants to save everyone; yes he wants to protect his group and he isn't afraid to kill people to do it, man or woman. He's not stupid enough to try and save everyone, and he had good plans. He was the best character in there until the freaking doctor left him to die (well, that in itself wasn't a cliché, which is good).<br/><br/>Vanessa is /okay/ as the MC. She's a bit generic but at least she's not that stupid.<br/><br/>You know what was stupid? the last episode. Why didn't that white- haired dude (the one Vanessa turned back to human in the first few episodes) point out to the group about to attack the citadel, that they HAVE to save Vanessa?<br/><br/>I mean, she's the key to ending this whole vampire situation. It's so dumb that anyone would even want to kill her. <br/><br/>The last episode wasn't so great but I'll still watch the next season. They better make Axel come back in a good way.

1969,Van Helsing, Very awful and frankly no fun.,"The only real spoiler here is the show itself - which stands in opposition to any sense of internal logic.<br/><br/>I kind of feel bad, because I don't want to just say mean things about anyone in this, but there's nothing else to really say, and I feel I should warn others of the danger. <br/><br/>Our lead has been ""asleep"" on a table in a crisp white t-shirt without food or water for at least six months (tacitly revealed by the ""Generic Hero Guy"" background) and apparently was either created for that purpose in a room in a facility which holds absolutely no devices or hardware required for that by genre convention, or she has been sleeping that way for the years it has been since the world fell apart. But don't worry... that won't be acknowledged at all by the characters. In fact neither will the running water, or seemingly abundant electricity that still exists after the world is dead.<br/><br/>The lead gives zero emotional reaction after learning her alleged ""future plot point crutch to be deployed during a possible writers strike daughter"" she was so yelly about in the first place is likely years dead. Really the only emotion beyond ""Angry!"" and ""Dramatic!"" an actor displays is the deaf guy (clearly given the director note to ""look sympathetic"") while watching the monologue of a random girl we don't know or have investment in as she Opens Up And Talks Facing Away From Him So He Wouldn't Even Be Able To Read Her Lips.<br/><br/>Yes it's that bad.<br/><br/>The poorly drawn characters' one-note pursuits against their own motivations (*in the rare moments they actually have motivations) with all the fury of a Cinco De Mayo hangover Big Brother episode becomes incredibly tiring. The runner up for character depth is the Renfield-like ""Doc"" who has been locked in a cage and fed blood for no logical reason and at no one's request since becoming a vampire essentially day one, and all she does is smile and laugh a lot. Of COURSE she becomes human again in a future episode... and it's frankly insulting that we'd be expected to watch that long and then pretend to be surprised at the turn.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of flat, pointless talking heads pushing back against each other and pulling each other's hair for contrarian reasons that no human being would mimic set against the backdrop of a lazy and relentlessly predictable survival scenario both illogical and completely free of drama, then this is trying to be the show for you. <br/><br/>If you're looking for something to watch while not suffering from impaired mental function, you may well want a refund on the hour you spent with this show because Roger Corman has turned out more thoughtful product.",60 out of 116 found this helpful.,1.0,21 September 2016

(Of course, being a ""shipper,"" I love the UST between the two main characters, but that's not the only reason I watch the show.)<br/><br/>As I once said to a friend to whom I was recommending the show: ""It will give you a new perspective on the military side of our socio-political system; it will open your eyes to the travesty around you, with storylines weekly pulled from the headlines; it will offer you several pieces of eye candy, varying in gender, age, and race; and it will broaden your horizons when it comes to what types of quality programming you permit yourself to watch.  . . . With creative episodal writing, there are references to many past episodes, keeping the regular viewer constantly on his or her toes.""<br/><br/>Really, though, ""JAG"" is a very enjoyable show, something that I can sit and watch with my parents and still talk about with my friends.

1972,JAG, Law and Order meets Top Gun!,"JAG (Judge Advocate General) is one of my favorite shows.  Week after week we see our invincilble-gungho hero and somewhat aloof romatic Harmon Rabb Jr (David James Elliot), pursue terrorists, prosecute, convict, defend and acquit: not-always-innocent scumbags, incompetent sailors and marines, and even his best friend.  Its hard to believe Elliot is Candadian born, playing a top American Hero.<br/><br/>I first saw JAG (although I did not really care about it) way back in 1995 when it first aired on NBC, but after 21 episodes (out of 22) and less than spectacular ratings, NBC canned it in the Spring of 1996.  NBC refused to air the (still somewhat unresolved to this very day) season 1 cliffhanger finale, although it did air in other parts of the world (More on this shortly).  I was a late comer, only captivated by summertime boredom and thus watching reruns on USA network, I realized I loved the show's premise, Law and Order meets Top Gun.   Harmon Rabb Jr (Elliot) is Mavrick (Tom Cruise), almost to the letter. He's a tomcat pilot, he's a gorgeous hunk to the ladies, and he's arrogant and reckless.  But at the sametime he couldn't be more different from Mavrick: he's a topnotch investigator and litigator, he's determined, he's sophisticated, and he's calm, calculating and sometimes vengefull.<br/><br/>Ironically, JAG's creator, Donald P. Bellisario, himself an former US. Marine, had previous successes on NBC with the Miami Vice predecessor Magnum P.I., and the scifi adventure series Quantum Leap. CBS saw potential in Bellisario's dream, even if NBC did not, and picked it up for a 2nd season, which began airing in 1997, realizing that JAG had a large (and potentially lucrative) following.  For years, CBS had been trying to pull itself out of the ratings shawdows cast down on it from NBC and ABC as well as staying ahead of the upstarts FOX, UPN and WB.  Today, JAG is among the Top 15 highest rated shows on TV.  NBC execs shot themsselves in the foot with JAG's cancellation and are still shaking the heads over.<br/><br/>
The show contains stories of American hero's in the Navy, taking real events and writing them into interesting epiodes with war stories and POW tales from Bosnia, Vietnam, the Gulf War, and the Cold War with the extinct USSR. It also writes in media feeding frenzies such as Elian Gonzalez, protests involving live fire exercises in Puerto Rico, and last year's Spy plane incident with China.  With the tragic events of Sept 11, and subsequent military involvement in Afganistan, JAG's latest season (season 7) now focuses almost exclusively on the continueing military effort to weed out world terrorists writing it into an intricate tale that could be very real in spirit.<br/><br/>The show contains plenty of fascinating film sequences which are often pulled out of cinematic features, to give the stories colorful and exciting action sequences, transitional scenery, and location.  The show's producers also insert actual footage recored by the US Military from training exercises, sometimes sending their own photographers to on-duty warships.<br/><br/>Throughout, the show's first season, most episodes were straitforward and hostile.  Rabb just did his job, with fire, on the run, never having any remembrance of the previous week's adventure, and a blond female partner, Meg Austin (Tracey something).  The season ended with a cliffhanger that never aired in the US, as NBC cancelled JAG.  But by the 2nd season, we never knew what really happened in the show's S1 finale (it was later explained, albiet badly in a ""flashback"" episode in S3). That explanation is: a female officer and lover of Rabb's is murdered, presumably by a stalker.  What diehard fans know is that the woman who was murdered happens to be a ""twin"" of Rabb's new partner, except that they have no familial relations whatsoever to one another...that we know of at any rate.  This twin is Rabb's counterpart and princpal character: Sarah ""Mac"" McKenezie (Cathryn Bell).  At first, Rabb had trouble accepting Mac, but gradually a best friend relationship grew between them, for the uncanny resemeblance Rabb sees in Mac to that of his deceased love, but now its created a hell of a sexual tension between the two.  Mac herself show's remarkable vulnerability and defiance to Rabb.  She's tagged along on his personel ""Mulder-like"" mission to Russia to learn the truth about Rabb's father who dissappeared during the Vietnam War. In almost every way possible she has kept him inline whenever he screws up, yet when she screws up, she wants nothing to do with Rabb.  An interesting tale of melodrama.<br/><br/>Great show, check it out!",73 out of 85 found this helpful.,,21 May 2002
1973,JAG, Great Show!!!,"This is one of the few shows I make an effort to watch every week. I like the interplay and chemistry between the characters, whether it is the leading two or the rest.The lesser known characters and guests stars play their roles well. Whethger it's Bud, Chedweggen, Singer or Gunny I like the roles and the characters. In fact the less popular characters are as neccessary to the show as the two leads. Who didn't feel sad for the pain of his character and his family when Bud lost his leg in Afghanistan? You get the chance to know and in some cases not just love, but strongly dislike the characters.While I am not big into lawyer shows, the military aspect and background makes it much better and different with political,military and possible combat situation. I was a fan of the show before Catherine Bell arrived and have remained so. The chemistry between Mac and Harm is great. I just hope they don't kill one of them off when the show has run its course. The show is a sterling example of our best and brightest doing their jobs day in and day out where the rules are different and its in a realm many Americans do not understand or know about. This has to rank as one of the best tv series' about the military.JAG is A1 in my book. I hope it goes on for a few more years!",50 out of 63 found this helpful.,,22 April 2003

Eye candy with a pulse, Catherine Bell is fun to look at and can act.  Her Demi Moore character as the pretty but witty lawyer adds to the  series. Many leading women who are considered to have amazing physical  assets are not always terrific actors. Catherine Bell is an exception.

However, please don't let that last comment sway you if you are not as gung-ho about the military as I am. The show is essentially ""Law &amp; Order"" (another one of my favorites) with the Navy as the backdrop. The characters are very well developed, and they grow with each episode.

1978,JAG, Another superb Belisarius Production,"I've always been a huge fan of Don Bellisario's creations, starting with 'Airwolf' (still my all-time favourite), and then 'Quantum Leap', but J.A.G. is really Don's excuse to get back to what he does best... military-based drama series (preferably with some big aerial toys to play with).<br/><br/>I loved the 1st Season of J.A.G. especially... the scripts and cast were at their best (with Andrea Parker - who later moved on to one of the main roles in 'The Prefender'), Tracey Needham and Andrea Thompson, but a network &amp; cast change at the start of the 2nd Season brought about a slight watering down of the show [the same happened after the superb 1st Season of 'Airwolf'] increased the ratings - so much so, that by its current 1999-2000 5th Season, it is now a Top 20 Nielsen show.<br/><br/>The show has returned more to its action roots with the 4th and 5th Seasons, so I'm happy again.<br/><br/>Some of the 2nd &amp; 3rd Season episodes are terrible though - including the one based in Northern Ireland, which was completely unrealistic. Like the Russian post above this one, the producers/writers of the show should visit other countries first before using every foreign stereotype they can come up with.<br/><br/>But, in the end, I still wouldn't miss this show (the only one I currently even make time to watch regularly) as it is, after all, a Belisarius Production!",28 out of 39 found this helpful.,,18 November 1999

1980,JAG, Good show - need more like it.,"It surprises me (assuming the show is reasonably accurate) how relatively little the Navy has changed since I got out of it 31 years ago. I assume the show gets some cooperation from the Navy, anyway it's worth watching. I have yet to see a bad episode. My only criticism is there is a tendency to wrap up an episode too quickly sometimes and there is too much time spent on romance and not enough on action (wow, I sound like I am about ten years old. Hmm.)",27 out of 40 found this helpful.,,3 March 1999
1981,JAG, Highly recommend-Great Show- Good plots- Doesn't feel fake,"First, I would like to say that if you have never seen ""JAG"" before, you need to watch it, especially if you are even just remotely interested in the Navy, the Marines, the Military in general, military law, civilian law, good stories, Catherine Bell or any other of the actors/actresses. The stories are very interesting, especially so in the last two or three seasons. I have watched the show regularly for several years, and the stories seem real, not just a lot of shooting and talking with no plot, like some other shows(cough..Pensacola..cough..). Watching this show has given me insight into how many things work in the military, and also it has many cool things that fit into the story without making it plotless-like SEALs, Naval/Marine Aviation, and even Russia and the KGB. If you hadn't figured it out already, JAG stands for Judge Advocate General, the legal branch of the military. The show centers on a group of Naval/Marine lawyers and legalman(somewhat of researchers and assistants to the Judge Advocates(lawyers)). The characters evolve over time, and you see their characters change. For example, Lt. Bud Roberts, a junior naval officer that debuted on the show as a public affairs officer or something on an aircraft carrier that Harm(David James Elliot) and Mac(Catherine Bell) are sent to to investigate a crime. Bud later became a regular on the show, transferring to the office of the JAG and becoming a legalman. Later, he goes back to the carrier with Harm and Mac(this is much later), and falls in love with then-Ensign Simms, who has replaced him in what he did on the carrier, who later does what Bud did and transfers. Bud becomes a lawyer and is promoted to Lt. jg and later Lt., and the two are married and have a child together. The characters are also developed somewhat more subtly, such as when Bud's father, Master Chief Bud Roberts(Sr.), Ret. is court-martialed(is charged of a crime and brought to trial in military court. The Master Chief is a drunk and abused Bud and his brother Mikey when they were children. Bud Sr. didn't show up for his son's wedding. Mikey is eventually coerced to enlist in the Navy, becoming a fire controlman, and is eventually charged with crimes himself(Bud Sr. and Mikey both are found innocent). I went to all the trouble of registering and writing this so the least you can do is watch the show once. It's on 8pm EST on CBS(new and recent re-runs) Tuesdays, and 7pm EST every night on USA(re-runs from past seasons), excepting for special shows/events such as Big Brother and the Grand Open. It's a great show and I think you will like it, so at least watch it.",21 out of 31 found this helpful.,,28 August 2001
1982,JAG," Not Quite ""Top Gun"" Meets ""A Few Good Men"": Suffers From Too Much Military Cliché","Is this an original show or the television equivalent of an army-navy recruiting poster? What made the movie ""A Few Good Men"" such outstanding cinema was its willingness to steer clear of obvious military cliché. Sure you can have the fanatical colonel who was a disciple at Patton's knee but there's also ingredients in his character that makes him different. Jessup certainly had the passion of a Patton but also the contempt for authority of a Nixon. But JAG offers the hot-headed and sweating military officer whose veins pop out of his neck ad infinitum that has been seen so many times that it's a textbook study of stereotypes to avoid. Budding screenwriters take note. (Take note of a similar character in the recent film ""Avatar"".) But in JAG few characters are anything more than these caricatures who are exactly as you would expect them.<br/><br/>The opening pilot episode wreaks with so much wall-to-wall story cliché, it seems a collage of scenes from other films and shows. From the strands of trumpet fanfares accompanied by snare drums at the opening (my kingdom for different music) to the flashback of the main character as a naval pilot, JAG never quite transcends to an original story. I couldn't help but think of the parody ""Airplane!"" with the flashback sequence. There's the tough butch woman out to prove she's as good as men, the hot-headed aircraft carrier captain, the obnoxious guy in the officer's lounge who knows the investigator, the sexual innuendos between the two investigators who just happen to be a male and a female, and the creme-de-la-creme: the main character's father was also a naval pilot who died on a mission. If I had $100 for every time someone referred to his father, I could probably buy a Carravagio. I guess you just had to have the obligatory ""Your father would be very proud of you."" Give me a break. Were the writers sick the day they taught how to avoid hackneyed dialog? This came off like a by-the-numbers approach to film-making that you could probably purchase at a game store for about $10. There's ""Patton"", ""Top Gun"", ""Moonlighting"", ""A Few Good Men"", almost any western of your choice where there's bar or saloon, and of course almost any over-the-top war movie of your choice, like ""The Longest Day"".<br/><br/>The plot of the first episode is somewhat interesting: a woman naval pilot on the verge of an outstanding career goes missing from aboard her aircraft carrier. The two JAG corps investigators, a boy-girl team in the style of ""Hart to Hart"" and ""Moonlighting"", board the carrier to reveal the truth. Of course the implied sexual play between the two leads is so over-the-top I expected them to be leaping into a bunk together by conclusion, which is against naval regulations. At first the female character states that this is strictly a business-investigative relationship. However, when the male lead is speaking to her in private, he gets closer to her than would be necessary to kiss. And she lets it happen as if she can't refuse him. So much for the rhetoric of the show. (One thing I liked about ""A Few Good Men"" is that the young leads, Tom Cruise and Demi Moore, never got together.) The only notable performance of the entire episode was by Terry O'Quinn, playing a military colleague of the lead investigator's late father. He's tough, smart and not entirely sold on the idea of women naval pilots. Simultaneously he doesn't come off cliché or stereotypical. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the pilot episode of JAG collapses under its own weight. By show's end I knew who did it. The acting is marginal, except for O'Quinn. There are too many badly scripted, acted and directed sexual innuendo scenes in the vein of Moonlighting but not nearly as good or believable. They just came off contrived as if the producers are showing us what we want to see. Also, too many cliché characters, too many other cliché scenes, like the chewing out of an inferior officer by a superior. And the hot-head in the lounge/bar. How many times have I seen this? And that's the problem with cliché. It starts seeming like a cartoon and not something real. And I begin to lose interest because I've seen it before. Good writing avoids cliché because we want to see something new, not just a jigsaw puzzle of worn-out scenes. Strangely enough, I think cliché is less believable.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,5.0,13 March 2010
1983,JAG," Good action, and accurate","JAG started out as a total shoot-'em-up, dynamic show on NBC.  It lasted almost a season, and was cancelled; CBS took it, and cleaned it up.  Now, what you see is a relatively accurate view of life as a staff corps officer in the US Navy and US Marine Corps.  Of course, it's still a little TOO action-packed for the real JAG Corps, in that most service lawyers will never take leave to travel into a foreign country to face insurgents or rescue POW's.  However, the issues JAG raises can surprise you - Cuban immigrants, political power struggles in Congress and the Fleet, criminals in uniform (just your average old murderers, thieves, secessionists and militias), racism, sexism, tradition versus progress, and the like. People are always drawn to military dramas, to action, and to law-inspired entertainment; JAG wraps them all into one.  The idea of having a gorgeous co-star, who is arguably tougher than the lead, and does NOT expect her looks to get her her way, is groundbreaking, which is unfortunate to happen this late.  As far as work goes, it's good to be attractive, but better to be good.  JAG illustrates this well.  Or, alternately, it's better to be right than popular, or, sometimes, the good guys win!",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,29 January 2001
1984,JAG, great show that went bad the last 2 seasons,"I started watching JAG in 1997 and it immediately became my favorite TV show. Vietnam era vet in the USAF too bad they didn't have more interaction with the Air Force. Anyways, a GREAT show. But then, because of circumstances I missed seasons 8, 9 and 10. Just recently I've been watching them on-line, and sadly, I have to say this great show got bad by season 9 and season 10 was almost unpalatable to watch. Why and how could this have happened. 1) Too soap opera, where there was more emphasis on the character interaction than the court cases, but the worst reason was 2) the characters became hokey and silly. Unreal. Like ""check me out, aren't I neat?!"" The only ones who had any sense of original propriety were Harm and MAC. The worst one was this Vic. It's OK to have some ""Hollywood license"" but what makes a character great is when they display INTEREST, in their lives, their work, with others. But when they become INTERESTING with their silly overdone personalities and quirks, they become a distraction and annoying and that's EXACTLY what happened. (this by the way, was WAY worse with NCIS - I couldn't get thru one episode the characters were so overdone and ""interesting"" instead of being interested. Only Mark Harmon was good) If they had just kept the brashness of Vic and used JUST that with his interactions that would have been good. But he became so overbearing. The new Marine JAG also didn't have to be so serious. In it's favor, the character development of Bud from bumbling geek (too overdone) to competent lawyer was good Also, so many handsome men and gorgeous women. Yes, to be expected from Hollywood but too unreal for the military. MAC is a little chest-heavy but has the face of an angel, she is so beautiful, although the short-crop hair of season 10 was a detraction. In any case, the 2 very best plot developments was the interaction between Harm and Mac AND the intricacies of the court cases. By the 10th season that got lost with the silliness of other characters and sub-plots. Season 3 through 6 were the best. All in all though, a TREMENDOUS show.

1985,JAG," First five seasons were great, the second five were second rate","When 'JAG' first aired on British television back in early 1996, I was hooked. As a huge fan of shows such as 'Law and Order', it was a dream come true finding a series that had all the action of a military programme and the intelligence of a courtroom drama rolled into one. The characters were also likable and well-portrayed with David James Elliott's Harmon Rabb being stubborn yet just and dedicated to Navy and his country and Tracey Needham's character Meg Austin being his talented, determined partner who, after the first season, was replaced by Sarah Mackenzie-- a tough, aggressive Marine-- played by Catherine Bell. It was always thrilling and engaging to watch Rabb and co investigating various crimes involving the Navy and Marine, often cases that bore resemblance to military news happening in reality, then having to argue their case in court.<br/><br/>However, this once great show went downhill by season five when the military-based story lines quickly gave way to plots that would have been more suited to a daytime TV soap. Instead of seeing Rabb and Mac striving to see justice done, we had excessive time wasted on which man Mac liked and, worse, whether she wanted to have babies. There were times I honestly felt I was not watching 'JAG' and had accidentally switched over to 'Neighbours' or 'Sunset Beach'. As the show lost sight of its original genre and became less of a military series and more of a soap, it lost its appeal with me although I still enjoy watching the earlier seasons when it was at its best. I only hope 'JAG''s producer Donald P. Bellisario doesn't make the same mistake with his other series 'NCIS'.",15 out of 25 found this helpful.,5.0,9 March 2006
1986,JAG, Excellent show...worthy of birthing NCIS,"I'll be honest; I was only interested in JAG because it gave birth to my favorite show NCIS. I rented the two DVDs that contained the pilot episodes. Since my family liked NCIS, I waited to watch the pilot for NCIS and watch them with my family. In the meantime, I watched the episodes before the first part of the pilot (I got the discs one at a time). I got hooked fast. I liked how each episode felt interconnected, with either some plot points being set up before the episodes where they were center stage or past ones have at least a minor effect on the current episode. I also got to loving the characters. Harm and Mac are a great combo, with them fighting each other outside or inside of the courtroom one moment and buddies the next. I enjoyed Admiral Chegwidden and Bud, as well as Harriet. There was a great sense of humor. It may've been a little more serious than NCIS, but I say JAG is just as funny as NCIS. It got to the point where when I got to the NCIS pilot episodes, the reasons I even gave JAG the time of day, (SLIGHT SPOILER) I had hard time deciding who to root for: My old friend Gibbs, or my new one Rabb. Needless to say, JAG is an awesome show. I guess I shouldn't be surprised since NCIS is so good that JAG is good. I highly recommend this show.

But the last episode I saw, at least half of it (couldn't watch anymore) was as disappointing as well as stupid, inaccurate and totally offensive. The story of this episode (I can't remember the title/number) was about a pilot, that shot an armored car, because he thought that the Serbs were in it. It had a flag on it and wasn't shooting at anyone ;&gt;<br/><br/>Well let me tell you why is this very wrong: Even though I'm not a Serb (I'm Slovenian) and I know very well about mass murders or genocide that happened in the 90-is, it is very clear that: 1. Russian and Yugoslavian flag do have the same colours but NOT the same flag. Comm'on, don't you remember the red star? in the MIDDLE of the flag?? 2. Killing someone just because he's of a certain nationality is wrong, even if, at the time, he's involved in a large scale war. Yeah, than the character stated that he had to kill them, because they were probably headed to make another mass burial site. Aham... like only the Serbs did that. Wake up! There was no good/evil here! Just too much propaganda, just like in USA and Cuba nowadays...<br/><br/>I don't get it - I know that ""history is written by winners"" but here was nothing to win. The real truth about the wars aggressors will show: a) when enough time passes, so most people involved in it will be dead and b) that ""evildoers"" weren't only the Serbs but all nations that were part of that big old Yugoslavia.",16 out of 31 found this helpful.,1.0,18 July 2006

Sadly it's all done on a budget so the acting is wooden, the scripts shallow and unconvincing and most of the stuff gluing it together nicked from stock footage without even a crude attempt at CGI to make the continuity work (others have mentioned details like plane types and ship numbers, but even the basics ... a plane has a sodding great hole blasted in it and the next minute a mint example lands at Miramar, before, frames later, the bruised pilot is hauled out of the wreckage).<br/><br/>All very laughable, but does it matter? well yes it does, the political agenda strays into the story lines, and google about, people are taking this nonsense seriously.<br/><br/>A few episodes deal with sexual harassment, but in such a one dimensional unquestioning way, all trying to refight the tailhook controversy, but so transparently and obnoxiously they actually show whoever is behind this appalling stuff learned entirely the wrong lesson.<br/><br/>Just watched a ridiculous journey into Northern Irish terrorism. Belfast seems to be some sort of downtown New York with 50s London taxis and buses (hey, you can get a bus from the RUC HQ direct to Carnaby street!). RUC officers seem to have dodgy Cork accents, while the IRA spoke with voices I'd normally expect to hear from an apprenticeboy. Everyone had a nice tie and tweedy suit. Of course the English have to be baby-eating facists, and the visiting Americans can cut through decades of complex intrigue and hatred to solve the case in mere minutes, hampered only by this British obsession with not allowing them to carry guns.<br/><br/>I'd love to see the producers have the guts to try the same sort of insulting nonsense set in downtown Jerusalum.<br/><br/>The characters in this thing are so one-dimensional, the scripts predictable, and the whole thing so cheaply chucked together.

1990,JAG, The First Season: A Revelation,"When JAG first came on the air, I didn't watch it at all. My politics are a little left of center and I was not impressed by the first Bush administration sending our people to secure the Kuwaiti oil fields. I felt American lives were worth more than that. When a show came on a couple of years later that was advertised by seemingly endless shots of people in uniform saluting planes that were taking off, I just wasn't in the mood for what I took to be a John Wayne vision of the military as a bunch of patriotic action figures with no real depth as human beings.<br/><br/>A couple of years later I was visiting my parents and they had begun watching JAG, scheduling their Tuesday evening plans around it. This was not surprising for my Dad, an ex-marine and a solid Republican. It was surprising for my Mom, a Democrat with the same opinion of military adventures that I had. The first episode I watched was the last episode of the third season, ""To Russia With Love"". It seemed reasonably entertaining and certainly wasn't' ""jingoistic"". The characters were multi-dimensional, (I certainly noticed that Catherine Bell was!). Since it was a cliff-hanger I naturally had to watch the first show in the fall and slowly became hooked, making the show part of my own regular viewing schedule.<br/><br/>I found it a solid, if flawed, drama focusing primarily on the effort, through law, to keep the military on it's moral compass. I'd always liked ""The Caine Mutiny"" and also liked ""A Few Good Men"", which seems to have inspired the series. The concept of judging a severely hierarchical organization using a set of standards that ultimately supersedes the hierarchy while continuing to respect it is dramatically interesting and the show drove home the point that military power itself is not enough: it has to have a moral reason for its existence and use.<br/><br/>When I used to watch ""Star Trek"", I presumed that a civilization that could travel across the distances of space would probably be militarily superior to anyone they encountered and that their dilemmas would tend to be moral, (how to use their power wisely), more often than physical, (how to get more power to defeat a threat), and I preferred the ""moral dilemma"" episodes, even though they were in the minority. In JAG, those episodes seemed to be the norm and the ""action"" episodes the exception.<br/><br/>There were two things I didn't like about the show. One was it's non-linear format, jumping from the main story to a romantic or comical sub-plot or into a continuing background story. I prefer shows that stick to their subject. JAG seemed to be a half-hour drama padded into an hour format by all the ""other stuff"". I came to resent the ""action"" shows. They seemed to be a rather silly divergence from what the show was really about, certainly from what a JAG lawyer's job was all about. I remembered watching ""Homicide"", which was supposed to be an examination of the day-to-day lives of Baltimore homicide detectives but which occasionally was interrupted with episodes the network insisted they make about serial killers, drug kingpins and arsonists so they could advertise it with titles like ""City on Fire"", etc. It seemed to me that the ""action"" episodes of JAG, with their ""Hunt for Red October"" plots, CIA undercover work, continuing stories about Harm's father and brother and mysterious, recurring villains served the same purpose for the network and served little purpose on the show itself.<br/><br/>The show went off the air after a decade and I was recently walking through a record store and saw the DVD of the first season of JAG for sale. I bought it on a whim, just to see what the show was like at its beginning. It was a revelation. The shows take place almost entirely in the field and are about JAG investigations. Those investigations inevitably lead to action-packed sequences but at least they grow logically out of a JAG investigation. The show has a completely linear format and thus has a much faster pace but still has more time to tell it's story because it's not cross-cut with sub-plots or ongoing stories. I like Catherine Bell but I like Tracey Needham even a little better. She seems very soft and sexy, (especially with that watery voice), and yet can be tough when the occasion demands. ""Tough"" is a personality trait but not a type of person and those who have to be hard-boiled to be tough really aren't very good at it. Meg Austin demonstrates that very well.<br/><br/>The production values are amazing, especially since the show at that time had no Navy co-operation. Clips and even sets from several movies, (Top Gun, The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide and isn't the ambush in ""War Cries"" from ""A Clear and Present Danger""?) are skillfully integrated with stock footage and scenes shot on an old carrier and in a studio give each episode the look of a movie.<br/><br/>It's one of the most entertaining shows I've ever seen. Even if there are only two episodes with courtroom scenes, the ""moral dilemmas"" are still there: the show is all about right and wrong. Even though I liked the later JAG, I'd have to say the original concept of the show was much superior. Apparently the public, (the show was ranked 77th in the ratings that year) and the networks didn't agree. The show got canceled, picked up by CBS and changed considerably and wound up in the top ten, lasting a decade, something very few shows have ever done.<br/><br/>At least we've got the DVDs of the first season to see what it was originally supposed to be like.",6 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,28 April 2007

1992,JAG, Good Military/Lawyer Fun!,"Yes, JAG is cliche. Yes, the characters and plots are often predictable. No, this show won't win an Emmy, but so what? Can't hour dramas be fun?<br/><br/>David James Elliot (Cmdr. Harmon Rabb) and Catherine Bell (Col. Sarah MacKenzie) -- and don't forget Adm. Chegwidden, both Lt. Roberts, and the rest -- play the roles of lawyers in the Navy's Judge Advocate General Corps. The show explores the intricacies of the legal system (esp in the military world) and the military itself in a nice fashion, always with topical storylines. Everything from the recent V-22 crashes to the Chinese EP-3 incident to the sinking of the Soviet Kursk has been explored, albeit with different conclusions and scenarios.<br/><br/>For me, watching Law &amp; Order and having a pretty good knowledge of the military makes me view the legal side in a different tint, but that's just me. Also, virtually no ship in the show actually corresponds with a real one name-wise (i.e. the ""Carrier"" Patrick Henry; the Patrick Henry was a ballistic missile sub long since retired). And are we STILL using F-5 Tigers as stand-in MiGs? Oh well...not a big deal really.<br/><br/>The apparent solving of the mystery of Harm's father and the axing of some cast members (Australian Mic Brumby and Gunny Galindez) makes me wonder how much longer the show can go on. My theory is that it will conclude with Harm and Mac getting married. In a sense, I hope it won't happen because this is a very nice show all to itself that's always new. It's great to watch once in a while or all the time (like your's truly).",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,,12 January 2002

It seems like the authors don't give a f... about the continuity of the series, and just write whatever they think is cool, and that is AWESOME! Thumbs up. One thing that never changes though, is the expressions of the actors. Rabb: I'm thinking really hard, and I am really concerned. Mac: I'm cute, and I'm also smart. Bud: I'm confused :(. I love that. Then they go from being layers to superheroes who save the whole world. You could argue that it's unrealistic, but hey, it's America! <br/><br/>As I'm writing this, the magnificent Rabb has just punched his way out of a 10 vs 1 situation.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,,28 July 2005
1994,JAG, I only watched 2 or 3 shows,"I only watched 2 or 3 of the shows, and I do not like JAG! I see politically correct undertones, with a couple of the characters, mixed with over the top Hollywood plot twists. Kills the realism, I wanted to see. The show is a mix of the movies ""A few good men"" and ""Top Gun"" The show with the model style actors is like a Paul Mitchell commercial. The constant infighting, and personal problems would make the military nonfunctional. I find the show more dramatic than real. I hope the real military is not like this or we would be in trouble. TV is too standoffish and formulated. I wish Hollywood could be more imaginative, and less formulated. Too busy trying to push a cut and dry social message. The creativity, realism, excitement and even likable personalities is missing. I would like to see a more human side to the show, with dualities of the good, bad, and grey area of life. I know there are bad people in the world, but the show is too cut and dry like Walker Texas Ranger. Save a hour and watch another show",7 out of 14 found this helpful.,,8 December 2005
1995,JAG, Unproductive,"It's difficult to overlook this show's lack of originality and predilection for mishmash. Just a TV version of A Few Good Men with dragged out courtroom scenes and implausible action sequences for ""variety"". Super lawyers flying jets, parachuting into enemy territory, exchanging gunfire with opposing forces, and being fluent in ten languages? Good God! Far more ridiculous is that many of the episodes not only duplicate story lines of other films, but blatantly include their footage as well. One episode about the IRA ripped off numerous clips from In The Name of The Father. Another, where David Elliot is held prisoner in China, was taken smack out of Red Corner. I even recognized recycled segments from The Hunt for Red October and Crimson Tide during several submarine episodes. After these major flaws, it's barely worth mentioning the immature dialogue and amateurish special effects, but there you have it.

1996,Adventure Time, It's Awesome,"For a kids show, Adventure Time has surprising mature and deep themes, making it a joy to watch for all ages. The characters are all so diverse and unique and the voice acting is perfect. For the most part they are light hearted and funny, but as the show gradually reveals their backstories and flaws, it adds quite a bit of depth and even sadness at times. This allows them to feel real and relatable despite the supernatural setting. What I enjoy most about Adventure Time is that even though the episodes seem random and disconnected, they all help build up a rich and diverse world and reveal many subtle ideas and story arcs that are massively paid of in the future. It is a show that leaves me smiling every time I watch it, with a heartwarming display of friendship, morality and forgivenss. In addition, it is also hilarious and full of clever, memerable one liners. For me, the only thing holding this show back from being a masterpiece is that it has a few boring and even uncomfortable episodes that I don't feel like are representative of how good the show normally is. Despite this, I love this show and quite simply, its awesome.",23 out of 23 found this helpful.,9.0,20 August 2019

But while shows like Chowder may fail at times using this model, Adventure Time succeeds.<br/><br/>It does so thanks to wonderful voice acting, clever dialog and most of all, unusually mature themes. Not in a risqué sense, but...it doesn't rely on cookie cutter stories and it's comfortable leaving some endings ambiguous. It's also comfortable making characters believable (despite its fantasy setting).<br/><br/>This show is deserves attention.",185 out of 216 found this helpful.,10.0,25 April 2010

It's Adventure Time!"" Adventure Time was an animated short made by Pen Ward and his team a few years back. The short was full of comedy, off the wall jokes, chocked full of hilarious one-liners and even an entertaining fight scene. And now, years later it is a full blown television series. The only thing people were concerned about was that the adaption could never live up to the original.<br/><br/>Well I'm here to say it has. In. Every. Aspect.<br/><br/>The only thing different is the characters and world have been expanded upon, and Penn's name is now Finn.<br/><br/>Adventure Time with Finn and Jake is Cartoon Network's newest cartoon. Similarly to the pilot, it is full to the brim with humor (some which is directly aimed at the adult audience, THANK GOD) There are still many one liners (most of which have been stolen from the pilot but I'm hoping that as the series goes on this will diminish. The music isn't very memorable, but it isn't supposed to be. It's a show about Finn, Jake and all of their friends and the stupid situations they find themselves in.<br/><br/>Cartoon Network has finally found a gem, and I hope for their sake that they keep this show running and start funding more shows like this instead of obviously cheap-made flash cartoons (Johnny Test anyone?)

1999,Adventure Time, One of the Best Shows of This Generation,"Adventure Time is the story of an almost normal 12-13 year old human boy named Finn, and his magical dog Jake(voiced by John Di Maggio). They live in the enchanted land of Ooo and have many strange adventures exploring dungeons, saving princesses(most commonly Princess Bubblegum of the Candy Kingdom)and meeting many strange inhabitants of the world, some friendlier than others.<br/><br/>The plot sounds simple enough, but Adventure Time is one of the most surreal kid's shows to come out of Cartoon Network for a long time. And I love every minute of it.<br/><br/>While I find the earlier episodes of the show ranged from good to OK, the later episodes got really great with the animation and jokes improving as the series went on. The characters are all very likable with unique personalities and quite a few have very memorable and hilarious one-liners. Every time I sit down and watch this show, I am greatly entertained.<br/><br/>That doesn't mean it's for everyone though. While some, like me, may like the surreal appeal others may not. I don't recommend this show to the younger audience(younger then 8) as this show may unintentionally give them nightmares at times. Parents more used to family friendly cartoons may also not like the jokes geared towards the older crowd(and trust me there's a lot of them).<br/><br/>Either way, this show has great writing, animation, voice acting everything to me is near perfection. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a different kind of kid show.",85 out of 101 found this helpful.,10.0,28 September 2011
2000,Adventure Time, I love this show.,"Adventure time is a strange animal. It's on cartoon network. Not adult swim; but on during the regular hours. The shows target audience is children. But nonetheless, this show is the best cartoon I've ever seen. I saw the pilot a couple years back and finally saw the show and i was blown away. <br/><br/>Adventure Time does not teach lessons per se. It starts off supposedly trying to teach you something, but instead saysscrew it and veers off into AWESOME. Its random, hilarious, and perfect. The characters are messed up in the best way possible. If any lesson can be taken from this show it's that nobody is perfect; everyone has their flaws. Everyone messes up, a lot. Everyone makes mistakes. Even though Finn is the only human in the show, everyone in the show makes human mistakes. It doesn't matter who or what you are, you're still going to mess up. But no matter what flaws you may have or how much you screw up, at the end of the day your friends will be there for you; especially when you're there for your friends. <br/><br/>If your friend is in trouble, destroy the problem with sword, song, reason, or love.

2001,Adventure Time, Adventure Time is often misunderstood,"You might get a wrong idea about AT:<br/><br/>1 - It can seem very childish because of it's vibrant colors, silly moments here and there (that is one of many characteristics of the show)
BUT
The show is not typical in any way including childishness and silliness - those qualities enrich the show.<br/><br/>2 - AT might seem dull and random because of how weird it can get.
BUT
The weird part is all in favor of originality (which is limitless on this show).
Large portion of crazy elements of Adventure Time are purposeful smart ideas and in most cases these ideas come from pure artistic statements and not just random thoughts anyone can have.<br/><br/>To sum up what I wrote so far - Adventure Time is not what it seems. That goes to show on the characters:
For instance: Ice King is not a two dimensional crazy villain he seems at first - He's a former scientist with a tragic past and you really empathize with him.
Marceline is not just a cool vampire - she has the most tragic backstory. Princess Bubblegum is not just pretty and cute princess with cold exterior - she is one of the most complex characters on the show and you find out more and more about her... I could go on but the characters are/get extremely developed as the show goes on (Finn is the best example of that considering how much he's grown and matured).<br/><br/>3 - AT is not for a limited age group
IN FACT
as an adult, I enjoy the show more than any child can ever enjoy - that's thanks to the smart writing. The writers on this show manage to fit a great story (90%/95% of the times) in 11 minute episodes and it's for all ages - it's adventurous, deep, smart and funny.<br/><br/>4 - Don't expect AT to be a typical Cartoon Network show.
Furthermore, if you're an adult please don't watch Adventure Time on CN as
lots of moments are censored (cut/altered) on the network and you may enjoy the show better without those changes in place.<br/><br/>5 - There might be a bad episode
Yea, no show is 100% perfect and because of the difficult task the writers have on this show.
(I need to explain why: let's compare this show to Regular Show, Family Guy or Rick and Morty - the writing structure is less evident on Adventure Time as it doesn't quite have a typical structure like Family Guy has for instance - being comedy-based characters being cynical most of the time, or having random cuts for loughs, AT doesn't have a structure like Rick and Morty that has the smartest character in control every episode and being predictable and it doesn't have a typical tone every single time like FG and R&amp;M by going for comedy over drama most the time... I write all this not because I hate on any of these shows but it's a simple fact - Adventure Time (while not perfect either) has way less cliche writing and way more depth than most cartoons out there).
Because Adventure Time makes sense, has depth and a developing story instead of on-timer episodes, it's difficult to make every single episode great. So be sure to give Adventure Time a chance to grow on you and most importantly - don't judge the show on few episodes.
P.S: Adventure Time starts as being a little silly but it matures - slowly getting smarter and deeper so keep that in mind as well.<br/><br/>I can't get into someones head and clearly, we're all subjective here no matter how hard we try but by telling people what to expect and giving them the idea why they might enjoy a certain film/animation and making them aware of what to expect is what's important rather than saying this show is awesome or that it sucks.
As for me: I am happy I get to live in the age when there's Adventure Time to watch - that is how much this show means to me. And as a summery:<br/><br/>This show is not an entertainment, Adventure Time is art and I mean it both as a regular fan and also as someone having degree in Animation and History of Modern Art. Adventure Time is all a person like me needs in a world full of nonsensical shows and movies that aim at entertainment and money.
So please keep an open mind and give this show a chance, you might end up thinking this show is pure genius and not some over-hyped thing some simple minded people tell you it is.",31 out of 35 found this helpful.,10.0,1 May 2018
2002,Adventure Time," Adventure Time: Inventive, Imaginative, Algebraic, Timeless","A few months ago, a friend of mine showed me a grainy YouTube video of the ""Adventure Time"" short that was shown on Nickelodeon. I immediately fell in love with the short and we began reading up all about since we just learned it was being adopted by Cartoon Network. What we found out and watched blew us away. The amount of thought and imagination put into this show is astounding. I have never remained entertained for an entire episode of a show before, let alone an entire season! The wild and wacky aspects are quite entertaining but also do not remove anything from the ongoing plot and story. We see how characters develop and even see how moral choices produce themselves to challenge the duo, Finn and Jake, along the way. Though they stumble, this imaginative and amazing (not to mention post-apocalyptic) world always seems to lead back to the path of righteousness which is exactly where this show is.<br/><br/>In short, this show is an anomaly among mediocrity. This is a seemingly limitless world of entertainment that does not merely dance around idiotic humor. This is a show that isn't afraid to have fun and toy around with the absurd to make its point.

2005,Adventure Time," Not for everyone...but if it's for you, you'll love it","There are some who say punchlines are better if you can't see them coming. One way to achieve this is to employ tangential humor, but you sometimes risk completely losing your audience. Pendleton Ward has proved that he has a formula for tangential humor, and so far the equations are working out.<br/><br/>Adventure Time's pilot aired in 2008, and since has collected a cult following on the internet. A boy and a shape-shifting dog save a bubblegum princess from an ice king...such a setting is delightfully fanciful, even for fantasy! For those who loved the original, there may be some differences that make you uncomfortable. For example, several of the voice actors are different, and the character designs are slightly altered. However, as long as you came for Pendleton Ward's brand of humor, you'll be more than satisfied.<br/><br/>Not everyone is going to like Adventure Time, however. There are many who simply have not been exposed to such an exotic type of humor, and so this show may frighten rather than entertain.<br/><br/>I'm sure, however, that the consensus is that Cartoon Network has improved it's show/success ratio by green-lighting Adventure Time with Finn and Jake.",68 out of 87 found this helpful.,9.0,20 April 2010

2008,Adventure Time, The greatest TV show on cartoon network,"First of all I really don't like cartoon network... or at least when they keep on showing stupid kid shows. This is what makes Adventure Time so special is that it is pretending to be a kid's show in appearance but in reality it is quite mature and isn't really for kids. All of the episodes I have seen are funny except for one. The characters are all likable and there seems to be a dark side to every character. Finn is the main character and is the ONLY human in the entire show. There are hints that this is the far future, and humanity was destroyed (you see destroyed cities under water, or a river of garbage). Finn is tries his best at being a good hero, but sometimes they he seems to hurt some innocent people. Jake is his side kick dog who is really great because his voice is perfect, and he is just laid back and relaxed. Princess Bubblegum is the good princess who Finn likes, and she is super smart and is ruler of the candy kingdom. She seems to have a dark side that appears every once in a while. The Ice King is a common protagonist. It bothers me that everyone hates him, and kind of attacks him for no reason. It is often seen that he steals princesses because he only wants to be happy, and basically the reason he does anything is because he is so lonely.<br/><br/>Some people may not like this show for its very smooth animation style. The animation is a bit cheap but it is sort of based off of video games and some Japanese animation. It is important to realize this show is trying to be weird. Some people do not appreciate its random and off the wall humor. Like where Finn is offered to run with wolves, so him and his vampire friend start running on all fours chasing wolves at night, and they start to look really scary and foam at the mouth. Finn starts biting the wolves and fighting them, and a whole bunch of random stuff. This entire scene is only about 30 seconds long and seems out of the blue. What makes this show great is also how something insanely funny will happen but it goes by so fast you won't notice it. Like when a friendly Peppermint candy does Jake and Finn a favor, and later he says ""Well now I want your skin!"" and Jake and Finn laugh at his joke and then he says ""I will rip it off of you while you're asleep"" and he gives a demonic smile. Their smiles fade quickly. Every episode has a funny ending which always makes you leave even a boring episode on a high note.<br/><br/>I cannot wait to see more of this show since I have seen every episode and it is a great show. Do not judge this show from only one or two episodes. Watch a lot of them and you will realize how great it is.",66 out of 89 found this helpful.,10.0,10 June 2011

What I love about the show (to this day) is how it does whatever it wants. The show in its later seasons is more mature, but still has that comedic effect. Throughout the show, we see the characters around us grow and that makes me proud. It's hard to believe such an influential show ended recently in 2018. This show will go down in both CN and Cartoon history.",13 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,4 September 2018
2015,Adventure Time, one of my favorite shows,"A great, heart-warming, action-packed and funny show. great characters with lots of depth. even finn, the main character, is awesome, which is unusual in my opinion. he respects women and despite being this manly hero, he knows its okay to like, cry and stuff, which is all great to teach kids and adults alike. great animation and wacky story as well. a well made and entertaining show that will forever be very dear to me. i used to watch with my friends and family as a kid and had many toys and games, so this show is important to me.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,15 April 2020
2016,Adventure Time," Original, Creative, Satirical, Whimsical, and Hilarious!","It took about five episodes for me to become enthralled with Adventure Time. I doubt I am the target demographic as a Midwest Minister, with two young children, and a Masters in Theological Studies. But, this series is absolutely art. I'm not joking.<br/><br/>When you look at art, it stirs something in you. Perhaps it conjures frustration when ""this doesn't make sense"" or surprise when ""I could never have foreseen an Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant stepping into the story"" Adventure Time creates a conversation with yourself, with the characters, and with others.<br/><br/>Also, there is a massive backstory that is never developed so far as to remove the awe and wonder. Ice King is by far my favorite character for this reason. We still have questions about Princess Bubblegum's origin, seeing only hints throughout the series.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is character development. We walk with Finn through his formative years and encounter many strong emotions stemming from love and dating to failed expectations in our parents.<br/><br/>It's truly art.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,5 March 2020
2017,Adventure Time, One of cartoon networks best shows to date,"To this day this show still impresses me from time to time. It's very deep for a kids show. The animation imo was ahead of it's time. The humor is great, the characters are amazing. There is rarely any episode on this show that I hated or atleast didn't like. The story and this universe that the creator of the show made is very creative and well thought. The only problem that I have about this show is that princess bubblegum seems to be more like a villain than a good guy but it kinda explains why she acts this way. Overall, I loved this show, it's amazing, it's beautiful, the music is very lofi and minimalistic, it's great, and I definitely recommend you to watch this show",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,25 January 2020
2018,Adventure Time, A Soon-To-Be Timeless Classic,"There are three kinds of people in the world: People who love 'Adventure Time', people who haven't given it much though or aren't huge fans of it, and people that complain about the ""good 'ol days"" of Cartoon Network.<br/><br/>I've only gotten into the show quite recently, but I remember way back in 2010 seeing the advertisements of young Finn fighting the villainous Ice King and thinking ""Huh, this looks different"", and not thinking about it a second more. <br/><br/>As I got older, my tastes in television lied upon the characters, how well-written they were and complex and all that. When a friend told me that the characters of 'Adventure Time' were just what I was looking for, I was skeptical at first, but also curious. <br/><br/>An evening of learning about this ""Mushroom War"" and watching clips of a vampire girl singing about her true feelings towards an old friend, a rainbow unicorn telling her canine partner that she's pregnant, and a video game device pretending that its human, and I was convinced to give the show a fair shake. <br/><br/>I honestly don't think this show is given enough credit. In just eleven minutes 'Adventure Time' utilizes what its given to craft (most of the time) very fleshed out and clever narratives; I hear all the time how people say there's a lot of ""pointless episodes"" and only a couple ""meaningful"" ones, but I'm inclined to disagree. <br/><br/>'Adventure Time' doesn't need to sole narrative to be good; it's more of just a series of sub-plots revolving around different characters, more in recent seasons than early ones (which I'm inclined to say are pretty weak until season 3). And not only that, but there's almost not a single episode in this series that isn't referenced later on; it just keeps building and building a more fleshed-out world, and that's what the recent season 6 has been trying to do. The Land of Ooo doesn't revolve around Finn and Jake, and that's what I love about this show the most I think. Everybody is messed up, from the insanity-driven Magic Man to Princess Bubblegum and her incredibly grey morals and actions. <br/><br/>And the characters change throughout the series too; Finn has gone from a screaming, spastic 12-year-old to a surprisingly reserved but still passionate 16-year-old over the course of the series, and Marceline has gone from an anti-hero with a heart of steel to a girl that's a lot more comfortable about sharing her feelings, at least with her newly-acquired mortal friends. On top of that, the dialogue is also something special. A lot of the time, the show manages to have these characters act and converse with one another in such a way that it sounds like the voice actors are actually having a real conversation with each other, and that really goes a long way for me at least. <br/><br/>As far as the animation goes, I actually loved the simplistic character designs from the start, as I found them to be quite charming; plus it fits the show's overall ""growing up"" feel, like 'Calvin and Hobbes.' But as simple as they are, this show has a huge cast of character, almost as large as the Simpsons' probably, and each and every one of them looks different from another. That, and the background of this show are beautifully detailed if you ever find yourself looking at them. <br/><br/>This really is one of those shows that only comes around once in a lifetime. It's simple enough on the surface for a preteen audience, but also a little complex and even thought-provoking a lot of the time for the adults, with some subtle writing and character moments that all pile up into one mathematical show. <br/><br/>Give the entire series a watch; you don't know what you've been missing, or at least not seeing when writing it off as a simple mindless show.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,24 September 2014
2019,Adventure Time," Anyone who needs some Understanding, Read this","There was a time when I disliked this show. Now, I view it as one of the best animated series of all time, and one of the most creatively and boldly non-pandering shows in cartoon history, and this is why:<br/><br/>Adventure Time does not pander to traditional or accessible story structures, payoffs, exposition, or plot constructs. It does not use traditional or accessible cartoon character archetypes. It does not use traditional or accessible humor. It does not use traditional music or voice-acting. It doesn't even always use traditional emotions or dialogue. As a result, the show feels more original than anything else seen on cartoon network since Samurai Jack. Much like Samurai Jack, this show is very immersing and has a style all its own.Also like Samurai Jack, the show takes place in a strange world, where almost anything can happen, or any kind of character can show up, and it will still feel believable and consistent. Recommended for anyone who is into experimental storytelling and music. In fact, most of the soundtrack consists of formless ambient music or IDM.<br/><br/>Nothing about this show feels forced or phony. There are no traditional payoffs or unneeded exposition. There are lots of silent moments and strange scenes that do nothing but establish the characters and their varying types of insanity. There's lots of dialogue that can be taken a number of ways. There are no trumpet-blasts or dinky piano tunes to let the viewer know when he should laugh or be excited. The show makes it YOUR job to be entertained. It's like going to visit another world and have fun watching these characters live their day-to-day lives. No, better yet, it's like being a man from one- thousand years ago watching our daily lives. He finds them a novelty, and is intrigued, but he does not understand everything we do, or the way we talk. The characters in this show will not stop to explain anything for the benefit of the audience. For them, most of the weirdness is just commonplace. They know more than we do, but they have no reason to tell us what they know. If you are used to shows with super-tight writing where everything is conveyed to the audience, look elsewhere. This is a more challenging, atmospheric sort of show.<br/><br/>That being said, this is also one of the only cartoons that has succeeded in making me cry multiple times. As a warning, you will not like every episode. You may not even like every season. I don't, and unless you have very broad tastes, you won't. This show has numerous fans who like it for totally different reasons. Some are their for the back-stories and mythos, some for the adventure episodes, some for the comedy, some for the romance plots, and some for the tragedies. This show does basically everything.<br/><br/>Animation: Minimal, using bright colors and simple, easy designs. The animation may seem lackluster, but it's a pretty immersing style if you give it the chance, and some of the art direction and creativity is admirable. The simple style allows for an endless amount of characters, backgrounds, and stories without too much expense needed. The colors and production value get better over the course of the show. They won't look the best in the first few episodes.<br/><br/>Characters: The characters here are diverse and numerous. Some of the them are annoying, but most of them have depth and dimension that will slowly reveal itself over the course of the show. Many of them are immature, and most of them are insane to varying degrees, but they often have to make hard decisions or go through strange dilemmas. Anyone who SEEMS like typical archetypes will prove otherwise. My expectations were challenged by some of them. Simon Petrikov is my favorite character. Writing and Storytelling: As I said, this is a low-conveyance show. The stories are done in a freestyle, storyboard-driven manner. The writers seem to draw from Nintendo- style fantasy games like ""The Legend of Zelda"" or the ""Paper Mario"" series. The early episodes are a bit more focused on simple fun, randomness, and adventure, but things don't get interesting (for me at least) until the show reveals its true colors a bit later on. Pieces start to come together, and the viewer realizes that the randomness actually isn't as random as he might think. Without spoiling much, let's just say that the world of Ooo has a bittersweet back-story to it that makes the show infinitely more interesting once they start hinting at it. Some of the individual characters also have mysterious, semi-disturbing origins. It's what made me curious in the first place. The show deals with its various characters and plot threads at a respectable pace, often juggling many at once and becoming more complex. The ""Billy's Bucket List/Wake Up/Escape from the Citadel"" three- parter is what I would recommend for people who want to see the show do some more tight, well-crafted writing. This series features passage of time, continuity, and the aging of characters.<br/><br/>Audio: The deadpan, naturalistic voice acting can be either welcoming, or annoying, depending on the viewer or character. I like how the casting is handled. Music is experimental electronica. Musical numbers sound realistically unrehearsed, which makes them more heartfelt when used in episodes like ""I Remember You"" and ""Lemonhope Story"".<br/><br/>You don't have to like the show, but I at least want it to be acknowledged for the risks it takes and the creativity it encourages. People who have worked on the show have gone on to make other series like that are good for similar reasons and have helped give Frederator and Cartoon Network more of an identity again, bringing them more respect from longtime fans. Also, to warn you, this show is surprisingly not for young kids. Make sure you're at least around 12 before you watch it. Trust me.",16 out of 21 found this helpful.,8.0,16 September 2014

Both had respect for each other obviously but they were always getting on each other's nerves and Magnum also had to put up with two dogs-Zeus and Apollo if my memory serves me correctly-who didn't like him at all.<br/><br/>Of course, like most 80's heroes Magnum had a cool car which he used to parade around Hawaii solving all types of cases involving crooks both small-time and big time.

2027,"Magnum, P.I.", The Heir to Rockford,"Magnum to me is pretty much the logical heir to Jim Rockford in the fact that many of the same themes that were so prevalent on Rockford were on this show.

The other thing that I think made him endearing is the fact that he pretty much had a regular guy persona even though he was living in the lap of luxury and even though I wasn't as big a fan of this show as I was ""Rockford"" I can still see why this show was a classic. <br/><br/>And another thing, it wasn't just Selleck.

2030,"Magnum, P.I.", I know what you're thinking...,"...that I would bash this show.  Well I can't.  How could one forget Magnum's psychic link when he went to England or when he gets stranded on the island that doesn't welcome visitors or the all time worst one:  the Ivan and Cookie episode.  Ugh, for years just saying ""cookie"" with a Russian accent would make me laugh.  Yeah, the episodes that were marked serious were pretty bad but the light-hearted ones more than made up the difference. Magnum's trip to L.A., the treasure hunt, Higgins and Magnum's feud, Magnum as a hotel detective, the P.I. award that didn't matter to him because he wanted to solve the murder of the French detective that he didn't even like, were great stories.  That last episode was particularly good as a lot of the more fun guest stars of the past participated.  Candy Clark's Leslie should get special mention as the best of all the guest stars as the hooker that means well but doesn't listen to anyone.  As for the regular cast: all good, although Larry Manetti sometimes came across a little amateurish.  But this would have meant nothing if the main star wasn't any good.  And Tom Selleck was good.  He makes me believe that Magnum can look at a video of T.C.'s kidnapped daughter and figure out where she is being held from the reflection of an apartment building in the glass behind her.

2033,"Magnum, P.I."," I've Always Believed That Happiness Was All About Watching ""Magnum"" Continually Without Commercials !","Sometimes I review lists of the greatest 10, 20, or 25 American TV shows in history, and when I don't find (Magnum P.I.) in one, I say maybe the makers of this list are: so poor to not watch it, or so pathetically fool to forget it, or watched it and refused to include it (folks I don't want to know at all!)<br/><br/>(Magnum P.I.) is the best of its kind. Simply the action, the comedy, and the drama. It had completely what made it the standard to measure any other similar work: good characters, fresh atmosphere, touching moments, big production, great writing, sensitive cinematography, genius music, top notch acting, cinematic direction, and memorable 162 episodes that were never bad, and just perfect all the way (Maybe one concerning Higgins's twin, and a few else, but HEY, they're humans after all).<br/><br/>(Magnum) for me means 2 eras in my life. The first when I was a kid at the 1980s and (Magnum) was the assured ride of fun. The second one was after I've studied cinema and scriptwriting, when I discovered how this show had it all, so every episode of the reruns was such a lesson about how to make a classic work and a great amount of entertainment too. The thing about it is that it embodied cleverly what I believe in as the ultimate formula: some fun + some seriousness. It's not wholly a show about nice detective in Hawaii who punches the bad guys, hangs out by the beach, and plays the saxophone badly in between; actually he is that, yet with more.<br/><br/>It was a lovely book of wisdom with catchy thoughtful lines, instruction about friendship, manifesto about deformed generation that could overstep its tribulation anyway, a chance to be a down to earth hero, learning that life is invaluable that despite anything you must solemnize it, and how living careless and well is the best revenge out of anything! See, whether it shows a rainy night or shinny day, it can represent the beauty of both with contemplating also.<br/><br/>I liked the main formula of the characters: a brain (Higgins), some muscles (TC), a heart (Rick), and one who got all of that temperately (Magnum). Not to mention the distinct relationship between (Higgins) and (Magnum) which develops from English gentleman vs. straight American, to severe father and rebel son, to friends, very different friends yet resemble each other and learn from each other, with keeping all the previous symptoms running on and under the surface. That was unique and creative as nearly the whole thing.<br/><br/>(Tom Selleck) was like the show itself: funny but can masterly be serious. For instance, I'll never forget his performance in (Memories Are Forever)'s 2 parts where he assured how strong actor he is, and how deep (Magnum) can be as a character and as a show.<br/><br/>I just hated the (James Bond) effect on the title character. Aside from serving in the Navy, speaking many languages, enjoying certain wine, living - somehow - in luxury, exactly like 007, what did bother me was the idea of (Magnum) being a widower, who lost his love early, and now he has many girls in his life, without any new everlasting love as well, which I believe fitted the show in terms of providing tons of eye candies! Plus, it was uncomfortable, rather unacceptable, to watch (Magnum) turning into a ruthless killer in the name of cold war!<br/><br/>Anyhow, at the advertisement for it as DVD, you'll hear a voice saying: ""It's the 1980s"". I think it can define not merely the era, but the best of it. Its secret was that it didn't satisfy with being only a funny entertaining show, and wanted to present something better with every step ahead. In one word; I love (Magnum), as a child's memory, and as a grown-up's mania. I've always believed that happiness was all about watching it continually without commercials, and I still do. Because this show is never dated. So, when I made a list of the best 10 TV shows ever, I found no competitor on the first rank but (Magnum, P.I.). It's an immortal moment of ecstasy which gets a certain mode to put you in the mood. It equals a ""Magnum opus"" for me. If only every show has something from it, we would have better ones that could last after watching, in our hearts as well as our brains.<br/><br/>P.S: I wrote elaborately a review about this show's magical elements through one of its most important episodes (4 # 1: Home From The Sea), which you can find on its own page.",20 out of 23 found this helpful.,9.0,30 September 2007

While Magnum was an entertaining series and a great post-Vietnam twist on the disillusioned P.I. of post World War II America, Selleck's best P.I. role, for my money, actually came as the anti-Jim Rockford, Lance White, on The Rockford Files.  THAT should have been a series--in fact, I think it was originally intended to be one. Still, a decade long run as Magnum is hard to beat.  Magnum was quality TV--far and above the likes of the A-Team, an unfortunate comparison I've seen made by other viewers in this commentary. Needless to say, today's dreck on TV can't touch Magnum.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,16 April 2004
2039,"Magnum, P.I.", The best performance by a guest star....,"I have watched from the day it started, to the day it went off the air. Many episodes affected me deeply (Lily, death of Michelle, killing the corrupt officer, etc.), but the episode that touched me the most was the one in which Frank Sinatra guest stars as Mike Doheney who is looking for the killer of his lovely grandaughter. I cried my eyes out as he stood at her grave in the end of the movie. It was very moving.  I felt Frank Sinatra once again pulled off an excellent performance. He was excellent!<br/><br/>Just thought I'd pass it along.<br/><br/>s.",30 out of 41 found this helpful.,,5 January 2004
2040,"Magnum, P.I."," Great TV series, even after being out of production more than a decade.","This TV series has it all - sexy guys, adventure, humor... tragedy. This show continues to attract new fans, even after it's been off the air for more than a decade - the appeal is timeless.  The scenery is to die for; there's many a fan who's dreamed of moving to Hawaii after seeing just a few episodes.  The actors are excellent, and the character development is top notch: almost every episode reveals something new about someone.<br/><br/>Surf, sun, and Selleck - there couldn't be a better combination, and once you add the rest of the superb cast and plots that are truly interesting, it's an unbeatable, even after all these years.  =)",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,,4 August 2000
2041,"Magnum, P.I.", This was the show I wasn't going to watch!,"It's happened over the years at least a few times. Something becomes so popular that I decide it just can't be anything worthwhile, and then I find myself doing a complete 180. This guy Selleck was too good looking in an old Hollywood way (Clark Gable), his voice seemed an octave too high for a man of his size and looks, so damn many women were positively orgasmic when they talked about him and women are notorious for going after some really shallow males, and the few times I caught a scene or two flipping through channels, he seemed smug, or at least that's how I perceived him. And then one Thursday evening there was nothing on the network channels and nothing on any cable channel and I flipped on CBS just as Magnum P.I. started. It was the first two hour episode that introduced Michelle and had a spectacular gunfight at the end on the streets of Little Saigon. My two favorite movies have always been Rio Bravo and Casablanca, and this episode seemed to be an updated melding of the two. Like Duke in Rio Bravo, Magnum had loyal friends to back his play as he tries to set things right when no one else will help him, and like Bogie in Casablanca, Magnum has an ill-fated love affair he is going to have to give up to a higher duty. And then there was the gunfight at the end. After years and years of so-called do-gooders trying to get violence off the TV, and somewhat succeeding, there was a real hero like Duke or Bogie, who wasn't going to apologize for putting a few well deserved .45 slugs into a few bad guys. Women liked Magnum because he was so charming and good looking and mischievous like a little boy. I liked him because, like Duke and Bogie and Gable, for all of his faults, he was a man! <br/><br/>The show seemed too good to be true, a good looking old Hollywood sort of guy who carried my favorite pistol and wasn't adverse to using it, a show at times filled with humor, sometimes filled with drama, and Magnum, like Selleck, was just the sort of guy you always wanted for a friend in good times and bad. And then the next season or so there was the two hour episode that introduced Magnum's and T.C.'s old Soviet torturer and nemesis from Vietnam, Ivan, who just happened to be on the islands for a long weekend to ""look up some old friends"" and assassinate a world leader. Magnum and friends have to relive their haunted unresolved past in Vietnam, prevent an assassination, not only in Hawaii but also in other areas of the world, and seek justice and retribution when the powers that be can not put Ivan in jail. In the final 30 seconds of the show, Magnum with his .45 became as powerful an image on screen as Clint and his big .44, even it was only a curved 23"" TV set! <br/><br/>I remember reading an article that discussed the types of TV shows popular during certain Presidential administrations. There was the straight forward, safe, family values sort of programs that reflected Eisenhower's quiet dignity in the '50s. In the early '60s during the Kennedy administration, Jack and Bobby's determination to right wrongs over missiles in Cuba or in mob-controlled unions gave us The F.B.I. and Robert Stack as Eliot Ness in The Untouchables. Later, having shamefully abandoned Vietnam for purely political reasons, our Presidents like Nixon and Ford and Carter seemed rather impotent, like the always wimpy Alan Alda (Hawkeye) in M.A.S.H., and the always intimidated and beat up James Garner in The Rockford Files. Reagan got into the White House and suddenly his no nonsense, straight shooting philosophies, his search for right and wrong and black and white, and his jovial sense of humor was reflected in Thomas Sullivan Magnum or Magnum P.I. And just as suddenly TV had, in Selleck and Magnum, as good a character, if not better, as anything Hollywood had come up with for the larger screen in the previous 20 years.<br/><br/>Today I have four seasons of Magnum P.I. on DVD, and whenever I want something to watch and can not decide on something from my library, I pull out the private investigator in Hawaii and go back to a time not all that long ago, when life seemed somewhat more clear and safe, and certainly younger, and a tall man in a Tiger baseball hat and Hawaiian shirt, with a red Ferrari and a Colt .45 auto, went out to do the decent thing and right the wrongs of the day.<br/><br/>George Clooney or Vince Vaughn as Magnum P.I.???

2042,"Magnum, P.I."," Scenic &amp; Well Produced, Written, &amp; Acted","John Hillerman &amp; Tom Selleck are a perfect balance to each other to anchor this series. They play off each other very well &amp; even though Sellick used this as a springboard for his entire career, Hillerman is most often remembered for this show. The island setting for this show &amp; the photography are top notch.<br/><br/>Glen Larsen &amp; Donald Bellisario both have done great work in many series with varying degrees of success. Both have had hit shows besides this one, &amp; sometimes not so successful. You don't think of Ba Ba Black Sheep &amp; Battlestar Gallactica when you think of Bellsario/ Larsen, but of Quantum Leap, Knight Rider, Qunicy &amp; Jag among others. Both men were born in the mid 1930's which puts them in the same class.<br/><br/>They have nothing to be shamed of in their work on this series which ran a very successful 164 episodes in the 1980's. The shows hold up pretty well even after all these years. This show was no small part of a successful CBS group in the 1980's. Catch it when you can, as I recently caught the pilot 2 hour premiere on a rerun.<br/><br/>The first show introduces Hillerman &amp; Sellecks characters &amp; the motivation behind the feud they always have during the series run. There is always plenty of eye candy for the guys, to go with the other natural great scenery. Always plenty of action for the detective fan in this show too.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,3 January 2007
2043,"Magnum, P.I.", The greatest TV show ever made,"It's sad that Hollywood never gave Selleck a quality movie project to star in, as he's one of the nicest actors alive.  Stunningly handsome, charming, intelligent, what more could we ask for?  In an alternate universe he'd have the same fame and fortune as Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson.<br/><br/>At least Tom will always have this masterpiece as a legacy to be proud of. During my childhood on the island of Oahu my parents got to meet the cast of Magnum at the actual ""Robin Masters"" estate, check out the real Ferrari, and play with the Dobermans (Zeus and Apollo).  Sure, we met other celebrities, but nobody (show or movie) will ever match the sheer coolness of this series.<br/><br/>The saddest tragedy of Selleck's career (besides being contractually booted out of the Indiana Jones role by CBS executives) is that blockbuster novelist TOM CLANCY is a huge Magnum P.I. fan and has always wanted to re-launch the show into a series of big-screen theatrical movies, but the execs at Universal don't believe there's enough of an audience to make this a worthwhile investment.  AUGH!",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,,20 April 2001
2044,"Magnum, P.I.", This was a great show,"I don't generally think very much of television shows for many reasons. Although I can't correlate the two events, when Magnum went off air in 1988 I stopped watching network television and haven't watched it since. I was never a big TV fan so when Magnum went off air it was just the reason I needed to turn off the tube.<br/><br/>Magnum was a great show because it offered fine actors usually giving excellent performances, great production values, always great music, and almost always interesting, and, frequently very moving, story lines that were typically believable. Magnum was never a super hero just a regular guy trying to make some money and have fun doing it. I can't compare Magnum to anything more recent but it does compare favorable to the Rockford Files. I can't recall the names of the great episodes but the last few involving Magnum's Vietnamese girlfriend were very good.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,31 January 2007
2045,"Magnum, P.I.", John Hillerman Stole Virtually Every Scene,"""Magnum PI"" was of course a vehicle for Tom Selleck. He was Magnum, no doubt a great looking guy who the chicks dug, but also the type of leading man the guys liked. He had a sense of humor, was loyal to his friends and had his ethics and responsibility. But John Hillerman as Higgins, the ex-Sgt. Major who was the Major Domo of Robins Nest and may or may not have been Robin Masters, was astounding in his portrayal. <br/><br/>Higgins could be a pretentious know it all, but then he usually knew something about most everything. And behind the stiff English stoicism breathed a generous and caring human. He had seen it all in his career in the British military and intelligence and although he was retired he relished the chance for action afforded by his association with Magnum. Hillerman just nailed the part and nothing was better than the scenes between him and Selleck. Higgins could often get quite irritated with Magnum, but there was always a grudging respect and admiration for each other. I wouldn't call it a father-son relationship, nor was Magnum and Higgins buddies the way he was with Rick and TC, but a sense of camaraderie that 2 professional commandos have for each other.<br/><br/>The whole Robin Masters and Robin's Nest was a brilliant bit by the creators of Magnum. There was some preposterous stuff like having a PI driving a red Ferrari, a cool car but just a bit hard to keep any semblance of anonymity in such a ride. Good cast, I've mentioned Hillerman. Nothing special about Manetti or Mosley as Rick and TC, although they did have some good comic moments. Enjoyed Agatha, Tanaka, Mac, the luscious Lt Maggie Poole {never figured why Magnum didn't hit on her} A lot of comedy in this show, plus some very moving moments. Without a doubt, one of the best shows of its genre.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,28 January 2014

2054,The End of the F***ing World, Dark and beautiful (originally written in the Netflix reviews section),"Spectacular. I started watching on a whim when I saw the Netflix banner and got so caught up that it's suddenly 5:00 AM and I just finished the finale. This is a younger version of Bonnie and Clyde except PLOT TWIST the crime has a reason and one of the protagonists is a would-be sociopath who sets out to kill the other. The acting is brilliant, the characters are brilliant, there are lesbian police detectives whose lesbien-ness isn't the main focus of their characters. What more could I ask for? I'm sure that people are going to complain about the romanization of violence/crime/anarchy or whatever, but I would argue that this show does exactly the opposite. Everything has consequence in this tragic tale, from the young protagonists' actions to the adults whose mistakes have irreversibly damaged the lives of their children and the people around them. The performances are stunning. I've only ever seen Alex Lawther in Black Mirror, but I look forward to his future projects. That dude has a long career ahead of him, and so does Jessica Barden. A side note: As someone in their late teens, its refreshing to see actors who actually LOOK like teens playing teens. Every other piece of media shows airbrushed adults in their mid twenties as the ""average teen"" and it gets exhausting (I can confirm that almost all of us look like baby eggs with faces, even as a freshman in college). This is dark, this is real, this is relevant, and this is beautiful. P.S. This is not a rigged Netflix review. I am ACTUALLY giving this 5 stars and I am writing it of my own volition.

It's not a bad show, actually it is quite entertaining. Is it shocking and brilliant? Is it thought provoking? Not really. I mean I guess it's bit of a criticism on the modern world: how we're all shallow and we don't connect and it's hard to find meaning in life etc. etc. but it's not really profound or anything. It's kind of just stating the obvious. And yes ofc love and 'true' and 'real' connection are the answers to all of that, but U know, everybody knows that too. However the actors are good and the characters are fun to watch and they definitely have some character development. Both of the main characters are quite unlikable in the beginning, but at the end of the season there really is a feeling that they're likable, almost lovable people. Also the couple do have a really nice chemistry, which is nice. And it also has the classic theme that for one to be good you have to first also do bad things and know your evil side, your shadow, although it doesn't necessarily convey that that well.

2072,Shetland, Enjoyed,"I discovered 'Shetland' while clicking around on the media streamer XBMC late tonight. I became an instant fan. It delivers: plot, intrigue and suspense. There is lots of room for arm chair detective work. So many possibilities to look at. Is it power? Is it money? Is it about an old love or a new love? Is it an old feud that's gone on for generations and finally came to it's breaking point? Or is it simply an accident? One thing is for sure, there is a dead body and a detective who is on the case. He is skilled and insightful. <br/><br/>The Shetland landscape is beautiful, peaceful, isolated and full of history. It is as important to the story as any of the people. I look forward to the 2014 season.<br/><br/>I appreciate this type of crime story so much. For me the British deliver the best treatment of a murder mystery. This is the way to tell this type of story. The touch of Sherlock Holmes' creative mind and a land where intrigue and power struggles have been the way things were done since Merlin was learning magic. It grips my imagination, allows the me to be right there with the detective, looking right over his shoulder. Hurrah for the advent of media streaming.

I am a fan of Douglas Henshall as he plays DI Perez so convincingly and with an amazing depth that does at times compare with the best characters I have ever seen on TV or Film.

And to an extent, 'Shetland' is pure formula milk. But there's something in the spectacular landscape that makes the stories affecting; and even if the role is thin, Douglas Henshall manages to invest it with a convincing, emotional gravitas that goes beyond what's written in the script. The plots aren't too bad either, although the low-key style (reiminiscent of the BBC version of 'Wallander') tends to defuse their dramatic effect. If allowed to run too long, this series will doubtless stale; but for the moment, it's still feels fresh, and as raw as the harsh Shetland climate.",60 out of 68 found this helpful.,8.0,26 April 2014
2076,Shetland, Very enjoyable mystery series.,"After a good pilot and a fairly good first full series I feel that Shetland is starting to come into its own, this second full series has started in fine form, it's somehow more slick, more meaty, the stories seem a bit bigger.<br/><br/>I have forever been a big fan of Douglas Henshall, he's a truly talented actor, I've always found him to be an excellent villain, a great bad guy, but finally a show for him to have the lead role and show a different side.<br/><br/>The Pilot was really enjoyable, I thought Blue Lightning was a really good story, and the recent opener to the second full series was great too, loved the performance from Ciaran Hinds.<br/><br/>The mixed up story between Jimmy Perez, his daughter Cassie and her biological father Duncan is great.<br/><br/>An enjoyable series that hopefully will continue to run. 8/10",32 out of 35 found this helpful.,8.0,26 January 2016

The mystery plot was good (it kept me interested and I wasn't able to work out ""whodunit"") but it was nothing special.<br/><br/>But I thoroughly enjoyed this two-parter. Why? Well, first of all, the location. The Shetland Islands have an atmosphere and landscape all of their own and provided a wonderful setting. In fact I think they could have made even more of the landscape than they did - they stayed within quite a small area of the islands.<br/><br/>Douglas Henshall as DI Jimmy Perez was an excellent lead. He didn't have a particularly strong supporting cast but I found him very engaging and believable.<br/><br/>Finally, I thought they made very good use of the Shetlands' unique history. The Shetland Bus, Up Helly Aa, and an archaeological dig were all weaved into the story, making sure that this drama stayed firmly rooted in its setting.

2079,Shetland, Great television viewing,"Douglas Henshall as Det. Insp. Jimmy Perez and the remote location of Shetland are the main attractions of this superb British drama. Perez is a man with a good heart who takes on each murder case as if the family survivors depend entirely on him. He's the sort of guy you want to have on your side. The setting is spectacular but the climate is harsh; cold, grey, damp. You feel like you're right there with them. The murders do not have simple explanations and often involve a web of intrigue. Perez will hunt them down, whether its clan warfare in Shetland or a crime syndicate in Glasgow. Perez (his family name comes from his Portuguese father) has a close friend and rival in Duncan Hunter, a local councillor. Played by Mark Bonnar, Duncan is in a relationship with Perez's ex-wife and is a surrogate father to his teenage daughter. This is an area of contention because Jimmy cares deeply for his daughter and faces the challenge of not being in control. Used to dealing with criminals, he fears the worst for the one he loves most. The stories are from British author Ann Cleeves. The series is a fine piece of work in the tradition of British mystery writing and film-making. It is also one of many great television shows that have come out of Britain and Scandinavia in recent years along with Borgen, The Bridge, Broadchurch, Wallander. Shetland and the others are what great television is about.",19 out of 21 found this helpful.,9.0,28 April 2017

Characters and plot are introduced and revealed bit by bit, in a way that keeps you wanting more.<br/><br/>It is like three or four different onions that are peeled back one at a time, you just are never sure which one is being peeled, and whether it is a good one or a bad one. Eventually they start to come together, but never in quite the way you might have guessed. The ultimate denouement is action packed - right up to the last 10 minutes of the series.<br/><br/>Then the whole plot is revealed in a highly improbable manner in a monologue by a single character, with even a key fact being announced when the character could have had no knowledge of it. So disappointing after such a riveting series. I was ready to rate the series a 10 until the last 10 minutes.

2083,Shetland, terrific show,"This is a wonderful series ...I'm watching S1 &amp; S2 again for the 2nd time in less than a month. The writing is great, so is the acting, the characters are3-D &amp; interesting, not from stock. The stories do share some sameness...there's a murder (maybe 2) in a small, place that's fairly isolated, in one part or other of the Shetland Isles. There's several potential suspects. The stories &amp; mysteries are the kind that seem like what could happen in any small town, village, or big city, for that matter; the types of things that happen to real people, as opposed to dramatic, wild, over-the-top happenin's. Not as cozy as a drawing room mystery, but easy to relate to.<br/><br/>Which is not to say they're boring. I really grew to care about the characters, &amp; when bad thing(s) happened to one (or more)* of the regulars, it really moved me.<br/><br/>The islands play a big part in the series; as at least one other reviewer observed, the land &amp; sea are pretty much main characters as well as the people. Beautifully filmed in a gorgeous (if minimalist) land, the scenery makes me want to go there to get in touch with my own Scottish roots.<br/><br/>Lovely series; I hope the Beeb has more sense than most of US TV decision-makers &amp; keeps it up (this show wouldn't have lasted a full season on a US channel...too intelligent &amp; classy).<br/><br/>It occurred to me mid-way thru the second run thru that part of what I like about the characters is that the actors look like real people, rather than the plastic Barbie/Ken people that we get on US TV shows; older characters may have belly bulges or wrinkles. Most look as if they've never been near a Botox needle. There's very attractive people, and some very unattractive people. Realistic people.

2086,Shetland, Decent new crime drama,"This crime drama opens on the island of Bressay, part of Shetland, where an elderly woman is shot and killed. DI Jimmy Perez is soon on the case. Being a small community there aren't a huge number of suspects but it turns out there are a surprising number of motives. The victim had been allowing an archaeological team to dig on her land and they had recently discovered a skull that they believed was five hundred years old; she thought it may be much younger though. As DI Perez investigates he learns of connections to the 'Shetland Bus'; the wartime transport to occupied Norway and of a visiting professor who made a habit of getting close to his female students amongst other things. Before long there is a second death and he will have to work quickly to solve the case before a team from the mainland arrive to take over.<br/><br/>Setting a crime drama on Shetland one could be excused for thinking this was just the BBC's attempt to make some 'Nordic Noir' in the UK; as it turned out this feels very much like a British murder mystery; the case only lasts two episodes, we get to see some nice scenery and the protagonist's home life has some complications. The case itself has plenty of suspects the keep the viewer guessing and the location is a great setting for a murder mystery an island where murder is virtually unknown and people don't ordinarily live in fear of crime. Douglas Henshall does a decent job in the lead role and the rest of the cast a pretty good too.

2088,Shetland, This relates only to SO5 -,"Series 1-4 were wonderful. All scored really well. Of course I want to watch SO5.
There are 2 episodes to go so perhaps not the whole story... but enough me thinks.
The characters, created by Ann Cleeves, were very credible in the first 4 series - compeling at times so I was eager for more.
For SO5 I would score this way:
<ul><li>very good story basis</li><li>delivery of action 1</li></ul>There is simply too much missing to make this performance credible, one eg.
(spoiler) when Perez's car is rammed within millimeters of total disaster no one follows it up; yet that was the first physical link to the suspects who were proving heavyweight (the basic emotion of human traffickers is the willingness to kill).
Thrown into the mix are a number of romantic sub-plots, a crazed African woman and just ignorance of the procedures of policing ( why of earth would a trained officer hand over a biro and paper to the arrested man?)
My feeling is that whoever had this directed/ produced was hoping to ride of the success of 1 - 4 but the script writing is hopeless. Too bad - I really liked those characters, also the ones Ann Cleeves created for the series Vera.",11 out of 14 found this helpful.,2.0,23 March 2019

(I think of Foyle, who is also such a good guy and father, or Lewis, also in this vein.)<br/><br/>Here we have Jimmy Perez, which is so well performed and written that you simply fall for him and his humanity, though the cases often portray damaged people or bitter crimes.<br/><br/>I always say farewell to each season eagerly waiting for next year, so we can resume our tremendously pleasant and thrilling engagement with Shetland, their people and the characters in this show.<br/><br/>Plus the landscapes and the atmosphere, which are enthralling and make you yearn for the place even if you've never been there.<br/><br/>It is not a fast-action show, but very thrilling with a brilliant management of suspense, the whole who-dunnit thing and the gradual unveiling of the truth shared by the team.

On the dreary Shetland Islands north of Scotland, Perez knows the perpetrators as well as the victims and expresses compassion for both.

This is one of the very best series in any market in our opinion.<br/><br/>Casting is superb. I can't think of a single role that was miscast.<br/><br/>The cinematography is, well Scotland. The Scottish architecture and construction is interesting, but the islands are bare and wild. The sun rarely shines. I've been to Scotland several times on business. It is a beautiful place and Glasgow is a very nice city. The grey skies add to the ambiance of the settings.<br/><br/>The story lines are very good. We will have to pick up books authored by Ann Cleeves.<br/><br/>We really like the lead character, DI Jimmy Perez, and how he's played by Douglas Henshall. He is calm, methodical, asks very simple straight-forward questions, and is persistent. Alison O'Donnell is great as DS Alison McIntosh. I won't list them all but the entire cast is great.<br/><br/>Our only negative, just a subjective thing, is we like shows that begin and end in the same episode. All of the Shetland series are two or more episodes, season three being a single story (multiple facets) spread over six episodes. At least episode five could have been cut and the few important bits filtered into episodes 4 and 6.<br/><br/>We can't wait for season 4.",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,10 June 2017

The first few shows the filmed had a gray tone in the filming, (not the stories). I read they actually used filters to dull down the vivid colors to create more of a ""mood"". Now they seemed to have accepted the fact that they are filming in a beautiful location and letting it shine. I could watch this show just for the scenery really. The mysteries are good, they are not usually the person you think who did it. There is usually an old story revealed to tell us who did it. People's histories and back stories. Which I like. I like the Jimmy Perez character. He seems like such a loving and solid man.I hope they do a 2nd series. I enjoyed my time with Shetland. Update-This show made it to 5 seasons.

2094,Shetland, Season/Series 05 Is Bad,"SHETLAND still hasn't had a story take place in wintertime, and season 5 wanders and dithers all over the place in a story about people traffickers and a maybe romance for Perez with a truly annoying woman.<br/><br/>Aside from the moronic romance with a married woman, Tosh maybe finds a boyfriend while Sandy maybe gets suspended for being stupid. Rhona still just sits around scowling at everyone. The trafficking story devolves into various murders and is way too thin to be stretched out over 6 episodes. And then there's Duncan reaching for rock bottom while Cassie is off at Uni.<br/><br/>This season seemed really full of filler and ""OH PLEASE"" moments that were way off the mark.

Each crime was kept to a tight 2-episode story.<br/><br/>Then in season 3, everything changed, and it became much more like a typical Brit crime drama with a 6-episode sprawling plot, multiple sinister organizations operating in the background, intensely vile baddies, etc. Most of all, the setting changed, with about half the scenes in a big city. This loses much of the intimate feel of the first two seasons. After seeing this, I checked the writing, and discovered that it was no longer based on Ann Cleeves' novels, but other TV writers, which is no doubt the reason.

2096,The Middle," Very underrated, innocent family comedy","I really wish ABC would promote this show more, and give the actors credit for their work. They have been robbed of Emmy nominations twice. I honestly enjoy Modern Family but I don't get why that show gets a million Emmy nods every year. Anyway, I've been watching since day 1 and have loved it since. Frankie Heck is the harried car-saleslady mother of 3 kids, living in the fictional town of Orson, Indiana. She is always trying to get the kids to bond, while trying to get by herself, as she and her husband Mike don't make a lot of money and their house is always a mess. Axl, the oldest, is a typical lazy, sarcastic teenager who is almost always making fun of his sister Sue, the middle teen daughter. She is very optimistic and bubbly, but nobody really knows she exists, and can never make anything out of herself, especially at school. Finally we have little Brick, who's nose is always stuck in a book and doesn't really have any friends, but if he does make a friend, they're even quirkier than he is. And they are always trying to compete with their practically perfect neighbors, the Donahues. I think we can all relate to this show in some way--the house is always a mess, the mom doesn't always feel like cooking so she brings home fast food, there's those neighbors who are like the perfect family that you've always wanted to be, and the kids don't always get along. It's not laugh out loud funny but I still tune in every Wednesday. And it is NOT a ripoff of Malcolm. That show was about 4 brothers, one of them being a genius. And they lived in California whereas the Hecks live in the MID-west. And they're middle-income, and this show is focused on the mom, trying to do her best to support her family. This show also has more positive vibes. If it didn't have the word ""Middle"" in the title, people probably wouldn't say a word, right? 8/10.",104 out of 122 found this helpful.,10.0,2 September 2012

Kudos to the superb cast, talented writers, directors, etc. Patricia Heaton and Neil Flynn beautifully and often hilariously play the parents of the Heck family of Orson Indiana. The three children are also played very well ( Charlie McDermott, Eden Sher and Atticus Shaffer)and their very individual characters nicely developed and consistent. The supporting cast is also excellent. The show even offers a gay friend who is sensitively portrayed by Brock Ciarlelli, and whose character is handled beautifully. The Heck's neighbors, the Donahues, The Glossners (Brooke Shields is amazing), The Heck's parents (Marsha Mason, Jerry Van Dyke, and John Collum), and all the other regulars and semi-regulars contribute substantially to the high quality of the show. I often had belly laughs from many of the uproarious 
lines and even tears at certain points. like when Brock's character 'came out' to his best friend played by Eden. What an incredibly poignant moment.

2098,The Middle, Heaton hits a home run,"Often times an actor or actress gets associated with an iconic role, a role they basically continue to play over and over, no matter what show or movie they're in. Happily, this is not the case for Patricia Heaton in her new show ""The Middle"". Her new character, while still a wife and mother of three, is much different than Debra Barone, the character she played for 9 years in ""Everybody Loves Raymond."" <br/><br/>In Debra, Heaton developed a character identified by her sharp, sarcastic wit, razor-sharp tongue, explosive temper, sexy appearance and a love-hate relationship with her husband and his family. Debra's problems were dealing with her passive-aggressive mother-in-law and her over-the-top intrusiveness, or the little ""moral superiority"" battles with Raymond. Because of this limited source for trouble and tension, the problems they had, while funny,were not down-to-earth, day-to-day problems most average families worry about.<br/><br/>In Frankie, Heaton has created a character who is more of a mother than a wife, and is on the same level as her husband instead of above him. That makes a huge difference in the tone of the show, and it's quite refreshing. The problems this family faces are problems most families can identify with, from struggling with bills and worrying about work to having a kid who just can't seem to get it together and find his or her place in the world. Frankie doesn't have time to worry about who didn't put up a suitcase or to fake a boob job to prove some minor point; she has to work together with her whole family just to get by. They face each crisis together, and sometimes have to settle for a less than optimal solution. But at the end of the day, they love and support each other in sweet, often surprisingly tender ways.<br/><br/>While not laugh out loud funny, the show has a sweetness and reality to it I find enjoyable. It has the same feel as old classic sitcoms from the 70's and early 80's, an era many consider to be the Golden Age of sitcom television. I think the biggest draw for me, though, is that I LIKE this family; I'd like to live next door to them, and get to know them. And really, can you say anything better about a show than that, that it makes a family so real and so genuine that you'd be happy to have them as neighbors? I hope the show continues and only gets better.",136 out of 167 found this helpful.,9.0,11 October 2009

Of all the sitcoms on ABC's new ""Wednesday Comedy Night"" this is the one I expected to like the least, so it came as quite a surprise how funny and entertaining the pilot episode was. It moves along nicely and the cast is excellent. I always thought Heaton was talented but could never really enjoy her on EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND because her character was, quite frankly, an unendurable bitch. Here she has a chance to project a little more warmth and likability and really shines. The real charmer in the cast is Eden Sher as the teenage daughter, a marvel of gawky authenticity.

The children are not perfect nor are they drug addicted or sex-crazed or alcoholic or parent-hating brats. The oldest son hanging out in boxer shorts? My son did that. The middle child, the daughter, trying to find her place in the school social order but often coming up short? Who hasn't failed at something in life? And the youngest child, the little boy who often repeats things in a whisper, is sweet and loves his parents. These kids make you laugh both from their unintentional humor and from recognition. And I especially like the fact that each episode ends on an upbeat note. The family members, no matter what crazy circumstances they may find themselves in, love each other and accept their lot in life without bitterness and anger. Far removed from the pop culture norms we've been fed lately, people living in 'The Middle' may actually exist after all.",108 out of 139 found this helpful.,8.0,15 October 2009

Atticus Shaffer as the youngest son ""Brick"" is pretty bizarre, but somehow I find myself laughing at him, especially when he repeats to himself in a whisper, the last word of his sentences. I can't explain why, but it's funny to me every time he does it.<br/><br/>I hope the show doesn't get old for me.

2106,The Middle, A Home Run,"Thank you, ABC, for putting a great group of comedy writers together to support this all star cast. Barbara Heaton as the used car saleslady mom and the janitor from Scrubs as the dad are the best parents I've seen on t.v. in a long time. The 3 children are given meaty characterizations to play and I hope they will win many awards. The kids and the other supporting cast (including Chris Kattan and the car lot boss) couldn't have been cast better. Every show gives me old fashioned belly laughs and inspiration that, like this family struggling to survive in the middle class (the reason for its name, not named for the middle of the country in which it takes place) we can all learn a lesson in what makes families strong.",51 out of 74 found this helpful.,10.0,9 April 2010

It makes me laugh very much and it's the same story with my younger sisters. We have many episodes recorded at home! The plot lines are very real and very funny and amusing. The characters are also very realistic. I also love how it isn't always comedy and that there's a little bit of other genres too, but still it's mostly comedy. I love watching The Middle as its, entertaining, hilarious, fun and gets me in a happy mood. Sometimes I can also relate to the story plots such as the house looking a complete mess and wanting all the new trends! I also like how Patricia Heaton, who plays Frankie Heck, narrates during parts of the show. It's something different and I like it! They are the many reasons why I love to watch The Middle!

2111,The Middle, Finally!! A good family show!!,"I am so pleased that there is finally a good family show on the air that doesn't promote social/political stances and shove their viewpoint in everyone's face! Patricia Heaton is back and with a vengeance! I have been a fan of Ms. Heaton's every since her days on Thirty Something and Everybody Loves Raymond. Her comedic timing is dead on and her facial expressions suit the moment perfectly; not to mention that her acting skills are per near flawless. When you watch this show, you can really feel what the family is going through and that is, at least in part, due to Patricia Heaton's performance.<br/><br/>Eden Shur as Sue Heck is brilliant! I was the Sue Heck of my school and remember vividly trying out for everything and always failing yet I always stayed optimistic that eventually, something would turn out :) My parents were always supportive of me as well although I'm sure my school years debacles were a source of humor for them as Sue's are for her parents. Charlie McDermott is hilarious as Axel..oh my gosh! He reminds me of my high school boyfriend. Neil Flynn and Atticus Shaffer are wonderful as well.<br/><br/>I enjoy this show completely and hope it stays on the air for a long time!!",19 out of 28 found this helpful.,10.0,11 April 2013
2112,The Middle, Patricia Heaton rises up as the star of her own show!,"Emmy winner Patricia Heaton plays a mom, Frances, better known as Frankie in the Middle of the country in Indiana. She has three children with her husband. They both work jobs. She's a car salesman and he works in an office. They have a daughter who tries to achieve or win but always loses. An awkward youngest son who she uses an actual sale to pick him up from school because she or her husband forgot to pick him up. Her oldest son, Axel, doesn't wear his shirt around the house and only comes down to eat. I could relate to this story. I think her role of Frankie is far more interesting than her other roles. Her home is not in order physically and the family lives in the middle of the country. The show starts off with Frankie wearing a superwoman costume because her youngest son, Brick, has said that his mom is his hero. It's not a bad show but you should all watch it if you have families or live outside Hollywood as most of us do. I like seeing her back on the air. She is the star and expect to see her name next year for an Emmy. She's got another shot at it. This show is funny, witty, and off-beat enough for Emmy voters.",41 out of 71 found this helpful.,,2 October 2009
2113,The Middle, Pleasantly Surprised,"The only reason I tuned into this show was for Neil Flynn. I was a huge fan of his character as Janitor on Scrubs. I had little hopes because I was not a huge Patricia Heaton fan. I have found now that was not her fault, but the fault of the writers of Everybody Loves Raymond. They made her such a hard to like character that you could not help but dislike her. I mean who would have stayed married to her? Anyway, I digress, The Middle is rather charming. I find myself constantly rolling my eyes (in a good way) at Axl, cheering for Sue and trying to guess what Brick will do next. The Middle is a great example of the average American family trying to stay afloat in today's economy. They portray the way most of us in my age demographic grew up in the Midwest. I am astounded as someone who spent Jr. High and High School in Iowa at just how accurate they are. I will be around watching for as long as they keep the show on the air.",19 out of 31 found this helpful.,10.0,21 November 2010
2114,The Middle, I am going to miss this show,"SPOILER: It is now hard to believe that The Middle's run as a tv series with new episodes is now over, and it is hard to believe how many changes the show has gone over the years. During the first three seasons, Frankie Heck (Patrica Heaton) worked at Mr. Ehlert's (Brian Doyle-Murray) car dealership as a struggling car saleswoman, that would come in last place out of three sales people that included her friend Bob (Chris Kattan). Beginning of season #4 Mr Ehlert fires Frankie, and she and Bob loses touch. And you might remember Patrica Heaton from Everybody Loves Raymond that also ran 9 seasons The main characters has always focused on the Heck family with Franke, her husband Mike (Neil Flynn), her oldest son Axl (Charlie McDermott), her daughter Sue (Eden Sher), and the youngest child Brick (Atticus Shaffer). The Heck have always been shower as a low income family, that mainly a lot in the first few seasons or so, with either Frankie or Mike bringing home takeout food, with the announcement ""I made dinner"". You have to wonder what the takeout places would think, if they heard either one of them say those words. Today is also a day that I didn't think that I would see anytime soon, the day after the series finale aired. And you also had a lot of recurring characters that included the Donahue family that were friends of the Heck family, and how can you forget about the Glossner family that were the rival family to the Heck family, that would have feuds with. I know Freeform and Hallmark channel will always have repeats of the show, and if you have been a fan of Everybody Loves Raymond, almost all the surviving adult cast members have appeared on the show guest starring including the late Doris Roberts, and Ray Romano that guest starred in the season #3 season opener. The series ended with 9 seasons that ran for 215 episodes, why it ended with 215, is because season #8 ended with 23 episodes instead of 24 episodes.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,23 May 2018
2115,The Middle, A rare sitcom with no embarrassment,"It's not that I am a puritan, but most sitcoms have enough raunch to them that I don't always feel comfortable watching them in mixed company. Yet often the humor lies in the very words, phrases and concepts that make me want to keep my kids away from the show. That is never a concern with ""The Middle."" On the other hand, it is genuinely funny - and although based on exaggeration, a solid reflection of the typical, average small-town American family. Most families have to live modestly from paycheck to paycheck, live in a plain, cramped house with old, tattered furniture, drive an older (sometimes junky) car and live with a degree of eccentric dysfunction. However, the family members are loyal to one another, even as the occasionally disagree. So many family comedies depict a group living in a house that, these days, would cost a million dollars, with furniture brought in by an interior designer, who talk in in soundbites heavy with zingers and put-downs. ""The Middle"" has a coherent plot and a nice flow of dialog. Frankly, I have been surprised it has been on for so many seasons, running somewhat under the radar as it does, and I am looking forward to future seasons, at least until Brick goes off to college.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,5 January 2018

2118,The Middle, One Heck of a show; definitely not your average comedy.,"The best thing about this new series is that it doesn't take itself at all seriously. There are no hidden agendas and there's very little sentimentality; which is quite refreshing to see in an American sit-com as all too often the viewer is comforted with the nicer side of life! Patricia Heaton (Frankie Heck) may be reprising the role of an unappreciated wife, but this time she's different, she's let off the leash and has real bite. She also narrates the show which is a kinda cool. Frankie's husband is Mike Heck (Neil Flynn) a Quarry Manager that's a little too laid-back for Frankie liking, but the pair gel very well and they do seem to still love each other after having three kids. The eldest is Axl, a typical teenager who wants to be a rock star or playboy to the stars. Of course he's completely deluded and isn't exactly a grade-A student, but what he does have going for him is his sporting prowess. He appears to be in all the sports teams. He's also very loyal to his family, but it's very subtle; you have to watch to see what I mean. Sue Heck is the nearest thing to Meg Griffin in real TV. Continually in a state neurotic insecurity and anonymity; Sue repeatedly fails to make any impact regarding after school activities – she literally tries-out for everything! Yet, she struggles on with incredible tenacity, a quality that's quite inspiring to see. Unlike Meg, Sue is pretty, slim and glasses free; but at 14, she still wears braces. Everyone (including her tutors) can never seem to remember her name or face, this only exacerbates her self-consciousness and anxiety. Look out for how delighted she is to make the school cross-country team (albeit contrived). The final component of the Heck family is Brick, a 9 year old loner with a reading fixation. Brick doesn't suffer fools lightly, he's very selective about to whom he speaks and he comes across as an evil genius in the making. Brick is very forgetful and shows little interest in anything other than his books. Nevertheless he's an interesting character and not cutesy which is always good! For me though Sue (Eden Sher) is the real gem in this new sit-com; she's very amusing, stupid and naive, yet her never say die attitude is heart-warming and a delight to see. I hope The Middle goes for a few more seasons, just to see how Sue gets on!",14 out of 22 found this helpful.,6.0,2 September 2011
2119,The Middle, The best family comedy,"I'm sorry I have to disagree with previous reviewers who do not like this show. I was an absolute devotee of Everybody Loves Raymond and Patricia Heaton deserved her awards in those days, but this to me is a far better show because the message in the end is usually positive and family-affirming. Yes I was at first put off by the crazy kids too but watch for a while and you'll see they have incredible talent, as does the whole family. Every cast member is a real character, but Frankie Heck steals the show every time. It really is a matter of taste and I hope the producers realise this appeals a LOT to middle class families. All the situations the Hecks get into are SO real, and Patricia Heaton is absolutely at her best, completely believable and hilarious.Brilliant, brilliant brilliant.Love it to bits.

2122,Babylon Berlin," A crossover between Great Gatsby, Miss Marple, The Untouchables, Casino witha European twist.","This series are one of the best I've ever seen. First of all because they are educational. They tell us about how life was under the Weimar Republic (the democratic regime in Germany between 1919 and 1933). I am tired of all those cliches about Germany as fascistland, ignoring the rich history this country had before authoritarianism.<br/><br/>In Germany 1929, the country is falling apart because of the great depression combined with the crippling punishment of Versailles treaty, plus almost all adult males are crippled because of WWI or heavily shell shocked, with seizures and convilsions that prevented them of working or actually leading normal lives. Starvation, homelessness, drug use and prostitition (male, female and transvestite ) are essentially the only way many families resort in order to feed their children and older relatives. Heroin addiction is a menace, and that despair is driving people to embrace any charlatan, demagogue or ideology that promises bringing them a better future (which at the time, was not fascim yet, but Bolshevism, with Trotskyists and Stalinist competing and fighting each other).<br/><br/>Despite all that hopelessness and misery that Germans were enduring, there is an incredible cultural scene happening in Berlin, where the nightlife is intense, American Jazz musicians and dancers achieve success, the arts (Cinema, design, architecture, music) is evolving, there is a lot of beauty and reckless sex happening. Decadence is the word to describe the atmosphere, where a caste society lives another planet, with country clubs, mansions and servants, while the plight of the majority is simply ignored. It almost feel like the Blade Runner society.<br/><br/>It is not mentioned in the series, but at the time, Albert Einstein was a professor in Berlin, and Fritz Lang was the king of Cinema, Walter Gropius founded Bauhaus by that time, Vladimir Nabokov was living there, in short, the great Europeans minds flocked to Berlin in the late 1920s. So what you appreciate in the series is this dicotomy. How a society with so much brilliance, talent and efficiency could have rebuild itself slowly and become a prosperous nation, but later the population made wrong choices and followed the call that ended up in a disaster that they will never recover. I was in Berlin 2 tears ago, and saw how damaged the city is and felt so sorry for them and their curse.<br/><br/>The series gives us some contex that help us understand how many people, mostly good intentioned, ended up supporting a system in 1933 that was almost non existent in the 20s (fascism). Their regime at the time was democratic, with a free press, a legal system, parliament, etc.<br/><br/>Babylon Berlin is not only politics. It is also thriller, romance, drama and action. The main actors Gereon and Lotte are very charismatic and you cheer for them all the time, because they come from disfunctional families, but they try to do the right thing all the time. It is almos impossible not to fall in love with Lotte. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also very good looking, but still keeping the beauty standars accurate with the early 20th century. Their nude bodies are beautiful, but never arousing. The nakedness is constant, but never out of place. And people smoke all the time, whic is also accurate. There is almost no scene without a cigarette.<br/><br/>I hope most people enjoy just like I did",246 out of 272 found this helpful.,10.0,4 February 2018

2126,Babylon Berlin, positively brilliant,"There really aren't enough adjectives to describe Babylon Berlin, an incredible German television series. And I have to echo what the other reviewers say, watch it in German with English subtitles.<br/><br/>This is 1920s Berlin, and the show immediately pulls you into that world, that atmosphere of the Weimar era.<br/><br/>This was a time of great upheaval in Germany - there is poverty, no work, and yet Berlin is a city of great art and hedonistic pleasure. The story focuses on a police inspector, Gereon Rath, who comes to Berlin to break a pornography ring. Along the way he meets a part-time prostitute, Charlotte Ritter, who also works as a stenographer, and he teams up with another officer, Bruno Wolter, as his partner.<br/><br/>This is Berlin during a time of political unrest, the rise of National Socialism (Nazis) and other far-right groups.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes in this series are so stunning they demand repeated viewings - most notably the nightclub scene in season 1, one of the most thrilling things I've ever seen. That's the only one I'll mention so I won't give anything away. But you can't beat Babylon Berlin for edge of your seat excitement and tension.<br/><br/>Impeccably filmed, impeccably directed, impeccably written, impeccably acted, featuring some amazing characters, Babylon Berlin is a must see.",41 out of 47 found this helpful.,10.0,7 March 2020

She also has a passing resemblance to Proust which is definite a good thing!

You don't even have to be interested in history or politics or cinematic artistry. It still works perfectly just as a story full of suspense and entertainment. 
It took a while to really get under my skin because it does not use the usual tear jerking bits and no clear cut heros who always do what you wish them to do in order to like them. It creeps into you in small but steady doses. The pace does increase in the second season (E 9-16) with a perfect finale. They do a great job of letting you feel the hope, courage, glamour, stupor, dust and doom of Berlin 1928. They do not force any morale or ostensible messages on you, yet it never feels spineless. Historical insight and information are weaved into a fictional world that captures your senses and intellect alike. They do it in such a natural way that it never feels educational. Like they did in Mad Men or Downton Abbey, but with some more use of experimental ways to visualise or narrate the story. The acting, the visual art (both set and cinematography), the music, are all impressive in the literal sense. The singing: Wow. A haunting performance by Severija Januauskaite, and not to forget Brian Ferry. <br/><br/>I can only recommend to watch it.

2134,Babylon Berlin, The Golden Age rolls on,"Just when I suspected the golden age of TV might be in decline after close to twenty years (counting from the advent of the Sopranos) along comes Babylon Berlin. What a savage swath through the Weimar Republic, that time in Germany between the World Wars. Were I to recount the plot, the multiple plots, the plots with the plots, this review would go on for many pages. Even Wikipedia has trouble keeping up. First, nothing is at it seems. The heroes often topple off their perches and the villains sometimes show flashes off humanity. No one trusts anyone and with good reason because no one is trustworthy. Morals are beside the point; betrayals are the politics of the day. And amazingly, according to what I read, the history in this series is not exaggerated: this is the way it was in the Weimar Republic. <br/><br/> The production values are fabulous; this is one good-looking movie. Berlin is bright, yet dark, completely addictive. The acting is superb, ranging from a conflicted detective, who reminds one of Clint Eastwood, to an actress who lights up the screen each time she appears, the lovely and very talented Liv Lisa Fries who plays Charlotte, a child of the slums, who has the strange ambition to be a homocide detective.Even the minor characters are sharply drawn.Contributing mightly to the verisimilitude: the costuming which is anything but costuming: these people look as if they had been wearing those peaked lapels and flapper gowns all their lives. <br/><br/>Someone said this might be the greatest serial film of all time. Hard to say that when you have such brilliant forays as The Sopranos, Breaking Bad and Fargo but I think they may be right. My only criticism is with the dubbed version in English; everyone has an American accent which is off-putting.

Young people wanted to escape reality by living it up in the ""anything goes"" night clubs, or wheeling and dealing for some extra activities in the discreet ""upstairs"" rooms. <br/><br/>The political winds were getting forceful, with Communists and Nazis fighting for power. Corrupt police and politicians played both sides against one another. The hero, mysterious vice cop (with an apparent morphine addiction) on a secret mission, joins forces with a street smart yet compassionate ""Gal Friday""; both refuse to give up hope for a better future for the people of this socially plagued city.<br/><br/>The closing theme song is established at the end of episode 2. It's a haunting song by another mysterious character, sung in German with a thick Russian accent. Throughout the series the song is woven into the closing titles, even as other period Jazz music is included in the score. This series is a masterpiece of drama! Some may be put off by many violent scenes, but because these do contribute to the plot, they are not gratuitous. The overall production values are mesmerizing. As a native to Berlin, I am very much impressed by the realism. ""Cabaret"" gave similar descriptions of the rough life ca. 1930. ""Babylon Berlin"" offers a sustained, chilling experience no other period piece could match. This is historical fiction of the highest quality!",31 out of 38 found this helpful.,10.0,22 February 2018
2137,Babylon Berlin, Review with some background information,"Babylon Berlin is based on the novel ""Der nasse Fisch"" by Volker Kutscher, but the production changed the story and the characters quite a bit, so much so that I wonder if further seasons can still be based on Kutscher's books.
Since I had read the books not too long before watching the series, I got confused because of those differences, mixing up the images in my head and on screen, so make sure to leave some time between reading and watching.
I can really recommend the books, they are well reasearched, they are historically accurate and give many nice details about the Berlin of that period.
I'm not expert enough to say if the changes and additions made in the series are still as accurate, but the production team consulted a historian while producing it.<br/><br/>Babylon Berlin is the most expensive German production so far and you can see it. Where cheaper productions have to go with 3-4 takes to get it done, here each scene was shot until the director was finally satisfied (I was an extra in this series, so I know).
Productions of such magnitude were not new to the team, many ""Hollywood"" movies and US series were shot entirely or in part in Berlin and Studio Babelsberg, so they had an experienced crew, headed by Tom Tykwer.<br/><br/>So is it any good? I'm not quite neutral, since I was there on set, and I dislike it when a good book gets altered too much in filming, but the images alone are worth it, you can see the extra money spent, so give it a try!<br/><br/>Edit: Review of season 3 (which is based on book #2 by Kutscher).
Again I was there as an extra and got a look behind the scenes. I couldn't find any numbers, but I had the impression that this season was done on a smaller budget than the first two, e.g. we didn't take quite as many shots on the same scene and seemed to be more in a hurry. Still, the sets, the costumes and some other things that cost money were already there and build upon. After watching the series on TV, I didn't really notice much of a difference when it comes to production value.
In this season, Gereon and Charlotte are undergoing some changes, thus becoming more like the characters from the books, to me these changes make them more amiable. Also, the plot follows the one from the book more closely than the first 2 seasons did, but there is still an entirely new sub plot.
Basically, if you liked the first 2 seasons, you will also like the third. It's a bit less glamorous, instead we get more detective story parts and you won't get as many history lessons, but you will get to see how movies were made 90 years ago. One of the great things is that the scenes that play at the Babelsberg Film Studios were actually shot there, they have survived a war, the GDR and the changes that came with the fall of the Berlin Wall.",39 out of 49 found this helpful.,9.0,14 January 2018
2138,Babylon Berlin, What a corker!,"For all lovers of German cinema - it's totally back! Visually, artistically, musically.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Deutschland 83 and its variants enormously but this is a whole new dimension.<br/><br/>Grab Siegfried Kracauer's FROM CALIGARI TO HITLER together with Otto Friedrich's BEFORE THE DELUGE and read every word again; then luxuriate in this masterpiece of longform television.<br/><br/>The directors - totally immersed in the period - spoil us with iris shots, shadows, distorted angles and so on to ground the visuals. It's Fritz Lang crossed with Murnau, Pabst and Wiene.<br/><br/>This amazing series is an homage to and a lament for Weimar Germany with LOTS OF DANCING.<br/><br/>We know what is waiting in the wings and sadly it isn't just Zarah Leander.",15 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,27 February 2020
2139,Babylon Berlin, Easy to Get Rid of the Dubbing if You Prefer That,"Babylon Berlin is perhaps the best thriller I have ever seen, and there's no need to duplicate all the rapturous praise everyone else has given. But the worst CRITICISM I see of the series here is that the German dialogue is dubbed into English rather than subtitled. Some people have given it low ratings just because of that.<br/><br/>But that's completely silly. Europeans often prefer dubbing, because people can listen faster than they can read, so dubbing can give you a more accurate picture of what's being said. Subtitles inevitably show you only a sampling of the actual words being said.<br/><br/>But if you prefer subtitles, it's easy to change the dubbing. Click on the little gear at the bottom of the screen, turn on the English subtitles, and turn the dialogue from dubbed English back to the original German. Problem solved.",27 out of 33 found this helpful.,10.0,23 June 2018
2140,Babylon Berlin, Gripping stuff!!,"Despite the fact that my wife and I, she is German and I am English, live in Germany we never watch German TV. My wife says there is no comparison to what the UK produce which she considers superior to both German and US productions.<br/><br/>Having said that we are both riveted to Babylon Berlin, Berlin is a city we have been to on many occasions, spent her 65th birthday in the Adlon no less! We have just finished watching series one which has on Sky Atlantic, why is it just being shown when it's over 3 years old and currently on series four? Never mind.<br/><br/>I think this is the best German series I've ever seen, including 'Das Boot', okay I haven't watched many but my wife says this is better than anything she has ever seen on German TV. You can see the budget it high, the 20s' setting looks authentic with clothes and settings from that period, you can almost believe Berlin wasn't flattened in 1945. The music is wonderful, some of it, particularly the Bryan Ferry material is not of the period although they have tried to make it so, We both looked at each other when a barely recognisable 'Dance Away' came on and said 'Roxy Music'.<br/><br/>If you like 20s' period drama with a touch of gangsters and you haven't seen it do so, you won't be disappointed. I've heard there is dubbed version, probably for the US market who don't like to do subtitles. Avoid it if you can, I hate dubbed films.<br/><br/>Update - I have now seen all three series, I don't understand the negative reviews and I object to being accused of planting a false review. I also refute accusations that it is leftist propaganda.

The 1920´s in Berlin is such a fascinating time. The series takes us into a shady Berlin with corruption, sex, social issues, new culture and a vibrant nightlife. 
The storyline and has a nice built up, which makes us familiar with the characters and stage. What I found most enjoyable is the variaty and detail fused with a great atmosphere, that creates a sometimes dark and nostalgic vibe.
The vibe is enhanced with the interesing characters and a great acting performances.

2145,Babylon Berlin," An incredible, unique piece of art","Nothing among what I've ever watched looks quite like Babylon Berlin. It paints a vivid picture of this gorgeous city and some of its inhabitants caught right in the middle of two wars, a period rarely seen from Germany's point of view.
Yes, season 1 is slow-paced and despair may seem to overtake glitz and splendour, an unfortunate reality in a post-WW1 Germany seeking reconstruction and recognition. Yet, it gives the viewer plenty of time to get to know and appreciate its multilayered, imperfect characters as they develop amid magnificent settings and music. The rhythm quickens and sharpens in season 2, patience is worth it as remaining understandings make sense, just so it can give way to new ones. Season 3 is a lot to take in and, after the end of episode 12, I have to say it's my favorite. It comes full circle and still leaves plenty of room for what's to come next, I just can't wait.
Beautifully written and acted - Babylon Berlin is rare, imperfect and superb.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,25 January 2021
2146,Shameless, Reminds you how good TV can be,"Once in a while, there comes along a TV drama series that makes you glad the medium was invented.  A series that makes you glad to be alive; a series that breaks your heart that you have to wait a whole week to see the next episode.  Shameless is such a series.<br/><br/>The Gallagher family consists of dad Frank and his six children (their mum apparently abandoned them years ago).  Frank spends most of his time out drinking, only returning to the family's council house on a run-down Manchester estate when he's dragged home comatose by the police in the early hours of the morning.  The result is that the six kids more or less bring themselves up, with the eldest - 20-year-old Fiona - acting as the token mum.<br/><br/>From all this, it should make for depressing viewing.  But the beauty of Paul Abbott's semi-autobiographical drama is that it's not even remotely depressing.  The six Gallagher kids, their friends and neighbours form an extended family where everyone loves and supports everyone else; and the result is bawdy, rude, but above all uplifting, heartwarming and fun.  The performances are uniformly excellent and to single anyone out would be unfair.  The first episode does a wonderful job of introducing the large cast of characters - not just in a cursory way either, but in sufficient depth to make you care about this assortment of misfits enough to want to tune in next week to see what befalls them next.<br/><br/>This is what TV should be.

2147,Shameless, As good as TV ever gets,"I'm not a great authority on this, as I hardy watch TV any more. If they came up with more stuff like this, I would be addicted to the Box. Fantastic script, characters and acting and the funniest, freshest British made comedy I've seen since Spaced and (to a slightly lesser extent) The League of Gentlemen.<br/><br/>Although I come from the north of England and lived in Manchester for two years and therefore, through direct association, find I can relate very naturally to this humour, it must surely transcend 'northern' taste and appeal, in the same way that Phoenix Nights did, to absolutely anybody who sees it.<br/><br/>It's no wonder Channel 4 are taking the unusual step of running the whole series again, as I think media interest/hype came too late this time round. It's the only British thing to come remotely close to challenging the HBO stable (6ft Under/S.A.T.C) stuff that has attracted TV's biggest plaudits in this last 4/5 years. I think it will go down as being an important landmark in British comedy broadcasting and gain cult status for years to come.<br/><br/>Commissioning a series two is a must - it was just hitting full speed last night with the closing episode of this first run.",78 out of 87 found this helpful.,10.0,25 February 2004

The characters are sublimely developed with Frank, the hapless father being one of, if not the main character. He is a horrible man with questionable morals and less than a day's work behind him in his life. He has 8 children to support and is supported himself by his beautiful yet eccentric wife. It is Franks tale of partying, avoiding work and generally being the worst father in the world.

2150,Shameless," Vital, visceral, poignant, all with perfect comedic timing.","From the very first episode you will be drawn into the lives of each of the principal characters - warts and haloes and all. Each is fully realized with a light and dark side, shown incrementally and alternately through their actions and their reluctantly expressed concerns. The story lines are both outrageous and  once you spend a few minutes with this family  absolutely believable, and move at an enervatingly brisk while gratifyingly even pace. I'm so glad I found out about it when Series II had already completed, and could enjoy it from episode 1.1 through the end of series II. While it seems evident that Series III will commence with casting changes, this production is so incredibly well planned (unlike most U.S. series - Lost, I'm looking at you) that the story arc girds you quite well for even fundamental shifts, and instills great anticipation. The show addresses immediate, on-the-ground social issues like complacency vs. poverty, avarice vs. honor, cheating vs. work (and stealing vs. profit), lust vs. love, and 9 times out of 10 the virtuous parts of humanity are exemplified and enjoyed (but always with the other side engaged and/or confronted in the process). That 10th time is where Frank comes in. Paul Abbott is a brave artist, a brave man, and a brave son. Never has such a reluctant father been so well-realized and so generously presented. Now.

This show blows away any of the lame crap that they call TV over here and is another testament to the vastly underrated talent of the UK. The only way a show this ballsy would be shown over here would be on a pay channel like HBO or Showtime. I am fast becoming a huge fan of British TV (Eastenders, The Office, Coupling, Father Ted, The Green Wing, ABFAB) and hopefully the DVD will be available to us yanks soon.

2153,Shameless, This is what TV is about........,"""Shameless"" began a couple of nights ago on SBS TV - supposedly an ethnic channel (are Mancunian's ethnic, then??) - in Australia, with no warning, no fanfare. I was blown fair out of my chair by this show, and possibly appreciated it all the more because I had no expectations, although once I noted Paul Abbott's name under 'writer' I knew I was in for something special. His scripts for 'Clocking Off' and 'Linda Green' were, like 'Shameless', both sharp and original. Dialogue is quick and relevant, characters are drawn immediately, and altogether the script treats the viewer as an intelligent participant in the hilarious, and often poignant, exploits of the Gallagher family. Dad Gallagher, always a bit the worse for wear on drugs or alcohol (or both) is raging around the room talking rubbish, and Fiona, eldest child, explains to her posh boyfriend that her Dad's ecstasy dealer is a schizophrenic, like that explains everything.

2154,Shameless, Fabulous television,"I love television. Watched it since the late '50's and enjoyed everything, even if I hated myself for enjoying it. However, there are shows that stand out and Shameless is one of them. I think that Alan Clark produced some of the best drama on British TV, even including Ken Loach and Dennis Potter. On comedy, the UK has birthed or succoured a comprehensive list of talented writers that Greece was not ancient enough to pre-empt. Shameless is brilliant. It is Ken Loach and Ian Pattison (Rab C Nesbit) in concert, it is Dennis Potter and the Pythons. David Threlfell plays Frank Gallagher, a wastrel philosopher whose genes will inherit the earth. His family are an absorbing, entertaining, sensitive magnet for our attention and affection. They are challenging and rude, but I'd live there, it is urban Manchester and welcoming. Forget the comedy for a minute and I'm most reminded of Alan Clark's 'Road'. Threlfell and Maxine Peake ( the best in ' dinnerladies ') are like Dudegeon and Horrocks. They provide adult acting and the rest of the cast are not far behind. If you do nothing else on a Saturday night, buy this DVD.

2156,Shameless, Could have been one of the greatest shows in british TV history,"The first four seasons of shameless were unbelievably brilliant. A northern working class family living on a rough council estate in Manchester. After that it declines immensely. By time it gets to season 11, it is complete garbage. Shameless used to film on an actual estate in Gorton, Manchester up to about season 4/5 when they moved to a custom built set due to problems filming because of the shows popularity. The problem with this, is that it's clearly a set. It's so noticeable that the set doesn't even try to resemble the layout of the estate. The shop is clearly behind the Gallaghers house, where as before it was about a mile away. There is houses across from the Gallaghers that were not there before. It's ridiculous. The biggest problem with this show though is the mysterious disappearances of cast members without any real mention of where they have gone. Debbie, Ian, Liam, Carol, Jez just name a few. The cast becomes almost unrecognisable. The first few seasons is about the real nitty gritty of northern working class life. After that, stories become pathetic like an episode where Frank and Monica are talking to there newborn baby through telepathy. Bottom line is that this show had the potential to be one of the greatest shows British TV has ever seen but rather than end it about six seasons before they did. They prolonged the agony of a once great show.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,6.0,17 February 2018

2159,Shameless, It was the Best Show Out,"What I am doing reviewing each series for how they did and their downfalls. I will be deeply analyzing Shameless, and the end I'll simply place a verdict.<br/><br/>Series 1: It was the most intriguing entry of the series because of the raw power/tenacity of the actors, the way certain scenarios were built on (example, Karen and Frank's affair) and how various situations of a dysfunctional family living on the breadline would affect viewers to think. How could we believe in the decision making of how this family would survive whilst the mother was on a run-about and the father was a layabout. Overall, series one was the most realistic because themes involving poverty, sex and alcoholism played major factors in how the characters acted upon certain situations.<br/><br/>Series 2: This was quite an excellent continuation from where the first series left off. We look through the lives of Frank and his dysfunctional clan. Again, quite relatable with audiences who are/were experiencing what the Gallagher family go through or even those who didn't live a lifestyle like this (I relate to the series through not living like the Gallagher's but instead deeply thinking about what they're experiencing and how certain situations impact them). I love how the Gallagher's are pounded with new situations to deal with. I also really enjoyed the way the cinematography was boosted up in color toning and brightness. It gave off the intention of a more tense feel.<br/><br/>Series 3: I would say that this was the last strong entry because after this, things started heading downhill. I believe that without Fiona and Steve, series 3 was still quite a grand look into how the children would survive without their eldest sister. I found at times I related to this one a little bit more than the first two. I enjoyed many of the new ideas that the creators dwelled upon. I found that series 3 set up chronological story lines for how plot lines would turn out (example, Frank not going through with divorce w/Monica and he still marries Sheila, what a coincidence?) However, those episodes about the two set up greatly for how series 4 evolves. Overall, genius.<br/><br/>Series 4: This is where I found Shameless would start taking a continuous root into recycling ideas. With the Maguire family being introduced, things would ultimately start to change greatly. Even though these were the cases for what some of the later entries turned out to be, I actually liked it. Still has a great cast, the Maguires are a laughable yet scary bunch of people who almost control the Chatsworth estate. I still found many of the episodes interesting, however I never liked the idea of Kev and Veronica leaving.<br/><br/>Series 5: I found this to be the last good entry in my opinion. I thought that even for 16 episodes, I thought it was a mighty effort to keep the hype of the show going extensively to engage audiences for one final time until it would slowly start to crumble and become a repetitive mix of mess. I have to say I was disappointed with the departure of Lip (who was my favorite character!). Despite that, I loved the way the show still casted some drama, keeping good contrast between the Gallagher's and Maguires. Their issues and troubles were presented realistically.<br/><br/>Series 6: This is where things started to really fall down the drain pipe. I don't think it was too bad, but I felt that Shameless was starting to run low on fuel to keep ""continuous addiction"". Story lines just felt a little over the top. I still liked the contrast between the two families and some of the humor was still up to scratch.<br/><br/>Series 7: I would say for a this series; it was probably the most darkest I had ever seen of it. Affairs, drug abuse, etc. which made Shameless compelling were taken to a new level , where I found most scenarios color coated grimly. I hardly found any humor at all. Honestly though, I found it a great turning point. Sure, some stupid story lines but it was different in a great way.<br/><br/>Series 8: This is when I really started dreading the series! Too many episodes! It was quite stupid as I found that most of the content which we had seen happen to characters in the past was happening all over again (example, Frank screwing a woman to make Libby break up with him) We've seen that before! I will admit there were some funny parts but I found that good characters were only tossed in whenever creators wanted them in! No good!<br/><br/>Series 9: I'd say it was a slight improvement over the 8th series but it had no redeeming qualities. We lost Carl and Mickey who were fantastic characters. We also ended up with idiotic characters like Billy and Domenic. Why??? The eviction part was interesting though.<br/><br/>Series 10: Well, it was awful. Zero develop and effort to achieve any realism whatsoever. It was sloppy. *I could note that it took me nearly a month to get through, come on!*<br/><br/>Series 11: I didn't mind this one. The final entry series has it's stronger traits (episodes 8, 13, 14) whilst it too had it's weaker episodes (7, 10, 11). Overall, I thought that the last series was a major improvement over some of the previous. Bringing back old characters such as Lip and Fiona were positive steps forward. It was good for the most part.<br/><br/>Verdict: Series 1: 10/10 Series 2: 10/10 Series 3: 9/10 Series 4: 8/10 Series 5: 8/10 Series 6: 6/10 Series 7: 6.5/10 Series 8: 5/10 Series 9:5.5/10 Series 10: 3/10 Series 11: 6/10<br/><br/>Overall Shameless is a series not to be missed.

2162,Shameless, Work is the scourge of the drinking classes...,"Paul Abbott's last drama, 'State of Play', was an ultra-serious (and ultra-good) political thriller.  For this, his follow-up, he has made what at first viewing appears to be a bizarre choice, making a drama about working class life that superficially resembles an extended version of Harry Enfield's 'Slobs' sketches, only with added sex and violence.  But as you get used to the program, its appeal grows.  Human stain Frank Gallacher, the awful family patriarch, rumbles on in the background, pretty much ignored by everyone else, who've all rumbled that he's just a waste of space. Meanwhile, they try to make the best of what he has left of their lives. Fast paced and funny, it's infinitely more entertaining than stolid dramas like 'Family Business' (screened at the same time on another channel).<br/><br/>Still, 'Shameless' is a hard series to place.  It's not exactly social commentary, less sentimental in its portrayals of working class life than the films of Ken Loach, but also, one suspects, less accurate; there are some echoes of 'The Royal Family', albeit with a totally different vibe. But when a drama doesn't fit a preconceived box, that's a plus not a minus. 'Shameless' won't change your life: but it is quirky, original and fun.",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,8.0,17 April 2004
2163,Shameless, The best of the British,"'Shameless' is without a doubt the best British made TV series in a very long time. Not only can all the audience relate the characters to someone they know, or even themselves - as I can, but the story lines never fail to create excitement and emotion in the audience. The catchy theme song becomes entwined within the minds of viewers, as they try to mimic the unforgettable accent that belongs to the one and only Frank Gallagher. The long-suffering kids always manage to realise their family values and always come up trumps for their siblings when they need to. It really moves the audience, especially in the more dramatic and darkly serious episodes that leave housewives in tears. The latest series has just finished its victorious run on channel 4, and my friends have relentlessly watched the DVDs of series 1 and 2 over and over again. We shall be re-visiting Chatsworth Estate when the series reruns - starting this week. Compulsory viewing for all Brits, and indeed any one who wants to get an inward look on real British people.

2166,Shameless, Shameless is now worthless.,"As an avid viewer of Shameless since series one I have noticed a gradual deterioration of the quality over the last two series (my rating is for series 6 and 7). I have now reached the point where I can no longer bear to watch wondering what horror show they will put on display next.<br/><br/>In this latest series we have already seen hard-man drug dealer Paddy doing ballroom dancing, Mimi joining the WI, Joe giving up his job to run a corner shop, Karen having mental problems and getting over them two minutes later and Ian rejecting his gay lifestyle to suddenly declare his love for his brother's ex-girlfriend. I could go on.<br/><br/>Now the latest episode saw poor unloved Liam find solace with an 84 year old WWII veteran only for his friendship to be confused with something more sinister. I could run with the that but the scene of Liam wearing his sister's dress under his clothes (because he was 'missing her') was probably the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in a TV drama. Did Debbie ever wear such a dress? It looked more like something a bad Margaret Thatcher impersonator would have worn in the 1980s.<br/><br/>This ludicrous scenario was only created so that Libby could witness what she thought was a perverted act. I can only assume that the writers either think that all potential child molesters get children to dress up in such bizarre clothes or they were too lazy to do any proper research.? Or maybe they were worried in case we thought they knew too much. Either way they seem to be confusing transvestitism with child abuse.<br/><br/>Once this scenario was revealed to the rest of Liam's family Carl immediately wanted to go round their with a baseball bat to bash the pensioner's brains out. This was Carl who last week was in hiding after being accused of beating someone to death with a baseball bat, which makes sense.<br/><br/>It's almost as though the writers take the first pitiful ideas they think of and then get 14-year olds to write the scripts which are then used unedited. I seriously don't know how the actors can bear to appear in such badly written trash. You'd think they would be embarrassed. I bet a lot of them will be deleting Shameless from their CV's in the future. I know I am deleting it from my list of must see dramas.",14 out of 23 found this helpful.,3.0,11 April 2010
2167,Shameless, Shameless,"Shameless is the funniest show on TV. The Gallagher kids have a chronic drunk as a father and a self-pitying mother who deserted them, instead of falling apart they have successfully stayed together and retained a close bond. It would be so easy to have made a show using the same characters and turned it into some sad soap opera portraying them as depressed poverty stricken people who would never achieve anything, instead all the characters are intelligent, extremely funny, creative and determined to succeed. Reading this back it doesn't do the show justice - you need to see it to appreciate it. Its hard to even to be mad at Frank who can be such a jerk but obviously loves his kids and Sheilia who is very kind and as nutty as a fruit cake. The neighbours Kev, Veronica and Marty are the best neighbours you could get (I'd love to live in their neighbourhood).

2169,Shameless, The Best thing since sliced bread,"In a time where any old crap can be deemed as entertainment, Shameless strives to bring realism and entertainment to our lives. I will warn that this show is not for anyone as it deals very frankly with todays social issues.<br/><br/>Set in the fictional Chatsworth estate Shameless follows the trials and tribulations of the Gallagher family. Held together by the oldest sister Fiona whilst their father is consistently drunk or drugged out of it, they face everything from new boyfriends, pregnancy, homosexuality, bailiffs and even an accidental killing.<br/><br/>In the family there is Fiona, Lip (a cheeky half wit), Ian (closet Homosexual), Carl (second youngest brother, Debbie (a con artist with a heart of Gold) and there is Liam (underdeveloped because of his age. There father Frank is what many would refer to as a waste of space. He spends every waking hour in the Jockey (His Local pub) whining to anyone who will listen about everything from politicians to the weather. He provides a lot of the comedy in this show. The series also reflects the lives of their neighbors and best friends Veronica and Kev. Along with them is Veronica's mother and her brother Marty who suffers from tourettes and is an arsonist. Also there is Shelagh who is Franks girlfriend, mother of his twins and bride to be. Then there is Steve Fiona's middle class boyfriend who seems to be to good to be true and it transpires he makes his living from car thefts. The series has now moved into it's third series and Fiona and Steve have left, but in the two previous series the younger members of the cast where kept in the back ground, but now they have flourished through this time and are well able to hold their own in which they are the center of the storyline<br/><br/>This series is very stylish in it's presentation it relies on a lot of quick edits and fancy camera work. However the story lines, courtesy of Paul Abbott and his team of writers, are of the best quality there is. It only goes further to prove that Paul Abbott is one of great Britains finest television writers and at the moment there is no one that comes close to him.<br/><br/>The acting is also top notch and the cast are in my opinion very capable of producing the best of work in even the most toughest of story lines and they should have been given some sort of honorary ensemble award for their work.<br/><br/>The one thing that everybody comments on about this series is the relationship between the characters. And if I am being honest this is why their following has grown and it's fan base crosses all walks of life. Definitely one to watch.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,10 February 2006

The first 5-6 seasons are brilliant but as they usually do it starts to fall off at the end..it did go on for 11 seasons which is a tad long for what it is but non the less a great series that the US version couldn't hold a candle against.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,18 June 2020
2171,Russian Doll, Self-help for all depressed people out there,"Well, Russian doll is genius, because it hits the sweet spot - the thing most of Netflix binge-watchers' are suffering from: depression. Not judging, as I am definitely counting myself in.<br/><br/>So - two complements to the makers:<br/><br/>First, the details - maybe only my way of interpreting it, because each scene, each dialogue in some way explains depression and its roots in a dark, but simultaneously humorous way. For me it's of course first of all the time loop. Such a great metaphor for the ongoing fight against this feeling of being stuck with one's own feelings and feeling powerless against them. It's like you wake up everyday, hating your job, hating yourself, your body, your life and you feel like you will never find a way out. There is a great build up that reflects a typical depression: first, she feels annoyed, doesn't know how to handle it, there is pressure from outside (the knocking on the door), the guests and her friends who try to reach out, but she cuts them off, one by one, not willing to accept or to see a helping hand, no mirror for self-hatred, as nothing is relevant anymore when you are at the edge. And at the same time the one and only explanation of where the feelings are coming from: consumption (drugs) or lack of it (eating disorder), which are on the other hand just a consequence from missing one key thing in the characters' lives: love.<br/><br/>Second, dear makers of the series, thank you, for giving it a happy ending. For showing that getting and accepting help actually helps. For not killing one of the characters to give it an art-house murderous twist, that lots of producers love these days. Thanks for letting Natascha to get to the ""smallest doll"", the core of a matreshka, that explained where all the pain is coming from. Thanks for realizing, that with your audience you have a responsibility- maybe not to cure depression, but not to push people to the extremes.<br/><br/>That being said, I enjoyed it because I could feel it, not because of the bittersweet humor or well-played characters. I'd rather describe it as a reflection of my own face I stare at every day in the mirror - I look at it, I know what's bothering me, one day I can do something about it, another I can't. But at least I am aware of this ups and downs - this is what the series teaches you, and this is a good start, right?",441 out of 489 found this helpful.,9.0,8 February 2019
2172,Russian Doll, This is not a comedy (fortunately).,"Wow. What a ride. This series compelled me to reactivate my account to write a review.<br/><br/>First of all - please do not expect laugh out loud comedy. This is a very dark and sometimes very unpleasant series.
Yet, it is sometimes hilarious in its own way.<br/><br/>The story of Russian Doll is based on a now often used device, granted. But it is by no means formulaic.
In fact, there are so many twists and turns in the development section of the 8 episodes, you will be glued to the screen.<br/><br/>Some people didn't like the main character, calling her nasty and unpleasant. But this is the point of the series! She is a deeply troubled person.
But trust me, she will become likeable soon enough - and stay tuned for the arrival of another main character (played by Charlie Barnett), who totally makes up for everything cringeworthy the potty-mouthed character played by Natasha Lyonne did until this point.<br/><br/>In the end, I promise you, you will have watched a cathartic experience that will leave you very happy.<br/><br/>On the technical level, Russian Doll is unusually well shot. The lighting reminds me of classic Mario Bava movies (I think this is intentional), and the music is very well sought.<br/><br/>So, go watch this, and please watch beyond episode 3, you will thank me later.<br/><br/>If only all takes on old plot devices were this awesome!

Russian doll is a true, deep, dark, intelligent masterpiece. Russian dolls transcends time, morality, gender and genres.

The lead character, Nadia, is thoroughly unappealing to me - crude, unkind, someone who always speaks in wisecracks, and always imposes herself on others - I couldn't understand how she even had any friends in her life.<br/><br/>Other reviewers praise the character development in this series - there is very little that goes on.

2186,Russian Doll, I don't understand the high ratings,"The basic premise (repeatedly dying and coming back, meeting fellow ""looper"" etc) is somewhat reminiscent of the fantastic book ""Replay"" by Ken Grimwood, although with a shorter time span between death and resurrection.<br/><br/>The big difference is that in ""Russian Doll"" you don't really know much about the main character, that is delivered in tidbits during the course of the show, but by then you are three hours in, which is far too late.<br/><br/>The main problem is that I don't feel anything for Nadia and her New York hipster friends (one mandatory lesbian, one mandatory minority, add a generous dash of Jew by having them live in an old yeshiva).<br/><br/>I don't have to like the characters, some of the best characters are the ones you hate, but if I don't feel anything for them since I barely know anything about them, I don't care what happens to them. I could care less if Nadia is stuck in that time loop forever looking for her runaway cat.<br/><br/>The acting isn't very good, especially the main character. I haven't seen ""Orange is the New Black"", so I have no idea if Natasha Lyonne was any good in that show. I have seen her in other projects that she apparently has been in, but in that case she made zero impression on me. So I really only know her from Russian Doll, and I cringe every time she's on screen. ""Poseur"" is the best word I can think of. Which connects to my next point.<br/><br/>The show tries so unbelievably hard to be edgy (Excessive drug use! An orgy! Hee hee a strap-on dildo! Aren't we cool??) but the end result is that I feel embarrassed for the show for its lazy shorthand. I'm reminded of the Steve Buscemi in 30 Rock ""How do you do, fellow kids?"" meme.<br/><br/>The one positive thing I can say about the show is that the episodes are only half an hour long, and the season has only 8 episodes. If it had followed the usual Netflix formula with 10 one-hour long episodes per season there is no way I would have finished this show.

This leads me to believe there is most likely something fishy going on here in the ratings/reviews, as this show seems like it should be a 5-6 at best for the 'true' IMDB rating. If a good chunk of these ratings and reviews aren't fake / paid for / bots, color me mega-shocked at the sudden shift of the IMDB populace and its quintessential user's voice.<br/><br/>As for the show, the main character is unlikable, as are almost all the characters. Perhaps the psychologist mother-figure or the homeless man are the most human characters in the whole show, but even they are either too jarring, don't have enough redeeming qualities, or lack screen time to make a dent in the subpar ""mystery"" that is Russian Doll. The show is repetitive and gets boring quickly. I was waiting for a interesting twist, elevation of the stakes, or even issues that needed to be resolved that didn't feel so forced. None of those came, and it's safe to say I regret watching the whole series through. If this was created by some Netflix cookie-cutter / algorithmic process, they need to rethink their formulas.<br/><br/>I hope the rating mess is a one-off thing, and that IMDB ratings don't get taken over by marketing agencies and paid bots. This is a sad day for the users who rely on IMDB ratings for both suggestions and also as a filter for the sake of efficient media consumption.

2196,The Challenge, The best physical/political competition reality show on tv,"The Challenge has been an MTV staple for decades now. This show puts former reality show contestants (originally drawing from the Real World and Road Rules casts exclusively) against each other in physical challenges and/or puzzles, all while they are trapped living in a huge, amazing house. Alliances, politics, backstabbing, hookups, fights, and general drunkenness have also been known to ensue.<br/><br/>What separates The Challenge from other tv shows of similar nature is that contestants often return season to season, with some contestants having been on 10+ seasons. This allows storylines to continue across years. You might watch your favorite contestant rise from 'sweet rookie underdog'to 'multi season champion' to 'veteran bully'. Not only this, but the physical challenges (especially some of the eliminations and the Final challenge) are actually incredibly grueling and require those who really want a shot at winning to specially train year-round.<br/><br/>I was just an elementary schooler when The Challenge began, so I literally grew up watching some of these people and continue to into my late 20s. That's not to say you wont enjoy it if you jump right into the current season without te background experience- the current seasons have drawn lots of brand new contestants from UK reality shows which has introduced a whole new set of characters and a US vs UK dynamic which has totally ushered in a brand new era of the show.<br/><br/>The Challenge has it all- personable characters, ridiculous personalities, great athletes, high drama, endearing underdogs, malicious bullies, and a plethora of VERY attractive people.

2202,The Challenge, The Challenge Total Madness: Best twist they have ever had,"LIke all seasons of The Challenge, this one was nuts. Pretty much each season there are fights, hook ups and a brutal challenge. Most of the people on the show know each other personally and from other TV shows, so alot of the fightings comes from personal issues and not game ones. I believe the way these people behave on the show is how they are in real life. For the most recent season, they added the best twist they have ever had. In order to make it to the final you would have to put yourself into an elimination challenge and win. This caused the people who normally control the game (vets) to put themsleves in rather then the rookies, which always seems to occur. There were some iconic moments, particularly when Bananas took on Wes in an elimination challenge and when CT got eliminated by a rookie. I think if Cara Maria and Paulie were there, it would have brought more drama to this season and most likely Bananas wouldn't have won. My biggest problem with the season was when the producers pretty much made Dee a silent competitor after her controversial Black Lives Matter tweets. They even shortened an episode , which made no sense as a result of them. It was like she was there but she wasn't. I almost wish they would release the episodes the way they were meant to be seen as well as the edited ones that take Dee out of the competition. The final challenge as always was pretty brutal and was surprised it didn't go more then one episode. Overall it was an excellent season.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,17 August 2020

2204,The Challenge, An MTV Fixture,"""The Challenge"" originated when MTV wanted to capitalize on its ""Road Rules"" and ""Real World"" franchises and the numerous young celebrities those two shows had created. Stars from each of those shows were pitted against each other. Over the course of thirty-three seasons, so far, its producers have looked for ways to keep it fresh, mostly by varying the cast. Like ""Big Brother"" and ""Survivor"" and ""The Amazing Race"" and other reality contest shows, they have pitted various factions against one another.<br/><br/>As in the original ""Real World"", the contestants are mostly attractive alpha types. Those who have been successful on the show(s) have returned again and again, creating careers. This means some of them have had their egos stroked for years and they bring romantic and rivalry histories with them. This baggage fuels attractions and personal vendettas. These are real contests, but they are also soap operas.<br/><br/>You can expect grueling competitions, plenty of chest beating, and juvenile hookups and alliances. For a prize of $1 million, these twenty-somethings will do almost anything.<br/><br/>The best competitors display heart, intelligence, and physicality.<br/><br/>These shows often come with their own ""after shows"", where an in-studio host asks probing questions about each episode and they show behind-the-scenes footage.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,7.0,8 February 2019

2206,The Challenge, Best Reality Competition Show on TV,"I'll be honest - I don't watch a lot of reality TV. I don't exactly love screaming drunken fighting and drama. This show certainly has those elements, though they have toned down the drama in some more recent years.<br/><br/>The weekly challenges and elimination matches they do on this show are incredible, highly entertaining, and are hands down more intense and significantly better than any other reality competition show on TV. To add to it host TJ Lavin is awesome and whomever is responsible for the editing on the show is a hilarious genius. Great mixture of thrilling weekly events and comedic moments. I'm not kidding about how amazing the challenges are - they often require a mixture of cunning, strength, speed, endurance, and agility. Brawn certainly doesn't make a good Challenger, it also requires brains and a great deal of heart.<br/><br/>Another joy of this show that makes it unlike other reality competition shows is the repeat cast. If you watch enough seasons you will see the developing relationships between long time Challengers and see why the political and social aspects of the game work as they do. And, well, if your favorite gets eliminated there is a pretty good chance that you'll see them take another shot at it next season or the season after.<br/><br/>The game has evolved significantly over the years as viewership has aged and the contestants themselves have gotten better. Watching early seasons (1-15) seems like a completely different experience than the later seasons (16-36). The Challenges are significantly harder in the later seasons and the competitors are much more sly about their political and social games.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,6 January 2021
2207,The Challenge, Focusing on politics way too much,"I love the challenge, but the show has taken a serious hit in terms of entertainment factor.<br/><br/>It used to be that the challenges were super difficult, and the contestants were prepared to battle it out in order to win the grand prize. However, nearing the 30th season mark we started getting worse challenges, contestants refusing to compete and a bunch of 'politicking.'<br/><br/>The episode I just watched (season 36, episode 11) had a total of 22 minutes of actual challenge and 40 minutes of 'duplicitous scheming.' As well as that, it had a cliff-hanger ending which meant I didn't even get to see the elimination match.<br/><br/>It's a shame that the show has gone this way, but I guess it's a result of the times. Back in the days what people cared about most was the actual competitive nature of the show, but now, the show runners think the generation watching is more interested in the fake and overhyped drama, as opposed to the actual challenges that made the show a hit in the first place. This may be true since season after season they've focused on bland conversation (fake politics) way more than the actual challenge portion of the show. I hope they can get back to form soon.<br/><br/>Between the fake politics, contestants choosing not to actually compete and the poor standard of competitors they're getting on, I don't know how much longer I can last.

2208,The Challenge, This is the best reality television gets.,"The Challenge - Recommended by a friend during my time in high school I started watching the challenge as of late 2015. Similar to the survivor, and big brother, this show combines social game, and physical competition towards the crowned winner of one million dollars. Each season has different rules, and different ways the money gets split. Producers invite people who have been on other reality television shows. (recruiting focuses mainly on MTV, and big brother.)<br/><br/>I Really have no complaints. The amount of returning players combined with a vast majority of new. Mixed alcohol, loyalty, respect, broken friendships, romance, anything you can think of with thirty people sharing a house together. Drama gets wild.

2214,Eureka, One the most well-written shows in the history of sci-fi,"As a science-fiction fan, long time lover of B-grade fun and a playwright who loves the idea of a small town with big secrets -- this is right up my alley. The characters either make or break a show like this, and in this case, the actors and their characters bring the entire story up. For example, the kid math-savant, a tough female DOD agent, Henry the quasi-mechanic, the tough deputy Lupo and an all-American US Marshall, who is the normal guy and now the Sheriff of Eureka. There are others of course and I am hoping the show hangs on long enough to develop a following. The setting is perfect. The writer's foreshadowing worked like a charm. Many things I assume will be happening. As I was watching, I kept saying, where's the villain?? And at the end of the first episode, a sweet villain was revealed, and in such a way -- you had to go --- Whoa -- very nice. The actor playing Jack Carter was perfectly chosen to act as us in this strange little story. Briefly, a small town hosts the world's most shining minds as they experiment and tinker with science and it's up to the normal people to keep the brains on the right path. I am so looking forward to the next installment. My hats off to the creative team -- this is just what I needed. Let's all hope we don't lose this show in the most important early stages. Ratings are King and just because it's good doesn't mean it will last. So fan boys gravitate to this show on Tuesdays on the best channel on the planet -- sci-fi!!<br/><br/>Addition: Just saw the sixth episode. This is a show that keeps topping itself, introducing new and deeper sub-plots and literally has a dream cast. You will fall in love with Eureka.<br/><br/>Here we are at the third season and it has only gotten better and better. This season everything's been kicked up a notch, I cannot believe the storyline of Nathan. I stand in awe of the writers, and as always one of the best TV casts in history.<br/><br/>Fourth Season opener: While most shows hit a slump in their 4th outing, Eureka raises the bar.

2215,Eureka," Great humor, great premise, great cast","A delightful blend of humor and sci-fi, this is the kind of original programming SciFi channel is known for. Like the Stargate series and the late, lamented FarScape, the cast features a sardonic yet pragmatic hero with a little too much baggage, along with a cast of quirky geniuses, and a nefarious plot to steal top-secret military plans (are there any other kind?). The outstanding cast, featuring the wonderful Joe Morton and the under-appreciated Maury Chaikin, manages to bring energy and panache to what could have easily become formulaic. It's good to see Debra Farantino return to sci-fi as well (raise your hand if you miss ""Earth 2""). The premise offers endless variations on a theme, and the only foreseeable problems are a stereotypically heavy-handed military antagonist and a preponderance of absent-minded professor types. If the show can steer clear of overexposing these characters, or give them a twist or two, then Eureka is an excellent addition to SciFi's increasingly vivid and original programming.",114 out of 131 found this helpful.,9.0,20 July 2006
2216,Eureka, A nice place to visit,"Eureka is never going to be remembered as a ""classic"" or ""groundbreaking"" SF show. It could, however, be remembered as one of the more charming and offbeat SF shows to come along in a while. It is a bit slippery to classify, but my best description of ""Eureka"" is kind of ""Northern Exposure"" for SF fans.<br/><br/>""Eureka"" has thus far been family-friendly light adventure with its humor coming from the quirky nature of the brilliant scientist locals and the ""fish out of water"" experiences of new sheriff Jack Carter and his teenage daughter, Zoe.<br/><br/>Those tuning in to see traditional SF--where speculative fiction and profound ""what if"" moments rule the course of the show--will be disappointed. There won't be many serious examinations of the impact of new technologies here. The tech is secondary, actually tertiary. The odd characters are the focus of the show. Second to that is the weekly mystery. ""How can the tech-ignorant sheriff learn to work with the ample supply of local geniuses to save the day?"" Finally, comes the tech. And when tech is dealt with, it reminds me of vintage Geordi la Forge technobabble. I swear that someone was going to ""reverse the flow of the graviton emitters."" So, ""Eureka"" is not great SF. Nor is it great drama. Nor is it side-splitting comedy. It is instead an amiable and lightweight mix of the three. Eureka is not at all unlike ""Northern Exposure's"" Cicely, Alaska. It is a very pleasant place to visit once a week.",94 out of 111 found this helpful.,9.0,26 July 2006

You would think they could only go so far with this theme, but the writers are doing a great job of keeping it exciting and fresh so far. They have also added a great human element to the show, dealing with the sheriff and his relationship with his daughter, Zoe. And you gotta love his house!

2218,Eureka, Eureka! We've found a new hit show!,"LOL. I know. The title of this post is too cliché, but I couldn't resist. In any case, I found the pilot of ""Eureka"" to be totally refreshing. The makers of the show took issues and aspects of long standing science fiction, added a new twist and location, and a ton of humour, creating in the process a fun new show that both amuses and mystifies.<br/><br/>Personally, I enjoyed seeing science fiction elements that have been proved interesting, stimulating, and well liked in the past. Throughout it all, while not too much language was used that I consider far above my own understanding, it still gave me the impression of ""Hmmm... They know what they are talking about. Maybe some of this really is possible."" I love that about television shows.<br/><br/>Leaving behind the sci fi subject matter, I was also impressed with the acting within and writing of the show. The pilot showed a serious side, with veins of humour throughout. The acting showed great compatibility and believability of the characters. I found myself liking some characters and getting annoyed at others. I love being drawn into a show like that.<br/><br/>Although some things can be considered predictable, and indeed I guessed a number of things before they happened or were revealed, I was still held in suspense and laughing from beginning to end.

Eureka is very eccentric little town (they don't say what state), apparently designed as a haven for cutting edge, and eccentric, scientists. The characters are well drawn, so you find yourself caring what happens to them. It's a good combination of science fiction, and light humor.

This show actually allows you to think of the possibilities presenting interesting scientific ""what ifs"". However, it's great entertainment for various ages and IQs. I thought the characters were also introduced and developed quite nicely along with the story, something you don't see very often in many movies of this genre today, and so many of which, I can't get through the first half hour without feeling bored and changing the channel. This show will keep me coming back for more, if following episodes prove as interesting as this one. It does have a lot of promise. I like the way the main character brings the grounded ""regular guy"" comments and common sensibility to the show. Having worked around rocket scientists, they can send us into space, but you don't want them to drive your car. I agree with another reviewer, it does remind you of ""American Gothic"", because of the character development, sort of an ""American Gothic"" meets ""Star Trek Next Generation"". Hopefully, they will continue with this group of characters and not dilute it with a constant onslaught of new characters like ""Farscape"" - if you missed a few episodes, it was as though the entire cast changed.

The science fiction is well written and looks like it can be extended into reality someday. In my opinion that is what makes good sci fi. So much of what was written in the past has come true or is coming true in our lifetime. The special effects are well thought out and presented. The plots combine sci fi with humanity and the continuity from week to week is present but does not make the viewer feel that they are watching a soap opera and have to watch the next episode in order to find out what is going to happen.

2229,Eureka, Every little boy's dream,"I'm not big on leaving comments on IMDb, but I registered so I could leave this one. Eureka is a show no true geek or lovers of geek (or technology in general) should miss. That is my own personal view of course, but the show's humor, plot and interpersonal relationships are all tied in very well. I love watching the show for the suspenseful moments, and the ones that break out of the norm for a moment to show us something truly different. Time and space have been covered on Star Trek and other Sci Fi programs, but I'm a big fan of this show because it's all in current-day terms. The town of Eureka looks like a cozy mountain town (something I can relate to where I grew up) and has that ""just want to go home"" feeling to it.<br/><br/>Jack Carter (Played by Colin Ferguson) has an awesome house - guys like me get into things like that and can't wait until our dream home is built like this. His daughter Zoe (played by Jordan Hinson) reminds me of my sister - spunky and brash, but has a sweet and girlie side. Jack's friend, Henry Deacon (played by Joe Morton) is tough, dependable and a grounding icon to Jack. When Jack (who isn't from or has been around Eureka for long) thinks he's going nuts or gets spooked, Henry is there to back him up, even if the obscene is normal to him (and even when he's at the receiving end of a gun barrel). Jack's genuine attitude about his job, and his not-so-sure understanding of what's going on around him makes it fun to see how he's going to react next. Don't get me started on his deputy (played by Erica Cerra) Jo, who is a smart, sexy sidekick who is more than capable of putting Jack in his place when needed. Her sarcasm is rooted deep, but if you like that kind of personality, you'll love her presence.<br/><br/>I can't give this show as good a write up as it deserves - it has so many layers. I find myself going back to episodes I have on my DVR just to watch them again - the fascination of which I haven't had since the first Matrix movie hit the theatres.

It's watchable and although by season four it's gotten a little formulatic, there's enough fun twists to keep it interesting and fun..

The love of his life gets stolen, he spends a good chunk of his life alone, they bring her back, and then kill her off totally crushing Henry, and ruining his friendship with Jack. Then they throw a total stranger at him and say surprise, she's your wife. Henry plays the good guy and tries to work it out. When he starts to care about her, she learns the truth and puts the breaks on. He jumps through hoops and wins her back only to lose her. When she comes back, she's afraid of him. Again, he's the good guy and is patient and works it out only to watch her get arrested for being a spy. Seriously, what do the creators of this show have against Henry? He doesn't deserve all that heartache.
I enjoyed seeing Stan Lee and Wallace Shawn. I love that guy!",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,13 June 2020
2235,Eureka, Very Entertaining and Well Done Series,"Quite original, thoughtful, and well written series with a uniformly excellent cast. Each episode is a delight and the characters grow and develop as the series progresses. It is one of the more witty shows on television yet it also tackles some important issues as well. Cable television has become a haven for creative and talented people blocked from network expression due to the reality series craze. This is a perfect example of a creative work that has found a home on cable. Well-produced science fiction that doesn't take itself too seriously and still leaves the viewer with much to think about. It is interesting to see how important relationships are in this series and those are often much more important than plot and the sci-fi angle.",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,21 August 2007

2237,Eureka, outstanding,"An overall well rounded funny, gripping programme. I adore every episode and really looked forward to it being on. It had some amazing one liners that made me and my boy friend laugh so much. The best episode bar far had to be S.A.R.A.H, when the poor sheriff's house turned bad! I swear i will be forever using the word INVISIBLING from now on, its a classic little piece of English language, which lets face it, can only be used to its full comedic value in a room full of genius science people who are more than willing to point out any mistake. Im not usually one for this type of programme, but good god A Town Called Eureka is amazing! It takes an awful lot to keep me interested in television programmes, and this programme had it all for me.

2238,Eureka, This old treasure still worth a watch!!,"I am wildly late to this but I just discovered Eureka. Let me start with Colin Ferguson. WOW. This guy does not get enough credit!!! The acting, facial expressions and physical stunts/acting is incredible. I am now a huge fan of his. The dialogue in this show is great. It is interesting, fresh, funny and at times unpredictable. Additionally, the storyline is so sweet and fun. For me, the fact that every storyline is cleanly and satisfyingly wrapped up is, well, extremely satisfying. You do have to overlook some ""logic"" to fully appreciate this show - I don't think it is difficult or unreasonable as the premise of the show is meant to be quirky and sweet not ""technically accurate"". They do make sure you know that anything and everything Is possible in Eureka.
The last thing I want to point out is the entire cast really works together as a whole. Even the ""annoying"" characters are endearing in their own way and everyone pulls their weight.
Since this show is concluded I want to let you rest assured that it is not too late to enjoy this show. It wraps up in a wonderful and heartfelt way that leaves you feeling it was complete.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,10 July 2019

I related a lot to the characters because I'm from a small town in the south, and it makes me ""feel at home"" when I watch it. Also, I wish that my town was like Bluebell. They all come together as a family when needed most, and I wish I lived some where like that. I really, really wish they would do a season 5 so that I could find out what happens with Wade &amp; Zoe's baby, Lavon &amp; Lemons relationship, &amp; what happens with George &amp; Annabeth!!

I binge watched the first 3 seasons, and then it came down to season 4 and it wasn't on there. I searched high and low to find it, and finally found most of it on the CW's app. Please, please bring it back!

2241,Hart of Dixie, Hart of Dixie deserves a second season.,"Its detractors mostly fault it for what it's not- it's not your typical doctor-drama and it's not trying to portray a real-life surgeon. <br/><br/>If you judge the show on what it is trying to do- provide 40 minutes of heart-warming entertainment, then I think Rachel Bilson's nice-chick schtick and Lemon's bullying friendship along with great support from the rest of the cast, provides a nice alternative to practically every other TV programme out there.<br/><br/>I love that Hart of Dixie lets you take it with a pinch of salt. I like watching a medically oriented programme that doesn't recycle those ER clichés that every such show from Third Watch to Grey's Anatomy has to hobble through for the plot. 'Get the paddles! clear!', 'he's gone into v-tach', tacky-cardia. I mean gimme a break. I'm sorry but the fake blood, fake body parts, fake killing and murdering all have their place but if a show wants a lighter take on living, outside of Vegas, Miami and LA with fewer guns, more food, flirting, and dating and then what's not to like? I wish them many happy returns. <br/><br/>Hart of Dixie definitely deserves a second and third season as far as I'm concerned. I think the show has plenty of material to explore with relationships, farce &amp; fancy and the fish out of water element. I really hope it gets renewed.",101 out of 114 found this helpful.,9.0,9 March 2012
2242,Hart of Dixie, Sweet and charming show!!!,"I did not have any expectations or hopes for the show and to my surprise I was entertained and actually found the show charming. Some of the people in the story are very exaggerated and cliché like but in some strange way it is part of the charm. <br/><br/>I did not find the main character Zoe Hart very believable as a doctor but that really did not bother me as I found that the personal development of all the characters was more important and relevant to the story and that is part of the charm.<br/><br/>In the first 2-3 episodes, two characters (Wade and Lemon) stood out to me as very irritating until the story develops. Along the way the story starts to unwrap their past, the life they have been colored by and shows what character they really hold but also allows one to understand their behavior. As the story continues those two have slowly become my favorite and I just want to give them a hug, they deserve something good to find it's way to them.<br/><br/>This way of telling the story is central and easy as it grabs hold of once affection for those characters that live in this town and they grow on you. The town has this (Gilmore Girls) Stars Hollow feel to it with all its fun and strange traditions that without a doubt gives the show part of the charm<br/><br/>The acting varies very much depending on the actor but again it does not stands out as much as one might think. The stories are often very sweet and reveal the personalized twist of life.",48 out of 55 found this helpful.,8.0,1 February 2012
2243,Hart of Dixie, Good entertainment Value,"Let's get this out of the way: it's not a heavy drama, it's not realistic, it's a bit clichéd. But as a weekly viewing experience: it's lighthearted, fun, charming, entertaining and it works without having to try so hard.<br/><br/>Some characters might annoy some viewers (the southern belle character is pushed to its limits, Rachel Bilson as dizzy surgeon who has to spend 1 year as a general doctor in the middle of nowhere might work as a dizzy new yorker but not totally convince as a surgeon), but I think that the overall charm of the show makes it easy to look past this and enjoy oneself.<br/><br/>People should give this show a shot and see for themselves if they enjoy it or not.",64 out of 77 found this helpful.,8.0,29 October 2011
2244,Hart of Dixie, Love how the show and characters are evolving,"I love this show! All the characters are trying to find their way in life and often make mistakes due to their insecurities or conceptions of what they are supposed to be (Lemon tries to be the perfect southern belle, Zoe tries to live up to what she thinks her parents want her to be ). I love seeing the variety of ages going through life issues such as seeing Zoe finally realizes that her mom really did try to do what she thought was best for her but has errors in judgment. The scenes between Zoe and her father Ethan hart show his concern for her and insecurities about his place as her father . I love how Wade is always concerned about Zoe but is totally immature and can't admit he loves her. He works to keep up his front that he doesn't care because he is insecure about how people see him as second rate. It is fun and charming. Rachel Bilson is a great Zoe! She is funny and sensitive and a good person..and has her flaws it is ..refreshing. The heat wave episode was hilarious. The dynamic between wade and Zoe makes the show. I am tired of everyone blaming Zoe for ruining this and that..that is getting old. I hope the new shows in 2013 continue to evolve the richness of the characters along with the the humor and southern charm! I'd love to see more of AnnaBeth and see Wade realize his potential.",33 out of 38 found this helpful.,10.0,13 December 2012
2245,Hart of Dixie, Bluebell is the new Starshollow,"What do I expect from this kind of series? - That I come home after a long day and be able to relax, enjoy sometimes maybe a bit cliché story and laugh at the occasional jokes. Do I need a unique story that has never been told before and a superb acting from the protagonists? No. With that being said, Hart of Dixie is THE series for a rainy day. While for someone mediocre, it is better than the majority of soap operas currently on air. I enjoy the distinctive town of Bluebell very much, reminds me so much of Gilmore Girls' Starshollow! The setting has a rather specific atmosphere, feels like living in the 1950s sometimes. Plus, I have always been a fan of underdogs like Wade.

I think that Zoe has been set up for some great learning experiences. I can understand that there are some clichés within the show, but come on! which show doesn't have clichés in it these days? It is a television show and people who want to take it too seriously should go watch a documentary instead. I think that the clichés add to the show myself.

2249,Hart of Dixie, Best t.v. since Northern Exposure,"Simply put, absolutely charming. If you're not entertained, you may just have a heart of stone. Possibly the best thing on t.v. since Northern Exposure. This is the first I've seen of Rachel Bilson so I can't compare it to the other shows mentioned in other reviews. She admirably carries the heavy load, with tons of absolutely flawless supporting players. The simmering animosity between her and the quintessential Southern Belle, Lemon, is priceless. Jaime King as Lemon Breeland is absolute Southern perfection. She is the embodiment of Southern charm. Tough as nails, wickedly condescending, at times just plain mean. Then tragically vulnerable. You just want to hug the stuffing out of her!<br/><br/>Darn near flawless,I can't think of how to improve the show. Perhaps some gratuitous swimsuit scenes at the local swimming hole? Maybe have Doc Hart partake in some gator hunting? Maybe a zombie crossover with the Walking Dead!?",34 out of 45 found this helpful.,9.0,30 January 2012

Life is already way too stressful why add more. I've already binge watched it three times (my life is full of a little too much reality right now) and I like it more every time. I love the 'love triangle' aspect with the 'under dog' winning. I absolutely love the character Wade. He's deep and caring while coming off as a jerk (in the beginning) but he grows so much throughout the series and Zoe starting off as a New Yorker with a entitled attitude becoming more down home and happy. I have to give props to the person who did the soundtrack for this series. They picked all the perfect songs/music for everything.

2251,Hart of Dixie, Pleasant and watchable,It's nice to have a pleasant hour long comedy with light romance on TV where no one is really evil. There are too many crime shows. Josh Schwarz delivers tongue in cheek humor and a good likable cast. It's a Dr Quinn meets Sweet Home Alabama story and it's quite charming. Zoe moves from NYC to Bluebell Alabama to practice medicine. The culture differences do provide enough laughs.<br/><br/>Rachel Bilson is Rachel Bilson just like Audrey Hepburn was always Audrey Hepburn. She may not be that convincing as a doctor but who cares - she is likable and manages to carry a series. The series relies on the other cast members equally. Jaimie King is pretty and acts well as the high strung Southern Belle Lemon. The male leads Scott Porter and Wilson Bethel aren't that good looking but suit their roles and are convincing actors.<br/><br/>Overall pleasant and watchable - I'll keep watching and hope it lasts.,28 out of 37 found this helpful.,8.0,1 February 2012
2252,Hart of Dixie, Regional importance,"Good entertainment! I look forward to heading South once a week, where so many of my friends reside. The characters are delightful, the scenery lovely, and the small town values and foundations a good reminder to this Westerner. Southern charm with just the right amount of tension and complications of real life. A lot of people have collaborated well to make this a cohesive series. The actors are well-cast; believable. I'd enjoy seeing some 60-70 year old people in the cast, portrayed with more diversity, as the younger actors are. So far, dithering, alcoholic and dead are the characterizations in this demographic-my age bracket. We're far more than that! Perhaps in the seasons to follow I'll see this enrichment added. It's my hope that this series will not only continue, but that the writers will develop and deepen the essential premise of this terrific program. I believe that any television show that can open our nations' viewers to a wider portrayal of another region is valuable. References and responses to real events, such as Katrina, on this program, help unify us, by portraying our similarities country-wide. Hart of Dixie is already able to show our differences with humor and poignancy. Keep up the good work, and stay on the air. I look forward to continuing to follow this series.",35 out of 49 found this helpful.,10.0,3 November 2011

2254,Hart of Dixie, the only show I have watched twice!! The only show I have reviewed!!,"Hart of Dixi is the definition of ""feel good"" TV. I am all to quick to seek out big time drama but so glad I gave this a chance! It is light and is def a good escape at the end of a tough day. Very, June Clever-ish. The stereotypes are fun and you fall in love with each character as they develop more and more. The rumors of cancellation is my reason for reviewing... I would love to see the show live on! I find myself craving the ""mood"" of the show and have started to go for round 2! I am not one to watch a show twice but it's more than just the story-line that brings me back for more. In most series, the story-line is all that keeps me watching, and once that is over, so is my attention. Hart of Dixi will not overwhelm you with drama but has just enough to keep you hooked. It brings such a unique pleasure/mood, you are sure to fall in love with the town of Blue Bell :) I know my little review is nothing when it comes to the renewal of a show but hopefully, there are enough Hart of Dixi fans out there to speak up and encourage the show to live on!!",13 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,22 February 2015

They really need to tone her down. And to be honest, I don't think Rachel Bilson is all that great of an actress. She seems to have the same expression and reaction to everything that happens.

Very good story line. Zoe takes over her fathers practice after he passes away. She later learns he was her dad. Now she has to bring in 30% of the business to keep her job. So far she's been a great asset to the community although they don't know it yet. It almost looks like the same set used in Gilmore girls but set in Alabama.

2264,Young Justice," One of THE best DC cartoons of all time, in my opinion.","DC has always been well known for making fantastic children's cartoons that can be aimed for the hardcore adult fans as-well, bringing nothing but top-notch shows. However, in recent years, it seems that the quality of DC cartoons have dropped. The two main shows that come to mind are ""The Batman"", a terrible show which is clearly aimed at the younger audience, and ""Batman: The brave and bold"", A decent cartoon that isn't on par with classic DC cartoons. <br/><br/>However, this cartoon has brought back the best parts of the best DC cartoons and combined them into one. The ""Justice League"" series was fantastic, but as the series went on it was clear that each episode focused on the development of particular characters (Especially in JL: Unlimited) which did not have an ultimate affect in the series. episode was a one-off that usually didn't require viewing of the previous or next episode. Young Justice saw this, and tried to do something new. Firstly, it made sure that the team stays small, like the early days of the Justice League, so that it could make these characters actually important to the plot lines. Secondly, it made each episode a one-off adventure that tied to a single string plot that brought each episode together. JL and JL:U did this a few times, but Young Justice has a clear sense of what's happening in the plot, and what the characters are going through. THIS is why I love Young Justice: it knows what it is trying to do, and it makes you constantly want more.<br/><br/>The cartoon style is an updated version of the Justice League's animation style, which shows both seriousness in the tone of the storyline, and the professionalism of the series as a whole. Teen Titans was a 'fun' series, but it was difficult sometimes to accept the serious moments amidst the childish artwork. That's not so much a complaint of Teen Titans, but I appreciate what Young Justice is doing and I prefer it.<br/><br/>Voice work is fine, and the music works. Both are easily above par. I actually think EVERY voice is great, even Batman's (even though I am a die-hard Conroy fan, Bruce Greenwood gives a voice I would definitely expect from Batman). There is one exception, though: I was not impressed by the Joker's voice, or his character. I could see they were trying to make him more ""Sane"", but that doesn't work, as the character should be the definition of insanity. However, he only appears once, and the other actors are really good.<br/><br/>If you look at my other reviews, you can see that I often give good scores in my reviews. Let me clarify that I am not always giving full marks to what I like, but I prefer to review great shows/movies which I think deserve to be praised. This is definitely a show that deserves to be praised, and I hope the show goes on to be very successful. <br/><br/>Bottom line: Fantastic. I would recommend to anyone, not just DC fans.",119 out of 133 found this helpful.,10.0,15 February 2012
2265,Young Justice, DC - This is the Series We Needed and the One We Need Right Now!,"Everything fits perfectly in this magical series. These days, if a series shows quality, it is because it was taken seriously by high- ranked people. I love the tone, the characters, the plot-line, the themes, the secrets, the chemistry between many characters, the relationship between Justice League (mentors) and Young Justice (sidekicks), the way they make superheroes used to be forgettable now memorable, etc. I absolutely didn't care about Superboy, Speedy, Blue Beetle, etc., but now I really am interested and I think that is the strength of this show.<br/><br/>The only tiny, small and little complaint I have concerns the music. Actually, I love how it is played throughout each episode, but to make it truly epic, it needs a better introduction or a standout song just like ''The Batman'' (90s, ''Superman'' (90s) and both ''Justice League'' and ''Justice League Unlimited'' : Tananan! Tananan! Tananananan! ... Of course, it is only a personal opinion and it certainly does not diminish the quality of this show.<br/><br/>I have watched the entire ''Young Justice'' season 1 and everything that has aired of season 2 in the last four days and whaouh! I want more and more and more. Whe I started watching season 2, I was utterly surprised to see a 5 years jump from where season 1 left and CHUCK NORRIS or GOD was I pleased! It truly is an intelligent move because it allows to bring new young superheroes like Blue Beetle or Impulse, etc. I am 20 years old and this show certainly is for young teenagers and young adults and even adults. Many theme are for mature people, with life and death decisions.<br/><br/>I can't believe how great the animation is, almost as great as every single DC animated movie they release each year, last one being ''The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1''. I truly hope they'll continue this series for many years to come because it is AMAZINGLY AWESOME! This series take risks and it works just fine in my book. That is what keeps it fresh. However, I hope they stay focus on the main characters they developed in the first season, not making the same mistake of some episodes of ''Justice League Unlimited''.<br/><br/>I can only give it a minimum of 9.5/10, but IMDb approximates, so to me, it is a 10/10! If any of the designers see this review, I encourage your awesome work and make you know that you have my total admiration. I was searching for a good show and I found yours by total luck.

2266,Young Justice, Exceptional,"As always, DC's domination in the animation field exceeds all expectations. Young Justice is far superior to Justice League/Unlimited, Teen Titans and every other animated super hero series. To start off YJ's animation is much higher in quality then the other shows not to mention far more detailed. The action sequences are also more realistic and enjoyable. The show is also better scripted than past DC shows as well as more mature in themes and dialogue. Watching just one episode you can't know what's going on, the long story arcs make it more consistent as well as entertaining. The show also focuses on the main characters which gives it more intensity and depth. You may not relate to all the characters but you do connect with them as the voice actors give amazing performances. All in all this action packed, emotional show will not disappoint, and will definitely keep you hooked until the end. I'd say many would agree that Young Justice is the best DC Animated Series since Batman TAS. Glad the show was popular enough for renewal",40 out of 45 found this helpful.,10.0,27 July 2018
2267,Young Justice, Second season picks up fast,"I've seen a couple of reviews that say the jump between the second season and the first is a huge mistake, and initially I would agree with those reviews. The team from the first season was the one I knew and loved, and for the first couple episodes, the decision seems to be a mistake. However, as they have fleshed out this seasons story line and developed these new characters, I have liked the series more and more. Impulse and Blue Beetle have turned into some of my favorite characters, and the plot twists throughout this season have been absolutely incredible. I know it might be hard to jump into the first few episodes of the second season, but if you give it a chance, you will enjoy it just as much of the first.",44 out of 51 found this helpful.,9.0,6 October 2012
2268,Young Justice, DC got it right,"DC Universe finally got it right with this series; this is one animated series that I look forward to seeing the next episode. This is a more advanced and updated version of the comic book which I like a lot, and allowing the youngsters to go on covert missions learning how to be a team as they stumble through how to be heroes is a real watchable and enjoyable delight. Hopefully they won't stray too far from the storyline that they've set and allow us to see the progression of the cloned Super-Man Connor as well as Speedy or the Red Arrow, which will make this one of the best superhero action series since Super-Man and Batman. I think this will give other animators something to think about and will definitely put DC in the upper echelon rivaling the new Marvel series (TAWMH), keep up the good work.",56 out of 67 found this helpful.,10.0,20 July 2011

2271,Young Justice, Better than Teen Titans,"This series has most of my favorite DC Comics characters whether it be from Young Justice or the Justice League. The show unlike Teen Titans' TV-Y7 rating is rated TV-PG which promises more mature themes and better action sequences. My favorite Young Justice member is Robin followed By Speedy. Robin is my favorite member because I'm a huge fan of the superheroes that Batman regularly teams up with and the super villains that he regularly fights. Not just the storyline is better than Teen Titans, so is the animation. The animation reminds me of the straight to DVD PG-13 movie Justice League: Crisis On Two Earths. The action, the comedy, the characters, and the animation are all top-notch.",80 out of 107 found this helpful.,10.0,29 December 2010
2272,Young Justice, 'Independence Day' or 'All we want to do is save the world!',"There has been no lack of series about the young, troubled, and super-powered set. Arguably, the very concept of the super-hero genre has been called a teen power fantasy. The hero IS the teenager, striking out at the world, righting wrongs in a way a kid never could.<br/><br/>And I can see that. I can also see the implications of that notion. Because teens are sometimes scared of themselves. Scared of the new thoughts and feelings they have, the older they get. Scared of the changes in how they perceive themselves and how they see the world.<br/><br/>Why, even Robin has days when Batman seems like a weird control freak rather than the beloved mentor who keeps Gotham City safe! There comes a time when a young super-hero wants to venture out with his peers.<br/><br/>This is the core premise behind Young Justice, the latest series based on DC Comics' vast and rich mythos of super-heroes. Heading the series is Greg Weisman, perhaps best known for his work on the cult classic Disney series ""Gargoyles"" and the highly popular ""Spectacular Spider-Man"" animated series.<br/><br/>His strengths are character development, intelligent and complex villains, and world-building. We get quite a lot of each in the first episode.<br/><br/>The partners (do NOT call them ""sidekicks"") of the sixteen-member strong Justice League are getting ready to take their first step into, well, the Big League. Access to the Hall of Justice. Participation in the missions that save the World, the Universe, All of Reality, etc.<br/><br/>But when the League does get an alert, they're left to pose for tourists and stay put. How infuriating.<br/><br/>Why, it's almost enough to make them want to sneak out and investigate a mysterious fire at a top secret genetic research facility! Which they doonly to find that someone's after-school science project involves cloning the most powerful hero on Earth, and transforming him into a loyal, brainwashed slave. My, my, my The banter is crisp and funny, ranging from Robin's pondering on why people are always being over or underwhelmed, yet one never hears about someone just being ""whelmed"", to the classic bit about confusing codenames: Bystander #1: ""Hey, look. It's Speedy!"" Bystander #2: ""Oh. Is he the Flash's sidekick?"" Bystander #1: ""No, he's Green Arrow's."" Bystander #2: ""*well, that makes NO sense at ALL."" Most of the episode sets up the cast dynamic. Speedy is the hot-headed rebel. So rebellious, in fact, that he storms off in a rage a mere eight minutes into the episode. Robin is the tech geek. Kid Flash is the plucky comedy relief . Aqualad is the calm, natural leader who always finds his center, despite increasing misgivings about the world and his place in it. And Superboy is the freshly-minted son Superman never knew he hadmuch to each other's mutual confusion and anger.<br/><br/>I loved the usage of obscure characters from the DC mythos, such as Blockbuster, the Golden Guardian and Dubbilex the DNAlien. I loved the twist about the true goals of the eerie creatures being created by the Big Bads.<br/><br/>The Big Bads themselves, an ominous unseen council of ominous known as ""The Light"" managed to seem creepy and smart rather than cliché and trite. Always a plus.<br/><br/>If I have a complaint about the pilot, it's that the female members of them team were either absent entirely (Artemis won't join until episode six) or only made a cameo in the coda (Miss Martian, the sweet-natured niece of J'Onn J'Onzz, Manhunter From Mars). Hopefully they'll be given a prominent role in the actual series.<br/><br/>All in all an exciting, witty, satisfying pilot. The scope of the series looks ambitious, the animation budget seems to be sky high, and the young heroes are now basically the Black Ops branch of the Justice League! That's a notion as disturbing as it is awesome. I'm sure the moral ambiguity will be addressed.<br/><br/>Count me in for the regular series, coming out January of next year.<br/><br/>(Originally appeared at http://fourthdayuniverse.com/reports/ )",41 out of 56 found this helpful.,8.0,27 November 2010
2273,Young Justice, Young Justice is the follow-up to the DC-Animated-Universe we all deserved.,"Don't confuse this show with Teen Titans or anything like that; yes there are adolescent teens in this show discovering their potential like many other great kids shows on the market, like Avatar, Steven Universe, Adventure Time, DragonBall, The Legend of Korra and so-forth, but Young Justice is like a spiritual sequel to the Justice League &amp; Justice League Unlimited cartoons from the 2000s and more. This cartoon is super kick-ass stuff! 
It's what superhero shows like Ultimate Spider-Man WANT to be, but struggle to find the right balance between entertainment and broadly appealing wisdom that kids and adults can enjoy in the same way. Young Justice masters that: it's got solid drama, nice splashes of humor throughout and of course some great action that shows this great team working some difficult stuff out.<br/><br/>This superhero fest gets 4.5/5 stars.",15 out of 19 found this helpful.,9.0,16 July 2018

Fortunately, it surpassed all my expectations, following the same tradition of other mature and well made animations inspired in DC comics, like the ""Batman"", ""Superman"" and ""Justice League"" series from the nineties.<br/><br/>""Young Justice"" had a great script in every episode, is funny to watch, has likable and interesting characters, and also has a great animation with pretty cool designs, which combine modern and classic elements, with excellent results.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a flawless series which I would recommend to anyone.<br/><br/>10/10 (And I would give this 11 stars if I could)",19 out of 26 found this helpful.,10.0,22 December 2012

Making a logical and good story with so many super heroes is really difficult and they did it so nicely. Its amazing, really great. Only one character is somehow not fitted for long run (for me) that's ""Impulse."" He came from future to change it, he succeed but did not succeed and stayed in present. That's not working for me. He should not be stayed more than 2 or 3 episodes. Other than that show is awesome. Must watch the show. It keeps telling me to write more and more lines but i have said enough.

2276,Young Justice, I can't watch this show anymore 2019,"I loved season 1 and 2. But it has been a decline since that time, why would you be asking ? Is it because plot ? The plot has remained almost the same, they are trying to take a new approach being ''more mature'' and I don't dislike it, but I don't like it that much either. It is in the subplot and political correctness where this show fails miserably to me. The subplots are cliche and not well thought, the most interesting characters like Forager have been completely wasted and left as comedic relief. Black Lighting's relation with Virgil has been completely wasted, so has been Virgil, and as a fan of the 2000 Static Shock character it pains me to see Static so underrepresented in this show. He has absolutely nothing special here, nor any reminiscence of what he was in the comics not the old cartoon, he is not inspiring, nor a hero, he is just a guy with super powers. And that's been a problem with most of the show third season, most of the new adds to the undercover super hero team, or the original team, have been pretty much just for the lolz, oh look this young super hero is now inside here, nothing to make them special, they are just secret agents, no more, no less.<br/><br/>Now to the main dish, the political correctness. I have no problem with homosexual relationships, there are quite a few that I like in cartoon shows, for example, Jeff's two mothers in Clarence, THAT'S how you represent a non binary relationship. They were loving, they were caring, BUT THEY HAD DEFECTS. All relationships, have defects, even if you like someone from your own gender, that will not exempt you from being HUMAN. The girl who worked in a retail store on the other side of my street just had a break up with her spouse over their life choices, one was a trucker the other an employee in the store and pretty much never saw each other, there were also suspicious of infidelity etc. Being homosexual, doesn't make you perfect, doesn't make you an untouchable being incapable of doing no wrong, YOU ARE SILL HUMAN. But many shows in doing the homosexual couple for representation only forgets this, they show a loving caring couple with nothing wrong on it, just for the sake of it. That's it, nothing more. I also hate when they change a character's sexuality for representation, which DC does a lot, see Alan Scott, Maxima, etc. In this case Kaldur Ahm, and no, he is not bisexual in the comics, you are thinking of Jackson Hyde, who looks like Kaldur from the show. But you know what ? They could have made this through by adding spice over their relationship, making it a grief relationship where they got together to get over the pain of Tula's death, they could have been showed struggling with this, is their relationship real ? or are they just trying to ease a common pain ? But nooooo, that would make it interesting, we can't have that in PC representation for the sake of representation.<br/><br/>But no, it's not the over representation for the sake of representation what ticks me off in this show. NO. You see in one episode, when Superboy said '' We have to know what the other side is saying of us '' or something along those lines, I actually had hopes on the show, I thought ' ok, this guys are saying, we're leftist PC, BUT that doesn't mean we're not open to dialogue, we will hear your point of view '', it should've been a red flag that they did this on an obvious parody of Fox News, but Superboy's phrase gave me hope. After Nevermore, that hope is completely destroyed.<br/><br/>Luthor says this is fake news ! Ever heard of that before ? I'm not a Trump fan, I've criticized many aspects of his administration. But if you are telling me, that his fake news thing is fake, when I can google his full quotes and see how CNN and many others completely take him out of context and even go as far as lie about the intention of what he is saying , then we have a problem, furthermore, this is beyond of being right or left, this is having a political bias against someone, this is not saying '' I disagree with you on this policy '', this is just blatant '' Orange man bad ! ''. This is partisanism at it's finest. Are you really telling me, after what the news have been doing, after they threatening people over memes, they are the good guys ? Or that there is no chance the media lies ? What happened to that of hearing what the other side says ?<br/><br/>I can't watch this show anymore. It has become a cliche PC propaganda.

Great new characters, awesome action sequences, and a cool new storyline, or so I thought. I sadly went in with high hopes, but quickly fell hard after I found out they went political. Their plot that they quickly and randomly put in turned me off the show just as quick.

2279,Young Justice," First two seasons are best DC has to offer, but season 3 is just uhh","The first two seasons of this show are amazing. The best DC has to offer, it gives us in depth characters and story. The first season is God's with getting all these side not wanting to be known as side but as their own people. It lets you connect to the heroes it also shows them grow as a team. With them being kids having crushes, or dealing with school or even with their parents.<br/><br/>Season 2 takes things on a whole new level. With a five year tone jump, now seeing new heroes. And heroes we loved from the first season grown up. Suck as Dick Grayson, who is nightwing. It also gives us Aqualad who is now evil, and Wally and Artemis retried. And Connor and Megan not together anymore. And our new heroes are Blue Beetle, Impulse, wondergirl, batgirl and etc. This season is crazier with villains such as the reach, Mongul, and of course the light. With season we see our heroes undercover and keep secrets from other team members. It is an Insane and intense fun season.<br/><br/>Season 3, after six years of no young justice we finally got a new season. This season takes place two years later. With the major issue being meta human trafficking. It also includes new characters like Geo Force, Halo, Cyborg and etc.<br/><br/>All in all this series is great, but season 3 is alright. The story seems to be all over the place and it has a little too much political stuff in it. It's not as in depth with its stories and it feels the team aren't as connected. With some episodes not really having villains or only half the episode being about them on a mission. I'm at watching the show but this season is not the same.

Season two brings a host of cool ideas and relationships as well. The interaction between the characters and the stories are all a breath of fresh air. Especially for a show really for kids. However, it came out when I was in my late 20's. And growing up with Batman the Animated series and Superman the Animated series I was no stranger to good animation and cool story lines. And Young Justice does not disappoint in the slightest way. Every aspect of the show gets a 10/10. The stories, the characters, the action, the animation... all top notch.

2284,Young Justice," One of Cartoon Network's best shows in recent years, not perfect but terrific all the same","Not quite among Cartoon Network's all-time best shows(Dexter's Laboratory, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Johnny Bravo, Powerpuff Girls, Cow and Chicken). But in recent years, alongside Regular Show, Adventure Time and the first three Ben 10 series- Omniverse is a huge disappointment- it is one of their better shows in recent years, The Amazing World of Gumball is also mostly great apart from some weak writing early on. Young Justice isn't quite perfect, the season 2 finale does feel too convenient and incomplete and not all the voice acting was quite there; Brent Spiner is nowhere near sinister or insane enough as Joker, too restrained, Kevin Michael Richardson is over-parted and all his characters sound exactly the same(Mal Duncan is the worst case), and while Nolan North has times where he is right on the money at others he is not powerful or heroic enough as Superman.<br/><br/>The rest of the voice acting though is fabulous, all the Young Justice team are voiced with depth and a great dynamic. Even if Jesse McCartney does start off a tad too lightweight for Nightwing he does mature, as Robin and Dick Grayson he is spot on. Bruce Greenwood is pitch-perfect as Batman, he doesn't erase memories of Kevin Conroy but is suitably dark and brooding. There are no complaints to be made of Vanessa Marshall and Maggie Q as Black Canary and Wonder Woman, and Phil LaMarr is a good Aquaman. For the villain roles, Miguel Ferrer, Oded Ferr, Mark Rolston, Keith Szarabajka, Danny Trejo and Arnold Vosloo are particularly good, though all except for Joker are good. The secondary characters are memorable, the likes of Phil LaMarr, Tara Strong, Edward Asner, Crispin Freeman, Jeff Bennett Geoff Pierson and Cree Summer are without fault. G. Gordon Godfrey is annoying in a way and the only character who isn't (intentionally) likable, but Tim Curry voices with such adept smarmy drollness and sinks his teeth into Godfrey's monologues.<br/><br/>But it's not just the voice acting that makes up and comes across strongly in Young Justice. The animation is great here, somewhat anime in look but colourful, detailed and atmospheric, when it calls for it to have a serious approach- and there are numerous cases of that- it does so very effectively without being overly so. The fluidity of the backgrounds and character movements and how dynamically the colours and shadings are used are to much admired. The music has a feel and orchestration that suits the tone perfectly without making too serious or upbeat, with some beautiful and haunting moments. There's nothing cheesy or forgettable about the theme tune either(unlike other Cartoon Network shows like Ben 10: Omniverse and Johnny Test, how is that show still airing?) <br/><br/>From a writing and narrative standpoint, Young Justice also scores. The dialogue is very thought-provoking and intelligently written, doing a great job at giving the characters depth and complexity and also with an ability to provide emotional depth and a some subtle humour. The story lines are always compelling and succeeds in drawing us into the world the characters live in, there is great atmosphere and the action is exciting and well-animated. It is true that narratively the first season is better than the second, the second season was still interesting and well done on the most part if not quite as well-developed and focused in tone. The characters really make the show work, Robin and Speedy stand out in the Young Justice team though all of them have likable and resourceful personalities. Batman, Black Canary, Wonder Woman and Aquaman come off best in the Justice League, and you even root for the fun and charismatic villains especially Vandal Savage and Ras'Al Ghul.<br/><br/>All in all, a terrific show and it is a shame that it was cancelled- maybe its erratic scheduling got the better of it- because it did have potential to have more and the ending of season 2 did suggest that somewhat. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox",10 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,17 August 2013

While some fans criticize the five year time skip i believe it was necessary. Robin's transference to Nightwing, Zatanna, and Rocket coming in the league Kaldur going undercover in black manta's organization. All these changes are keeping the plot exciting , and interesting to watch. The show is currently on hiatus, but i cant wait till it comes back again in September.

2288,Young Justice, A great show that I would highly recommend to anyone,"WARNING FOR SPOILERS!!<br/><br/>Just watched this show from episodes 1-18 and can I just say that I loved it! As a kid I would have watched Batman, Batman Beyond, Justice League, Justice League Unlimited, Teen Titans and can I just say that this show beats something like Teen Titans hands down.<br/><br/>The animation and art style is similar to Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths. The series focuses on the sidekicks of comic book legends like Superman, Batman, The Flash and many others.<br/><br/>For the beginning of the series we are introduced to four characters of the soon to be arranged team, Robin, Superboy, Kid Flash and Aqualad, Speedy does make an appearance in the first episode for only a short time. I was actually surprised with some of the character changes, like Drake Grayson replacing Tim Drake and Wally replacing Bart and some of the other changes. What gives this show a plus is that it focuses on each member, including future members like Artemis and Miss Martian and how they work on becoming a team, it also shows that even though your a hero's side kick or in Superboy's case, clone, that they, themselves are developing and trying to get through some personal things as well as learning how to work together and on who to trust.<br/><br/>there are also some relationships and turmoil within the group, Aqualad the leader, is sometimes unsure on whether he should be leader or not and waits for Robin to mature so that he could handover command, Superboy at first seems to be going through some issues with his ""father"", he and Miss Martian start forming a relationship and like every couple go through some bumps on the road as well as maintaining their work. KidFlash is comic relief although he shows to not be totally useless since he has a good amount of scientific knowledge and seems to have a soft spot for Artemis while the latter seems to have a secret that she does not want everyone else knowing and the only ones that seem to know are the older members, Speedy (Now known as Red Arrow) and Robin seems to know.<br/><br/>There are Cameo appearances by the senior members of the Justice League, as well as Barbra Gordan, Zatanna, Garth, Tula, etc.<br/><br/>However I have only watched up to episode 18 but so far I am enjoying it and would recommend anyone who has seen previous DC Television shows or read the comics to give this show a go.",12 out of 18 found this helpful.,8.0,1 February 2012

The story line and the actors and everything about this show is brilliant. I was hooked 5 minutes into episode1!! There's never a boring moment. Love the mix of comedy and action and romance. I also like that each episode is well over an hour long. Easily rated 10/10!!!,197 out of 206 found this helpful.,10.0,13 February 2020
2292,Crash Landing on You, So good I want to cry,"What makes this KD different from other KDs?
1. They used older actors which IMO are better in acting. Hyun Bin &amp; Son Ye Jin are definitely the best choice for RJH &amp; YSR character. The chemistry are inevitable!
2. The story is flawless and not boring. There's a speck of love story, comedy, and action in one KD. What not to love?
3. Beautiful sceneries. Omo.

Anywhere from little hints to Looks of shuttle love gets me on the edge of my seat, but it's his emotions that make it so heartbreaking. He really brings so much emotional acting to the scenes and I should have known watching memories of the Alhambra. But, this has definitely got me hooked. Everyone wants a knight and shining armor with an edge. Korean dramas are much more on spot compared to many and I have to say the writers went where the love and mystery meet...where no one can go.

These charms are combined with the longing for reunification that handles both North and South Koreans with love and respect. And both leads are at their most beautiful and talented.

You kept watching laughing, smiling, picking your pillow and crying whole boxed of tissues in one episode. Probably one drama like this in ten years time.

2300,Crash Landing on You, Currently watching it a second time and here's why ...,"For a KD to portray and pull off the North Korean culture and dialect deserves an award in itself. So many dramas fail to capture the depiction of North Korea in the positive sense of things, but this KD does everything in its power to show both the good and bad side of the country including the value of belonging in a community. The character development of both leads and supporting cast was also incredible to watch given no one outshone one another, and each character (whether their part was big or small) had an equal opportunity to tell their life story. Moreover, to unite the two Koreas by plotting a developing romance between two people with completely opposite lives and mantra was a genius idea. The energy and undeniable chemistry you felt from the screen b/w the two leads is honestly unmatched, and the fact that I cried in almost every episode goes to show how big of an impact most of the scenes had on me to feel the way I did.",54 out of 58 found this helpful.,10.0,14 March 2020

2302,Crash Landing on You, Will touch the deepest part of your soul!,"""Even if it breaks my heart because it's a dream that can't come true, I'd like to sincerely dream of the future.""<br/><br/>I finished this Drama an hour ago and I am still just sitting here, not knowing what to do,...or to write, for that matter.
I am floored. My heart aches. I am happy and sad and amazed and grateful to have been able to watch this masterpiece. I honestly don't know where to begin. My heart is so full.<br/><br/>""Crash Landing On You"" is a master class in screenwriting. The pacing, the revelations through flashbacks and unlinear storytelling, the perfect balance between tragedy, romance and humor,...and God, the characters!<br/><br/>How is it possible to make each and every character of such a big ensemble so complex, relatable and loveable? I was so attached to every single character, that at some point I basically cried through entire episodes, because even when there were happy scenes, I kept thinking that things would probably not stay like that for all my poor babies. At any given time, while watching CLOY, I just had to think of the whole South Korea - North Korea predicament that they are all in and the tears started flowing.<br/><br/>The scenes between Jung Hyuk and Se Ri are so raw and real that I often cried, as well. They say crying doesn't necessarily mean you're sad, it just means you are overwhelmed with emotion - no matter which emotion. And that's exactly how I felt. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when it was sad, romantic and funny.<br/><br/>I cried buckets and buckets of tears but I also laughed so hard that my stomach was sore the next day. There are so many funny moments in both, North and South Korea, but I think my favorite was Se Ri's department store opening. I almost died laughing.<br/><br/>As an aspiring screenwriter and filmmaker, I am deeply humbled by the masterful stroytelling and breathtaking cinematography. There are so many gorgeous settings, such as all the snow scenes, the night of the train break-down and all the scenes in Switzerland.<br/><br/>I am Swiss and I've never seen Switzerland portrayed so beautifully. It made me fall in love with my own country, again. It was strange to see the tram I take every week in a K-Drama. It was strange to see the place I spent vacations as a child. It was strange to see the sights I walk past every day, and have them shown in a new light, looking at them through the eyes of these characters to whom Switzerland represents happiness and their own little paradise. Somehow, seeing some of these incredibly emotional scenes against the Swiss backdrop, made them even more emotional for me.<br/><br/>I can't mention the Switzerland scenes without mentioning how perfect the OST is, especially ""The Song For My Brother"", ""Flower"", ""Sunset, ""Here I Am Again"", ""The Hill of Yearning"" and ""Photo of My Mind"", which are the perfect musical expression of the Drama's atmosphere and emotions.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the acting is brilliant! I've loved Hyun Bin ever since ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and his on-screen chemistry with Son Ye Jin is out of this world. I am also very happy to have been introduced to Kim Jung Hyun, Lee Shin Young and Seo Ji Hye through this Drama.<br/><br/>This drama touched the deepest parts of my soul and will forever stay with me!",41 out of 44 found this helpful.,10.0,29 February 2020

2305,Crash Landing on You, My First K-Drama - Excellent - Beautiful - Can't get over it - Must Watch,"Where was I till now? Why didn't I ever try any Korean Drama? Why didn't I know about Hyun Bin?
This is my first ever K-Drama and I'll be honest here. I loved it. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, and an excellent series. Everything is amazing - Story, Main Leads, Their Chemistry, Acting, Thrill, Action Sequence, Star Cast, Background Score, Music. I completed this series in 3 days and I am suffering from Post Drama Syndrome now. I can't get over it. After completing this series, like everyone else, I am searching everything about CLOY on YouTube, Google.<br/><br/>This is such a series which will never leave you. No matter how hard you'll try you can't forget it. You'll fall in love with all the characters, be it Captain Ri Jung Hyuk, Yoon Se ri, Gu Seung joon or Park Kwang beom. They all justified their characters and got immense love from viewers. You'll cry with them, laugh with them and start feeling their pain &amp; emotions.<br/><br/>And what to say about Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin chemistry. It's magical. You'll start rooting for them. Hyun Bin was Rustic and Rough in NK but Classic and Dashing in SK. He can be tough and cute at the same time. He totally nailed his role and I read that he learned Piano for this role. Son Ye Jin was a great choice for the role of Yoon Se Ri. She played her role as a helpless SK Woman in NK and a strong, confident businesswoman in SK. I especially loved her character development.<br/><br/>I have fallen in love with CLOY. And I am definitely going to watch other K-Dramas now. And this is my first ever review on IMDb. I created my account on IMDb to let South Korean people know that I have fallen in love with your country, your culture, your actors, and film industry. Lots of love from India! This series made me feel like visiting South Korea and having some friends from that land in my life :) Lots of love!",21 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,26 April 2020
2306,Crash Landing on You, Crash Landing on My Heart.,"""If you give up on waiting, the pain of loss will kill you. That's why I wait."" -Captain Ri.<br/><br/>Most people who have watched the entire series, love CLOY, which is one of KDrama's finest series, for some of the following points:<br/><br/>1. The writer, Park Ji-eun, who also gave us ""You Who Came from the Star"" is one of the best, knowing how to balance drama, comedy, themes, and closure while keeping her audience intrigued and in love with her characters. The director, Lee Jeong-hyo, who has worked on many series and movies, kept everything focused and carefully paced so that the series steadily evolved each week.<br/><br/>2. The cast is one of the best I've seen with immensely beautiful and talented leads, warm, hilarious village ajummas, and Capt. Ri's delightful squad, dubbed ""the ducklings""-all of whom became a family for one another and for the viewers.<br/><br/>3. Themes varying from the pain of losing family, being abandoned and becoming a street orphan all the way to the belief in a Zen appreciation for patience and waiting, also kindness, protection, sacrifice, and unconditional love. The themes drive the plot, and the cast brought everything to life, making us impatient for each weekend to finally roll around so we can see what happens next to our beloved characters, whether love, laughter, danger and heartbreak, we got on that train with them.<br/><br/>4. A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekick-and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty, making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time.<br/><br/>5. The touching, beautiful OST, which many fans have downloaded. The piano piece ""Song for My Brother"" leaves me in tears every time.<br/><br/>6. A wealthy, beautiful but hurt woman who learns to love herself as well as others, who can be hilarious and sassy, yet who finds strength in loving and protecting the most amazing man-Capt. Ri.<br/><br/>7. A beautiful man, a pianist who becomes an army officer, a quiet philosopher and tomato plant caretaker with a ""low voice""-the kindest man I believe I've ever seen in any narrative-who adores the hurt woman, knows who she is, finds her, protects her, and loves her no matter what evil, what danger threatens them. Yes, he sounds too good to be true. . . . .but he's not. The whole world is in love with Capt. Ri because Hyun Bin developed him and made us believe that such a man can exist.",31 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,16 February 2020
2307,Crash Landing on You, A show that stay with you for a long time.,"I finished watching this show two days ago, and I just can't get it our of my head. It feels like I have a broken heart. So I had to make an IMDB account in order to write a review to this surprisingly impressionable show. Maybe it will help my grieving process.<br/><br/>The show is well balanced, and takes you through a huge reservoir of emotions. I've cried and laugh, felt fear and joy. At the beginning I wasn't all that sure. In the first episodes I thought the story seemed to predictable, and at times whimsical. But boy was I wrong. After two episodes I couldn't stop watching. I finished the entire series in three days.<br/><br/>The main characters have captivating stories, and the actors are able to portray thoughts and emotions in a superb manner. Even though I couldn't understand the language, I felt like I could.<br/><br/>The script is well written. There is no unnecessary dialogue, the character say what is needed. And nothing is over explained. The main plot has many layers, and I catch myself thinking back at different moments in the storyline more than once during the day. The side stories give you a glimpse of the lives of ordinary people in a country far different from my own. Even the seemingly dim neighbors get a special place in your heart. The acting is superb. The mimic of some of the supporting actors seem a bit dramatic at first, but somehow it just fits. Everything feels natural, something that is often lacking in Hollywood productions. The main cast are able to give us a nuanced portrait of human emotions.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop here. All I wanted to say was: WATCH IT.",19 out of 20 found this helpful.,10.0,7 May 2020

The 4 main characters are perfect in their roles, and the supporting actors were great! I love the build up from the first episode all the way to the end. It has cute interactions as well as heartbreaking ones, and just an overall enjoyable drama in Korean. I started watching other Korean tv shows but none of them are as well made as this one, I highly recommend this if it's your first time watching korean drama and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!<br/><br/>The story is about a South Korean smart lady boss who happens to come from a wealthy family and meets a North Korean soldier after accidentally being swept away in a hurricane. Both actors were great in their roles, although I find the female actor Son ye jin a better actor, the male actor Hyun Bin is quite handsome and cute in his role. The supporting actors are all quite good and thought the director did a good job - especially with the build up of the story.

Trying to play off the success of Marvel's Luke Cage, black lightning falls short at every turn. It wants to be a drama, it wants to be action, it wants to be a super hero show, but it isn't any of that. It's just loud noise throwing every black social issue at you possible. I am a black man and I felt this was just too much all at once. How it has lasted 3 seasons baffles me. Maybe the cw needs to have a ""black"" show since every other show barely has us on it, but this shouldn't be what they go with.<br/><br/>You can tell how bad they even think this show is because they didn't include him in their week long crossover event until his third season (tho he didn't get an entire episode for his show) yet batwoman did in her first season.

With the high production values of Black Panther, and Luke Cage before it (I preferred Luke Cage actually), I was hoping for more of the same with Black Lightning. Instead, I tried to be loyal because at least I am represented as a black person on screen. But I didn't like the characters. Some were just jarring.

I know it's only one episode in but the characters have no depth or personality at all so far (including Mr Black Lightning himself). James Remar, who is usually a fantastic actor, even looked bad in this. Maybe it's the direction or maybe it's the writing.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes... maybe they need to use some camera trickery to speed things up because this dude has the worlds slowest kick that manages to make a person fly about 4 miles back.

There are a few good actors in the show but they fail to make the show better. The action is horrific, it's worse than a bad kung fu show. The story line is long, drawn out, and unappealing. But the one painfully obvious message in the show is it's a black superhero show. I don't care is a superhero is white, black, Asian, or Indian, but It seems like the main focus of the show is black issues every change they get, right down to the opening music that make 0 sense.

That's why I had such high hopes for this show, especially after the banal fiasco that is Legends. So with that hope firmly in place I watched the first epsiode of BL and found myself disappointed, but I kept hope alive and continued to grate through the rest of the first season of this show until all hope was lost.<br/><br/>TV shows are supposed to be entertaining, right? Well this show is instead, a poorly written, horrendously acted, haphazardly cast, with direction that seems like it was phoned in, example of trite political commentary and innuendo. As a non-white person I have a message for BL producers, social justice reform and outrage should come second in TV programming to the entertainmaent value of a program. Your personal opinions and social outrage shouldn't be the basis for the product you put together; rage aginst the machine and practice your social prostelytism elsewhere. Please take a page from Luke Cage, focus on the story, the cast, and the acting, and layer in your thoughts on social justice into that tapestry.<br/><br/>It pains me to say, as someone who really wanted this show to turnaround the primntime DCU, that this show is not worth watching.",34 out of 53 found this helpful.,1.0,12 March 2019

2342,Sanditon, Bring on Season 2!,"With social media being as it is, you cannot help but get roped into all the controversy going on about this show. So I took a look at some YouTube clips and other things going around on Twitter and Instagram etc and got the general gist of what the show is all about. All I can say, is that I was hooked - right from the very first clip. Whoever had the brilliant idea to cast Theo James as the tall, dark, mysteriously brooding Sidney Parker should be applauded. He is absolutely brilliant in this role. I have seen him in other things, but I think this has really showed how good of an actor he really is. Of course he is handsome (any red blooded female can see that) but that didn't even matter to me, because he brought Sidney Parker to life for me. He made me fall in love with him just as Charlotte did and he made me irritated and annoyed just as Charlotte was. He is just an amazing actor and he suited this role to a tee. Charlotte's character (played by Rose Williams) took me a while to warm up to but I found her maturing with each episode and I liked her spunk and charisma but I also liked her softer more vulnerable side which came out slowly as she begun to realize her true feelings for Sidney. Rose is a very talented actor as well. She is exactly how I would picture Charlotte to be.<br/><br/>So to all you people saying how horrible it is and that Jane Austen would be turning in her grave etc etc, I say - SO WHAT! I have a sneaky suspicion that she really isn't worried about it in the slightest. Get over yourselves, get a glass of wine, sit back and just enjoy this wonderfully lovely romantic story. I did!

It's unlikely that I fall in love with them... instead, it's unusual when I keep watching them, 'cause I often get bored after few episodes. But this never happened to me with ""Sanditon"". Despite the linearity of the plot, all the characters are well-written, even those who are in the background. You think that, when you start watching a Jane Austen's novel adaptation, you'll see an happy ending where the two protagonists get married... but things in ""Sanditon"" are more complicated than this. I didn't appreciate at first how Davies ended the relationship between Sidney and Charlotte, but if this would mean there will be a season two... I'm on board.

The layered storylines are very absorbing and good to see other characters have depth and meaningful plots of their own. Some viewers don't seem to like the ""warts/bums and all"" portrayal of Austen's work in this adaptation, but it feels like a truer reflection of the times she lived in and reflects issues we're still trying to come to terms with in society today - so I, for one, think it's refreshing!<br/><br/>Ignore the critics - those who think Austen wouldn't have approved evidently have no concept of her spirit - as long as there's a second series that is!",108 out of 130 found this helpful.,10.0,3 October 2019
2354,Sanditon," Reflecting on this after my initial horror, One of the cleverest and well made period adaptations in a long while","So I am sure I am amongst the millions who initially worried that Andrew Davies had done a disservice to Jane Austen by finishing what she started in a decidedly more modern tone. And as for the ending, well, I think steam was rising from the UK on the night it finished as we all self-combusted with sadness and rage and love.<br/><br/>But, may I say on behalf of myself and those I know who don't use social media, that really all being said and done this was a truly exceptional piece of drama. Well cast, well acted and (cough) well written. Davies wit, aptitude to blend Austen's era with the requirement of a modern audience and subtle literary weavings as a nod to Jane and a nod to the plot, are outstanding. Watch again to realise this.<br/><br/>To conclude, This is surely only the beginning of Sanditon. For we: the saddened, the cross, the down-right disapproving and the delighted would all like another 'go' at this one. First class. A second series would draw us all back like moths to a flame.",100 out of 120 found this helpful.,10.0,21 October 2019

I've learned that even so called Austen purists don't always know all the ins and outs of regency times. With Sanditon, Austen introduced a new world to her readers. One of entrepeneurs. A new territory. Sanditon is a feast for the eyes AND ears! The end was unexpected (understatement of the year 😅), but I wouldn't have missed seeing this series for the world.

Crawford excels at capturing Riggs, improving on Mel Gibson's portrayal of the mega flawed character.<br/><br/>The acting, writing and rapport between the entire cast have made the TV version of Lethal Weapon better than the movie franchise. With the bar set so high, Fox would ensure the end to its best program with any meddling.

Season 2 started &amp; seemed to be on a downhill slide to the end.<br/><br/>This became ""must watch"" for me on Wednesday and then Tuesday nights for season 2. Clayne as Riggs was the main reason why. The action, comedy, storylines all were great.<br/><br/>Every time it seemed like there was a glimmer of hope/happiness for Clayne's character, the show seemed to stomp it out.<br/><br/>Then just as it is being promoted that the upcoming episode was directed by Clayne, conveniently the news is ""leaked"" that he had been ""reprimanded"" twice for his behavior on set.<br/><br/>Instead of being like most celebrities, Clayne faced it head on. He acknowledged that there were 2 incidents, but he gave his side of the story NAD apologized. From what I heard/read, it sounded like for the most part that he was trying to make sure that it was a safe set.<br/><br/>The rumors continued to swirl until once again just before the season finale, rumors came out that ""sources"" were reporting that Clayne had been fired and that producers on the show were trying to recast in hopes that the show would be picked up for a 3rd season.<br/><br/>If the rumors are true, the storyline to write off Riggs was already there. He was going back to Texas with Molly! Instead the producers, director, writer, whoever decided that wasn't good enough and had him killed(at least that's how it looks) in the final scene!<br/><br/>Reports are that while several actors have been approached about taking over the role in a recast, all of them have turned it down. I think that goes to show:
1. What a great job Clayne did as Riggs
2. How leery they are of what may/may not get them fired
3. Why FOX is such a terrible network and has to pick all new shows every year instead of having anything renewed, unless it's animation<br/><br/>So in conclusion, if you've never seen this before, definitely watch the 1st season. The 2nd season had some good parts, but also some disappointments.

Not only as the actor playing Riggs, but also because he was a driving mind behind a lot of the scenes. He's an artist dedicated to his profession and the art of filmmaking. Without him, scenes are going to be sub-par &amp; half assed because Damon Wayans is lazy and entitled. Zero respect for the producers of Lethal Weapon and FOX network for the shady and crappy way they treated Clayne while pampering Damon. <br/><br/>Watch the first 2 seasons because they are fantastic.

I king of expected Wayons to leave the show first, he and his brothers are well known for leaving good shows. To fire Clayne when Wayans was probably going to quit eventually anyway was a bad move. I found his character annoying and very predictable. If they had fired him and left Clayne in place I think the show could have gone on, Wayans never wanted to do the show in the first place. So if I worked for the network I would put a fork in this one before the next season, it's done! I used to give the show a 8.5 star rating, if they actually do this, I will tune into the first show and if I don't see Clayne, I will turn it off with a new rating of 0.",55 out of 68 found this helpful.,1.0,29 August 2018

Right now i'm looking forward to this show every week more than any other. They've completely nailed the casting and characters of Riggs and Murtaugh, from Murtaugh's protectiveness of his family to Riggs's crazy outward charm, thinly veiling a near suicidal depression. More than that though, they've managed to recreate the bromance that made the originals so memorable. That is truly where this show excels, at being a damn good buddy cop story.<br/><br/>So here's my suggestion. Don't expect anything, don't pre-judge it, just watch the first few episodes. If you still don't like it then fine, but i'm betting that if you liked the originals, then you will.",118 out of 153 found this helpful.,9.0,10 November 2016
2387,Lethal Weapon, Lose Clayne Crawford - Lose a Viewer!,"I just watched the season finale and was shocked, as it appeared they were killing Clayne/Riggs off. So, I came here, to IMDB, to find out what was going on and learned they did, indeed, kill off Clayne's character. He is the main reason I watch this show. Get rid of him, get rid of one more viewer! 
The chemistry between Murtaugh and Riggs has come across as so natural and incredibly ""right."" That chemistry is what, for me, drives the show; without that, the show will just wither away and I'd be surprised if season 3 makes it through all the episodes, before they yank it from airing.
Clayne's portrayal of Riggs is the quintessential piece of the puzzle that is the background for the two main characters. Clayne is perfect for the role. And, from the viewer's point of view, the two characters interact wonderfully together! It has been a joy, fun, intense, unpredictable, and addictive pleasure, watching the two work together through each episode.
Unless I read that they will be bringing Clayne back to the role of Riggs, I will find enjoyable watching elsewhere. What a shame!",32 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,20 May 2018

I can't see the show going on without him and I won't be watching anymore. Huge mistake letting the star of the show go. Show had amazing potential. You can't have Lethal Weapon without Martín Riggs.

2389,Legion, Not your average superhero,"*** some mild spoilers ahead ***<br/><br/>""What is your name?"" Jesus asked.<br/><br/>""My name is Legion,"" he replied, ""for we are many."" (Mark 5:9)<br/><br/>I hope you'll forgive me for starting this review by citing this (rather obvious) excerpt from the bible, but I just couldn't resist. Apart from these opening lines, I'll try to avoid any spoilers for the show, so you won't read anything specific about the storyline here. As with all my reviews, this is supposed to give you an overall impression of the show without giving away any details regarding the plot.<br/><br/>For those among you who, like me, love some of the slightly weirder superheroes out there (especially of the mutant kind and preferably in the X-Men universe) but feel most of those guys' screen outings so far were either constricted by the 2-hour format or held back by the need to appeal to mainstream audiences, I'm happy to report there is finally a full length TV-show that dares to fully embrace the craziness of its source material without taking any prisoners. The show's name is 'Legion' (and I'm already pretty sure its fans will be many), and compared to its central character David Haller, even Deadpool looks almost sane. <br/><br/>Following the storyline may seem a little difficult (at least at the beginning) for 'Legion' plunges us head first into the confused mind of its hero, and the narrative is - deliberately - often just as fractured as David Haller's personality. Right from the start this show makes it very clear how committed it is to convey its protagonist's unstable state of mind - and boy does it succeed: through David's eyes we experience an often terrifying (albeit colorful) world where we can never be sure what's real and what's imagined; nor can we get a grasp on where we are, when we are, or even WHO we are.<br/><br/>But this trip down the rabbit hole is well worth taking (even if it does turn into a horror trip at times) for it's a psychedelic ride that has been designed by very talented people. Creator Noah Hawley, who has already given us the excellent show 'Fargo', obviously knows what he's doing, and watching the show feels like listening to a perfectly composed concept album from a seventies rock band (btw, watch out for a cool Pink Floyd reference). The cast is terrific (especially Dan Stevens as David Haller); the visuals and the production design are a wonderfully weird mix of retro and modern elements which fits David's distorted perception of time and reality like a glove, and the mystery surrounding David as he desperately tries to cut through the haze and figure out what's going on will keep you glued to the screen throughout.<br/><br/>Insanity is a tricky subject to tackle, and the possible pitfalls are many; present it with too much levity and you risk the accusation that you're making fun of people with a terrible illness - yet if you portray it as tragic and bleak as it often is (I am saying that as someone who has a family member who suffers from schizophrenia) you will lose your audience. So to find the right tone here was not an easy thing to do, but I believe the show - just as Marvel did in the comic books - does an outstanding job at never coming across disrespectful while still offering fantastic entertainment.<br/><br/>So to sum up my first impression: 'Legion' represents a refreshingly different side of Marvel (compared to the films and shows based on Marvel Comics' more ""grounded"" creations that we've seen so far) and by fully embracing the source material's ""weirdness"" the show is a testament to just how insanely (in the true sense of the word) inventive and versatile Stan Lee and his band of brothers were/are. This show is wilder, more surreal and generally much, much crazier than your average superhero story and there are moments where you feel reminded of the works of David Fincher, Charlie Kaufman or even David Lynch. I'd highly recommend it especially to adult comic book fans and those among you who don't demand everything be explained within the first episode. Personally, I feel this is Marvel at its best and most complex: 9 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/",387 out of 513 found this helpful.,,12 February 2017

By season 2 it feels like the rug has been pulled out from under the show's plot, and they're left dancing in midair with nothing to hold them up but a fun style, dance numbers, and psychedelic rambling.<br/><br/>I'm going to keep watching in hopes that it gets back on track.

The writing, pacing, acting, and especially the production design were all top notch and really made the show stand out. At the end of the season I was super hyped about what Season 2 was going to offer. <br/><br/>Right from the get go, Season 2 seemed to fall flat. The story arc of Farouk was drawn out way too long and could have been presented so much better. For a character that has this much importance to the Legion storyline, the writers and production team sure succeeded in phoning it in. Even the ""look-at-my-fancy-artsy-fartsy-reverse-camera-framing-because-it's-art"" shots that are obligatory in Noah Hawley productions somehow seemed contrived and slapped together with no real purpose. <br/><br/>Yawn.

2399,Legion, Truly original take on Marvel mayhem!,"There is nothing quite like Legion. It's the strangest, barmiest concoction on TV. I absolutely love it! Taking a Marvel X Men antihero and turning him into the craziest ""super"" ever, is no mean feat and David Haller aka ""Legion"" is brilliantly brought to life by Brit actor, Dan Stevens. This show takes the X Men idea and blows it out of the water. Fantastic, trippy visuals, music and dance, comedy, violence and much, much more to feast the eyes and brain on. First season was terrific and the writing a real cut above for Marvel fare. All the actors are fantastic, especially Stevens and Aubrey Plaza. The second season was even stranger than the first and took me places I'd never been to in any TV show. It was really weird in a good way. The third season is building to be the best of the lot with a more linear storyline, Legion's origin story as the son of Charles Xavier himself and more stunning visuals and mind bending imaginary scenarios. This show is truly great and will be remembered long into the future as one of the best series ever.

The story is vague &amp; intriguing from the beginning with growing enchantment as the episodes stack-up. <br/><br/>Sure. I'm a comic book geek from the 1980's, but Noah Hawley seems like he has more than his ducks in a row for this project. As SONY/Fox has often mis-stepped with the X- Men and its creative use of characters and story lines, LEGION seems to be avoiding the potholes, while creating a new amalgam of story from the past to forging ahead with a cohesive story. <br/><br/>Aubrey Plaza's performance is delightfully off-beat and maniacal. <br/><br/>I could list the positives for every actor and their character, literally the casting (and execution) seems perfect at this point (through episode seven).<br/><br/>Love it!",106 out of 172 found this helpful.,9.0,23 March 2017

2406,Legion, Marvel versus David Lynch. The best Marvel show.,"While part of the Marvel Universe, Legion is an odd-man-out, neither part of the big budget Disney cinematic universe or the Netflix version of the Marvel universe. It also has the best acting, writing and direction of any of them and a more mature approach. It's a cerebral, surreal sci-fi mutant show. If you are a comics fan, the fact of Chris Claremont &amp; Bill Sienkiewicz involvement in this tells you almost all you need to know -- it successfully carries both of their styles onto a TV screen. Claremont wrote many of the most legendary story arcs for the X-Men. Sienkiwicz is a brilliant comic artist, emphasis on artist -- he often works with paint and mixed media to create comics that look like fine art. The writing and direction is complicated, non-linear, and accomplished, verging on avant garde. There is immense attention to detail and editing, artistically-framed scenes. The acting is a cut above other Marvel shows (although Cage gets an honorable mention) and they've gathered a cast that works great together. The psychological, Lynch-ian freaky edginess that Sienkiewicz infused in all his work is present. It's not perfect, it takes some risks that don't work (like season 2 ep.5 -- tedious and anti-climactic), but it is freaky &amp; cool.",39 out of 61 found this helpful.,8.0,11 June 2018

I have since caught it in syndication, and I am surprised at how good it is. It does have its sappy moments (like even the greatest sitcoms -- except ""Seinfeld,"" which poked fun at this show at least once), but at the core of the show is an homage to all things Manhattan, and classic comedy heavily influenced by ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" ""I Love Lucy,"" and Sid Caesar. I have laughed out loud more to this show than I have to some of my other favorites.<br/><br/>The show does have its weaknesses and some annoying characters, but the comedy holds up anyway. If you have avoided this show until now, give it a try.",35 out of 43 found this helpful.,8.0,3 November 2007

2420,Mad About You, My new favorite series,"I used to watch random episodes of Mad About You a few years ago. It was fun, as much as Seinfeld, Friends and similar sitcoms. Lighthearted, funny, it was very pleasing to watch. But it wasn't until recently, when I decided to watch the entire series, from the first episode to the last, that it really became my favorite show.<br/><br/>I was so amazed by it, so impressed! The characters were so involving, so easy to relate. The story, funny and filled with smart ironies, while at the same time always dealing with relevant life, society and family issues. Well, I became absolutely fascinated by it.<br/><br/>So it came as a surprise to see how low was the score here on IMDb, which is usually very precise. After some thought, I believe the reason is on the first place a matter of style. I'm 22 years old, and I really doubt the style Mad About You was made is really appealing to most people of my generation, used to Friends, How I Met Your Mother and so on. It's very different. Not that it bothered me, but well, people are different. Also, Mad About You wasn't aiming to be simple entertainment, at least the way I see it. I believe the point was to be not only fun, but artistic, creative, and socially relevant. So, even though it was brilliant, it might not always be appealing to everyone.<br/><br/>But, if you're reading this, and you don't find much interest in the series, I urge you: please reconsider! It's a classic, and if you give it a chance you will really appreciate it. I hope to have convinced you by the end of this review :)<br/><br/>So, I'll describe three reasons why I fell in love with the series.<br/><br/>First, it has an elaborate sense of humor. There are so many different kinds of jokes throughout the series. Some are just picturing silly things common people do, the contradictions we all have. Take the theme song, for instance: ""tell me all of your secrets and I'll tell you most of mine"". It's the little things, you see? :) Other jokes are more elaborate, connecting the beginning of the episode to the end, with impressive cohesion. It is filled with so many ironies, making the entire show extremely pleasing to watch. And, even though it's not the kind of series in which you'll be laughing the entire time, it does have a few hilarious moments.<br/><br/>Besides that, it is beautifully crafted, from the plot line to the direction and acting. Really, it has a remarkable quality. Some episodes must have been extremely difficult to film and were still perfect. Yes, some of them were really impressive works of art. Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt not only have that chemistry others have mentioned, but they are also incredible actors. And whoever trained Murray (the dog) has made an awesome job. Mad About You wouldn't be so cool if Murray wasn't a part of it. Also, many episodes had a very creative way of being ""meta-linguistic"", kind of referring to itself in the end. That was often funny too!<br/><br/>Finally, and most importantly, it is deeply meaningful. Even while describing seemingly unimportant daily events, it had a deep message. Basically, while the mass culture of our time praises lives without commitment and makes marriage seem somewhat obsolete, here are Jamie and Paul showing that it is not true. It's better to be together than to be apart. More than that, it is better to be married than just together. ""That paper in the city hall"" is not irrelevant, it has an important role, and it is worth it. And, you see, it's not that Jamie and Paul are perfect; far from that! They are a quite troublesome couple, in fact! But still, they find a way to be happy together. The show is extremely honest describing their issues, and just like real couples, they undergo some pretty rough times. Still, after watching it, most people (me included) feel motivated and anxious to get married, not naively thinking it's easy, but knowing that it is worth it.<br/><br/>Not to say that the show is only meaningful or relevant because of what it says about marriage. But I'll leave that for other reviews to describe :P<br/><br/>So, yeah, Mad About You is pretty awesome. Don't discard it for the latest hype. If you have the chance, watch the entire series, you won't regret it.",17 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,28 September 2013
2421,Mad About You, Belly-laugh show,"This show is seriously a belly-laugh show. It may seem pathetic, but once you get hooked on Mad About You, you wake up in the morning looking forward to the half hour you'll spend watching it. The show is perfectly cast, and I mean *perfectly* cast. Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt play off each other wonderfully-- The writing is seriously some of the best ever on TV. I watch the show when it's on at 2:30AM and everyone else in my house is asleep, and I honestly have to bite my lip to keep from laughing so loud that I wake everyone else up. Long story short: if you are looking for a clever, high brow, witty, well written, wonderfully acted, exceptional show you won't find it anywhere else.

2425,Mad About You, Poor poor planning,"So they decide to do this on some new cable (internet, etc.) service. This is only available to watch on Spectrum. STUPID DECISION!!!
The original show aired in NBC, a channel everyone can get. But hey, maybe there were issues with the network. Next logical places to go would be Netflix or Hulu, two well established streaming services.
But noooo! They put the new series on Spectrum, which is limited anyway! Even if I wanted to get Spectrum, I couldn't because it's not available in my area.
I don't doubt that this series will be awesome, but it's likely going to get extremely low viewership based on its airing platform.

2426,Mad About You, Definitely worth watching,"My wife and I have been watching collections of some great comedies (Seinfeld, I Love Lucy, Friends, Frasier, Dick Van Dyke) and have found ""Mad About You"" (at least the first 3 seasons) to be on par with all of them. The show is funny and great at exploring relationship idiosyncrasies. Paul Reiser is very funny and the writing is outstanding. There are certainly some sappy moments but all shows have that at one point or another. The chemistry between Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt is excellent and that chemistry gives the show more believability. I wish Sony would release the entire series (or at least group the first 3 seasons in a collection). This show is definitely worth watching.",12 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,10 January 2009
2427,Mad About You, This is some good TV!,"Mad About You is a show about a married couple, Paul and Jamie Buchman, and they live in New York. The humor of the show comes from the every day stuff that happens in life. I gotta tell you, a sitcom can't get too much better from this. It can be very funny sometimes, pretty often actually, but it can be pretty serious also from time to time. One of the main things why this show works so good, is the actors. Paul Reiser and Helen Hunt are perfect as the leading stars. And why are they so good? Because they have chemistry. They have it so much it could fill the whole room. From the other cast I have to mention Leila Kenzle as Fran, Anne Ramsay as Lisa, Richard Kind as Mark, John Pankow as Ira, Cynthia Harris as Sylvia, Louis Zorich as Burt, Carol Burnett as Theresa, Carroll O'Connor as Gus and Lisa Kudrow as Ursula. And let's not forget Maui the Dog as Murray. That dog got all the best lines! The guests of the show are unique. Many times they have stole the show. Or how do you like this guest list; Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner, Jerry Seinfeld, Jerry Lewis...the list just goes on. In Mad About You the dialogue is something really amazing. There just isn't one bad thing I can tell you about this show. Well one bad thing is that it has ended now. There is no Mad About You no more because they canceled it four years ago. It ran in the years 1992-1999 and it was good while it lasted. But everything must end sometimes.Now there are nothing but reruns. So let's just enjoy watching the reruns of one great television show.",25 out of 43 found this helpful.,,7 November 2003

2431,Mad About You," I really wanted to love this reboot, but...","I really don't. Yet. (Full disclosure: Only watched the first episode.) I loved the original series; but times have changed and I don't feel like this series found it's way to the new millennium.<br/><br/>It's like it's trying too hard. Everything feels forced and overplayed; the writing is too sharp edged; the characters rather one-dimensional. The premise of their unease is uncomfortable: What worked when they were newlyweds finding their rhythm feels mired in unhealthy banter as an older couple.<br/><br/>Paul Reiser is brilliant in The Kominsky Method so I think it's mostly the writing at fault here. The actors can only flesh out the characters as much as the page allows....and it's not allowing much. I'm not going to give up yet, I will try a couple more episodes before abandoning ship. I owe it that much.<br/><br/>On a personal note:
I REALLY wanted to love this show because I worked as an extra for a few years in the 90's and I was fortunate enough to WORK ON the original series for two different episodes. Loved the experiences (both). Actors were friendly and production staff top-notch and I had fond memories of the experience.<br/><br/>If, after watching more episodes, I feel the need to update to a more positive review, I will.

2440,Sneaky Pete, A masterpiece.,"I'll make this short.<br/><br/>You know that feeling you get, when you bought something you were unsure about, then you open it and instantly regret having spent money on that? <br/><br/>I felt the same way about spending time to watch television series the last decade. <br/><br/>You get invested in the first episodes and then the plot just gets thinner and thinner and after a few episodes you notice what crap you're wasting your time on. <br/><br/>Well there was no remorse on this series for me. This is on a whole different level. This series makes other series look like ""The dark Knight"" made old comic book movies look like. It's just that good. I didn't think I'd see something this good ever. This will blow up and it's justified. <br/><br/>The plot starts as a family drama and slowly weaves in a con plot while rapidly picking up pace and creating the tensest experience I ever had while watching TV.

2444,Sneaky Pete," S1 and S2 worth the price of admission, S3 feels like a post-game show","I have been looking forward to S3 for a while since I binge-watched the first two last year. Those 20 episodes contain some of the most fast-paced, tense and almost anxiety-inducing elements in a TV show since - dare I say it - ""Breaking Bad"". Lots of tremendous acting especially by Giovanni Ribisi, great characters, setups and mini-payoffs building up to a grand finale for each season.<br/><br/>S3 was off to a great start and I whipped through the first 4 episodes in a row but honestly, I started losing general interest halfway through. Ribisi and McRae visibly grow tired of their respective characters and there are lot of strange, forced throwaway scenes. Overall the acting/writing sort of just fizzles towards the end with each mini-payoff just barely necessary to a climax half as exciting compared to the previous seasons.<br/><br/>I noticed a complete lack of return of the writing and production staff from those first two seasons - especially Graham Yost, a master screenwriter of the fast-paced action-thriller genre. There are a couple of great moments especially in the beginning but overall not nearly as good as the first two seasons. The show needs to do itself a favor and get Yost back in the screenwriting chair for the next season if there is one.<br/><br/>Unfortunately S3 knocks my IMDb rating down to a 7 for overall show - S1/2 are a solid 9.",30 out of 34 found this helpful.,7.0,15 May 2019

2449,Sneaky Pete, Breaking good,"Somehow in the end Sneaky Pete achieves pretty much everything it says on the box, and everything it hints at in the pilot. It's a con movie, and a brilliant one at that, while being a dysfunctional family drama at the same time, and also being brilliant at that. It's simply an extremely well written and acted show that somehow manages to spin about five B-plots, three C-plots and a main arc into a riveting story that never seems forced one bit, and always feels as if the writers let the characters be true to themselves rather than deus-ex-machina them into a better story. And yet the story is pretty much perfect in the end. <br/><br/>It also manages to take itself lightly almost the whole time and rarely going into cliché even though it gets into some dark situations, and doesn't make a joke out of those situations. Giovanni Ribisi especially impresses in the title role, essentially a bad guy looking to ""break good"" (shout out to Brian Cranston/Walter White who produced it and also steals all his scenes as the big villain), but the cast is superb pretty much across the board. The only thing I was missing to make it a true masterpiece was some pizazz in the directing department as it's mostly unspectacular visually, but that's a small price to pay when you get the writing and performance departments so right.",62 out of 84 found this helpful.,9.0,15 January 2017

2460,Sneaky Pete, Season 1 = fantastic. Season 2...,"...not so much. I hate to say it, because I was really a huge fan of season 1, but the second season was fairly disappointing by the end. The first few episodes were great - as good as the season 1. But for me, season two starts falling apart when the character of Maggie is introduced. For some reason, she just doesn't quite work. Not sure sure if it's the actress or how her role is written, but her character is not that effective, and the subplot involving her starts to make the episodes drag. The main baddie is also not as charismatic as Bryan Cranston's character was in in season 1. And there are just too many subplots in this season. While season 1 was complex and interwove a number of stories, somehow it worked and never seemed forced or confusing. It was like a Swiss watch. Here, it felt like they were trying too hard - you could see the gears moving. In fairness, it must be very difficult to write this kind of story effectively more than once. The show is a lot like Justified (not surprising, as it was co-created by Graham Yost), and it shows a similar trajectory: brilliant at first, then a steady decline.

2461,Sneaky Pete, What took me so long? Why did I not watch this years ago ?,"Whatever it is that is stopping you from tuning into this very well written and extremely engaging series...please rise above and/or let it go; so you can sit back and be entertained by the quickly well developed characters and evenly paced twists and turns of this exceptional TV programme. Think Usual Suspects crossed with The Pink Panther and a little piece of Bloodlines.<br/><br/>You'll soon feel so attached to the main cast, that you're rooting for them all, in their own individual trials and tribulations.

2462,Sneaky Pete, The Sneaky Man is Awesome,"I saw the title and thought this show is not gonna be much still decided to watch the first episode. Wow am I glad I did what a great series and every season just as great as the other. Pete will steal you blind still he has some moral values that make him really attractive throughout the series.
The family he infiltrates has plenty of moral problems and family secrets as well. Even though most of them are likable for the most part all have a dark side that comes to the forefront when any of them get into trouble.
I want go into the series and what it is about as it is a really fast moving changing with every episode plot with danger and trouble at every turn. I could not get enough from the first episode through what will be the final episode of season three the series never disappointed and always had me wanting for more. The fact that Amazon cancelled this series after three seasons is amazing to me.

2463,Sneaky Pete, This Season Not So Great,"Sneaky Pete has kind of built itself on extremely unlikely situations and coincidences, but in the past seasons it was easy to suspend belief as the the plot lines were compelling and actors engrossing, especially season 1.<br/><br/>Season 3 is a big letdown, with a horribly written also-ran story concerning the Bowman siblings' parent, which is a HUGE yawn, led by completely charisma free Libe Barer (Carly); it's almost painful to watch. I found myself fast forwarding during any parts of that storyline, and even the actors involved looked like they couldn't care less about Carly's mission when interacting with her. I felt bad for Margo Martindale (Audrey), a wonderful actress, who had to be tied down to that super tired dead weight of a plot.<br/><br/>Giovanni Ribisi seemed robotic and bored this season, almost looking like he'd rather be anywhere else. The writing was off kilter as well, with Ribisi making a ton of very questionable moves for someone deemed to be so clever. His new love relationship was a chemistry fail. Was really looking forward to bingeing this season, but ended up being pretty disappointed.",17 out of 23 found this helpful.,6.0,12 May 2019

But alas Brickleberry got canceled only after 3 seasons, which seems to be the cutoff age for such shows (see Drawn Together...)
Sooo, my fear is this show, being equally offensive, will again not last for very long, even though its on Netflix, who aren't as concerned with the outrage of snowflakes as TV stations. <br/><br/>But other than that, its a pretty fun show - offensive, hella funny, so I wholeheartedly recommend it.",82 out of 142 found this helpful.,10.0,31 August 2018

I like those shows too much.<br/><br/>Paradise PD is an uninspired, uncultured, juvenile attempt at shock humour.

2474,Paradise PD," I DON'T care if it's offensive, I DO care that it's not funny!","Other reviewers are mentioning this show as being very offensive, as a good or bad thing. To be honest, I know they did a lot of bathroom and sex jokes, but I don't remember it being extremely offensive or dark or anything.<br/><br/>Anyway, I love dark comedy. South Park is hilarious. I don't like it nearly as much any more, but Family Guy was quite funny. There's lots of other ""offensive"" shows that are funny. The problem with Paradise PD and Brickleberry is that those shows go dark but forget to make it funny. Just being dark isn't funny, even if it is ""extreme"". You have to actually be saying something or at least being funny about it.<br/><br/>This show just isn't funny. The voices aren't great, the animation is just OK, and the writing and humor are just total crap. It's not just bad, it's bad that's been done a million times before. Poop and fart and sex jokes you've heard in every school yard and on every street corner.<br/><br/>Furthermore, why does this show even exist? Brickleberry was a huge mistake and a gigantic flop that never should have been made into a series. So when that ended in an obvious trainwreck... Netflix decided to continue it? Why? Do the Brickleberry people have dirt on the Netflix board of directors or something?<br/><br/>Paradise PD is literally just a continuation of Brickleberry, only turning the park rangers into policemen and replacing the bear with a talking dog that is literally flat out lifted from Family Guy. I know because I watched every episode of both. Yes, I hated it, but much like a car accident, I simply couldn't look away. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent on a show that seems to have been written by a grade six creative writing class who were told ""you can write as many sex and poop jokes as you want!""<br/><br/>Who knows what Netflix was thinking. Anyway, it doesn't matter. This show is destined to flop just like Brickleberry, and until it does, nobody has a gun to my head forcing me to watch it!

All three stories are exceptionally well done although the current era one is the weakest. Most people comment on Lucy Lui in the 80s era story and her relationship with both her gay husband Karl and her young lover Tommy. But personally I found the 60s story to be the best. Ginnifer Goodwin was superb as Beth Ann Stanton the increasingly bitter wife of the lying and cheating Rob Stanton.<br/><br/>The final episode weaved all three stories into their own exiting conclusions and I can't wait to see what Marc Cherry comes up with next.,47 out of 51 found this helpful.,9.0,19 October 2019

Hopefully now that Netflix has picked up season 3 and produced a masterpiece, maybe it will start to get the recognition it deserves.<br/><br/>For people watching the 3rd season first, you can watch it as a standalone as even though it is a continuing story line from past seasons like Narcos, etc, you will still understand whats going on and will really connect with the characters.<br/><br/>All in all a very gritty and realistic ride. The character development, suspense, twists are great and at the end of it you will be left wondering why you haven't heard of or seen this series before.<br/><br/>P.S - The ending of season 3 left very mouth watering prospects for season 4 to fulfill.",43 out of 47 found this helpful.,10.0,21 September 2019

2523,Top Boy," The show as a whole is fantastic, Season 3 is flawless.","I have been a top boy fan since day 1 and thought we'd sadly seen the last of it after season 2. Then season 3 happened. S3 is hands down the best series of them all without a shadow of a doubt. If not, the greatest UK Crime Drama series of all time.This show is literally breathtaking. Gripping throughout. Brutal. It catches you from the get go and really makes you FEEL. you relate and feel what every character is feeling. The plot is thrilling. The acting is sublime.
Kane Robinson is sensational as he always was and should be known first and foremost for his acting even before his music. I want to see much more of him.
Everything just feels so real from the first minute and it immerses you in its dark, gritty brilliance from the first press of the play button.
You do not need to have watched the first 2 series at all, but why wouldn't you? I'd highly recommend you do just for your own entertainment extension and to build S3 up to the masterpiece that it is. Season 3 just shows the epic potential and capabilities of this show. The newly casted characters are fantastic also - and bring so much to the table in the best way.
Sorry Channel 4, but Netflix just blew this one out of the park. All I can say is thank god for Drake giving this show the reincarnation it deserves. You truly are treated to 10 bursting episodes of the best of British TV. You literally feel spoilt after every episode and just can't look away. I finished this in 2 days and now feel lost without, it really is one that sticks with you. This simply has to be a long standing hard hitter that comes back with season after season, it's something that can't get old.

The shows gives an inside look into London gang lifestyle on the estates of London and how kids become 'shotters' for the more notorious people on the estates. Each episode of Top Boy has a gripping storyline which keeps you wanting more; one millions viewers for a urban C4 show cannot be wrong.

Bravo is a real fringe network and the following seems to be pretty good even without that. It would play well on one of those three streaming services. I hate to see a good series get dumped because of an obscure channel. Warehouse 13 died that way. Amazon did step in and save the Expanse so, there is still hope.

2541,Imposters, Fun And Games Ahead,"I love stories about cons. Especially long cons. The longer the better. When they are done well, I find them fascinating--like ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" or ""House of Games"" or ""Grifters"".<br/><br/>""Imposters"" starts with a married couple, blissfully happy newlyweds Ezra (Rob Heaps) and Ava (Inbar Lavi) Bloom. They say ignorance is bliss. It doesn't take long for Ezra to discover his blushing bride has skipped with all of his liquid assets. He is an emotional wreck. But he finds purpose when another victim named Richard (Parker Young) shows up, looking for Ava.<br/><br/>The first episode also introduces us to Ava's team of con artists(which includes Katharine LaNasa, who was so remarkable in ""Satisfaction""). <br/><br/>The cast is one of this show's strong points. Ms. Levi is enchanting as the evil enchantress, Rob Heaps is attractive but has an everyman charm, Parker Young (who played a likable dolt in ""Suburgatory"") is convincing as a former jock. The credits promise some casting surprises.<br/><br/>The show's premise is interesting and scenes from future episodes indicate increasing complexity in the story lines. It's best not to know too much before watching a new show, so I will write nothing more about the plot. <br/><br/>But I will definitely be watching this very watchable cast.<br/><br/>Update 3/2/17: Now that a few episodes have aired, I am upping my grade to ""9"" because the show is very engaging.

2542,Imposters, Better than you think.,"I started watching ""Imposters"" while I was working on a project. I usually put on a movie or a TV show to have something going on in the background, so I picked Imposters with no real expectations. I watched the first episode wondering if I was really gonna watch this, it looked ""dull"" and ""fake"" somehow. I thought it was bad acting, but in fact, it was excellent acting and bad writing decisions overall. Since I didn't even know the pitch of that show, I had no idea what was really going on. The ""fake"" acting was totally a part of it ! I watched episode 2 and it started to make sens, now I've just seen them all to the 6th episode, this TV show is a gem. Every episode brings a new surprise, it's funny and dark, smart and silly. I'm looking forward to the next episode.

2548,Imposters," Funny and engaging for the first season, then less so","Imposters stars Inbar Lavi as a con-woman able to be a rich person's perfect romantic partner before skipping out with their money. In season one she works on her next victim while three former victims hunt her down. This nutty story fueled primarily by the charm of its principles.<br/><br/>Lavi is perfect as the girl who is easy to love. Often you would expect this part to go the route of the femme fatale; an intimidating, sexy, mysterious woman. But Lavi is sweet and lovable, which is much truer to what men actually go for (remember, in Gilligan Island polls, men were hotter for girl-next-door Maryanne than sex bomb Ginger).<br/><br/>Her pursuers have an easy rapport as they bumble their way towards a woman they all clearly love. In a ridiculous but clever turn, the three decide to con people along the way. While they hunt Inbar down, she finds that there is more to her current con than she expects.<br/><br/>The early episodes are all about humor and character, with little sign of the Big Con typical of con-people fiction until the halfway point; the series is more about the conned than cons.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, season 2 is a let down, at least for the four episodes I watched. Lavi was an enigma is season one, but in two the series moves into psycho-analyzing her, which sucks out the mystery. Meanwhile he character is completely divorced from her three exes, which results in fall less forward momentum. The show isn't as funny, the characters aren't as interesting. It's like a whole new, inferior show. Perfectly watchable, but that's about it.<br/><br/>But do watch season one; it's terrific.",40 out of 56 found this helpful.,8.0,1 March 2017
2549,Imposters, Really begins to roll after a few episodes,"After episode one, I wasn't too sure about this series; I typically stick with a new series through the first season to give a fair assessment. <br/><br/>At first, I found the characters a little boring and predictable - though I continued to watch because it was... well, sorta cute. :) You'll not fall off the sofa laughing, but you will smile, and you will chuckle from time to time. I spent the first three episodes praying it would get better each episode, and it did improve as hoped.<br/><br/>In Episode 4, the show really takes off, much to my delight. Without giving away details, viewers are greeted with surprising moments and plot twists that finish with a ""I REALLY have to wait a week!??!"" feeling.<br/><br/>Imposters has the potential to be very successful, and if episode four is any indication, I think we're in for a treat.",38 out of 53 found this helpful.,8.0,1 March 2017

She is the new fresh face of Hollywood and, after visiting Israel last year, I find this native Hebrew woman highly intriguing. Her initial sidekicks, Max and Sal, are also very good actors. The three new sidekicks, all ex-spouses of Inbar's character Maddie, are pretty average. Writing is better than the crap on network television. Despite moving slowly in spots, the plot remains engaging enough to hold your interest. Somewhat miffed by Uma Thurman's character. She is not so convincing in her role as a hard-nosed enforcer. Patrick, the FBI dude, is just okay. He's a poor man's Shamar Moore.<br/><br/>I like this show... a lot.

In fact I was about to start texting my friends telling them I found a gem of a show. Good thing I held off. What began as intriguing and sexy and fun turned very familiar. So many things left me wanting. Jules complete inability to take care of her emotions was exhausting. But more annoying was the Bumbling FBI unit of Patrick, Gina and Auntie, nothing about these agents seem remotely real or professional. Let's begin here: Patrick is working an undercover operation where he is trying to ""catch"" Maddie, a professional con artist. So when he leaves his gorgeous house that the Bureau is paying for and drives off in his expensive car that the Bureau is paying for, he drives directly to the Bureau!!! Come on guys. It doesn't dawn on any of the FBI agents that Patrick could be followed?!?! To add insult to injury when Richard does follow Patrick all three agents--Patrick, Auntie and Gina--are in the FBI lobby wearing their badges, just in cases it wasn't obvious enough that they work for the Bureau. Insulting!<br/><br/>Then we move into the tried and not-true of the cat and mouse game with Maddie &amp; Patrick. Who has real feelings, which feelings are real. She is not that swift and he is not that smart, neither are very good at their jobs.<br/><br/>And we are to believe that The Doctor, a mastermind scamming millions of dollars would show up in person to collect a measly $500,000 and put his entire criminal empire in jeopardy. Awful!<br/><br/>Little Ms Agent Gina is too busy trying to get with her one night stand conquest Jules to pay attention to her job and keep an eye on the $500,000?!?!

I don't think that's so easy in real life, even for a beautiful girl:) Apart of that, the dialogue looks spontaneous and funny, humour is there all the time but not exaggerated, and episode 3 was so well built that I really was upset when it ended, I certainly wanted more, which is great - the movie achieved his purpose, as far as I am concerned.

Each episode gets better as the season goes on, becoming more and more like Star Trek. The humor is what you are expecting, but can be quite good at times when made with good timing. The world and ship designs, voice acting, and music is excellent, capturing a TNG era which gives the show great presence. This makes me wonder, how is it an animated comedy can be more Trek than a show with a knighted legendary actor, costing a few billion dollars per episode?!?<br/><br/>Overall this was an excellent start with some kinks to iron out, but I am definitely anticipating season 2, and ready to flaunt Lower Decks in the face of STD and Picard.",53 out of 77 found this helpful.,8.0,31 December 2020

""Rick and Morty humor with Star Trek? How long are they going to beat the horse they killed?"" I thought to myself. But then it turned out that I liked it. While it's not perfect and not all the humor lands for me, it's not bad either. Many Star Trek fans are understandably, and from my point of view, justifiably bitter about what has been done to Star Trek with Discovery and Picard, and even though Kurtzman is running this show too, I think there is an opportunity for it to shine by satirizing what made people like me hate the last two 'not treks' CBS made. It's not the trek you wanted, that mantle seems to have passed onto the Orville, but it's worth continuing to watch in my opinion as long as the show doesn't try to take itself too seriously, and especially will be if the creators can eventually seize the opportunity to demonstrate self-awareness about what went wrong with the last two shows.",69 out of 123 found this helpful.,8.0,30 August 2020

Also, the Rick and Morty style animation really doesn't do it for me except for Rick and Morty itself, and that's due to the writing and humor that OVERCOMES the failings of its hideous art style.

She's the star but certainly not alone in delivering quite engaging, excellent characterization, and entertaining performances.<br/><br/>This series goes to show that today's television doesn't have to depict violence, gore, profanity, or much that older children couldn't watch. Yet, for an adult who likes Cronenberg's and Lynch's films, this clean cut show is quite interesting without being too 'vanilla'. <br/><br/>Sedgewick has really come into her character by this third season and I like it far better than ""24"" which has now become monotonously predictable.

Her love interest is hot and I certainly hope this continues and heats up during this second season. Fritz, I hope, will have a stronger part in this season and their relationship will heat up. He is very caring and thoughtful and hopefully Brenda will appreciate him and not mess this up. I would love to see their relationship be portrayed as healthy and happy--not like all the other junk on TV. I bought the First Season DVD set and haven't gotten tired of watching them.

She is hired from Atlanta to head LAPD's Priority Crimes Unit for those high profile crimes that need a resolution and need it quickly. Tensions arise immediately. Her brusque style makes her own people want to transfer away, her boss is a former lover who dumped her and she manages to make many more enemies than friends. The crimes are formula enough that you can probably figure out whodunit before you get to the climax but it's the characters and relationships that sell the show and make it worth watching. Not only is Kyra Sedgwick giving the performance of her life in this series but she has a terrific supporting cast that gives the series heart. The ability of the writers to also give us some great comic lines keeps the show teetering at times from comedy to drama. The first season is already out on DVD.

If Sipowicz had shown up, would you have questioned his credibility as a leader because he doesn't look like he walked off the pages of GQ?

It was a brilliant piece of acting and writing for the entire cast.<br/><br/>I live in Atlanta and was born here. Brenda's southern accent is rather thick for Atlanta, but just right for some areas outside the Atlanta metro area, perhaps middle or south Georgia.

Like Law and Order the show puts more focus on the cases themselves rather than the personal lives of the characters, but The Closer opens the door a little more. Kyra is really what draws in people to this show, it's something about her character's charm despite the fact the character is from the often ridiculed south. The writers were also keen to make Brenda Johnson a real person, not some super-hero who always wins and always knows the every move of the bad guy; sometimes Brenda makes mistakes and pays for them and sometimes she is insecure about her looks or being freshly relocated to the big city of Los Angelos.

2598,The Closer, The Closer is not a mystery,"I have to laugh at the critics here who criticize that the show points to the killers.<br/><br/>The concept of the Closer to me is not that she solves the case but how she uses different interrogation techniques to get the killers to confess. In the first episode, she uses the woman's homophobia to get her to admit that she knew the person had a sex change operation. It prevents a heat of passion defense and establishes premeditation.<br/><br/>The car jacking episode with the autistic boy she is able to use the fact that federal and state are considered separate sovereigns. Thus she could promise immunity on state charges knowing the car jacking made it a federal case and the guilty confessor would not get away scott free.<br/><br/>With the Abu Ghraib scandal and this belief that you have to torture people to get information, the Closer ironically shows that good and effective interrogation does not have to involve physical abuse.<br/><br/>TNT is not my favorite network but for once they did something right. I may forgive them someday for ruining the NBC Pretender series with their made for TV movie continuation that was god awful. This is the only series I can remember TNT doing that I like.

Kyra Sedgwick excellently portrays a tough woman who won't let people walk all over her. People complain that Brenda is a b****, but maybe that's the point. What fun would it be to watch a show with nothing but sweetness and joy between the main characters, no conflict whatsoever? The tension she endures and often causes just makes the show all the more entertaining.<br/><br/>What is most irritating, however, is to hear people complain about how the perpetrators in each show is obvious. Anybody who had listened what TNT had been saying about the show before it premiered would know that they said from the beginning that this show would be unlike other crime dramas in that the crime would not be the main focus.

2604,The Closer, The Closer,The Closer is one of the best new shows on television today. Kyra Sedgwick does an outstanding job. She shows that women can handle themselves in the law enforcement industry. She has a tough time fitting in with the male members of her team because she is so much brighter and more insightful then they are. I also feel they are rather intimidated by her actions. She is able to get more information from the law breakers then the men can. I believe she makes the show what it is. She is an amazing actress. I am also a fan of all the Law and Order shows. I feel this one is up to the same standards as those as are the CSI shows. I think this show should continue and will rank close with the other law and order shows. Give this show a chance and it will surprise you. I am glad the network took the chance with this new show because it shows that they looked beyond the negativity that some viewers might have with shows like this one.,53 out of 81 found this helpful.,,6 August 2005
2605,The Closer, Great work from Kyra Sedgwick. A very entertaining and interesting cop drama.,"TNT has found a real winner in the cable TV series world with this series which continues to do well now three seasons in. ""The Closer"" is full of drama, love, passion, intrigue, humor, and seriousness. Kyra Sedgwick is great as Brenda Johnoson a real true southern belle from Atlanta, GA with both charm, wit, grace, and intelligence who starts a new life in Los Angeles as a chief deputy detective. Each episode Brenda always is very tough on each crime and murder case she works she's tough as nails in the interview asking tough questions to suspects. Brenda also is very witty and smart when looking for clues upon the crime scene her investigative work is hands on, but underneath it all she never losses her southern charm and nice gentle ways. Her love life is off and on but sometimes romance with an FBI agent is shown. She's certainly a tough woman cracking L.A.'s most bloody and tough cases with hard work and determination, her habit is a bad sweet tooth! I just love the way Kyra speaks and portrays Brenda so well with a deep and thick southern drawl a real twang of talent! Really this series is good a tribute to police detectives and their hard work of crime solving skills, even better it's nice to see the fine Kyra Sedgwick doing a role so well a real role model to every working woman!",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,25 June 2007

2607,The Closer," smart, entertaining and thought provoking","A great cop show with smart plot lines, interesting characters and a distinctive style. The story starts out with Brenda, a southern transplant to LA. She's very good at solving odd murder cases and getting a confession from the criminal. She's not so great at the rest of her life. As the story develops we watch her weave her job and her very messy personal life with intelligent, interesting and occasionally funny results. The insight into police life and politics adds another fascinating dimension, to what is already an impressive show. I really think the new cable style of short seasons pushes shows like this to the utmost, making every episode highly watchable.",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,4 August 2006
2608,The Closer, Crime Drama With Heart,"Chief Deputy Brenda Lee Johnson, along with her co-workers, family, victims and suspects are combined in story lines dramatically different from the popular CSI, Law and Order and copycats. Personally, I'm over-saturated with stories ""ripped from the headlines"", grisly autopsies and cool cool cinematography. The Closer entertains. While the plots may not always be completely believable, the characters act like real people. If you like character driven stories, this is a show worth exploring. I've read complaints that there's not much mystery in the show. I agree, but it doesn't matter. That's not the intent. There was very little mystery in Columbo either and it was the most entertaining show of its time. And there's complaints about Brenda Lee's messy personal life. For me, it makes her fully dimensional and complex. She has a lot of foibles and she is definitely ""impossible"" as she readily admits, but her work is brilliant, inspired and she's a fierce force of justice. Her over the top southern accent adds a sweetness that is endearing once one grows accustomed to it. Her problems with her fiancé and parents may be a bit exaggerated and contrived at times, but Kyra Sedgwick carries Brenda Lee's life into the viewer's heart in such a way that any flaws are easily overlooked. The supporting cast is superb. I wouldn't change a thing.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,4 July 2009
2609,The Closer," Funny, Quirky, Brilliant","I just have to say that I love, love, love The Closer. Kyra Sedgwick plays Brenda Lee Johnson brilliantly, and who can help but love her quirky mannerisms and genius? Brenda's quick wit and obsessive personality is both endearing and annoying, and it is for this reason that she is such a brilliant and compelling character. I also love the show because it is funny (watching Johnson's staff react to her quirkiness is a trip), it makes you think, and the story lines are usually always excellent. I also enjoy how the show delves deeper into the intragroup dynamics than your typical crime solving show. I look forward every week to The Closer.

A breath of fresh air with all the nonsense that is on TV today. Thank goodness for all the Law &amp; Order, CSI, NCIS and like episodes, along with Monk and Psych.

Her character's great , she's messy, sort of disorganized, trying her best not to eat the junk food she tempts herself with...and then giving in to just the one cookie, God! How often have we all been there! Then we see her totally in command of the situation, taking control, getting under the skin of the accused, making the arrest stick, getting the bad guy to confess...whew!<br/><br/>She constantly surprises me with her strength and yet the writer's not afraid to show us her weaknesses, and I think that's why I like her so much.

She is witty, spunky and altogether wonderful.<br/><br/>This is a refreshing change from the so-called ""reality shows"" that I simply cannot stomach. This show ranks right up there with the Law and Order shows of which I am also a great fan.....in fact, in my humble opinion, it could easily surpass them if the writers can continue to produce this same quality of scripts.

2613,The Closer, On my list of DO NOT MISS!,"I love this show. I never miss it.<br/><br/>The casting is great. There are a couple of weaker characters that I think should be abandoned or developed more (we do have several seasons behind us), but I love nearly every character on the show.<br/><br/>What makes this show enjoyable for me are the subtle things. you really have to watch to catch some of them. One character has a hangup about his desk...and the others are aware of his hangup and purposely put random things on his desk or sit on it. All the characters have some little odd quirk, especially Chief Brenda Lee Johnson. (For a long time we were asking ourselves ""what's the deal with the FOOD?"") I was laughing out loud at one episode where she was going all over the place looking for her glasses while one of the other characters had them on his face. There are just so many moments like that on this show that break the tension of the more serious subject matter. The characters feel like people I've worked with or may have as family members.<br/><br/>I like the flawed hero. I was always more of a Spiderman than a Superman fan. I think the writing on this show is awesome. They have tried to make the characters multifaceted and they've added so many subtleties that sometimes I'm glad I have my DVR to rewind and see what I missed the first time.<br/><br/>All in all, I really enjoy this show...one of my favorites.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,14 June 2009

2615,Brave New World, Pretty Brave,"Overall I liked this show. I like how it hit on a lot of political ideals and ideologies that we're seeing today without even trying. I honestly think a lot of people do not like this show because it directly points out hypocrisies that we see everyday in society, and points directly at them and their ideologies. We tell ourselves it will never be like that, it's too far out there. Example, This book was written in 1931 and while it's still not truly real life because our scientific technology isn't there....yet. But, you can bet if it was you'd see a society a lot like this one. It's scary / crazy to think that it is a possibility in the near future and it's even crazier to think that people can't see it coming like a freight train.
Either way the show was pretty great. Good acting followed by some not so good directing and producing. Meaning it still felt like a TV show at times. cutting corners on certain things like character development, or simply just trying to hard to be edgy. I do appreciate the fact that they didn't go overboard with the sex and nudity. Not that I don't like those things but at a certain point I just want to watch a good show, not soft core.

I think when you watch sci-fi, you have to disengage from reality a little bit, sit with the weirdness and discomfort of things different from our familiar world. This world is in the 2500s, a time we can't actually imagine any more than people 500 years ago could imagine 2020 (or covid, but I digress). Obviously people are going to complain, because everyone's a critic and people hate it when you mess with classics, but you can't please everyone.

I don't mind that some adaptations are taking another direction from the source. The main issue with this mini series, is that the main concept is just literally gone.<br/><br/>Instead of telling a story of an individual fighting against a dystopic society, it becomes a generic cliché of a romantic love story like any other show. John is supposed to be an intellectual human being, fond of Shakespeare, a noble savage. Instead, in this show, he is just another angry dude who falls in love with a pretty girl. Dialogs are sometimes good, and sometimes bad. there are some good moments.<br/><br/>I would like to emphasize again, that i don't mind the fit into the new era, and some changes are understandable.

2622,Brave New World, Not just a bad show. it's kind of an abomination.,"Imagine taking a classic piece of literature and making a show sharing its name which not only completely misses the whole point of the book, but actually elevates the aspects of human behavior and society which the book was critiquing. Like making a show called Moby Dick, but instead of Ahab's quest for revenge consuming him and destroying everything, in the tv adaptation he kills the whale and everyone is fine and afterwards they go get ice cream.<br/><br/>It's not necessarily a problem that this show has lots of sex in it. Hedonism was an important part of Huxley's Brave New World. There were orgies in the book. There are orgies in the show. No big deal, right?<br/><br/>The important difference is, Huxley centered his focus on hedonism as a numbing and fleeting frenzy of instant gratification that divorces people from feeling or meaning. It might work for a time as a coping mechanism but ultimately it stops working and disappoints when the novelty wears off. The same is true for Soma/drugs and other external sources of fulfillment.<br/><br/>In Huxley's World State, all of human technology and law was aimed towards sustaining a kind of continuous hedonistic indulgence, to keep people distracted from their feelings. This was a central point to everything Huxley was trying to say in Brave New World, where it seems that our real society, the same as his world, is hell bent on finding newer and better ways to distract and numb rather than to grow and where many of the actual new technologies emerging today seem to suit this purpose.<br/><br/>In Peacock's version of A Brave New World, however, the hedonism is actually deployed in a rather distasteful and indulgent way to draw in viewers who are doing the exact thing Huxley was critiquing. This is basically spitting in Huxley's face. He would roll over in his grave if he saw this show.<br/><br/>The writing is so, so bad and that is evident from the first ten minutes. It doesn't get better further in, it actually gets worse somehow. This show really beats you over the head with its dystopian-ness when the source material was such a classic precisely because its modern parallels were so subtle and relatable that they filled you with dread about where humanity is headed and where it has already ended up.<br/><br/>There is no such depth to Peacock's Brave New World.

2625,Brave New World," Brilliant Novel Will Last 100 years, This will be forgotten by Christmas","The novel has stood the test of time with it's amazing depiction of a future where all are happy and have purpose within a cast system. No families, no parenting, and the conditioning, cloning and genetic manipulation of people and children. One of the book's great thought provocations is that despite The Brave New World going against all our 'Savage' instincts, it's the Brave new World that wins and cannot be argued against as a better way forward for society and people for their welfare and happiness. This adaptation ignores the whole point of the book including that dilemma and turns it into a badly scripted Logan's Run, but not as good. This series is a typical Hollywood caper where the great free capitalist ways win through revolution against an evil dystopia. it's better to be free to feel sadness and love than ignorantly happy and without worry. The characters have changed from the book into more stereotypical film and TV drama characters. Their flaws and the frustration that the reader felt towards them which made them interesting has gone out the window.
I read the book this summer and greatly anticipated this drama. It's not all bad as a piece of TV, and as a Sci-Fi drama OK, but this would have been better to leave the novel and it's characters alone and make it only loosely based on BNW.

Read the book, not cliff notes) and this is a storyline from the universe of the book. It's not that hard to imagine that nbc wouldn't do a complete 1 to 1 recreation of the book and make an original storyline.<br/><br/>That being said, this is an excellent show. I'm over halfway done binge watching it and sad to see it's only 9 episodes. I'll be honest, I didn't even know they were making this on peacock and only saw it when I downloaded the app and made an account to watch some free episodes.

There is nothing new presented or explored: it's well put together, it looks nice and must have had some cash thrown at it but still somehow comes across as cheap, naive , and Dr Who-ish, and is better aimed at teen viewers. Personally, I would have been a little more generous if it had merely been 'loosely based on' or 'inspired by' the novel, but it seems the producers are riding on Huxley's coat tails for an easy cash-in. On the plus side; it features a very brief and amusing appearance by comedian, Rich Hall, and has a very nice soundtrack.

2635,Brave New World, from an 8 to a 4,"This might be the first case in TV history where the first episode is a stinker. Feels like it is made just to turn people away from the series. Everything is superfluous, set design and costumes are bland and boring, characters are unlikable. ~~ (Due to the last two episodes, it is better to just not watch it at all)<br/><br/>From Episode 2 to 7, the quality is flipped, and it becomes an enjoyable marathon watch.<br/><br/>Episode 8 and 9 is a stinker, worse than the 1st. While the 1st is plastic, 8 &amp; 9 is just plain stupid and makes you hate the writing and the characters . It becomes a melodrama set in a loosely sci-fi society that the writers have not sat down for longer than 5 minutes and thought of the intricacies that such a setup presents.<br/><br/>I recommend a first time viewer to watch Episode 4 first, then watch episode 2 and 3 as a sort of flashback. Then continue on wards with 5-7. (then stop watching)<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>But it gets real soapy with mopey , possessive, emo-man childs at the ends, in a love triangle, but the women is written with all the modern day feminists would imbue in such a character.<br/><br/>It is very very difficult to watch the last episode for how terrible it is.<br/><br/>The most egotistic counter-culture male with the messiah-complex in this triangle ( ..he actually dresses all black too... ) goes on to lead violent massacre perpetrated by a bunch of mentally deficient slave-workers , killing millions of innocents and destroying what they have built, so that can live as primitives in the wild. ( A fantasy these lovers flirt with during their dalliances)<br/><br/>(Why can't they use robots in such an advanced society ? They can launch to space daily, build an entire metropolis hundred of meters above the ground, have a universal information matrix .... Cause the writers would actually need to work, and create a rebel class that the viewer would relate to. Oh, and no security cameras and actual security personnel to handle those that refuses 'reconditioning' )<br/><br/>The writers probably meant for this to inspire the viewer as a rousing emancipation of the oppressed and of the soul ( something which the writers equate to unfiltered and unchecked negative emotions , and it's manifestation of violent actions ) and a remodeling to a fairer society ( they think the 'might is right' society of Episode 2 is more perfect, and if you don't agree, you literally deserve to be murdered) , but all this does is to tell the opposite. The truth is that it actually shows how readily available beneficial pharmaceuticals (zero side effects shown) , polygamy, and an ordered and civil society, is actually good.<br/><br/>Attempts to show the cultural downsides of this society is also undercut by internal contradictions. The attempt to show the lack of art and music is contradicted by montages of fashion, detailed landscaping, good interior design, a great electronic score at the clubs, and even award ceremonies for their movie-equivalents.<br/><br/>it all boils down to this being a naive love story. The negative implication that the writers stresses is the inability of having sexual monogamy. But emotional monogamy and friendships is allowed. Do the writers not understand why Kings and queens have harems, paramours and doxies for millennias, and at the same time be praised and blessed by the religious authorities too? ( different standards for the paupers &amp; proletariat , of course )<br/><br/>What a purile outlook in such a series where orgies are commonplace, and dates are rare .",54 out of 97 found this helpful.,4.0,17 July 2020

Some will not understand the adaptation, some will praise it and it will be rewatched for years to come spreading the sci-fi bug to a whole new generation.<br/><br/>Hardly I rewatch something but already looking foward to it and just finished 10 minutes ago.

You know that feeling when you finish a tv series or a book or a film and feel like you just had a life experience, you stare at the now black screen for a solid 5 minutes to digest everything, and then there's this emptiness...so you turn to the internet to see what everyone thinks... that's this show..<br/><br/>Honestly, I have no idea wtf these negative reviews are on about. I thought it followed the book pretty closely except for the ending. They took some creative liberties but god dangit I liked it. It really embellished a story that was already incredible.

2639,Trailer Park Boys, Knock Knock...F%@k Off.,"While I respect the opinions of those who criticized the show (not surprisingly the comments rated ""least useful""), it appears that their views are so concrete that they just don't get it.<br/><br/>This brilliant series is not intended to reflect the ""reality"" of trailer park life in Nova Scotia, but is instead a wonderful artistic compilation of many extreme, bizarre, and mundane experiences that are interesting on an entertaining and (feigned) voyeuristic basis. There are operas, soap operas, space operas, and now ""park operas"". <br/><br/>Consider how difficult it must be to act improv style not only on the set, but to act ""in character"" during all media interviews and public engagements, as is the expectation. Not many actors would have the commitment or stamina to carry this through for the benefit of the production image. Mike Smith, who plays the character Bubbles, apparently can only wear the thick glasses for 15 minutes at a time without extreme fatigue.<br/><br/>Let's consider the acting quality and skill. Would Deniro or Pacino make this a better series? No! The charm is in the rough edges, the improv, the humility, and the belief that these are low rung thugs. It is totally believable and a credit to the acting and direction.<br/><br/>How is Canada or Nova Scotia being insulted if we recognize that this series is a parody and that we should not take it so seriously. According to the on-line polls I have viewed for TPB of the episodes to date, the average rating has been 9 out of 10. Most of those voting were from Canada followed by participants from the US, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand. We should be proud that we have had an impact on others, especially on those outside of our country. <br/><br/>If given a chance, you will see how the brilliance shines through the layers of carefully placed sh#@. It is meant to look amateurish!",226 out of 238 found this helpful.,9.0,7 October 2006

2641,Trailer Park Boys," Incredible, brilliant show","Completely original, brilliantly written, beautifully acted, perpetually shocking and always quotable, TPB is simply one of the top 5 shows of all time. How many shows have had so, so many memorable, hilarious lines? Only the Simpsons, Larry Sanders, Sopranos quickly come to mind. The subject matter is refreshing and daring, it certainly could never escape heavy censorship in the US. Every line is funny, the dialogue is almost ""clockwork orange"" like. All the characters are excellent, the ensemble works so well together, I love seeing all of them, with their various looks changing season to season. Ricky may the best character overall, but they all have essential roles they have all mastered. I will admit that seasons 4 and 5 are slipping just the slightest bit from the dizzying heights of season 3, but it is still better than 99% of anything else. The Christmas Special ""Prequel"" from a couple of years ago was pure gold. It answered many questions, especially about Randy, and was brilliant. We finally got to see some winter scenes. Hopefully the movie will have some scenes in winter. The Alex Lifeson episode from season 3 should be in the TV Hall of Fame as one of the greatest 23 minutes ever shown. Thank you Canada!!!

2642,Trailer Park Boys," understated brilliance, continuing the great Canadian comedy tradition","Like most people when I first saw this show I thought it was just another mindless low budget comedy series aimed at the dim-witted pot smokers among us. Then I watched it more and became mesmerized by the underlying brilliance, everything was not as it seemed, from the beautifully languid intro music, to the ingenious documentary style of filming. Much like SCTV, it uses the low budget quality of the show, and turns that into a bonus. THe shaky hand-held camera, the occasional boom mic shot all blend perfectly with the mostly improvised dialogue. There's something uniquely Canadian about this, making the best out of the fewest resources, and it demonstrates the greatness of the show that it does not need huge production values to make you laugh your ass off. And laugh you will as you watch the main characters, Ricky, Julian and Bubbles stumble their way through life. We have all met people like this, much like in the movie ""Fubar"", people who are completely ignorant and emotionally underdeveloped, yet very much content with their position in life. Both Fubar and TPB, the key is not to make fun of these people in a condescending way, look equally at their naive stupidity but also at their loyalty and innocence and genuineness.<br/><br/>The 80's had SCTV, the 90's Kids in the Hall, for Canada, the 00's belong to the Trailer Park boys.",121 out of 138 found this helpful.,,6 August 2004

2645,Trailer Park Boys, It grows on you,"When I first left a review of this show I was fairly unimpressed with it. However, since then I've forced myself to watched the entire Seasons 1-3 and I have to say it: man, was I wrong.<br/><br/>It grows on you. If you can get over the bad acting and the political incorrectness you'll find one hell of a show. As another reviewer said it's not an accurate reflection of life in a Nova Scotia trailer park: more like if you took the weirdest members of every trailer park in NS and put them together to dumb it up.<br/><br/>Some of the funnier aspects I've found have been Ricky's constant mispronunciations (there are at least then in every episode), Mr Lahey's constant sh*t analogies, and, of course, Bubbles, who makes even the bad episodes worth watching.<br/><br/>If you give it a chance you won't have a single favourite episode; more like a collection of favorite moments pulled from each ep. Whether it's J-Roc's identity crisis (""I hate to admit it ... I'm white""), Bubbles' dragging a drunken Ricky home in the back of his go-cart, or the visit from the hysterically creepy Bible Pimp, there'll be at least something that makes you giggle whenever you think of it.<br/><br/>All that said, BBC America can look forward to a few letters of mixed reactions, and Comedy Central can start kicking themselves for not being the first to snatch it up.",70 out of 87 found this helpful.,,21 January 2004
2646,Trailer Park Boys, A comedy groundbreaker,"Who are the guys living in that Trailer Park in the title? Angry, skinny, drunk homosexual baldy running the town with his hairy fat Starsky-boyfriend who has a phobia of t-shirts, world's best professional weed grower taking shots in the leg every now and trying to finish elementary school for the millionth time, jug pissing old man taking support money from the government by acting disabled, poor Bubbles with two criminals as his only friends wanting to establish his own kindergarten for cats: Kittyland, a hip hop teen who never watches at the mirror because he wants to think he is black and so many other caricatured characters, that if I could continue the list and it would just get weirder and weirder.<br/><br/>Generally everyone and everything is so absurd I can't watch the show for one minute without bursting to laughter. Where normal people would go to the work in the morning, Trailer Park Boys spend the time camouflaging 200 pounds of hash into a driveway. There's gunshots in ""my neighbor just parked at my spot""-situations and people eating drugs instead of bacon in the morning. Their lives are so upside down it's hilarious.<br/><br/>Very rarely a new comedy that does something original instead of just copying an earlier success appears, I dare to say for myself that Trailer Park Boys is definitely the best comedy show ever to air. I could go on about actors being fantastic or characters being perfectly written, but it ain't the point in the series. The point is more like a world that you see when you go asleep and have a dream where the craziest and funniest and stupidest people live in one small trailer park and make you laugh for the whole show.",24 out of 29 found this helpful.,10.0,30 December 2006

This is Melrose Place or 90210 on Welfare and it freakingly hilarious.<br/><br/>The cast is very classic characters. The dialogue is cheesey and trite, but it all fits in perfectly.<br/><br/>The entire production is cheap, but made to be purposely done that way...and it comes off great. There are few comedies that are not Hollywood formula and this is one.<br/><br/>I can only state that for Canadian programming, this is far better than any ""road To Avonlea"" type programming.<br/><br/>Lately Canadian television series have become very edgy and have defined characters with unique definition...and it's about time.<br/><br/>It's time that comedy has gotten away from the ""FRIENDS"" and ""FRASIER"" type lame ass comedy writing and became creative like this show.<br/><br/>I look for more series episodes and possibly a feature movie too.<br/><br/>I've had the opportunity to live in a trailer park for several months in Florida, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico and British Columbia...I can easily relate to some of the characters that I have met in this series to real life people.<br/><br/>Fantastic view of a very unique position of life.<br/><br/>Awesome job.",88 out of 121 found this helpful.,,26 April 2004

Made to satirize the everyday life of the lowest of the classes and the problems that run with them, manages to make you laugh, tell the truth and promote human feelings in the most genuine way. Take a look at every character at the show and you realize just how funny everyday life really is. Jules, the responsible guy who never lets his glass of liquor off his hand, Bubbles, the benevolent little cat guy that everyone loves, and lives by fixing stolen carts and Ricky, the full-mouthed little a-hole friend that everyone has, never stops smoking even with nicotine patches on him.<br/><br/>The show is full of many other interesting characters that have their own brand attitude that makes this show so funny and well made. The exaggeration is the main protagonist here, abuse, swearing, dope, gunfights all in a perfect mix of comedy exaggeration. The show wins you by making you love the characters and their exaggerating attitude the outlaw lifestyle and their constants attempts to make a living.<br/><br/>If you love honest comedy, you are going to f-kin love this show.

On behalf of all of us poor, misbegotten souls that live due south of you Canadian's lower border (a.k.a the tree line) (sorry, I just couldn't resist), thank you, thank you, thank you! TPB isn't distributed in the U.S. as far as I can tell, so if you're a yank and unless you happen to live near the border and can watch CBC you won't know about this show other than by freak accident (it was a Netflix experiment for me). I see from the last couple of pages that there really are a few trifling slobs (on both sides of the Canadian/U.S. DMZ) that just don't get it. Well , I'm truly sorry for those poor miserable souls, probably something to do with the amount of fiber in their diet, but down here in Alabama WE sure get it! I've made it a (minor) mission to spread TPB around to everyone I can find with a pulse and I have yet to find anyone who (after a few episodes) hasn't been won over heart and soul (I make my friends send off for the DVD's after the first I give them, kind of like the neighborhood pusher). I won't say they don't exist in 'Bama (a land that may not have invented trailer parks, but has certainly perfected them) just that they're rare. Maybe that's why I like this part of the planet so much. I'm sorry for those who just don't get it, but I'm hard pressed to understand them either. After all, anyone who has ever had a family should recognize Ricky, Julian, Bubbles, et. al., with all their schemes, their plots, all their massively dysfunctional and f***ed up ways (to quote Ricky), and all their grace and generosity (where it REALLY matters) immediately. I know I certainly do, those guys are everyone I'm related to and everyone I ever grew up with boiled down and condensed. Apparently a lot of others do as well, which says many good things about the human race (even that part of it living in the desert south of you Canadian's border). This is a magnificent show, it makes me laugh so hard I have to pace myself so I won't end up at the doctor's office. I'm waiting on pins and needles for the movie (which should be out this month according to the net) and for the next season, and I really do mean pins and needles, what in the world will Ricky do next?!

2658,Trailer Park Boys, Trailor Park I'd Love To Reside In,"This viewer started watching this show after it had aired for nearly seven seasons. Better late than never. I watched the first episode of the first season and was immediately hooked. I binged twelve seasons in two weeks. Clattenburg has created a sublime mockumentary. This series has excellent direction, writing, cinematography, soundtrack, setting and acting. All of the actors involved deliver magnificent comedic performances. In particular Smith, Wells, Tremblay, Roach, Rolfe, Bowles, Torrens and the late Dunsworth are hysterical. Some of the aforementioned also contribute to the writing and directing of the series. To summarize twelve seasons as concise as possible, the plot revolves around two recently released inmates, Julian and Ricky, who return home to Sunnyvale Trailer Park in Nova Scotia. They are immediately shocked by the changes at the park, however they haven't changed at all. They meet up with Bubbles who completes the threesome and is sort of an anchor of sensibility. However Bubble's love for kitty cats, his curiosity and good nature always allow for him to be manipulated by Julian and Ricky. Julian and Ricky's arch nemesis is trailer park supervisor Lahey who is almost always inebriated and his assistant Randy. Randy has an allergy to shirts and a penchant for cheeseburgers which is chucklesome in and of itself. Julian and Ricky continuously hatch outlandish, zany, bizarre and quirky schemes to get rich quick with Bubbles most of the time observing and sometimes offering to be the brains behind the operations. These schemes are not always legal but I must admit they are clever. While this is going on Lahey and Randy constantly try to enforce park regulations threatening to rid the park of the boys and the feelings mutual. Sometimes the boys enlist the help of the inept Cory and Jacob who are witless, daft and goofy, but are such loveable characters. There is also wanna be rapper J-Roc who is exceptionally funny and Ricky's girlfriend Lucy who also delivers genuine hilarity. There are many subplots throughout the twelve seasons which keeps the series fresh. The plot is uproarious, side-splitting, rib-tickling, vulgar, boisterous, vivacious, raunchy and bombastic. This is one of the most memorable, addictive, superlative and near virtuoso series in it's genre. Season 13 just started but as this viewer streams nearly 99% of content viewed, I will wait with copious anticipation and confidence that the fun filled joy ride will continue. This viewer has already seen the two movies and live shows so in the meantime I'll watch the new animated, ""Trailer Park Boys"" series that dropped yesterday to tide me over or maybe I'll just revisit the series from episode one again.

The ""sheriff"" (can't remember his name) appearance, was the only reason I realized it was just a comedy. Brilliant entertainment. The atmosphere makes it very realistic and credible.

2664,The Waltons," Wonderful, nostalgic series of family warmth and closeness","This is a delightful series with wholesome values that my own family often watched together during my son's earlier growing up years. It chronicles the ongoing story of a Depression Era family living in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia...often seen though the eyes of the oldest son John Boy, a budding author, who relates his family's experiences in a journal. The series follows the Walton family through both the Depression and World War II. It also portrays the career paths, courtships, &amp; marriages of many of the children, the births of new grandchildren, and the illnesses, aging, &amp; deaths of some of the characters.<br/><br/>The mother, Olivia, is a devout Baptist who must deal with an extended stay in hospital as she suffers from tuberculosis. The father, John, though perhaps a little lapsed in his own faith, runs a saw mill and is a hard working man of integrity. The couple have seven children. John Boy eventually goes off to Richmond for college, Boatwright University, and later embarks upon a journalistic career in New York. Mary Ellen, a feisty tomboy, grows up to become a nurse and marries a doctor, Curtis Willard, sent to Pearl Harbour just prior to the Japanese attack. Jason is the family's budding musician, sometimes providing lively entertainment at the local Dew Drop Inn. Ben marries at a young age the pretty Cindy, and the two are set up with charming little accommodations adjacent to the main Walton house. Erin, the pretty one with her various beaux, is employed at the local telephone switchboard and later by G.W. Haines. Jim Bob is a mechanical tinkerer, and Elizabeth the rather spoiled and generally irritating baby of the family. <br/><br/>Also living under the same roof are John's parents, the devilish but wise old Grandpa Zebulun and the strict &amp; proper but feisty Grandma Esther. Years ago, it became a family chuckle that if Grandma Walton wouldn't have approved of the language, then it just wasn't acceptable! The banter between these grandparents is absolutely precious. I liked the multi generational aspects of the program with eventually four generations of Waltons. An ongoing storyline involved the stroke suffered by Grandma (and actress Ellen Corby), which restricted her movement and left her with a severe speech impediment. Also, actor Will Greer passed away, so the family was forced to grieve the loss of Grandpa.<br/><br/>The likable country store keeper, Ike Godsey, and his prim &amp; snooty wife, Corabeth, appear regularly on the show. Other local characters are featured, including Yancy Tucker and a succession of various parsons (one was portrayed by actor John Ritter). Of course my favourites are the charming, elderly Baldwin sisters with their legendary Recipe inherited from their dearly departed father! Olivia and Grandma were strongly opposed to alcohol, but Grandpa would sometimes stop by at the Baldwins for a wee nip of the Recipe, actually moonshine whiskey. Some episodes also featured interactions with 'outsiders', including circus acrobats and gypsies.<br/><br/>Most of the individual episodes are quite engaging, and the family's interactions even during conflict show an underlying warmth. Their famous extended calls of Good Night are of course legendary! Many plot lines revolve around their various financial struggles to live a decent life during the Great Depression. The marital relationship between John &amp; Olivia is well captured, as well as the siblings' interactions and their relationship with their parents &amp; grandparents.<br/><br/>Sadly, I am not surprised that this heartwarming series is receiving a few disparaging reviews these days. Perhaps life wasn't all rosy and moral back in the 1930's with issues of poverty, racism and so forth. However, its values were generally preferable to the decaying ones of today, where materialism reigns supreme, parents &amp; offspring alike feel entitled to their self absorbed attitude, rudeness is the norm in human interactions, the nuclear family and moral absolutes are becoming obsolete, and faith is mocked everywhere. This series represents the very antithesis of all such modern views, but thankfully, the vast majority of reviewers here still seem to appreciate it. Yes, better the Waltons than the Simpsons. My son is now a college sophomore, but admits to looking back fondly upon the series. <br/><br/>Indeed, these Walton characters are almost like family members in many homes, including my own. My compliments to actors Ralph Waite (John), Michael Learned (Olivia), Richard Thomas (John Boy), and all the others who brought them so vividly to life. Yes, the series can be sappy at times and may not always be realistic, but it is really not overly sentimental as some claim. Rather it is a depiction of the way we should ALL treat each other and the love, closeness, concern, warmth, and often unselfish giving that should be found in ALL our homes. Pity there aren't more TV programs nowadays that give us something worthy to aspire to.",75 out of 81 found this helpful.,10.0,15 June 2006
2665,The Waltons, A breath of fresh air in 2004,"Television has been going to the dogs over the past few years.  I recently picked up the DVD set of the first season of The Waltons and have been engrossed with every episode.  Each episode is like a miniature movie, with good acting and stories.  And what people used to make fun of (the syrupy quality of the show) now is a welcome relief.  I'd watch this over 99.9% of the junk on TV these days. One could have a field day writing about this show and comparing/contrasting it to The Sopranos.  The Sopranos, a show that I enjoy equally for other reasons (I'm not counting HBO's shows as regular TV shows), is the polar opposite.  That family is rich, profane, powerful, violent, confrontational, unhappy--while the Waltons are struggling (not exactly poor, despite the fact that it takes place during the Depression), wholesome, spiritual, loving, and HAPPY. The only thing I can quibble about The Waltons is the outdoor scenery.  The tall mountains and pine trees are clearly in California, not Piedmont Virginia.  The real Waltons mountain and home is not too far from where I live.  There are signs off U.S. Route 29 directing tourists to the home, which I believe is now a museum.  It may be worth a visit. All in all an excellent program.  Definitely a collector's item.",68 out of 74 found this helpful.,,8 June 2004
2666,The Waltons, Need More TV Shows Like This One,"Both my parents are dead and gone, but where raised in the Southwest mountains of Virginia during the depression, as Baptists, they along with myself and other members of our family watched this show every week. Several of us still watch it every morning, it comes on here at 7 am, it's a great start to my day. Every episode may not be exactly as some remember, that lived during that era, but it's a lot more true to life than most of what is on TV today. It would be nice if there were shows that even came close to this one, made now. Children and grown-ups alike could benefit from acting a little more like the Waltons, than a lot of people they try to imitate from TV in this day and time.",60 out of 66 found this helpful.,,12 July 2004

I remember well his dialogue of introduction and the episode that followed. ""The Waltons"" was well acted, well scripted and very down to earth and touching. I wasn't living during the Depression, but, my parents and my in-laws were and their stories and descriptions of the life back then during those trying times was exactly reinacted in the series ""The Waltons"".

2668,The Waltons," For the television ""snobs"" who just don't get it","I can't help but be amazed at the few individuals who feel compelled to give negative reviews to this totally entertaining television show. It's one thing to accurately note that the quality of some specific episodes weren't up to the normally high standard that had been set by the vast majority, but it's a different matter completely when someone who obviously either hasn't watched any episodes, or who is basing their opinion of the entire series on one or two specific episodes, takes the time to run the series down. In virtually every case of someone taking the time to run down ""The Waltons"", it is obvious from their comments that either they have never seen it, they haven't seen enough of it, or they just ""don't get it"". ""The Waltons"" is fictional entertainment based loosely on the Hamner family's experiences during the thirties and forties (framed mostly against the Great Depression and WWII). It was almost never overly sentimental or ""soppy"" and most who have viewed the series agree that it was generally extremely well acted, written, and produced. There were very few exceptions. My wife and I raised three kids in the seventies and eighties, and ""The Waltons"" was, and is, universally loved and (still) viewed by all of us. The characters are almost like members of our family... and the love, devotion, and family values displayed on that series, became an integral part of the life lessons we chose to make a high priority in the raising of our own children. <br/><br/>The standards generally set for kids today is worlds away from those of just a generation ago, and it's not hard to see why those who were, and are, being raised without benefit of a strong family ethic might see ""The Waltons"" as somewhat ""simple"" and overly sentimental. Thankfully, these people are still in the minority. Most people still ""get it"" and we are forever grateful to the people who were involved in any way with the production of this wonderful television show for giving all of us a standard to which we might aspire even as society in general continues to degrade and cheapen the concept of a nuclear family at every opportunity.<br/><br/>To those who haven't tried it... I suggest that you do so while it is still available. I'm sure that somewhere some group of ""new thinkers"" is trying to outlaw shows like ""The Waltons"" for the very reasons that it became so monumentally popular in the first place. As a country, our standards, morals, and sense of family values is being eroded every day... we parents are very much aware of how hard it is today to instill a sense of right and wrong in our children. ""The Waltons"" made the ""medicine"" go down in the easiest and most effective way... as an integral part of an extremely entertaining TV show that everyone in the family could/can view without a worry that the wrong values might be represented in a positive light. I've seen the entire series multiple times (except the ""reunion specials) and I've never seen an exception to that statement. Again,I invite the ""snobs"" out there to take a look... or even a second look... the vast majority knows what I know... that a very pleasant surprise awaits you if you'll just give ""The Waltons"" a chance.<br/><br/>John Christie<br/><br/>(""Thumbs-down TVLand"" and ""Thumbs-up Hallmark Channel""",89 out of 107 found this helpful.,,21 October 2004
2669,The Waltons, Ironies of Ironies,"This was one of the most popular series on CBS in the mid-1970's and it is one of the most ironic.  This show came one year after CBS's infamous purge of all of its rural comedies.  In 1971 hugely popular shows like The Beverly Hillbillies, Mayberry RFD, Green Acres, He Haw and The Ed Sullivan show were all canceled because of the perception that they didn't appeal to urban dwellers or young people.  Ironically all these shows were still in the top-10 at the time they were canceled.  The next year The Waltons debuted and quickly became one of the most popular shows in the network's history, it even was responsible, in part, for the cancellation of the hugely popular Flip Wilson Show on NBC.  I wonder how Fred Silverman, the man responsible for the purge, felt after this show became a hit.",35 out of 40 found this helpful.,,20 February 2003
2670,The Waltons, Best TV Show in the 1970s,"I watched this show while it was on television in the 1970s. Because I lived in a very urban and hectic setting, it was my solace. I would escape to this show as a psychological refuge - it really was that valuable. I didn't realize it at the time, but this show gave me a kind of hope for humanity that I've not seen on television since. The decay of the American family over the years has demonstrated that even more over time.<br/><br/>I used to look forward to each and every episode, fascinated by John-Boy and his writing. I always loved school and books, and found his writing exploits to be therapeutic and life-changing. It was at this time that I started writing journals. I had the good fortune to run into Richard Thomas in Hollywood after I'd read a book of his poetry. He had become a father to triplets and was very gracious when I mentioned I'd read his book. He was driving a station wagon filled with Pampers while picking up some orange juice at a market near where I lived.<br/><br/>Seeing this family interact among each other was a stark contrast to my own. My mother worked outside the home evenings, and it was my job to co-parent the children that she had with my step-father. As he was the antithesis of Ralph Waite's character, I believe this is part of the reason why this series had such a profound effect upon me. This is ironic, given that my step-father was old enough to be my mother's father. In fact, I'd go so far as to say that perhaps children in challenging familial situations could benefit greatly from viewing this show. Unlike the frothy Brady Bunch, this show presents how the core of a real and loving family could ideally operate.<br/><br/>For sure, the Depression Era setting would make most any modern child grateful for what he or she has today. Just about every earthly family situation is represented, from daily life at that time to careers, courtships, marriages, births, aging, illnesses and deaths.<br/><br/>The integrity of the parents and how they work together as a team is paramount to how this family survives. They also embrace the wisdom of their parents, who reside with them. Each child is nourished in a way that allows each of them to become whom they wish to be. This is the one aspect that mirrors my life, as my own mother was progressive in her thoughts about personal freedom.<br/><br/>The family dynamic between the grandparents is really entertaining and sweet. The program's multi-generational nature accentuates what is usually a bland and forced storyline in family dramas.<br/><br/>The other characters are charming, too, from the store keeper, Ike Godsey, his rather snooty wife, Corabeth, to the elderly Baldwin sisters and their racy ""family recipe"" (moonshine whiskey) which they inherited from their father. While the women in the Walton household are opposed to alcohol, Grandpa would sneak out to visit the Baldwins for a little refreshment. Other wandering characters in the show could include people as diverse as gypsies and circus acrobats, which always shown a sharp contrast to this family-centric show.<br/><br/>The core of this show is definitely the interactions among the family, whose simple structure and financial struggles during the Depression to live a decent life during the Great Depression. The communication and warmth are human qualities that many families today lack and viewing this show could benefit them as an example of what a truly caring family team looks like. Despite the fact that the story took place so long ago, the familial aspects of the show are timeless.",20 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,8 July 2011
2671,The Waltons, Great show,"TV Land is showing the series in sequence (for the most part), and I'm enjoying seeing it again, for only the second time. The acting is excellent, as are the production values. The terrible reunion shows of the 90s did not do justice to the series. They ""messed"" with the chronology, jumping ahead in time, for the sake of historical landmarks, when they should have respected the reality of the series. Granted, the last two seasons were strained, but I am currently viewing Season Six, the first without John-Boy, and it works quite well. Some complain that the series is a 70s version of the 30s/40s, but in 2004, I would not agree. I grew up in Virginia during the 60s, and I definitely feel that the series creators have adequately presented the dignity and attitude of the Southeast. Again, the reunion shows were idiotic. (Did these people never buy new appliances, or pave their driveway? The last reunion, set in 1969, was ridiculous. The characters were ten years younger than they should have been. The youngest child would have been around 41 years old, not 30.)<br/><br/>12/2006 NOTE: The current Walton's home set is NOT the original - just check with the studio.",15 out of 17 found this helpful.,,8 April 2004

But because of the effect the series had on me, I was able to marry and have children, and raise them to have that bond and that love that I did not know was possible until I saw The Walton's.

2675,The Waltons, The Best Family Show to Hit The Airwaves in Its Time,"The year was 1972 when this show hit the air wave on CBS September 14 as a weekly series. The Waltons was based on a large close-knit family living in rural Virginia during the Depression. The Creator Earl Hamner Jr. based the series on his own childhood, which he previously fictionalized in his novel, ""Spencer's Mountain"". The Waltons debuted on with Richard Thomas playing the role of John Boy Walton. In the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, during the Great Depression, the Walton family makes its small income from its saw mill on Walton's Mountain. The story is told through the eyes of John Boy, who wants to be a novelist, goes to college, and eventually fulfills his dream. The saga follows the family through depression and war, and through growing up, school, courtship, marriage, employment, birth, aging, illness and death. This is the true story of the Waltons. The show takes place during the Depression and then during World War II. The other case members were as followed Ralph Waite played the role of John Walton Sr. Michael Learned played the role Oliva Walton, Judy Norton Taylor played the role of Marry Ellen, Jon Walmsley played the role of Jason Walton, Mary Beth McDonough played the role of Erin Walton, Eric Scott played the role of Ben Walton, David Harper played the role of Jim Bob Walton, Kami Cotler played the role of Elizabeth Walton, Will Greer played the role Grandpa and Ellen Corby played the role of Grandma. Other original characters included Joe Conley as general store owner, Ike Godsey, John Crawford as Sheriff Ep Bridges, Mariclare Costello as schoolteacher Miss Rosemary Hunter and Helen Kleeb and Mary Jackson as eccentric sisters-- Mamie and Emily Baldwin, respectively. The Waltons' first season brought critical acclaim and several awards. Both Richard Thomas and Michael Learned took home Best Actor Emmys, Ellen Corby was awarded the Best Supporting Actress honor and the series was given the Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series. The show also earned Emmys for writing and editing in addition to receiving the prestigious Peabody award. The series entered the top-ten in its second season and finished second that year to All in the Family. The show remained in the top twenty for the next few seasons and received several more Emmys, including two more for both Michael Learned and Ellen Corby and a Best Supporting Actor award for Will Geer. In all, The Waltons received 37 Emmy nominations and took home 13 of the golden statuettes. Three reunion movies have been produced in the 1990s for CBS. ""A Walton Thanksgiving Reunion"" (1993), ""A Walton Wedding"" (1995) and ""A Walton Easter"" (1997) all feature the original cast with the exception of the late Will Geer. The series opened in the fall of September 1972 with the first episode titled The Foundling. A six-year old deaf and dumb girl is abandoned on the Walton's doorstep. With loving care they teach her to ""talk"" with sign language. But their kindness to the foundling causes a family crisis. Elizabeth, playing hide-and-seek with the deaf and dumb girl Holly, runs into an old abandoned shack and hides inside an empty trunk, but the lid falls shut and locks itself. Holly sees what has happened and runs to get help but is picked up by her father who doesn't understand sign language and takes her away. John and the family pursue and Holly then tells them by sign language what has occurred, and Elizabeth is rescued in time. Holly's parents now realize that their little girl is not retarded and are now able to communicate with her.

2677,The Waltons, Wholesome,"In the UK, the Waltons was a regular TV feature that marked out the 1970s decade, and - while its story lines contained the contemporary issue of its production time, and sometimes with a grain or two of excessive schmaltz - it remains to this day a remarkable achievement in TV history. I have to admit that my prejudices were foremost in my mind when my Brazilian wife requested me to buy the first four series boxed-set DVDs, and I advised her that I'd buy the first series only to see if she appreciated it before purchasing any more. But I was wrong. She consumed the series and, before long, I was hooked too. Nothing on TV today or or since the Waltons has ever portrayed loving, united and supportive family as courageously as the Waltons. If only I appreciated this when I was a teenager and the series came to a close in the very early 80's. By then, the world and his wife had enough of the Waltons and it was an idea that had outlived its usefulness, giving rise to a number of made-for-TV movies that were generally plot-less and nostalgic. Who would've ever guessed that in a matter of a few decades, after moral decay and worsening family values and a hefty back-catalogue of many TV series that espoused dysfunction and moral ambiguity, that the Waltons would arise like the phoenix from the ashes to entertain families around the world and educate us all in what a loving and united family looks like.<br/><br/>There are several comments that denounce the Waltons, because of its unrealistic portrayal of the Great Depression. They have a point - but nobody really knows how Virginian farming-community families lived during the Great Depression, because all we have are the novels and newspaper reports that focus on the drama and tragedy. In truth, the Waltons indeed do seem to be saved financially at the ninth hour by some act of compassion or sacrifice. But this is the whole point of the show. Unlike today's self-centered, egotistical, morally ambiguous solutions popularized by today's TV shows, the Waltons wasn't about portraying the Great Depression realistically, but about portraying wholesome family life. Sure, maybe such a family is a myth, but it's one worth aspiring to.<br/><br/>However, we mustn't forget that The Waltons depicted not only the Depression but also the struggle to survive for farming communities during the War Years, when the US industrialized. This is often overlooked, but is worth mentioning as it provides a backdrop of a historically important developments in US history. The Waltons simply portrays a world and time that has disappeared.<br/><br/>Every episode is jam-packed with heart and compassion and the Waltons overcome their ordeals through respect and understanding.<br/><br/>It's worth pointing out to the 'realists' out there that the show's pilot is a much more authentic portrayal of the Great Depression, centering around the theme of John Walton returning home through the ice and snow from Richmond to spend Christmas with his family. In that pilot episode, John-Boy and the children are acted by the same cast, however Olivia Walton and John Walton are played by different actors. Throughout the 90-minute screenplay, John-Boy is shown to be wracked by self-doubt and fears for his father's safe return in time for Christmas. The children are lost and forlorn and toil through the wintry conditions. Olivia Walton is haggard, nervy and verging on mental collapse - her character is portrayed as dark and regretful and morose. The entire pilot episode jars the soul and fails to unite as seamlessly as the subsequent series did. It took guts and vision to the producers and sponsors to back the series on the basis of that pilot, and real insight to re-cast Olivia and John Walton and polish up the scripts to focus on functional rather than dysfunctional family life.<br/><br/>Nobody needs reminding of how terrible the Great Depression was or how the evil banks exploited the poor and desperate. We have enough reminders about these facts today. And it's probably a sad fact that even the cast of the show had family-lives that were poor reflections of those they played in the Waltons. Even so, what people need is to see something good and praiseworthy and beautiful, something they can aspire to, rather than earthy, visceral and pessimistic. Nobody created the Waltons to address the sins of the Depression, but to deliver a show about a family where every member of the family is loved, not just by the fictional characters, but also by the viewers. I have to confess it is amazing how at home I feel when I watch an episode and how familiar the Waltons feel to me, almost as if they're extended family to me. Perhaps this is the real genius of the show and why there are so many faithful followers of the show who visit conventions, Waltons Mountain (in California!), and write to the cast and plead for more reunion TV appearances. Sure, I see the odd moment of schmaltz or social commentary, but I recognize it and ignore it in favour of the wholesome values the show espouses.<br/><br/>The Waltons is a gem of TV production that - like good wine - had to stand for a few years before it matured into the product that many value. It deserves to be remembered, re-watched and applauded in the annals of good TV for the sake of generations yet to come. Buy it while you can and cherish it. Future generations will probably become parents who believe that Desperate Housewives, the Sopranos, Confessions of a Call Girl, Six Feet Under, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Cold Case are family-friendly, wholesome productions.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,9 April 2012
2678,The Waltons, Negative Comments over the Years,"One of the most air-headed comments over the years has been ""This series does not in anyway depict the average depression era family."" I heard this comment just recently by a talk show host talking about 70's TV shows. Well, duh!, it depicts the depression era family of Earl Hamner the show's creator and has nothing to do with ""the average depression era American family."" How even some supposed TV critics came up with that for a reason to be negative against the show has always puzzled me. The show was as I understand it true to life for the area around Schuyler, VA., the home of Earl Hamner. A couple of the characters on the show were composites of his actual siblings (he had one more sibling than the Waltons). A special that aired in the late 1970's united his real brothers and sisters with their TV counterparts. The program is hugely successful worldwide and I'm glad that most comments are by and large supportive of the show and always have been save for that few who can't get their facts straight.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,11 June 2008

2681,The Waltons," Not the Typical Glamorous People on Television, Honest Look at Depression Era Life","In the entertainment industry today, most casting directors want the extraordinary looks first, and then if that's present, the acting skills are then evaluated. The Walton's television series of the 1970's was an extraordinary exception. Almost none of the cast had the looks of the typical 1970's to early 1980's television stars like, Jacqueline Smith, Lee Majors, Joan Collins or Farrah Fawcett. Seeing an old woman with her granddaughter sitting at the family table and preparing beans for the family meal is something which will never be seen again on American television in the foreseeable future. They say grace at meals, and they attend the local protestant church. (Interestingly, European television shows portray more ""ordinary"" people.) <br/><br/>The Waltons are middle-class people living during the Great Depression in the 1930's. Their clothes are ordinary and even drab. The women wear very little makeup, and they drive average cars from the period. They live in a humble two-story house with small bedrooms, a kitchen and eating area. Occasionally they listen to the radio dramas at night. They don't wear furs or silk, drive in Cadillacs, and reside in a large luxury manor whose entryway is larger than most people's apartments. This was probably the most honest portrayal of a middle class family ever to air on television. The characters of the show engage in regular work: preparing meals, chopping down trees, and buying goods at the local general store. Within this show were interesting stories often centered on some kind of stranger staying with the Waltons during the course of an episode. <br/><br/>The character at the heart of the show was John-Boy Walton (played by Richard Thomas), loosely based on the series' writer-creator Earl Hamner. John-Boy is an aspiring writer, and at the beginning of each episode, the voice of Earl Hamner tells the story of the Waltons as if looking back to his past. The Waltons was loosely based on Hamner's experiences growing up in depression-ear Virginia. Other characters of note are John Walton Sr. (Ralph Waite), Olivia Walton (Michael Learned), Grandpa (Will Geer), Grandma (Ellen Corby), and John-Boy's brothers and sisters. <br/><br/>Other supporting characters lived around the town, such as Ike Godsey and his wife at the General store, and two spinster sisters who are the wealthiest of the locals. The Waltons and their surrounding community are Protestant Christians who frown on things like alcohol, even though most likely the story is set just after Prohibition. Every once in awhile, Grandpa, my favorite character of the show, would spike lemonade with a ""secret formula"" and then plead innocence when it was found out. One Walton trademark which kind of entered into the American lexicon is the voice-overs which occur at the end of each episode where the characters speak about what they experienced, a bit like the ending jokes of many television westerns and even Star Trek. The voice-overs always occurred with a birds-eye view of the Waltons' house at night with a couple of the windows still lit. Then after all the good-nights were said, the light in the windows would dim. (I remember seeing a Mad Magazine spoof of Star Trek with an illustration of the hull of the ship, and the captions read: ""Good night Captain. Good night Mr Spock. Good night John-Boy."")<br/><br/>One of the few television series which portrays a family dealing with the real issues of family life in the 1930's. Not glamorous, not beautiful, but very real. If you're interested in seeing something of substance, try the Waltons.

I don't even listen to what the characters are saying because I'm so busy watching his delivery and the nuances that he gives his character. This series is an amazing study in acting rather than family values and a former time. Without Ralph Waite in this series it would be a dead loss. It just shows you that dialogue does not necessarily carry a series, but good acting that reaches down into the soul of the character certainly does.",7 out of 13 found this helpful.,,12 January 2005
2684,The Waltons," Good show, good acting. I still like it.","I remember watching The Waltons in the 90's when I was little. I recently started watching it again and I still like it. Sometimes they remind me of my family.I like how everything doesn't have any easy answer. Everything's not all black and white. The mom and dad are cute together and the grandparents are too even though grandma is always scolding grandpa. I think John Walton is one of the best TV dads because hes not stereotypical or one-dimensional. He's good, kind, hard working guy. Perhaps I'm biased because John-Boy is and always has been my favorite character. But the earlier seasons are infinitely better. I don't really understand how they could get away with continuing the show after Richard Thomas left because I thought John-Boy was the main character. Somethings missing after Richard Thomas left and no one can take his place. I feel like everyone is kind of waiting around for John-Boy to come back. In some episodes it seems like they make an attempt to have Jason take his place but it just doesn't work. Maybe they should have ended the series after Richard Thomas left. They definitely shouldn't have tried to have someone else play John-Boy. Don't get me wrong, it's not that there weren't any good episodes without John-Boy there just weren't as many great ones. As afore mentioned, John-Boy is my favorite character. I love his artistic personality and that he loves reading and poetry too (and not just to attract girls). He's a sweet, intelligent, caring guy (Why don't I ever meet anyone like that?). Pretty awesome character. He sure has a lot of girl friends which isn't that hard to understand. But I don't understand why it never works out because he's a nice guy. I always thought he was cute, and I get made fun of for this, but I still do. Anyways, good show and for the most part, I don't think it's sappy like some reviewers have said.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,1 July 2011
2685,The Waltons, The Great Depression Doesn't Get Any Better,"This show is about a large rural family during the Great Depression and WW II set in the Blue Ridge Mountains. When the show starts out most of the kids in the family don't wear shoes. The episodes with Richard Thomas as John Boy Walton are the strongest. He plays the oldest of the Walton children, who wants to eventually leave the family home so he can become a writer who wears shoes. Eventually Richard Thomas leaves the series presumably because he was tired of people coming up to him on the street and saying, ""Aren't you, John Boy?"" After Richard Thomas' departure the series loses its focus a bit, but the kids end up wearing shoes more often. Eventually most of the adult figures of the Walton household vanish under somewhat mysterious circumstances and the kids have the whole house and mountain to themselves. At this point they are wearing shoes all the time. The last episode has them throwing a giant party featuring ten kegs of beer and an unlimited supply of the Baldwin sister's recipe. Okay, The Walton kids would never throw a kegger, but it is still a warmly entertaining show to watch, especially during the shoeless years.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,14 January 2005

I understand that Victorious is designed for a younger audience, but let's be honest, it's easily one of the most quirky and just flat-out enjoyable nic shows out there. Yes it's a touch over-dramatic and can be pretty corny, but that's all part of the show's charm. It's like the love-child of Community, Glee, and one of the other nic shows like, I dunno, iCarly - and that, as it turns out, is a pretty killer combination. All of the cast members are so talented. From musicality to comedic timing, they've got it all. All of the characters are unique and interesting - particularly Cat and Sikowitz.<br/><br/>Okay, I guess I'll stop ranting.

I hope Nickelodeon changes their mind but it's highly unlikely, even though it's the most popular show they have right now, if I read correctly.

2718,Victorious," ""Victorious"" is just that - ""Victorious""","I think I can make this comment short &amp; sweet:<br/><br/>In the new Nickelodeon teen comedy show ""Victorious,"" Tori Vega (Victoria Justice) enrolls at a prestigious performing arts school after taking her older sister's place in a singing contest and just absolutely wowing the audience, not to mention herself, with her singing abilities. Hilarity ensues as she tries to adjust to life at the school and learn to harness her talents in an artistic and professional manner. And we also get to know some of her friends and enemies at the school, all of whom are also quite likable and colorful, including a nerdy guy with a fast-talking puppet.<br/><br/>Series creator Dan Schneider (""All That,"" ""Zoey 101,"" ""Drake &amp; Josh"" and my personal favorite, ""iCarly"") has yet another hit on his hands with his latest, ""Victorious,"" which is obviously meant to be the breakout role of star Victoria Justice, in her first starring role. I watched ""All That"" in the few precious years before Nickleodeon began its descent into idiocy in the late 1990s; I never watched ""Zoey 101,"" but I do remember Victoria Justice from the ""iCarly"" movie ""iFight Shelby Marx.""<br/><br/>One of Schneider's gifts as an entertainer is that he knows his audience and stars better than anyone else in the business. Being a former child actor himself, he knows his audience and empathizes with them and knows what works and what doesn't. He knows how to make his audience laugh without pandering to them or insulting their intelligence. Someone from a vastly different background making this show couldn't do what he does in making teen comedy shows funny, compelling, and continually interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Being that I'm in my mid-20s, I grew up watching Nick when it was still in its prime in the mid-'90s, and many of its greatest-ever shows are no longer on the air, unfortunately, and have been relegated to mere childhood memories. Shows like ""iCarly"" and ""Victorious,"" in my opinion, are able to give this fledgling network some semblance of credibility in trying to reel in lapsed viewers from better days gone by. And this is why I'm continually impressed by ""iCarly"" and ""Victorious,"" because they're entertaining, sweet, innocent, and funny - just like some of the older shows no longer on the air were back in the day.<br/><br/>Like Miranda Cosgrove in ""iCarly,"" Justice proves to be a spunky, fresh, and likable young talent to keep an eye on. And like some of her other peers, she can sing (how long will it be before she releases her first CD?). In my opinion, she and Miranda Cosgrove could definitely give other teen singing sensations of the moment like Miley Cyrus a run for their money.<br/><br/>Although I'm only two episodes in, I know that Dan Schneider has another teen comedy success on his hands. Victoria Justice is primed to become another teen star like some of her other cohorts on other popular Nick shows. What I can say about this show is that it is indeed very funny, and Schneider and company definitely better keep up the good work, or else!<br/><br/>10/10",48 out of 68 found this helpful.,10.0,18 April 2010

It will not make you laugh out loud in every single episode especially in the first season,but it is relaxing and funny and the characters are really interesting and unique. Also,as the seasons pasted the comedy felt more effortless and it was improving,eventually making me laugh and smile through the episodes.It helped me through a difficult time by reminding me that you have to try hard for your dreams,respect your friends and even enemies and have fun in life. It might not seem that deep,but every single episode has some kind of moral and Dan manages to show little advices for kids and adults with his one of a kind amusing way,without the audience even realizing it.

Only....I'm amazed at how much I am genuinely enjoying it! True, parts of this show haven't aged well....at all. But, it has some truly funny moments, catchy songs, and the cast had great chemistry overall. And of course it's fascinating to see Ariana Grande shine as Cat Valentine in the days before her mega stardom/success.

2724,Victorious, Best Nickelodeon Series Yet!,"For those users who submitted a low review on Victorious, their expectations were most likely a little off. I don't know what they expected. As a 20 year old guy and long time Disney Channel and Nickelodeon fan, Victorious has been by far one of my favorite sitcoms. The humor in this show is geared towards the mid to older teenage audience, for both guys and girls. <br/><br/>The cast members are all naturally talented and well above average actors/actresses and musicians (As a college music major who has taken music lessons for 17 years, I would know. Trust me, these kids can sing). Generally speaking, in comparison to other Disney and Nick actors/actresses, the Victorious cast members are naturally better performers overall. Each cast member executes their lines perfectly, whether in attempt to create a cheesy, sad/heartfelt, or hysterical moment. Sure, the show has its corny moments, but that's exactly what the director wants. The connection the cast establishes with the viewers make them feel as if they actually had a personal relationship with the other.<br/><br/>Dan Schneider does an outstanding job with this series. Each new episode takes the audience on a new adventure with the cast, charming the audience and leaving them wanting to see more at the end of each episode. He also does an outstanding job utilizing different guest stars/actors, as well as different stage sets, conditions, and environments for the cast to utilize. Watch this series! You will NEVER get bored. My only wish is that they could have extended the production of the series in order to allow for a proper series finale.",13 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,29 November 2013

There is also no talking back to adults in this show (although they make the adults such fools). The reason this show is called ""Victorious"" is because it's ""victorious"" in quality over all the other Nick shows. It is my #1 favorite show, next to Jessie (on Disney Channel). I wish the two had crossed despite being on separate channels though.

2728,Victorious," Victorious, characters and opinions...","I like the show Victorious. I think it's a nice family show that most can enjoy watching. The script is usually quite witty and often it has includes some humor that all ages can enjoy. I think that Victorious is more enjoyable for people over, let's say, 13 to watch, than say iCarly. As for the characters and actors, Victoria Justice isn't a favorite of mine. She's clearly improved since the first season but I still find her character annoying and not likable. I end up relating and having more compassion to Jade (Liz Gillies) who's meant to be the mean girl that nobody likes. I think that Liz and Ariana really carries the entire show from time to time. I love Cat (Ariana Grande) as a character. She's very likable, cute and funny. Although I like the chemistry between Liz and Avan Jogia, Avan's character Beck I feel is very plain. Another funny character, played by the very funny actress Danielle Monet, is Trina who is Tori's crazy, untalented and unpopular sister who also ends up being more likable than Tori in the end (at least for me). I don't really pay much attention to the other characters like Andre (Leon Thomas) or Robbie (Matt Bennett) they aren't really the characters that bring on the most chuckles. Another quirky and funny character is Sinjin (Mike Reid) who plays this really weird character but still remains funny. Another mentionable character is the kids teacher Sikowitz (Eric Lange) that guy is hilarious! He's such a good actor!",14 out of 22 found this helpful.,9.0,7 July 2012
2729,Victorious, Another solid effort from Dan Schneider,"After launching his career as the creative force behind All That, Dan Schneider has gone on to create some of Nickelodeon and TeenNick's best and most well-known programs, including The Amanda Show, Drake &amp; Josh, Zoey 101, and iCarly. His latest effort is Victorious, a Nickelodeon sitcom starring teen idol Victoria Justice. Known primarily for her supporting role in Zoey 101 and starring in the iCarly movie, iFight Shelby Marx, her first lead role in a television series finds her as Victoria ""Tori"" Vega, an easily likable high student whose talent is obvious to everyone but herself. After her naive sister is unable to perform at her art school's annual talent show, Victoria unwillingly takes the stage, wows the crowd, and, eventually leaves her ""normal"" high school to enroll at the fictional Hollywood Arts High School. From the very first day, it's clear: the transition will be a difficult one, thanks to the inherent irregularities that come with such a process, but ultimately necessary to achieving her lifelong dream.<br/><br/>Victorious adds little to Schneider's patented formula--the characters are still a bit odd, their dialogue quirky, and the situations they find themselves always more absurd than reasonable. Fans of Schneider's previous works will be right at home here, but unless you find Victoria Justice's character a more effective protagonist than, say, Zoey Brooks or Carly Shay, those who find shows like these predictable and cliché will likely retain the same opinion.",19 out of 32 found this helpful.,7.0,31 March 2010
2730,Victorious, Victorious is most definitely victorious!,"I love this show! During the age where kids are obsessed with celebrities, this shows a high school where stars are made, making the trend relatable and fun! The show includes old favorites, like Victoria Justice, and talented new faces like Elizabeth Gillies and Ariana Grande! Plus, the hit-maker Dan Schneider is the creator of this show, which is sure to make it a win! His previous shows have been hits in my book, and I'm sure this is no different. One thing I've noticed is that this show is probably for an older audience than iCarly, Schneider's other hit show, since the students seem to be older and one of the main characters, Beck, shared a kiss at least 3 times during the episode, all of them seemingly passionate. However, I have no problem with it, but I was surprised as Schneider normally steers clear of offending people, and we all know there are some overprotective parents out there! I can't wait for the rest of the season to come April 11, as this is a show I will definitely watch alongside my kids!",21 out of 37 found this helpful.,10.0,29 March 2010

2732,Victorious, Awesome cast + Dan Schneider = AWESOME show,"Vitorious is the perfect show for teens that just want to laugh after a dull week. Victoria Justice (Tori) is meant to play her role, she's a great actress, and apparently a good singer too. Daniella Monet (Trina) is an awesome actress, she could have easily gotten the role of Rachel in FRIENDS if so ever she was born a couple of more years earlier, plus she's really hilarious. The extremely talented and cute Ariana Grande (Cat) fits her role perfectly. She's probably my favorite of all because of her ridiculous cuteness and great talent, or maybe because she was a Broadway star... The first time I saw Leon Thomas III (Andre) was on iSave TV on iCarly, even then I thought he was an awesome guy, and now on Victorious he seems even more awesome. Liz Gillies (Jade) can really put on the villain vibe and plays her character really well.<br/><br/>For the rest of cast I cant tell yet because the show is still so young, but I think they'll be as good as the others maybe even better.<br/><br/>Dan Schneider made another AWESOME show, with the best teen actors/actresses I've ever seen. Other shows from Disney are no match for Victorious. It has lots of assorted comedy, brilliant acting, great talents, well written scripts, and creative writers, if you're looking for a good show on Nick watch Victorious.<br/><br/>10 stars for VicTORIous, and I love the title...",19 out of 36 found this helpful.,10.0,23 April 2010

Same style of humor, same jokes, same writers, same creator, just with a different cast and place. Now I'm not saying that's a bad thing, its actually a very good thing! This show is not laugh out loud funny (at least not for a teenage boy like me) but it is entertaining when nothing else is on. Personally I prefer Drake and Josh and iCarly over this so far, but hopefully during it's second season it hits it's stride. The highest point of the show is the star Victoria Justice. She's probably the funniest and most talented of all of the cast members (not to mention she's hot)!",13 out of 23 found this helpful.,9.0,6 August 2010

Some of the situations the characters find themselves in are kind of strange, but it makes for good comedy. Even the adult characters like Sikowitz and Lane are written pretty good and not forgettable (unlike most current sitcoms). Finally this show has some superb acting from every cast member, even the guy who plays Rex!

The writing is surprisingly funny in a weird sort of way(one of the main character is literally a ""urban"" puppet.) The acting from the kids is fine and obviously it includes a lot of breakout stars like Ariana Grande.

I've been watching nickelodeon for a long time and I've loved Victoria Justice since she was on Zoey 101 and I think its a must see for anyone who likes Zoey 101 and iCarly. In my opinion its the best show Dan Schneider has ever created. I even think this show is better than Disney channel's sonny with a chance. From now on I will watch Victorious every Sunday night instead of sonny with a chance.This is now my new favorite show. I think Cat (Ariana Grande) is the funniest one on the show!

2752,The Vineyard, Wonderful Interesting Story,"The Vineyard is a series that really is exceptional at keeping your interest and making you want to go on and watch another episode when you really need to stop. I actually watched it all in three days which may seem like a lot to some people, but is far beyond my usual pace.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the drama, adventure, and how so many lives are always affected by others. The beauty of the scenery and the lovely visuals of the time enchants the mind and you quickly fall in love with the story being told.<br/><br/>This production was originally in Spanish so the American version converted to English has a few faults that you totally recognize, but can get past because of the wonderful advancing plot.<br/><br/>The English dubbing sounds way to much like a bad 1970's karate movie with the high pitched voices and dull delivered dialogue. At least the speaking is in sync with the words being spoken and you don't have to see the mouth move then the words like some English dubbed movies.<br/><br/>Some of the lines are a little corny and ridiculous and as I mentioned above are spoken in a weird abnormal way. Still this is a tremendous story of two people never destined to meet that cross paths finally through their dealings with so many other people in their lives.<br/><br/>The villains are quite sneaky and mean and it pushes our heroes to limits that they probably would've never thought they would be capable of.

2758,Full House, Alright! T.G.I.F-Friday!,"I remember the days when I couldn't wait for Friday, I was just 2 years old when Full House began, but I remember for some odd reason just watching this show from day one. Full House has always brought back great memories for me, it's the one show I absolutely loved as a child and couldn't miss. I think because I always wanted to be apart of the Tanner family, they always seemed to have it together, have fun, and could solve any problem within half an hour, lol. Now, I still watch the show, I admit, it's an ultimate guilty pleasure. But I think I have a different out look on the show now.<br/><br/>At the time when 80's comedy shows came, it seemed like the popular thing was the single dad bit. Danny Tanner is a widowed father who has three young beautiful daughters: DJ(Donna Joe), Stephanie, and Michelle. His rock and roll brother in law, Jesse, comes to help him out having to abandon his living on the edge life style to take care of his little nieces. And Joey, Danny's life long best friend also moves in, a struggling comedian who brings a little humor and kindness to the family. Together they all go through life and it's little problems, but shows the bright side to each one.<br/><br/>The positives about this show is that it always had good morals, in some sick way, I think this helped me stay as a clean cut kid. It had typical problems that a lot of people knew how to relate too, including for kids growing up. The humor was also a plus, yeah, it's a bit cheesy at times compared to today's sitcoms, but it's still in all good fun like Leave It To Beaver style. Also many people could easily love most of the characters on the show or could relate to them. I always loved Stephanie personally, she always made me laugh and just seemed like the person I'd like to be friends with.<br/><br/>The negatives, problems were solved a little too well, where it could make you believe life was that easy, or at least you would wish it to be so. Then some of the characters got a little annoying, like Michelle, she went from a cute little baby to a spoiled brat, and the show became more about her in the later seasons, which I didn't appreciate. Then the twins that Jesse and Rebecca had were again little brats that were more annoying than cute.<br/><br/>But this show is a huge hit with our pop culture, it still plays on TV today. It also had major career boosts for John Stamos and of course, the Olsen twins. This is a very fun show that will always bring back awesome memories for me. I still watch it, I honestly have driven my mother insane with Full House, I probably will drive my children insane with it as well, but I can't help it, this is a fun show that I think is an honest classic. It always makes you feel good about yourself and about life, as cheesy as that sounds, you'll like it, I'm sure.",98 out of 106 found this helpful.,,11 January 2004
2759,Full House, One of the best family shows ever !,"Full House is a funny,yet emotional show. The show tells you how an unnormal family can come over some normal everyday life problems. It's a show you could watch over, and over, but never get bored. If you like watching these shows look for Season 1,2, and 3 on DVD. You can also look for Season 4 on DVD August 15 2006. You can find these DVD's anywhere from Walmart to your local mall. The DVD'S usually range from $25.00 - $30.00. The cast in the show make it even better, which includes the now famous Mary-Kate, and Ashley. So if you like shows like 7th Heaven, Family Matters, or any other family friendly shows Full House is for you. This show wasn't the family oriented show it is now in the start it was supposed to be more focused on Danny,Joey, and Jesse. I think it was a better move on ABC's part to switch it to a family sitcom. The show went off the air in 1995, but you can still catch it on ABC Family, and Nick@Nite. It's on ABC Family on normal weekdays at 12:00 PM EDT, and 3:00 PM EDT. It's on Nick@Nite on normal weekdays at 9:00 PM EDT, and 5:00 AM EDT. Also it has Friday night marathons of Full House from 10:00 PM till 2:00 AM in the summer only. Besides those times it usually is not on.

And one golden retriever named Comet. Other characters include Danny's girlfriend Vicky, DJ's air-headed but hilarious best friend Kimmy Gibbler who often walks in uninvited, and DJ's constantly eating boyfriend Steve.<br/><br/>Typically an episode involves one of the characters (typically one of the girls) having a problem and one of the family members (usually Danny) talking with them about their problem. In the eight years that Full House was on, the show dealt with issues such as drinking, peer pressure, smoking, child abuse, first crushes, the loss of loved ones, shoplifting, embarrassing moments, learning to drive, coping with disappointment, responsibiliy, dating, and even sex.<br/><br/>We all remember when Stephanie accidentally drove Joey's beloved car into the kitchen.

2762,Full House, Full House will live forever!,"I have never seen a show as good as Full House. Full House puts all of the newer shows to shame, big time! Anyone who has never seen it, which I don't see how it is possible, should see it. It is a great show for anyone of any age. Full House will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will amaze you. True, some people feel that there are some ""cheesy"" aspects to the show, but, the positive aspects out weigh all of the ""cheesy"" aspects. Full House ran it's first episode on September 22, 1987 entitled ""Our Very First Show"" and ran it's last episode on May 23, 1995 entitled ""Michelle Rides Again Part II"".<br/><br/>The plot of the show is very believable. Danny Tanner (Bob Saget) losses his wife, Pam, in an accident involving a drunk driver. Danny has his brother in law, Jesse Katsopolis (John Stamos), which is Pam's younger brother, and Danny also brings in his best friend Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier) to help him raise his three daughters. Danny's daughters are named DJ (Candice Cameron-Bure), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and Michelle (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen).Joey and Jesse plan on moving in with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years; which is the number of years the show ran for.<br/><br/>The following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor/actress who played him/her: John Stamos (Jesse): John Stamos is a great actor. He plays Jesse. Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break. In Full House, John Stamos does a great job portraying his character. He looked and played music like his idol, Elvis Presley.<br/><br/>Bob Saget (Danny): Bob Saget is also a great actor. He looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver. He has to raise three girls without a having the girl's Mother. Bob Saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls.<br/><br/>Dave Coulier (Joey): One word can describe Dave Coulier, funny. He is great. Playing the character of Joey was perfect for him. He does a great job playing the stand-up comedian waiting for his big break.<br/><br/>Candice Cameron-Bure (DJ): She is a tremendous actress. She plays the oldest sister, DJ which is short for Donna Jo. She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen. Her acting ability in Full House was very believable.<br/><br/>Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie): Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin, incredibly amazing! I wish I could say every thing that I would like to say about Jodie, but, I would use up the 1,000 word maximum just on her. She got her start in a kids show called Mother Goose Stories and when she came to Full House, she blew the audience's and creator's mind. Her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was. According to Dave Coulier, Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show. It was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break. Jodie, at five years old when the show first aired, could hit every line perfectly. She showed great enthusiasm. Most young kids can't do this. As you can probably guess, Jodie Sweetin (Stephanie) is my favorite character in Full House.<br/><br/>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen (Michelle): Great actress. Full House is where they got their start. They received the part of Michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera.<br/><br/>There are many more cast members that should be recognized. These are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987.<br/><br/>The only negative thing that I can say is how Full House became The Michelle Show towards the end. I think it was to focused on her towards the end. Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting.<br/><br/>Full House is a great show for everyone. It can teach you a lot. One of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy, such as loosing a family member, occurs. Full House continues to attract new fans. With all this said, there is only a couple things left to say; Full House will never die, and, thank you, the cast of Full House, for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy.",41 out of 49 found this helpful.,10.0,8 February 2007

That's the message kids should be getting from TV now a days, turn to your family for help, not to drugs. Kids should be watching more shows like Full House instead of half the mess on TV now a days.<br/><br/>I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth. It talks about real life problems and family matters. There is always a lesson you can learn from the show.<br/><br/>I vote the show a 10.",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,16 January 2007
2765,Full House, I Love It!,"I think Full House was and still IS a great show! It is family-safe and you are always guaranteed a good laugh at SOMETHING, whether it be Jesse's comments to Danny...Kimmy's rude behavior...it's just a hilarious show. The plot is very believable. A father of 3 daughters who's wife dies from a drunk driving accident, so the father calls his brother-in-law and best friend to help him out a bit. This show isn't a normal sitcom. It's the #1 sitcom. If you don't fall in love with this show, you'll fall in love with one of the actors. Almost everyone who watches Full House has a favorite character. Mine is John Stamos (Uncle Jesse) I'm telling you all, watch this show!! It makes you laugh, cry, and go ""WOW! That was so corny!"" It's 30 minutes well spent. That's why I give Full House 5 stars! Watch this show everyone. It's worth it.",69 out of 92 found this helpful.,,26 October 2004
2766,Full House, A show that will go on forever,"I really think ""Full House"" is going to the next ""Brady Bunch"" when it comes to longevity.  Even after it's final episode in 1995, you can catch at least four episodes of it daily on cable TV.  Kids love this show and it's easy to see why.  It's inoffensive, very cute and of course, the Olsen girls bring in the audience.<br/><br/>Most people will say that FH was the cheesiest show ever made.  While the last 1-2 seasons were borderline horrific, in my opinion, it wasn't that bad a show.  Being a year younger than Candace Cameron, I followed this show from its first episode and watched until the final episode.  It was one of the last true family shows of the 90's and was unfortunately replaced with the trash we see today.  It made the child actors a big part of the show; Michelle had her own storylines starting at 2 years old.  Compare that to child sitcom actors nowadays who are basically props or part of the background.  I also admire how Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen played Michelle for the entire series when in most cases, baby actors are dumped after a year or two.  I really didn't care much for the adults on the show; I won't go into detail of their annoyances because I'll never shutup. <br/><br/>
The show ran 8 seasons, which is pretty good.  I'm glad the show ended when it did because it was tanking by the 8th season.  The boy twins weren't nearly as good at being cute as Michelle was.  Michelle was too old to be cute, so the writers turned her into a smart aleck ""Stephanie jr"". Stephanie lost her smart mouth to Michelle and pretty much lost her entire personality and became boring.  D.J. was too responsible to be funny anymore.  And the adults had all gotten worse as the years went by.  Still, kids are going to be watching this show in reruns for years and I think it's because kids like watching other kids.  That's why the ""Brady Bunch"" has done so well with each new generation and I don't see ""Full House"" stopping anytime soon.",32 out of 42 found this helpful.,,29 April 2002
2767,Full House, The First Season was the best.,"I have to tell you, I really liked this show, but I only REALLY liked this show in the First Season. I love the episodes with Joey, Danny, and Jesse as the main characters. They were the funniest characters in the show. But when the kids grew up, there was suddenly a second plot in most episodes. Then it suddenly stopped being as funny as when there were a few main characters. But it was still pretty funny. I'm not saying that it's not good in the later seasons, it's just not AS good. It's all funny, but the First Season is the funniest. I still love the show after 17 years. Watch it when you get the chance, especially when it's the First Season, I love those episodes! I give the show overall an 8.5/10",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,,6 July 2004
2768,Full House, Really Really Really sweet and wonderful show,"Well what can I say about Full House. It was, is and always will be favorite show of all time. There was something really really special about Full House. It wasn't like any other show. Usually now we see shows filled with mindless and adult humor, but this was something everyone, from a 2 year old child to a 70 year old grandparent could enjoy. People could relate to the love, compare the small and day to day problems to their own. It was amazingly sweet. It had a magical feel towards it which, in my opinion no other show will ever have.<br/><br/>Various critics have termed the show as overly sweet or too good to be true. Something as a perfect family. It IS partly true. But I believe that this over sweetness made the people feel more happy watching the show. It was certainly not corny and cheesy as many other shows and movies are. You wouldn't feel like gagging in any of the Full House episodes.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just being nostalgic but my heart flutters at any mention of Full House or something related to it. Full House created an impact in not only America but around the whole world where it was and still is telecasted. It provided a happy heaven or secure bubble for people who were feeling low. The Full House family was and is the Worlds Family. Everyone associated with Full House was and is special. Be it the cameraman or the whole cast. They were all special. Full House is something as falling in love. This may and probably does sound really really corny and cheesy but thinking about watching Full House brings back good memories and makes you feel happy and nostalgic. I hope anyone who watched the show enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Full House along with humor provided daily lessons which a child and an adult may familiarize themselves with. It didn't face as major problems as people expected it to, but really there are very few families who face as major problems as people expected it too.<br/><br/>People grew up and still do grow up watching Full House. I hope there is a reunion show again.",51 out of 72 found this helpful.,10.0,16 May 2006

I know so many people loved her, but I just got a bad feeling from her. I loved Becky, she seemed like such a sweet person. In general the show always had a wonderful message and its so refreshing in a world of trashy TV. it's too bad there aren't sitcoms like this anymore. With regards to Joey, he was okay but sometimes I just felt like saying ""grow up"". I really loved DJ and Stephanie, they seemed like sweet girls. Steve was major hot. I really loved how Jesse and Becky's relationship was so caring and sweet. Its so wonderful that Becky would sacrifice living in a house just for them so he could be closer to his family.

2770,Full House, Mind Numbingly Bland but I LOVE it!,"In this crazy world in which we live full of overwhelming/underpaid jobs, prejudice/hate, rape/murder, war/torture, and those nutty quirky politicians, we need something to watch to get away from it all. You need something so mind numbingly stupid and bland to put yourself into a quiet peaceful vegetative state.<br/><br/>In the world of ""FULL HOUSE"" their most terrible disaster would mean nothing to us. Golly, Jessie has a gig tonight and after using his new hair spray his hair won't cooperate! OMG, DJ and the most popular girl wore the same dress to the BIG dance!! Yikes, Michelle is helping Joey do the laundry and used too much soap!!! Don't worry people; it all will work out in the end. PHEW!!!!<br/><br/>The characters of ""FULL HOUSE"" are just too much. Uncle Jessie with all that hair and strutting like Elvis was just sooooo cool. Uncle Joey just says the funniest things and Danny tries just so gosh darn hard to be a good dad. Then you have those wonderful girls. DJ tries to act like a grown up and know it all, but really still needs help from her Uncles and Dad. Stephanie is just so cute and perky but always has her opinions. Then of course it's those ""I wanna pinch those cheeks cause their so darn precious"" twins. Boy has those Olsen's grown. Danny, get them some food because they are WAY too thin!!<br/><br/>Of course the acting and writing would never win anyone any Emmy's, but ""FULL HOUSE"" wasn't trying to prove anything except that they were a wholesome family show and it was.

I saw this episode when they have to clean the house for their mothers, (Joey, Danny, and Jesse have to clean) and they are cleaning and singing and it was just plain funny. This show is great and I wish it was still airing. WHY? WHY!!! Also may I point out the boy friends. Nelson (Jason Marsden), and Viper (no idea) and Steve (no idea) are great.

2772,Full House, An absolute ABC classic!,"""FULL HOUSE,"" in my opinion, is an absolute ABC classic! I'm not sure if I've never seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it. One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse (John Stamos) and Rebecca (Lori Loughlin) get married. If you want to know how what made it so funny, you'd have to have seen it for yourself. It was a two-parter, so you'd have to have seen both parts. Another one of my favorite episodes is where Jesse, Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin), and Michelle (Mary Kate &amp; Ashley Olsen) get locked in a gas station on Michelle's birthday. You'd also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened. I have many other ones that I like, too. Everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,22 January 2006
2773,Full House, One of the BEST shows ever!,"This show was excellent! It is one of my favorite shows of all time, and was great for people of all ages. My favorite character was always the middle child, Stephanie. I guess you could say that she and I grew up together, because we were the same age, and she and I had a lot in common. She was played by the very talented young actress, Jodie Sweetin.<br/><br/>As a child, this show taught me quite a bit. It had many different parts to it such as happy times, sad times, adventurous parts, and most of all, extremely hilarious scenes! Every now and then, I continue to watch re-runs, and can see it from an adult's point of view. I get a kick out of every character. <br/><br/>After Danny's wife died, his brother in-law Jesse moved in to help raise the girls, along with Danny's best friend Joey. Although Danny was kind of strange, he was a very kind man, and was an excellent father. Jesse was a pretty cool guy, although was often kind of grouchy. He really improved his life by moving in and helping raise the girls, and even met a lovely woman who he married. Played by the beautiful and talented actress Lori Loughlin, Rebecca began as Danny's co-host when he was promoted from sports caster, to a morning talk show host. Jesse got to know Rebecca, and they married and had two twin boys. Joey was very good friends with Danny, and I got a kick out of him! He was into comedy, and was a kid at heart, but a great guy. The oldest girl D.J was an excellent big sister to Stephanie and Michelle, and I always wished my sister had been that great! Stephanie was a great girl, very smart, and funny. Michelle (played by the Olsen twins) was extremely smart, and was always so cute! She was extremely fun to watch, and I still enjoy watching the re-runs of her growing up. I often become a kid at heart watching this show, but as an adult, it gives me some good ideas for when I'm a father someday. It ran for eight years, and should have run longer! It was so much fun to watch the kids grow up, and grow up with them as I watched it all those years, as well as seeing the adults improve themselves.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10, I give this show a 10, and a grade A! If you like a good comedy with lots of laughs, as well as learning experiences, I highly recommend this great show for you!",85 out of 142 found this helpful.,,11 August 2001
2774,Full House, A Wonderful Show,"I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven. Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had ""more important"" things to do. Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too ""girly."" <br/><br/>Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it. Full House has made me laugh and cry. It's made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mom. I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable. But look at the big picture: three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver. The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt. The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times. What's any more real than that? <br/><br/>If anything the show has lifted me up when I'm down and brought me up even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness. I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. (Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies I have ever seen. They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people.)",51 out of 82 found this helpful.,10.0,15 May 2006

My favorite character was always Stephanie, although the Olsen twins are more my age. The network used to show back-to-back episodes every weekday on WGN after school (right after Blossom) and I was in my glory. Much like the X-Files, I went through a stage in my life where everything was Full House related. I even went so far as to tape it. Kimmy Gibler was a favorite of mine, probably because she was such a weirdo and makes me think of many people I know. Never cared for D.J. or Michelle very much and sadly Danny reminds me a lot of my mother who is also detergent crazy.

2782,Full House, Rather bland and irritating,"Full House was a show that I loved as a kid and watched without fail whenever it was on. However, re-watching it as a 19 year old, the show now feels bland and irritating. The production values are decent enough and there are some good morals. On the other hand, the music in my opinion is forgettable at best, while the writing and jokes are forced and rather lame and the stories are predictable and so sugary sometimes it makes your teeth hurt with any problems solved all too easily. I don't now care for the characters either, excepting Kimmy and Stephanie perhaps, however Joey, Danny and Becky manage be both bland and annoying, but worst was Michelle. At the start she was cute, as she got older she got brattier and brattier, the Disneyland episode for example epitomises this. The acting suffers from a lack of genuine comic timing. Overall, loved it as a kid, but I just cannot forgive its irritations and blandness now. 1/10 Bethany Cox",25 out of 41 found this helpful.,1.0,15 July 2011
2783,Preacher, A unique blend of pulp elements and dark fantasy for genre fans - peppered with a healthy dose of black humor.,"Let me start this review by stating that I've never read the comic books, so I can't testify as to whether or not this crazy, grotesque, violent and hilarious new AMC fantasy series is a faithful adaptation of the source material. But what I can tell you as an avid fantasy and horror fan is that the pilot left me with an immediate urge to watch the next episode.<br/><br/>Just so you know, this review won't contain anything story related, so if you want to learn what the show is about, read the IMDb synopsis or go to Wikipedia. I believe most films and TV-shows are enjoyed best without knowing anything other than maybe the genre, cast or filmmaker (plus, personally, I like to know about as many aspects as I can about the actual quality of the filmmaking itself). Oh, but maybe this: don't get frustrated if you don't immediately understand just what the heck is going on. The pilot introduces several key characters and important story elements by jumping around quite a bit and throwing you directly into the action, but we're clearly not meant to know and understand everything right from the start. So relax, be patient and have a little faith in showrunner Sam Catlin; the dude co-produced (or co-executive produced) 55 episodes of 'Breaking Bad', 10 of which he wrote, so he should know a little something about storytelling. <br/><br/>What becomes immediately evident in 'Preacher' is that the casting of the title role was a stroke of genius: Dominic Cooper ('The Devil's Double', 'Captain America: The First Avenger') makes for a fantastic lead. His charismatic but nuanced performance as conflicted preacher Jesse Custer was enough to convince me after only one episode that he will be able to carry this series. It's always a balancing act to portray this kind of character with just enough vulnerability to make him appear relatable and human but still have him come across as larger than life, and judging by what I've seen so far, Cooper manages to pull it off perfectly.<br/><br/>I'd say the cast in general is very solid, but the two actors that need to be mentioned most apart from Cooper's preacher are Ruth Negga in the role of Tulip and Joseph Gilgun who plays Cassidy. Both are wicked fun to watch (and obviously they're relishing their parts) and both have completely bonkers introduction scenes for their respective characters that will give audiences a taste of just what kind of crazy, ultra-violent mayhem we're in for with this new show.<br/><br/>Now just to get this straight: there are darkly comic moments abound in 'Preacher' but it is not a black comedy - nor is it as over the top as, say, 'Ash vs the Evil Dead' (despite being pretty over the top at times). Fans of the show's creators, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, would be well-advised not to expect a similar tone in 'Preacher' as in some of the duo's previous works like 'This Is the End' or 'The Interview'. What we have here is probably best described as ""dark fantasy"" and while it IS peppered with a large dose of dark comedy, I'm pretty sure there will also be some rather unfunny shît down the road for this preacher to deal with.<br/><br/>As for the production values, the visuals (and the visual effects) in general look very nice and the sets convincing; the southern locations have a ""lived-in"" and appropriately run-down look and the whole small-town, Texan atmosphere is tangible. The cinematography was expertly done (the pilot's DoP was none other than The Matrix' Bill Pope) and the soundtrack is even downright fantastic (if you can appreciate southern songs from the likes of Johnny Cash, that is). The one thing that didn't always work for me was the pacing/editing and the way certain scenes were established, but a slightly uneven rhythm is not uncommon for pilot episodes, so I'm not worried yet.<br/><br/>My overall verdict: 'Preacher' is a show that doesn't try for a second to cater to a mainstream audience; it offers a unique blend of pulp elements and dark fantasy for genre fans who most likely won't have the slightest problem digesting the hefty mix of drama, horror, gory violence and humor. Needless to say, I'm totally on board (and I can't wait for the next sermon).

2786,Preacher, Out the gate brilliant!,"Very rarely does a TV show - especially a pilot - surprise me as much as this one did, several times. This action-packed debut has some wonderful twists and turns and unexpected events and I strongly recommend you don't watch trailers or teasers or read spoilers before watching it. I also recommend you pay attention to things that are going on in the background like TV newscasts and sign boards. There are some gems there!!! Its so refreshing to encounter a pilot to a TV show that packs such a punch. No slow, drawn out introduction here.<br/><br/>I also rarely laugh out loud watching TV shows, most ""sit coms"" &amp; comedies leave me cold. But this show drew several delighted full throttle laughs from me. It's nasty, it's dark,it's suspenseful, it's bizarre, at times it's shocking and it's hilarious. Yes it has some blood &amp; guts in it, but always in context and with a purpose. It's not gratuitous or only there for shock value like, for example, American Horror Story. It's part of the plot. Also, this is the pilot, it's telling a story of how something began &amp; gathering some threads together. Of course it won't be coherent yet. Don't go in expecting it to be like everything else on TV, it just isn't. It's not like the other DC/Marvel shows either. It's a thing unto itself and I absolutely adored it.<br/><br/>It has fascinating characters, wonderful setting, great snappy dialogue (particularly from a character called Tulip) and some truly strange moments like the cow noises in the background of a certain scene and the character, Eugene. I also really liked the cinematography &amp; editing - there are some clear nods to some of the greats of horror and thriller directors that all you movie buffs out there will recognise. Not a frame of this pilot was wasted or dead air. The kind of tight, focused editing and directing I love. I was so impressed with this I watched it again immediately after the first viewing. I can honestly say I've never done that before with any TV show.<br/><br/>And all this in less than an hour. <br/><br/>There are some very odd negative reviews here but I think they're from people who just don't understand what they were watching and/or it all went right over their heads. It does jump around a little , but unlike a certain other show, this one guides you through it's jumps with deliberately obvious &amp; slightly amusing titles like 'Back in Africa"" or ""not that long ago"". I saw someone upset because it's not like Supernatural. LOL It's not supposed to be! Why be angry at the show for not being like some arbitrarily show you chose to think it would be like? It's not their fault! This show is more like The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy than Supernatural - although don't be misled by that description either! As I said, it's a breed apart.<br/><br/>I can't remember who said this but it's always stuck in my head: you can tell what a book or movie etc will be like within the first 5 minutes - because that sets the tone.

It was mostly the stars that encouraged me to watch, as I'm a big fan of all three leads, particularly Joseph Gilgun and I'm overall I'm happy I did, as I liked (but perhaps didn't love) this series.<br/><br/>Jesse Custer (Dominic Cooper) is a former criminal who has returned to his hometown to become their Preacher - as his father once was. Attendances are dwindling and Jesse is unsure of his place in the world, then he receives what he believes is a divine gift. When he speaks, those who hear are forced to act on it, regardless of what it is. With his church on the up, he reconnects with Tulip (Ruth Negga) a childhood friend who has a mission of revenge for them both to begin and meets Cassidy (Joseph Gilgun) an Irish Vampire just looking for a good time.<br/><br/>The first season is a funny, daring adult fantasy with wonderful central performances from its three leads and able support from the likes of Jackie Earle Haley, W Earl Brown, Lucy Griffiths and Derek Wilson. It ends at a point that I was really excited to see where it would go, but from there the show repeatedly splits up its three central characters and the second season is a step or two down in quality from the first. The third is better, but repeats the trick of splitting up the leads and introduces an element of repetition into the story line, as does the fourth. The later seasons rely on this bond between the three but the bonds between them is really something that we're more told about, than seeing exist.<br/><br/>One other slight issue, now it feels like it's another aspect of the very busy ""adult fantasy"" market. ""The Boys"", ""American Gods"", ""Legion"", ""Good Omens"" have all come subsequently and all (to some extent) cover similar ground.<br/><br/>I don't want to give the impression that it's bad, at any point, but aside from the first season it's just a bit too peripatetic and repetitive for its own good.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,7.0,24 July 2020

I can write a million things about the changes they made, which ones i think work and which don't, but it doesn't matter that much. I can write about how good Cassidy, Jesse and Tulip were on the TV show (they were great), but it doesn't matter to me that much either. The pilot was a pretty good episode on its own, fun, crazy, fast, intriguing, with good characters and a great cast, cool music, nice photography and direction, good writing etc. However, what truly matters to me, is that the love of the creators for the source material(the comic book, duh), was apparent everywhere and all the time. The pilot was made of love. They seem to know the comic book, to understand and love it, and to really want to make this adaptation work.

2793,Preacher, Has potential but plays it safe,"At last, it's happening. Preacher. They're finally going live action with one of the weirdest, strangest, most imaginative works of fiction - in any genre or format - I've ever encountered.<br/><br/>The good, in order: Dominic Cooper, as Jesse Custer, titular Preacher. He's managing to wear the role, something that very few actors could pull off. Ruth Negga, doing a better Tulip than the one in the comics (and that is saying something). Joseph Gilgun, whose turn as Cassidy is spot-on, truly the comics brought to life.<br/><br/>The sets, the costumes, the effects, the support acting are all first class too. The direction is nicely understated; they keep shots simple, with lots of use of nicely framed setups.<br/><br/>The humour is occasionally outright hilarious. Unfortunately there isn't nearly enough of it, and that's where the bad times start.<br/><br/>They've made some big mistakes with this series. Now, this is not just a fan of the comics talking... they've been putting minor characters and minor plot lines through the blender. Yes, initially I found this profoundly offensive, and it took some work to get past it. Someone who hadn't read the comics wouldn't notice the changes. The trouble is, they don't improve things.<br/><br/>Presumably this chop and change was done in an attempt to create workable TV. I think it was a strategic mistake, a case of missing the wood for the trees. The best thing about Preacher, hands down, was Garth Ennis' hyperactive imagination. Anything went, and frequently did. The original story was absolutely mental. Catlin, Goldberg and Rogen do the best they can (and they're no lightweights) but the goings-on in the TV series are a pale shadow of the fun and games in the comics.<br/><br/>The second major mistake was to make it sexually safe. The comics had every kind of oddball, weirdo, creep, and flat-out pervert imaginable. It was messed up. Sometimes it was shocking, and not in a good way either. Mostly, though, it was cry-while-reading hilarious, not least because the characters came across as real people. Not so the TV series. This is Preacher as overseen by studio execs and marketing teams, watered down to appeal to middle America, or at least to not incite too much hate mail. It is, frankly, tame.<br/><br/>There are the usual TV series problems - bogging down in one location (they spend way too long in Annville), throwing hooks in simply for the sake of luring the audience further along, undeveloped characters and plot lines - but that's just me picking threads at this point.<br/><br/>It's OK.

Laughs keep coming at the most inopportune moments and the sense of humour overrides all. There is inspiration in the finest detail when the show is at its best. This is TV with rocks in- country rocks. Yes, it's adult in content, but stylised and sassy and brassy. The visuals and framing create beautiful emptiness at times and the edits transition with impact and punch. The soundtrack is evocative and classy.

2796,Preacher, The graphic novel and the TV show are completely different animals,"Question: how did they manage to enlist Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon as producers and still deviate so much from the source material that it's become a completely different story altogether? The characters' names are the same and some of their traits as well, but their overall personalities are hopelessly divergent. Not that it would matter too much if the TV show had managed to be entertaining in its own right, but that's the rub here, isn't it? The writing is simply a hot mess, with characters and story lines thrown in randomly and huge pacing problems. For instance, how are people who haven't read the comics supposed to make any sense of the Wild West flashbacks sprinkled in every now and then? Their inclusion makes zero sense. But generally all the characters behave unnaturally, they contradict themselves and the fact that som eof them are angels, or vampires, or any other odd creature is poorly explained and poorly used.<br/><br/>The graphic novel shows Jesse, Tulip and Cassidy on a number of wild adventures, all with one central plot line: Jesse's ""mission"". Here, for reasons that can only be budgetary, the adventure is instead sadly confined to one somnolent old town. But if they couldn't afford the grandiosity of the graphic novel, why do a TV based on it in the first place? And altering every single character so emphatically in the process no less.",81 out of 165 found this helpful.,4.0,3 August 2016
2797,Preacher," Downhill after the first episode, but climbed back on top at the end","The first episode blew my socks off! I even watched it a second time.

Crazy action that was darkly comedic. <br/><br/>I just finished watching the 6th episode and feel so disappointed. It seems like the show is really dragging and it's hard to keep interested in it. There are definitely great scenes in each episode, they always involved over-the-top action. The action seems to be where the gold is and Tulip and the Vampire make for some good fun. I keep hoping it will take off. I think the town is dull. It is hard to transition from some crazy exciting lethal action to the dust blowing over barren land. <br/><br/>I do have faith that it will at some point turn around and take off. The first episode shows that it is possible. Hopefully the writers and directors will hear what people are saying about the show dragging and produce a brilliant second season. I'll keep watching and waiting.<br/><br/>Edit: finished the first season and the last two episodes, especially the last episode, was perfect! Yes! I knew they could do it. Those were the kind of episodes I was expecting to come from the mind of Seth Rogan. <br/><br/>P.s. Those two angels are great. It is hard not to find them endearing with their sweet murderous charm.

2798,Preacher, I wish that this had been good,"We watched the entire run of 'Preacher'. At the outset it came across as a quirky and imaginative concept and we eagerly awaited the release of the second series.<br/><br/>In the meantime I made it my business to read all of the original Graphic Novels by Garth Ennis. They were incredible. The original story of 'Preacher' as told in the Comics is nothing short of a masterpiece. They take you on an extraordinary journey through awesome narrative themes and totally beleivable character progressions. The pace and pathos is perfectly delivered and by the end of them I literally felt like a better version of myself.<br/><br/>It was then slightly perturbing to realise that virtually the entire second season was a complete departure from the books which ultimately proved to be completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>It continued to be entertaining enough, and we followed its' progress, albeit somewhat painstakingly through the second and third series as the storyline of the TV adaptation strained to reconcile themes from the much loved original source material with its' own slightly irrelevant narrative tangents. It had however become apparent by the end of the third season that it was already too late for this TV adaptation to be 'good'.<br/><br/>By the fourth season, 'Preacher' had already been cancelled and after three seasons'worth of extrapolating tenuous and completely irrelevant plot lines, all remaining storytelling necessarily suddenly needed to be crammed into this final run of episodes. Consequently all of the pathos and drama that once might have been was entirely skipped over in favour of an absurdly careless botch-job of sloppy sensationalism and cheap gags.<br/><br/>By the conclusion of the fourth and final series, the overall impression was that of an impudent toddler literally throwing all of its' toys out of the pram. For some puzzling reason best known unto themselves, the creators of this TV series saw fit to take one of the best stories to have been told in recent times and completely defame it. In its' place they apparently decided to tell a different story which starts off being 'not particularly good' and ends up totally puerile.<br/><br/>It is a sad thing indeed that somebody could not have just told the story that already existed instead of trying to rebuild it in their own image. Perhaps the most fundamentally puzzling inconsistency of this re-imagining is the fact that none of the main characters even vaguely resemble their equivalent characters from the books, and as a result, all of their interpersonal dynamics are completely skewed and there is effectively not much point to any of them.<br/><br/>Maybe one day there will be a good TV adaptation of 'Preacher', I will look forward to this. In the meantime I hope to acquire the 'Ultimate' leather-bound editions of the original comics in order that I can re-read them and exorcise the nonsense of this rather thin offering...",20 out of 35 found this helpful.,3.0,4 June 2020

Granted, this kind of supernatural stuff is not everyone's cup of tea but if you get it - you'll see that it's not just down to the storyline. I feel - in my humble opinion - that we really need to acknowledge and congratulate the casting team. Main characters are played brilliantly. Jesse, Tulip, Cassidy - what a fantastic combination of on screen chemistry and I get that, but when I think of the supporting actors playing characters such as Herr Starr, Jesus, Eugene, TC, Granma, the Saint of Killers, All Father even Hitler and so on. What a clever and wonderful selection of actors who have brought this weird and wondrous story to life. I'm not a comic book reader. I had never heard of the Preacher before but every week I am literally waiting for the next episode. Please don't dilute this high standard for the sake of viewer figures.

2801,Preacher, Inside Seth Rogan -- the TV series,"In 1980 a very odd and one-of-a-kind film was released from Africa (of all places) entitled The Gods Must Be Crazy. It violated almost every narrative standard for semi-serious. semi-comic, stories of the day.<br/><br/>The action was non-linear, captions came and went, locales jumped around, characters appeared and disappeared, some actors seemed to be camping the whole thing up and others seemed to be taking their roles much too seriously -- and generally the film was an international hit and a great time was had by all.<br/><br/>My first thought on watching the opener for Preacher is that Rogan must have seen The Gods Must Be Crazy too many times, but then I remembered he was born two years after it was made, so that theory went nowhere.<br/><br/>In any case, whatever work may have ""influenced"" Seth to pick this up and run with it (Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy would be my second guess) he did indeed pick it up and he did indeed run with it.<br/><br/>It is quirky, clever, fast-moving, confusing, and massively over-written.<br/><br/>In short, not for everyone. (Which may possibly explain the highly polarized reviews.) <br/><br/>At the end of the day, I suspect history will record that this was Rogan's way of breaking out of the ""actor"" role that Hollywood has pinned him to, and showing that he indeed has other talents.<br/><br/>I predict we will be seeing other unique projects from Rogan down the road.

2804,Preacher, An abomination,"First off let my start by saying that Garth Ennis's Preacher is my favorite comic ever and he has since become one of my favorite comic writers (the other being Warren Ellis). A Preacher TV adaptation had been in the works in one form or another for years now, but it was never a done thing until recently. When the first rumors first surfaced I was rather wary and feared the changes they would make to the source material, and even more so when I heard that it was being made by AMC, which has a poor track record when adapting comics (The Walking Dead barely follows the comic, and it changed a lot of things), but my wariness turned into dread when I found out that the person behind the adaptation was Seth Rogen. Absolutely nothing in the entire season actually happens in the comics (well, except for some of the Saint of Killers origin story -and even that was somewhat changed- and the fact that Genesis merged with Jesse, but the circumstances of the merger were completely different). I get it that apparently they meant this season as a kind of ""prequel"" to the comics, but Preacher didn't need a prequel, specially not one that made fundamental changes to all the characters and their relationships to each other. They changed Jesse's backstory, they depict him as a (mostly) dedicated preacher that wants to do right by his community, who uses the Word of God to help the people of Annville. They show him following on his father's footsteps as a preacher, when he was nothing of the sort (he was a Vietnam veteran). When the comics begin he was pretty much done with being a preacher (he was coerced into doing it actually) and his entire flock was burned alive when Genesis merged with him. They also show him as a big shot bank robber (along with Tulip), when in reality they were little more than car thieves. They changed Tulip to the point of her being unrecognizable as the character from the comics. First they make her out to be some kind of badass assassin, capable of bringing down a helicopter with a rocket launcher made from coffee cans, while when we meet her in the comics she is running away from her first botched assassination attempt (and while doing so she comes across Cassidy, who was sleeping under a tarp in the back of a truck she steals). She also tries to be cute, funny and sexy but she fails at all three, she instead comes across as annoying and totally unlikeable. Everything she does is completely uncharacteristic to the Tulip from the comics, who even goes so far as to have sex with Cassidy (presumably to spite Jesse), who she actually despises and distrusts in the comics. The first time we meet Cassidy he is fighting a group of vampire hunters (no such thing, vampires were apparently unknown even to an organization as powerful as the Grail) and then jumping off said plane in broad daylight. He should have burst into flames but he doesn't, he even survives the fall and proceeds to eat a cow... He pretty much walks around in broad daylight through the entire season, and he hardly ever wears his sunglasses. In the comics he never takes them off (until the last or second to last issue) and there's a reason for that. Also, on a more personal note, I can barely understand what he says 90% of the time. I know that he is supposed to be Irish, but he should tone the accent down a bit, he needs subtitles more badly than Arseface. Yet another thing they changed was how the Word manifests itself (no red eyes) and even how it works (the whole ""got to hell Eugene""). They also changed the characters relationships to each other. The guys (Jesse, Cassidy and Tulip) didn't know sheriff Root or Arseface (who looks like crap by the way, he is nowhere near as hideous or deformed as in the comics) and they most certainly didn't know Odin Quincannon, who doesn't come into the comics until MUCH later and who is nowhere near Annville. In short they changed pretty much everything that made Preacher what it was, the show is missing its actual characters, its profanity (there was hardly a page without a f*ck in the comics) and its plot. Maybe they'll stop pissing all over the source material in season 2, but I doubt it, and even if they do they've already made fundamental changes to the main characters's personalities and backstories. Comics fans should stay away from this turd and beg that Rogen doesn't also ""adapt"" Ennis's ""The Boys"".",70 out of 158 found this helpful.,2.0,3 August 2016

2807,Preacher, Catastrophic failure,"[*Possible Spoilers Ahead*]<br/><br/>The current 9 average IMDb rating has got to be from comic book fanbois. I haven't read the comic, so I'm not a fan of the underlying material. (To be clear, I didn't read The Walking Dead comics either - but the TV version proved itself in the pilot and in many episodes since as worthy of my time. I'm not anti-comics.)<br/><br/>The tone is glaringly uneven. Pacing is odd to say the least. Quintin pulls off gore humor in his sleep, so did Kickass and many others; this however just isn't doing it for me. Maybe the Preacher makers are just too late to the over-the-top-gore party. Nah, strike that. Their implementation is to blame. Have some consistency. Have a vision. Have a clue. Something. Anything.<br/><br/>Filled with clichés, one dimensional characters, and true, Sunday-funnies-worthy hamfisted cartoonish behavior.

There isn't a kid on planet earth who could watch an adult get violently killed without ending up in pee pee pants city. Dumb dumb dumb. I get what they're going for: ""Lookie here, she's such a bad*** even kids dig her!"" But the ""awesome!"" punchline faceplants, leaving us puzzled.

I will say my favorite show is The Walking Dead and I didn't like around Carl at times but he had the nerve to kill his mother when it had to be done instead of getting someone else killed.

Edge of your seat intensity from beginning to finish sprinkled with actual scary moments. Some of them Pet Sematary like.<br/><br/>Season 2 is ruined by pointless subplots and a very irritating kid. My god that kid! And the main story did not move forward one bit. Most of this season are fillers. Complete waste of time.<br/><br/>Season 3 started off with some intense actions, but cooled off very quickly, again, by pointless subplots. By now we're seeing flashbacks of supporting characters, completely irrelevant to the main story. And a couple of the main characters now have nothing to do, but the story is constantly being interrupted to give them screen time, so you can watch them sit around, drink alcohol, fluff about nothing, hook up...etc. Fillers, fillers, and more fillers.<br/><br/>This is where I give up.

2814,The Strain, Starts as interesting homage to Bram Stoker's classic novel 'Dracula' - and is soon let down by mediocre writing,"* Some mild spoilers ahead *<br/><br/>There has been no shortage of modern vampire stories lately, but surprisingly - at least to my knowledge - a modern day version of the ONE vampire story (in more than just the name) has not been among them. Although Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' is one of the most famous and influential novels in English literature of the Victorian era, it took Mexican producer/director Guillermo Del Toro to finally attempt an update (or rather an ""expansion"" on the theme) for a modern audience of this beautiful, Gothic tale.<br/><br/>It's probably meant more as an homage than a retelling (I haven't read Del Toro's novel 'The Strain' upon which this show is apparently based), but judging by what I've seen so far, there are many elements in the show's storyline (at least during the first episode) that remain surprisingly faithful to Stoker's novel, and at the beginning there's even the modern equivalent of the doomed ship 'Demeter'.<br/><br/>Del Toro cleverly plays with the expectations of those who have read 'Dracula', and knowing the story doesn't really spoil anything. Quite on the contrary: it's even more fun to watch this show and suddenly recognize nearly exact lines from the Victorian novel, but spoken to a member of some Latino drug gang (who answers the elegant words with the very modern ""F*** You!"" and ""S*** my D***!"").<br/><br/>The production values are - as was to be expected when the director of 'Hellboy' and 'Pacific Rim' is involved - pretty good. The visual effects and the make-up are quite OK also, but they do leave room for improvement. Alas, the writing and the acting leave a lot to be desired which was very unexpected in this day and age of great Television shows - especially when someone like Del Toro serves as a producer. Still, overall I'd say there's yet hope for this new show (IF the writing gets better). My vote so far: 6 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>***UPDATE***: I've stopped watching after the 4th. episode - it still puzzles me how so many talented people couldn't come up with better writing.

2815,The Strain, Couldn't go past season 2,"SPOILERS !!!!!!!! I am so disappointed...<br/><br/>I kept with it for the first season, even though I didn't like the arrogant stupidity of the main character. But at the final of the second season, where Nora stops when Zack yells ""stop"" was it for me.<br/><br/>To create drama, the characters are doing very stupid things. Zack, who saw his mother try to kill his dad, attack them, etc is still what? confused? I don't care if he is a kid, he would be over it by now. And Nora, who has beheaded and killed quite a few vamps, for some reason has problems with Zack's mom and then stops knowing her life is in danger cause the kid yells? No, No, and Just No. There had to be a better way to write this that didn't require such silliness from the characters.",55 out of 85 found this helpful.,3.0,23 July 2017
2816,The Strain, It started off interesting...and quickly degenerates into such stupidity you to actively hate the characters. All of them.,"I have always loved vampire stories, and so I was very intrigued by the premise, rather a cross between 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' meets 'Underworld'. This series never lived up to the hype, but it was interesting for the first little while. There has to be some suspension of disbelief involved (unless you believe in vampires?). What rapidly becomes apparent is that the logic chasm just keeps opening wider and wider. All of the main characters do things that are so incredibly stupid that you start to actively dislike them. I watched through to 13, in the vain hope it would get better. It doesn't. :P <br/><br/>All shows have a main character doing something that ends up turning out not the way they want it. However, this show telegraphs it ahead of time, then expects us to be surprised when it happens? (As an example:) I just finished watching ep.12. The main characters decide to go to the main hive, where they know hundreds of the vampires will be. Then they are surprised there are so many there, and they expect the viewer to be surprised as well? <br/><br/>The protagonists fail to protect their partners, parents, children, and each other AGAIN AND AGAIN. In New York (the most populous city in North America) hundreds if not thousands are infected and still it appears that not a single person has tried to leave or document what is going on. Where are the police? The FBI? the US National Guard? Other citizens? What about the REST of the CDC? (I may be wrong, I'm Canadian, but isn't it the National Guard who the US sends into disaster areas?)<br/><br/>Synopsis of Characters: the Good: (4)<br/><br/>Setrakian – I hope in real life David Bradley is in much better shape than his character, because you wonder how Setrakian stays upright at times. He has a suitably tragic background that is well written, believable and would actually be interesting. The consummate coward, his fears set all the wheels in motion. He is supposedly the main hunter but although his mind is willing, his flesh is weak. This character actually shows the most possibility of all, and I would be interested in his story if it wasn't for the rest of the idiots. Vasiliy – If I had to pick one character I liked, it would be Vasiliy. It is played extremely well by K. Durand. He is tough and capable, unfortunately following the idiots instead of leading them. Reggie – I liked how he was played as someone that was born into a system that he believed in. Slowly this belief erodes until he just walks away. I thought this would be great for him to come back on the protagonist side...but that (apparently?) doesn't happen. He just leaves, end of character. :P<br/><br/>the Bad: (7)<br/><br/>F – Supposedly a brilliant man who stumbles through scene after scene of ineptitude. His actions make little or no sense, even to himself, apparently. Nora – the most 'human' of the characters, is often confused and annoying. Eichorst – very transparently you are supposed to hate Eichorst, and this character does everything possible that 'evil' could do. Too bad it is so obvious that you just groan. Everything he plans goes off perfectly until he inexplicably fails at the end of the season. Big surprise. I think this character is well played by Jonathan Hyde but very poorly written. Gabriel – is a main character for the first bit but degenerates into a bit player in later episodes. Rather poorly written, he seems to die several times but always shows up later. Kelly – F's wife, she does stupid things until she gets taken. After this she shows up several times, seems to die several times, but always shows up later. Dutch - One woman brings down the Internet. Not just locally. But the whole world, apparently. And cell phones no longer work. Logic behind this? There is none. She is rude and arrogant. This has to be the worst written character of them all, except perhaps for.. Gus – Plays an Mexican who lives off of the streets, and can't seem to get out of his own way making stupid decision repeatedly until he is recruited to be humanity's champion by other vampires? (Why? How? Why would you or I care?) Yet another reason why ep.13 remains the worst I have seen so far (and I wasn't planning to watch further)<br/><br/>And the Unfortunate: (2 (+every vampire.))<br/><br/>Eldritch – At times pathetic, at times arrogant, he is sympathetic again until the last few episodes where we see a side of him that we have never seen before as a typical corporate head (arrogant, amoral, self-centred). The change actually reduces this character to just a generic stereotype. Zack – Kelly and F's child, Zack is at times very smart and mature and at other times totally stupid and in needs of constant home care or a straitjacket. In other words, a typical child. :)<br/><br/>The end of season 1 brings ridiculous to a whole new low, and dropped my rating to 4. The master is located (they entirely gloss over how) and surprise, it is above ground in the middle of the day! (because vampires secretly want to be out during the day, even knowing it will destroy them) The main protagonist takes his son on the vampire hunt (to get the master, of all things!) and with a clip of handgun ammo and a nailgun they get all the way through the nest to the very end, and find that what they were most counting on doesn't work on the Master. (go figure, it would end the series (blissfully).<br/><br/>I find TV is getting actively more generic all the time, but wouldn't it be nice if we found a series that actively engages our imaginations?",51 out of 79 found this helpful.,4.0,25 July 2015
2817,The Strain, Scriptwriting failure that spirals downhill very fast,"Sometimes, there's a very subtle line between character actions and dialogue that succeeds in representing real human beings and character actions and dialogue that leaves us with a taste of utter disbelief and dumb-foundedness. This is particularly true in sci-fi, since characters are not only reacting to stimuli we've all had a chance to relate to, but they are also reacting to the alien, to which we can only guess upon the accurate and believable reaction.<br/><br/>Here, that line isn't subtle. It has been hacked to pieces and moved out ten thousand kilometers to the ocean of screen writing absurdness. I can not write this without spoilers, since I can't figure out equivalent stupidity to describe upon you. Think of this: An angry, passive-aggressive (and sometimes actively aggressive) dad bashes in and hacks off the head of your new stepdad. You're 8 years old. Would your reaction be total meltdown into crying and panic or.. ""Oh. Okay. Was he a vampire? Oo. Okay. (Literally never heard of this vampire thing before, but I'll accept this just the same. It's okay)"" Yes, this actually happens.<br/><br/>The show is riddled with ridiculous characters. Everyone seems hugely aggressive towards each other, friend or not. The characters are constantly jabbing at each other about anything imaginable. When creating the characters, I can imagine the writing team going through a list of ""Ten most overused caricatures in fiction"" and picking them all. You've your work-focused scientist dad who ignores his family. You've your stepdad who tries too hard to be an awesome dad and comes out as kind of a dick thanks to that. You've an old man who at first seems senile, but is actually the most knowledgeable character of them all. You've your Mexican gangster dude, who actually has quite high moral standards. You've a 20-something year old thrashy-looking chick, who wears too much make-up, has a London accent and is, apparently, a hacking genius capable of, literally, shutting down the whole Internet and cell phone networks.<br/><br/>The show and its characterization steer not only to the unbelievable, but also to the annoying. Majority of time, if it wasn't bad enough to be kind of funny, it'd be just plain painful to watch.<br/><br/>In the defense of the show, I must admit that the first few episodes were somewhat interesting and did manage to hook my curiosity enough to continue watching for a while. If you have the capability to ignore the hundreds of plot holes, ridiculous characters, poor dialogue and predictable personalities and plot movement, and can take the show with a lot of humor, the first half of the first season might just be worth it. Maybe watch the rest of the 1st season if you're curious enough, but you better be prepared for some extreme stupidity.",46 out of 75 found this helpful.,3.0,28 September 2015

In the other hand these people with professions like doctors or hackers become killing machines and have ninja movements within days... In fact they are even more effective with a sword that fully equipped Navy Seals. Another example of the stupid evolution from the characters is the Dr. Goodweather's son.

2820,The Strain, What happened!,"Well the first few episodes really showed promise and apart from a few bits of bad scripting really made me think we finally had a good show to watch. But from ep4 everything changed, the story and acting just failed in so many ways, e.g. the devout Christian wife of an infected passenger decides out of the blue that it's fine to feed her neighbour to her infected husband for complaining about the noise, WTF? <br/><br/>Newly infected people seemed to turn into zombies (Is this a zombie show or a vampire show), except they seemed to just walk so slow they might as well not, it would have been much more scary if they were fast and could fly etc<br/><br/>The script just seemed to fall apart and every episode has been worse then the last. I kept watching to see if things would improve, but it seems like maybe they ran out of money to pay script writers and actors to actually act or maybe they had a script for three episodes thinking this would be a mini-series but someone at the last minute told them to make more. <br/><br/>Even ex-hobbit Sam's acting was appalling although script and bad editing really have a lot to do with the end result here I think.

2823,The Strain, Worst Downfall of a TV show.,"This series has to be the one having the worst downfall in writing ever. Good plot with season 1 and some part of season 2 but it all goes to downhill from that. No proper explanation or rationale on why the hell a good, understanding kid in season 1 goes crazy from the very first episode of season 2. You can speculate from the first episode of season 2 that the kid will turn out to be a villain which is honestly some real bad writing. A kid OK with all the weird stuff his mom doing, befriending a infected kid and OK with it despite telling a back story that the infected kid was blind is just garbage of a writing just to show us that the boy is turning to dark side. The kid exploding the bomb himself was kind of hilarious and at the same time reaching the heights of some real desperate writing. This series just went to some laughable show containing cool horror features, people with blades, guns cutting and blowing the infected people and that's it. No proper story line, lots of loopholes and please keep a nearby window open while you watch this because you literally have to throw logic out of the window while watching this. I bet season 4 will be bringing us into a post nuclear phase of new york city with some fallout(game) like environment and some more weird creatures roaming around (of course because of the nuclear blast). This had a good plot in the beginning and that's it. The simple way to describe this series is ""ITS BAD &amp; NOT WORTH SPENDING YOUR TIME"".",21 out of 33 found this helpful.,4.0,4 December 2016
2824,The Strain," I had to re-do my review --- Terrible, terrible, terrible!!!","Update 2: 08/25/2015 Just finished about 4~5 episodes from season 2 yesterday. I can hardly describe my feeling now.<br/><br/>I wasn't paying much attention to the show while I put it on the background and doing my own stuff. Same-o-Same-o bullshitting from Elph and Nora, and his ever-annoying brat son. Good thing Dutch and Fet are hooking up, though. A lot of ""Oh-Really?"" type of history from old Abraham. I wasn't too happy, but did not feel too disappointed either, given how bad it was from season 1. And then, I realized that, in that show, the world has become aware of the infestation of Vamps, all zombie type of thing. And the US government sent in 200 national guards. Wuuuaaaat? It's not an ALL-OUT WAR?!?! 200?!?! And people are still allowed to walk around the city like nothing happened? No curfew? Business still open, shops, restaurants and stuff? Nobody is trying to bolt out of that damn city??? And I turned off the TV. W.~T.~F.~ Seriously.<br/><br/>---Original Review--- I gave this show a 7-star rating when i first reviewed it few weeks ago. Now with finale came and gone, I am compelled to delete my previous review, and now it gets a 3-star.<br/><br/>It was somewhat enticing watching the pilot. 10 episodes later, ehhh, OK. Now, O~M~G! Did you shoot your screenwriter after episode 5? Main characters are from boring-and-annoying to deserve-to-be- hated. Story lines cannot be more inconsistent and ridiculous. More questions are brought up without ANY previous questions answered. And apparently, the entire world is so stupid in the show, that somehow I fee they do deserve to be annihilated by vamps.<br/><br/>First of all, nobody explained HOW the master could kill, or infect, the entire passenger cabin in a split second, without any struggle of any sort. And, nobody explained WHY the seemly omnipotent (during night time at least) master had to use a human to drive him from airport to Manhattan, though he could jump and run like nobody can see him. Nobdy explained HOW did old Abraham know that the Master was trying to sneak into Manhattan, and nobody explained WHY destroying the coffin is an effective measure against the master.<br/><br/>Oh, this Eldritch dude can just walk into a highly ranked federal official's office and throw her off balcony? Don't they have some kind of surveillance and security there? He thought nobody saw him or what? Are they trying to make fun of current White House security melt- down?<br/><br/>Of course there are more than one ""masters"". I just wonder, why are they (three of them) strapped on a cargo dolly-cart kind of device (oh yeah, like Hannibal)? From earlier episodes, you see these hooded vamps killing infected people and you kinda know they are not in-sync with the then-only master. But I was just puzzled that why do they need to hire a human, when they seem to have seemingly very effective ways of killing other vamps.<br/><br/>And yes somebody screwed up the internet and people in Manhattan cannot get online easily. But there are other people OUTSIDE of Manhattan. And there are HUNDREDS of people missing and nobody is suspicious of anything? Nobody questioned that? And you think NSA will just let the communications/internet down because it is ONLY Manhattan? In the last episode, the good guys launched a short hijacked TV broadcast alerting others about the invasion of vamps (which led to Eldritch throwing the official off building to preventing her from starting a quarantine of entire island). Maybe not a lot of people saw that when it was broadcasted. But come on! This entire world, if 1 out of 7 billion people saw that and recorded it, this short video will go viral 100 times bigger than Uncle Psy's Gangnam Style!!! <br/><br/>There are so many small details in the entire season makes me want to jump into the TV and kick the crap out of the stupid and arrogant Eph. Nobody, OK, maybe except Fet, is likable in the show. I'd rather see the master prevail and put on a bloody killing spree on them. Better than watching these morons fighting each other like 2-year olds fighting over a chewing toy.<br/><br/>The only reason I am still giving it a 3-star, is I want to see how the turf war goes between the Master and the Ninja-vamps going after him.",48 out of 84 found this helpful.,3.0,7 October 2014

And the characters reactions to finally seeing the creatures is NO ONE CALLS ANYONE, NO COPS, NO FBI! They just walk around like nothing is happening. The surviors from the first episode, they start having symptoms but NONE of them calls a doctor? Why does an all powerful vampire have to hire thugs for simple errands? The coffin...The vampire could lift, carry the coffin but had to have it driven out? From what we see of how the vamps feed, it makes no sense how the vampire attacked all the passengers on the plane with no one noticing... I could go on and on, but what's the point.

This is one of ""those shows"" where the characters have to all be in cahoots with their stupidity and carelessness in order for the plot to develop. I know that in the horror/fantasy genres that one has to be prepared to suspend their disbelief at times, but this show goes off the charts in how it tries the viewer's patience. Here's a few examples:<br/><br/><ul><li>A giant hideously ornate coffin full of dirt is found on an airline where all but four passengers died in flight and then is stolen from under the noses of the CDC and the cops from the airport by one guy with a van.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The CDC agents find live worms that voraciously drink human blood on the plane yet nobody at the CDC is concerned.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The doctor performing autopsies on the 200 dead passengers discovers the worms and is soon eaten by the 200 (now reanimated) dead passengers in his morgue, yet nobody seems to notice the doctor is missing for a couple of days.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Our 200 dead passengers disappear from the morgue and nobody at the CDC, law enforcement, or local government seem concerned.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The four ""survivors"" who were on the plane are allowed to leave quarantine and neither they nor their loved ones can think to call a doctor or the police once they start exhibiting some terrifying symptoms of their infection.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The lone CDC doctor who knows what's going on, and who has definitive proof that something is badly amiss with this spreading plague, is in trouble with his superiors for breaking the rules.</li></ul><br/><br/>Do I need to go on?

It's as if the show-runners, writers, and directors have no idea what they're doing.<br/><br/>I never read the books this show is based on but had always heard pretty good things about them, so I have to think this is just a really poor adaptation of the source material.

2828,The Strain, Strain is a strain to watch anymore.,I have read the books and they are nothing special but are alright but sadly the TV series is going downhill at a rate of knots.<br/><br/>The latest episode has pretty much done it for me.<br/><br/>The acting is not exactly inspiring especially that annoying kid who plays Zack who may be the worst child actor ever. Zack gets attacked by a vampire he knows and his reaction is so unbelievably badly acted. No show of emotion to the fact his dad just hacked off it's head with a shovel. <br/><br/>The characters themselves are too stupid to survive with poor decision making and as with the woman doctor a naivety that deserves a horrible death.<br/><br/>But for me the final straw had to be the Master. The big reveal came this week and it was so underwhelming to be laughable. He looks ridiculous and I would find it hard not to laugh if he appeared in front of me. In the book he is rather horrific but on the screen he is comic gold. The whole series wiped out for me by the silliest looking vampire in history. <br/><br/>The only bit worth watching was the back story to Setrakian and Eichorst but now with the revealing of the big comedy vampire lummox that has now gone. I will probably watch the rest but will employ liberally the fast forward button.<br/><br/>A shame as it could have been a good series if only they had gone for terror rather than child friendly comedy.,106 out of 201 found this helpful.,1.0,9 September 2014
2829,The Strain," Scary AF, But Interesting Storyline",The Strain after the first episode has definitely persuaded me to watch the next episode with it's frightening but complex storyline and thrilling pace.

The bodies all appear to have no markings or bruisings or anything wrong with them other than a strange color and the smell of ammonia. They all appear to be dead but are they really?<br/><br/>As much as I would love to say more I can't say much more of the storyline without giving away information one needs to learn themselves. The acting in the show of course isn't amazing but it's just a cable TV show only there to entertain us. The CGI and actual things you may see in the film are decent and look fairly real. Overall the first episode was entertaining and I do hope to see good things coming up in the show. I give the Pilot an 8/10!,142 out of 276 found this helpful.,8.0,13 July 2014
2830,The Strain, If The Simpsons did horror...,"6 episodes in, and this isn't good.<br/><br/>The Strain starts off as an interesting take on the vampire theme - imagine vampirism is a strain of a deadly virus, which turns people into vampiric creatures; and ""patient zero"" is a malevolent creature aimed at spreading his sickness. Mix in some modern-day 'heroes' in the form of a CDC response team, and add the wisdom of an old protagonist of the chief bad guy, with a sprinkling of sinister bad guys lurking in shadows.<br/><br/>However, this initial interesting premise is let down in a variety of ways. We have a number of clichéd characters (would you believe the hero is an ex-drunk in mid custody battle for his kid? And his ex now has a slimy corporate boyfriend ... well that's not very common); our hero has a young female colleague with the hots for him; and a former hobbit who is in the pay of the bad guys, cos his wife has cancer, and they might be able to help him. So that's a check for characters-we've- seen-before.<br/><br/>Then would you believe that the hero's boss is a pen-pushing ass, who when confronted with evidence of the viral outbreak would prefer to hush it up, rather than ... well, I'm not quite sure what his motivation is for this bizarre stance. But either way, when he sees a video of a vampire attack on hero-doc, he decides to send the FBI after the doc, rather than alert the authorities. Come on ...<br/><br/>Apart from the collection of recycled characters, the biggest problem is that this vampiric virus spreads and infects dozens, hundreds of people, without anyone appearing to notice. As though every week the world is reset again. Just like The Simpsons. For example:<br/><br/><ul><li>An infected rock star kills a doctor. Yet his assistant hires someone to ""clean up the mess"", then we never hear from her again.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As early as episode 3 vampires attack a hospital, killing several people (or turning them into vampires - it's a bit hit and miss, and not sure how it works as a long-term plan for the bad guys anyway). The next day, no mention of it anywhere.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Guy arrested for killing a vampire - no-one says ""hey, have you seen the body of the dude he just killed?""</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>City morgue wiped out by vampires ... not a word mentioned.</li></ul><br/><br/>There's also an embarrassingly bad sequence with hero arrested and interrogated by the stupidest, most 2-dimensional FBI agents you're ever likely to see (yeah ... they don't buy his video of a vampire being killed either), when the only evidence the FBI has for chasing the hero is a clip of video showing hero and pal dragging a vampire corpse. For some reason they're only after him, and not his pal who is free to wonder the city as and when.<br/><br/>We even have a scene where hero-doc returns to his old house to tell his wife and child to get out of Dodge - but slimy new boyfriend sells him out to the feds. So it's not only re-hashed characters, but re-hashed scenes. 'Mom' then sends son off to school ... that's what I'd do if a CDC doctor told me there was a deadly virus and I had to leave town pronto.<br/><br/>Why watch it? Well, it *really* is mindless entertainment, sometimes painful to watch, but it's nicely shot, and thankfully a short season. Also David Bradley is much the best of the cast, and worth watching - throwing himself into the Van Helsing role with gusto.<br/><br/>When so many good programmes are dropped after 1 season, it's a little sad to hear this has been renewed for a 2nd. There has to be better in this genre out there, surely?<br/><br/>***Update***<br/><br/>After 10 episodes things have slightly improved. Reasons:<br/><br/><ul><li>there are factions in the vampire fraternity;</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the various good-guys have now met up to form their 'fellowship';</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>it's decently unsentimental (people die ... people you think won't);</li></ul><br/><br/>So, enough to have an interest in Season 2; but they can't persist with the ""authorities don't know"" line, as we've had cops killed on duty, schools attacked, government agents killed. All things that would bring national agents to the party.

2831,The Strain, Downhill - The Series,"For something that started out pretty good to became so damn unbearable, it's unbelievable.<br/><br/>Scientifically trying to explain the clearly supernatural is one thing, but the terrible, unreasonable choices characters make is a wholly different. The cast is relatively small, and they do their best to keep them around. In a post-apocalyptic world-in-the-making, where pretty much everyone is in constant danger, the main characters always survive, including that damned brat, who tops Game of Thrones' King Joffrey for me. Their choices to face danger when it's not necessary, to go alone when they'd clearly need help to survive (which they do anyway 'cus 'plot armor'), to overdramatize everything and continue to whine about it for seasons to come, to actively push the boundaries of stupidity...<br/><br/>The show started out as a solid 7, maybe even an 8, with an intriguing story, interesting design choices, it was mysterious and even scary, but they managed to ruin it all and turn it into a show where characters have casual conversations and calmly drink themselves under the table while they're under attack from horrors, and spectacularly screw up the solution to mankind's survival, which earned similarly spectacular 1/10 rating from me.<br/><br/>With all the terrible choices, plot conveniences, plot holes, plot armor, horrid writing and whatever else, this is just milking the cash-cow now. Finished 3 seasons, I'm most definitely not going to start the 4th.<br/><br/>If you're really interested in the show, watch the first season and then stop right there and forget about it because with each episode, it gets worse and worse.

2833,Cougar Town," Not what you think (And a good thing, too)","Cougartown is a brand new show starring Courtney Cox as a newly-single over-40 mom ready to start dating a bunch of young guys!! ... fast forward a few episodes Here's the deal. The whole ""cougar"" idea really didn't work for this show. They wanted a show about a hot 40-something dating young guys, and stumbled upon some genuinely likable characters ready for a sitcom. So while the title remains, the show is actually about the life and friends of Courtney's character, Jules, as she struggles to rediscover herself when she thought she was past the age of new discoveries.<br/><br/>Just when you think the show is getting predictable, it pokes fun at itself. Once you get tired of Jules chugging wine every single episode, there's a show about her trying to quit drinking. As soon as you get tired of her meddling in the affairs of her friends, there's a show to see if she can go a day without prying. The show is very self-aware and unpretentious.<br/><br/>The characters are hilarious. Andy has the guy-love obsession with Jules' ex husband. Grayson was a superficial jerk until we found out he worked better as a damaged, but ultimately likable guy with intimacy issues. Jules' two best friends couldn't be more different, and the conflict stays refreshing. The son is hilarious, and provides some great sarcasm and a constant reminder that this nut-case main character is still a mom who is trying to raise a teenage son.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this: The show is no longer about it's title.

2835,Cougar Town," I didn't expect to, but I really loved this show !!!","Hearing the name Cougar Town and thinking of Courtney Cox Arquette's recent plastic surgery, I didn't expect much from this show. To say I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. I was driven to write a review (my first one after being a member for many years) because I really enjoy this little gem of a show and I wouldn't want to see it go off the air after only one season.<br/><br/>The characters work beautifully well together. There is a nice chemistry to the cast, but their rivalries and grudges are also appealing. Cox plays a great neurotic divorcée, but the character is quite different from her portrayal of Monica on Friends. Her son does a superb job as a deadpan role, probably the most down to earth of the entire cast of characters, he is great for one liners and comments on the awkwardness of his familial situation. The strangely devoted relationship between her ex-husband, Bobby and her best friend Ellie's husband Andy is hilarious and over the top but still believable. Meanwhile Ellie (Christa Miller a.k.a. Jordan from Scrubs a.k.a. Kate from Drew Carey) plays a slightly nicer version of her Scrubs character and does so with panache. It's actually nice to see her tone down the meanness and be more human, but still with the wittiness and bossiness of Jordan.<br/><br/>I've heard that Cougar Town has been garnishing some pretty scathing reviews and I can't really understand why. Not an episode has gone by where I didn't Laugh Out Loud several times. Honestly, I think it might be the second best show to debut in 2009- right behind Community, which would be extremely tough to beat.<br/><br/>Anyway, my overall grade ?

2837,Cougar Town, Favorite new show of the season,"Cougartown, as a whole, is my favorite new show this season. <br/><br/>Jules (Cox) is a divorced mom who lives next door to her best friend (Krista Miller), and sells real estate with her other best friend (Busy Phillips). She married young, so is just now testing her wings in the dating world and it happens to be with a younger man. Her best friends can't stand each other, but love her and are a good support system in helping her navigate this strange new world. The dialogue between the best friends is snarkiness at it's best.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox is brilliantly funny - I always thought she did comedy better than drama and this is a much better vehicle for her than Dirt, IMO.<br/><br/>In addition to our star, the show has an excellent supporting cast - Krista Miller rocks, as usual, Busy Phillips is a hoot - loved her in Freaks and Geeks, Dan Byrd (her son) is a breath of fresh air, and the rest of the men are not only hilarious, but delicious eye candy.<br/><br/>The writers are genius and I just hope that they can continue with this high level of hilarity through-out the season.<br/><br/>I can't imagine any woman 30+ who isn't going to identify with Jules &amp; her friends. <br/><br/>If you haven't given it a shot, yet, I hope you make the time to do so.",53 out of 78 found this helpful.,10.0,29 October 2009

2840,Cougar Town," They should change the title, but it's stuck","I began this show thinking there'd be lots of cougars prowling for young men, but it was actually only about one woman, the naive and exuberant Jules, well-played by Courteney Cox. And even that stopped after about half a season, when she found Grayson, not-so-well played by Josh Hopkins.<br/><br/>I expected the show to die off slowly then, but amazingly, it's now halfway through season 5 and I'm still watching. While there is no more 'cougaring', there are other characters that keep the show interesting: her ex-husband Bobby and his couldn't-care-less mode of living, her best friend neighbour Ellie (brilliantly played by Christa Miller) and her killer sense of deadpan humor, and Ellie's husband, the indefatigable and one-man-Bobby-fanclub Andy, also brilliantly played Ian Gomez. And each episode usually contains its own self-contained plot that is generally resolved at the end of 20 minutes. For the most part, those plots are engaging enough to keep you watching, especially when Ellie deploys her unique brand of humor.<br/><br/>And one more thing that seems insignificant yet adds interest to the show: those title cards.

2841,Cougar Town, great show,"This show has a brilliantly funny writing staff, employs a fantastically talented cast and is an all around entertaining show. The characters all compliment each other so well that the jokes and transitions look seamless.<br/><br/>The dynamic between Courtney Cox's show-centric Jules and everyone else in the cast is so perfectly executed. Busy Phillips' Lori, is one of the funniest relevant characters seen on TV today. Christa Miller adds as much to this show as she did and continues to do on Scrubs. As Ellie, she is cross between her character on Scrubs and June Cleaver.<br/><br/>Although the formula is very similar to Scrubs, there is no reason why that should be a bad thing. Scrubs was a very innovative show when it began and now Cougar Town is following in its hilarious footsteps.<br/><br/>The men in the Cougar Town cast are also so strong. Brian Van Holt's comedic timing, Josh Hopkin's character complexities, Dan Byrd's wide eyed innocence and Ian Gomez's slapstick all work so well with the rest of the cast's abilities.<br/><br/>The only negative in my eyes is the shows title-only because it throws the men off with thoughts of a Sex in the City, Desperate Housewives, Lipstick Jungle hybrid. Men need to have an open mind and not judge a show by its title. They will end up realizing that this show is just plain funny, regardless of gender.

2842,Cougar Town," Wickedly funny sitcom, played to the hilt by Cox &amp; Friends","When I heard that Courteney Cox, the comely Monica from NBC's megahit ""Friends"", was launching a new show this year in which she plays a 40ish divorcée on the prowl for young men, I thought: Wow! Little Monica as a midlife hellcat! This has got to be either the best show ever, or the worst show ever!<br/><br/>Fortunately, Ms. Cox and the writers of ""Cougar Town"" know how to be funny and edgy at the same time. Courteney's new show, set in a south Florida beach town, features her as the newly divorced Jules Cobb, who's trying desperately to be sexy and win over a new generation of boys... er, men.<br/><br/>Mrs. Robinson she ain't. Jules is not a predator so much as she is a wishful thinker. The men she attracts -- all of them good-looking, hunky Florida guys -- are usually dimmer than a 25-watt bulb, but still she keeps on trying. <br/><br/>Her two best friends, Ellie (Christa Miller) and Laurie (Busy Phillips), align with Jules to help her score with the guys. Ellie is married to a faithful guy whom she tries to humiliate at every chance, while Laurie is a younger (and blonder) version of Jules, hoping to meet Mr. Right... but not before she has bedded a lot of Mr. Wrongs.<br/><br/>The dialogue is sharp, and crackles with 21st century wit. One example shows us Jules, sitting in an outdoor restaurant with her current lover, with whom she is having a mild dispute. Her friendly rival, Barbara (played bitingly by Carolyn Hennesy) sits at the next table, a few feet away. Barbara leans towards Jules and says:<br/><br/>""If you're not going to eat that, can I have it?""<br/><br/>Jules, startled, says: ""My omelet?""<br/><br/>Barbara: ""No. HIM!""<br/><br/>Yes, it's that kind of a show.

It has the similar wackiness as Bill Lawrence's previous show Scrubs. The change to TBS didn't change it too much although it did indicate a slow inevitable decline. After a few seasons, the show became repetitive and safe. It is a little weird to have Travis go with Laurie.

2850,Cougar Town," Not there yet, but still decent","It's a new show; it's still got some kinks to work out, and I don't completely disagree with any of the previous reviews. The characters aren't well developed (yet), and, yes, some of them are essentially caricatures, especially the promiscuous male neighbor.<br/><br/>However, I think the previous reviewers who dismiss Cox's character as a vapid, sexually charged woman have somewhat missed the point. The show is not really about love or sex; it's about women retaining their feminine identity despite society's insistence that middle-aged women are past their prime, and about dealing with the societal prejudices that come with being a middle-aged woman (some of which can be seen on this very board; more on that later).<br/><br/>Jules is recently divorced, and is suddenly plunged into the single woman's dating world as a 40-something. The show is attempting to capture (with admittedly middling success), the panic and confusion that accompanies the single, middle-aged woman, as she competes with women half her age for the same men. Love? Sex? Never mind all that; Jules would settle for having some fun -- and doesn't she deserve it, after being a mother and housewife for so many years? The show extracts its humor from the awkward journey middle-aged women must often traverse, from motherhood to single-hood, and through whatever else is along the way.<br/><br/>This is where the neighbor's one-note caricature becomes necessary, or at least makes sense. He exists to contrast the different societal attitudes towards middle-aged men and women. Men easily rejoin the dating scene, but women are met with harsh sneers and judgmental assessments. Even in the reviews here on IMDb, some of the people complained that Jules was a sex-crazed maniac, an idiot nymphomaniac, and whatever else, despite that she waited until the tenth date to have sex with her boyfriend. A woman who waits until the tenth date is sex-crazed? No, she just wants to have fun and feel desirable, just like the rest of us.<br/><br/>That brings us to the show's problems, and it has a few. Cox is far too attractive to be convincing as a desperate cougar, for instance. And yes, it would be better if the other characters were more interesting, and if neighbor were more than just a one-note cad. But the show is, in my opinion, still quite funny, and the characters are becoming more sympathetic, even Jules's do-nothing ex-husband. I think the show has a lot of potential, and I will continue to watch it. <br/><br/>As I recall, Courtney Cox's other show, Friends, was almost unwatchable in the first two seasons. But there were good elements there, and eventually they figured it out. I suspect they'll do so with Cougar Town as well.",22 out of 41 found this helpful.,7.0,22 October 2009

Courteney Cox's acting and her character Jules - hilarious, playing a good character who is also a good person, and fun to know, a nice mother, a kind friend, and a very decent ex-wife. 2. The actors Busy Phillips, Jules's son Travis (loved him in ""Aliens in America""), her neighbor Ellie (Christa Miller is an excellent comedian and I don't want to hear any more about her face lifts!), and Josh Hopkins as her neighbor Grayson. 3. The father/son relationship which is both uncomfortable and funny. 4. All the interaction with Jules and Grayson",14 out of 26 found this helpful.,8.0,19 October 2009

2856,Cougar Town, Hilarious Fun! Something for everyone!,"My husband and I absolutely love this show and look forward to each new episode every week. We love the chemistry between the characters and the unique situations they find themselves in. We love all the different ways they handle their problems and how they always look out for each other in the end. We love all of the characters - and their flaws. We find ourselves using quotes from the show between us as inside jokes. We bought all the prior seasons and finished watching them earlier tonight. We will be buying this season when it comes out too. This is a fantastic TV show for adults to enjoy. So much better than the reality stuff. We have our DVR set to record this show just in case we are caught away from home when it comes on. We also re-watch the recordings on other nights because we enjoy this show so much. We are really picky with our likes and dislikes in TV shows and this show definitely makes our very short ""LOVE THIS"" list! My husband says he enjoys the sarcasm as well as the ""boobs"" when he watches the show. We love how they share ""TMI"" (too much information) between each other and how it makes the other characters ""uncomfortable"" dealing with it. Even the Target commercials with them in it are hilarious so we actually watch those commercials. I love this show because it depicts adults in their forties as still being able to have fun in their lives. There is never a dull moment going on in any of the episodes. We love the funny title cards they put up at the beginning of the show. We actually rewind the show to see those again. They have also dealt with some really serious issues while still being able to keep things light. We find ourselves laughing through the whole show. My husband and I wish we could hang out with people like these characters in real life. You just know there would never be a dull moment. Thank you TBS for helping keep one of our most favorite shows on the air. I think this show has ""staying power"" and if it were promoted better – it has the potential to be a number one show. They take real live trivial concerns and magnify them so people are able to laugh at themselves instead of taking everything so seriously.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,3 March 2013
2857,Cougar Town, hugely underrated,"Hot damn! what a pleasant surprise. Cougar Town is engaging from the minute you are introduced to Courtney Cox's Jules. <br/><br/>It quietly introduces and sets up characters and dynamics, and after just a few episodes, you're already at home with the show.<br/><br/>The premise may have directed a few male viewers away - 40 year old single divorcée mother isn't entirely sure what do to next, but does so anyway - battling nosy male neighbors, social perceptions and expectations, feeling older, dating, sex, double standards and insecure friends. You'd be surprised at how universal her struggles really are, and more so, how funny they can be. And has anyone ever noticed what great comic timing Courtney has?<br/><br/>Its smartly written, well acted and delivers as many laugh out loud moments as it does knowing smiles. You feel the chemistry, note the originality, appreciate the brazen humor, marvel at the subtle and wittier observations, and start praying that the show gets a few more seasons, because if it were to end today, the world really would have lost something great.<br/><br/>Yeah - it is THAT good.",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,30 August 2010

2859,3rd Rock from the Sun, Very funny,"""3rd Rock from the Show"" is a very funny comedy series about a group of aliens disguised as humans. John Lithgow (one of the most underrated actors of all-time) is fabulous as Dick, the confused and overly dramatic alien posing as a college professor (I think - it's been so long since I've seen this on TV!). Sally (Kristen Johnson), Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Harry (French Stewart) all join in on the fun as his clueless, bumbling pals - Tommy is an old alien in a teenager's body, Sally is a male in a female's body (or so we are led to believe). Harry is a walking radio who receives incoming transmissions from their home planet.<br/><br/>It may sound silly but that's the entire point! It has some very funny quotes like, ""Last week I didn't even know the difference between Bill Pullman and Bill Paxton!"" Dick: ""Pullman is the fat one."" ""I know that now!"" (or something like that). A lot of it has to do with pop culture and as a result you may have to be American to ""get"" some of the jokes.<br/><br/>One of the top ten greatest television shows of all time. Miserably underrated. It gained a strong cult following while on TV and was awarded with many Emmy nominations but never really become as successful or popular as ""Seinfeld,"" etc. Too bad.",99 out of 105 found this helpful.,10.0,14 January 2002

Can you believe that? I'm a huge fan now. I love the extras offered in the DVD collection. You learn all about the production and plots. I love all the characters. Some recurring characters (look for Jan Hooks and John Cleese!) are just roll-on-the-floor-laughing funny. If you've never seen this series, please start with show number 1 from season 1. You have to meet these characters from the very beginning to understand a lot of the comments. I didn't understand ""Sally"" until I saw the first episode. Then I got it. The casting is perfect. The characterizations are hilarious. I honestly can't see this show too much. I'm glad they are on DVD so they won't wear out like VHS would (for those of you over 30). By the way, if you know anyone who has Asperger's Syndrome/Autism, it is likely they will love this show, too. (My son has AS) They can really relate to these characters trying to figure out how to be human. (You do know they are aliens, right?) Buy it, watch it, fall in love with it.

2861,3rd Rock from the Sun, One of the All-Time Greatest TV Shows!,"NBC has sinned much. They canceled ""Joey,"" ""Four Kings,"" and ""Committed."" They let Seinfeld run for nine years (if I'm not mistaken), which felt like an *eternity*. However, this cosmic sitcom almost absolves them... for ""Joey,"" anyway.<br/><br/>When this was first on TV, my family would watch it every single week. We'd then watch it re-run in syndication to rediscover our favorite moments. And now I have some of it on DVD, and, if anything, it's only gained charm as the years have gone by. It's impossible to tell anyone how much I enjoy this show. But here are the basic reasons: a superb premise, a cast with no weak links whatsoever, and the guarantee of something completely and mind-bogglingly funny happening in virtually every episode! John Lithgow is fantastically self-absorbed as High Commander Dick Solomon, a selfish ""jackanape"" who feels the purpose of the universe is to serve his own needs. Kristen Johnston shines as Sally Solomon, who is *literally* a male trapped in a woman's body (""Next planet, I get to be something big with horns!"") Joseph Gordon-Levitt adds another quirky angle as the old man of the crew who is relegated to the task of being a teenager. And French Stewart proves us he can play a loony with his eyes closed... by doing it with his eyes closed. Every episode. As for humans, Jane Curtin gives a fascinatingly nuanced portrayal of Mary Albright, Dick's perpetual object of affection; Elmarie Wendel is simply delightful as landlady Mrs. Dubcek; Wayne Knight lends many interesting facets to the cop who steals Sally's heart; and let's not forget Simbi Khali as Dick and Mary's amazingly sarcastic secretary Nina, who has to be one of the best sitcom characters ever. And who can forget Ileen Getz as the monotone-voiced Judith?<br/><br/>This show deserves to have a rating that's much higher than ""7.something"". It was one of those rare comedies that was interesting in both concept and execution, while most sitcoms (even the greats!) cash in on making boring concepts entertaining.<br/><br/>Resume normal functions in 3... 2... 1... squeak!",39 out of 41 found this helpful.,10.0,25 August 2007

I would be entertained just watching him, with no sound. and 'Harry' is definitely the next best character. i love the way he dresses...the fur coat and his suspenders and bright shirts. plus, hes very funny. he gives off the impression that he is the youngest alien even though tommy is. i love how innocent and sweet he seems. <br/><br/>3rd Rock is not your A-typical show, it doesn't deal with real life and regular families and friends. every character in this show is weird and crazy and doing their own thing. i think its better this way. i get tired of watching the same old shows with a husband and a wife. problems with the kids or work or each other. its very refreshing to see a show where they have crazy situations and answers. plus it fun to see what it might be like for an alien to come to earth and not know how to deal with their bodies, or relationships, or school and work.",55 out of 61 found this helpful.,,28 October 2004
2866,3rd Rock from the Sun, The best sitcom we never watched.,"It's a low down dirty shame about 3rd Rock. While I've been a faithful viewer going on five years or so, the show never got the appreciation it deserved. Sure it won its share of Emmies, but that doesn't mean anybody watched it. It's a Ross and Rachel world out there, and the brilliance of 3rd Rock was often overshadowed by soap operas disguised as sitcoms.<br/><br/>But 3rd rock is rollicking comedy and nothing but. John Lithgow is simply one of our best in one of his best roles as Dick. If you like this show, I strongly suggest you see some of his movie work such as The World According To Garp, the movie I hate to love and love to hate, but Lithgow's performance falls on the love side of the scale.<br/><br/>Gangly Kristen Johnston plays Sally. The towering beauty and hilarious flake. She adds some amazing physical comedy to the show's ensemble. Her physical presence is so amusing she can crack you up just by standing there. I can't wait to see her in other comedic roles, my main fear being she'll fall into toilet humor instead of something sophisticated.<br/><br/>French Stewart as Harry is more or less the cute little pet and adds tremendously to the show. He acts as what at first might seem like the dumb member of the alien four, but in fact, his idiocy is what exposes that of the people that surround him in how they deal with him.<br/><br/>Finally, teenager Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Tommy is most impressive in the fact that he plays at the same level of the rest of the ensemble. The show hasn't used him as an idle, but as another resource for more of the social observations with which the show is bursting at the seems.<br/><br/>The four play together as a remarkable comedy team, each with their own quirks that evoke criticism on society. The satire is complete with the addition of the stereotypes they encounter every day. Jane Curtin as Mary, Dick's love interest, tries to appear normal and show the Solomon's that they aren't but is really as bizarre as anyone else on the show. Then there's Nina, the secretary; Don, the cop of Sally's dreams; the lovable nympho landlord, Miss Dubcek; and countless other students, colleagues, peers and various characters that teach the Solomons, themselves and us about society (I love Judith.) The show is as observant as any I've ever seen and equally funny with it's slapstick, zany dialogue, unusually usual situations and running gags.<br/><br/>My feeling is that the main source of 3rd Rock's brilliance is it's mocking classic sitcom formula. It takes the perpetually utilized premise of placing a group of outsiders in the middle of a ""normal"" group of people and completely turns it around. Unlike a show like the Beverly Hillbillies where we principally laugh at the Clampets, we're laughing it the Solomon's AND the people around them. In 3rd Rock, nobody is normal and there is no true norm, which is much truer to the world in which we live. There are all the classic patterned events from sitcoms (meeting people, dating, finding one's purpose, and the trials with which every day sitcom life presents you) but none of these situations lack a deeper meaner on 3rd Rock. Then there's the little things. Aspects such as the fact that there is no couch in the living room and that all the characters' names are those which one would have found on an older sitcom (Who's name is Sally anymore, really? Then Tom, Dick and Harry- the quintessential normal trio) are just some of the ways of the creators screw with our established expectations of prime time.<br/><br/>I love this show, and think it will endure in syndication long after we've forgotten about Veronica's Closet or whatever other weeknight carp they're handing to us these days; I don't pay much attention to it myself. Like M*A*S*H, I Love Lucy, All in the Family and other purposeful shows that have been with us for decades, 3rd Rock From the Sun always has meaning and hilarity at the same time. That's sure enough proof that this is more than your average hip singles in the city tripe and that 3rd Rock will stay a part of our society since it has done such a good job of mocking it.",21 out of 22 found this helpful.,,8 December 2001

2869,3rd Rock from the Sun, One of the best sitcoms ever.,"It's TV shows like this that make me sad for the state of TV today. Not saying that there are bad shows out there but they're just missing something.<br/><br/>3rd Rock from the Sun was a broad comedy about 4 aliens who have come to Earth to explore humanity and what it means to be human. You had the Information officer who was the oldest and wisest of the group who is now stuck in the body of a pubescent teen played wonderfully by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. He showed that even at such a young age that he'd become a great actor. There was the security officer who was a no nonsense military man who found himself in the body of a statuesque blonde bombshell. You had the high commander played in a wonderfully over the top way by the great John Lithgow. And finally you had the receiver of the group, a dimwit who's only purpose was to transmit and receive information from their boss ""the Big Giant Head"". The entire cast was amazing and most of the humor came from them not understanding humans and trying desperately to fit in.<br/><br/>I knew it was going to be a great sitcom from the very start. Harry, the dimwit with the radio in his head, wanders into the room crying out, ""I'm blind! I can't see!"" One of them, I think Sally the bombshell, responds with, ""your eyes are closed"". He takes a moment, opens his eyes and realization dawns on him, ""ohhhhhh! They're manual!"" and he wanders off.<br/><br/>During their run they explored many different things about what it means to be human but they never lost their alienness. It was sad when they finally said goodbye but like all good things, it's best to go out on a high note than to stay around too long and have it get stale.<br/><br/>You can find the episodes in syndication or online so there's really no excuse not to take a look.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,8 April 2019

Years later, I rediscovered the series in reruns and now I love it. Far from becoming dated, this series has only grown better with age, somehow.<br/><br/>The premise is that a group of aliens come to Earth to investigate earthly ways, disguised as earthlings. The alien aspect optimizes the fish-out-of-water setup, allowing maximum silliness. Imagine Mork with an entirely family in tow.<br/><br/>The cast is fantastic, starting with John Lithgow, who plays Dick, commander and patriarch of the transplanted foursome. Lithgow puts his stamp on every moment, every emotion, every action. Is this the same guy who played the smalltown clergyman in ""Footloose""? Yes, and he seems to relish the degree of zaniness and hyperbole that the series permits.<br/><br/>Sally, Harry and Tommy are played by Kristen Johnston, French Stewart, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, respectively. When the series began, Gordon-Levitt was age 15, but he already had plenty of acting experience. He holds his own with the talented cast. Stewart's Harry is a powder keg of quirks and tics just waiting to voice his inner oddity. In her role as Sally, Kristen Johnston is a force of nature. She lifts the words of the writers with her inspired vision and makes them more than was ever conceived. She can more than hold her own with Lithgow.<br/><br/>Jane Curtin as Mary, the object of Dick's affections, Wayne Knight as Officer Don, Elmarie Wendel as Mrs. Dubcek, and Simbi Kali as Nina form the rest of the excellent cast.

How would aliens react to experiencing life through human body's for the very first time. Their hilarious antics and reactions to normal everyday life in American society keeps me in stitches. <br/><br/>John Lithgow (Dick Solomon) won an Emmy for ""Outstanding Lead Actor"" for each year the show ran (1996-2001) With Kristen Johnston (Sally Solomon) winning ""Outstanding Supporting Actress"" from 1997-1999. In 1997 and 1998 The show won ""Outstanding comedy series"". In 1997 ""Third Rock"" won more Primetime Emmy awards then any other television show winning 5 of 8 Emmy nominations. <br/><br/>So imagine my shock when I look up ""best sitcoms of all time"" and to my complete dismay there is no mention of this wonderful show.

2884,World on Fire, Loved the Actors not the plot,"Well it is only the first episode and I imagine it will improve but for me the plot was very thin and seemed to trivialise the reality of the background.<br/><br/>I do not want to ""spoil"" it but by the end of August 1939 it was pretty clear what was going to happen ""peace in our time and all"". Sean is reading a newspaper with a headline of ""Poland on the Brink"" but our hero, in Poland, working at the British Embassy, needs to be told by an american reporter that the Germans are coming.
Suggesting that the British ambassador in Poland only knew what was happening when the bombs started falling is stretching it a bit.<br/><br/>I only care because real Polish soldiers, and many of them (66,000 dead, 133,700 wounded - only one estimate), lost their lives in the defence of Poland in September 1939 and the idea that the Polish army was not engaged is upsetting.
It is true that the Polish armies were initially unmobilised but so was the UK Army until a few months earlier. In Poland this quickly changed with 1.3 million Polish soldiers in the field. The battles ranged from 3rd September to 6th October. They did not just have bicycles and were finally overwhelmed by the Germans on one side and the Russians invading from the other.
But hey this is drama not a documentary. But it would be somewhat equivalent to dramatising the battle of Britain with one bi-plane and some old bloke flying it. The truth about Poland is different and much more terrible.

Our hero just has to find a French waif on the road to Dunkirk; followed by a lorry-load of men suffering from 'shell shock'. Why - the BEF at that point in the war had hardly encountered any German troops, and they had certainly not been under sustained fire. And of course an RAF pilot, also suffering from the dreaded s-s. Plus two French colonial soldiers. I had to walk away when the next scene was of an RAF base with Lois and co about to entertain the troops. They have thrown everything into this episode and it's utter tripe. Please, please read some history books.

2886,World on Fire, A Pastiche Of Tripe,"World On Fire<br/><br/>The drama established the characters in a very superficial way due to the scale of the canvas upon which the action was set, this resulted initially in the creation of some dreadful stereotypes to which we had no emotional empathy at all. The BBC allow scriptwriters to break this very simple rule, unless we know and love a character we do not care what happens to that person or whether they live or die. A pastiche of music, drama and emotion is no substitute.<br/><br/>The BBC was then guilty of inserting some inappropriate 21st century political correctness of the London metropolitan bourgeoisie to make the programme ""inclusive"", how insulting is that! To promote political world views through the guise of revisionist history is morally repugnant and needs to be called out for what it is, namely an attempt at indoctrination and brain washing. Whoever approved this production should be ashamed and held to account.<br/><br/>I was desperate to find some redeeming feature of this hotch-potch but alas I failed even the hairstyles were misplaced. Aha I found it Blake Harrison he was a star!<br/><br/>Why the screw-up, the BBC are brilliant at costume dramas but my casual observation is they just cannot do the 30's and 40's and this is perhaps the 5th such series in a row that just failed to convince, my advice stick to what you are good at and leave Downton Abbey to ITV and The Crown to Netflix.",78 out of 117 found this helpful.,1.0,16 November 2019

Sadly it has fallen far, far short of what I had hoped for. The writer doesn't even have a basic grasp of geography and seems to believe that Poland is next door to France - how else could a pair of Polish fighters walking west suddenly find they had reached France? The most ridiculous thing it the interlinked connections between the characters: yes, coincidences do happen, but for so many characters coincidentally to be connected to each other is a nonsense. The final episode of season 1 has the most outrageous coincidence of all when Harry, parachuted into Poland finds his wife walking towards him.

Schmalz is not respect. There was no Jingoism, just an oppressive sense of duty and deep fear. They knew what was coming, and they hated it.<br/><br/>The settings are wrong, a lot of the props and wardrobe are wrong and that is the one thing BBC/ITV usually get right in historical dramas The dialogue is utterly hopeless and bears no relation to how people spoke in the 1940, and that means that the emotional expression is all wrong too. The manners are wrong, any man who behaved as the men do in this serious would have been considered an utter troglodyte by those of all classes. Manners were important, and not optional. Women who behaved as the women do would have found themselves ostracized.<br/><br/>So what is it? A series about a WWII that took place in an alternate universe perhaps?

2895,World on Fire, 1939 And All That,"A Memorable History of WW II, comprising all the parts you can remember, including 103 Good Things, 5 Bad Kings and 2 Genuine Dates...<br/><br/>This has only received as many as 3 stars from me for Sean Bean's beautiful natural and understated performance.
I also enjoyed Leslie Manville as Robina, the quietly terrifying mother of the romantic lead. Someone here says that she was impossibly unpleasant. She is much more complex that that, and women like her abounded when I was a child with similar prejudices and rigid, tormented suppression of most emotion notably love and rage.
There were shades of her character from 'Harlots' (which I loved) but which worked well in this context.
The third star goes to the little Polish boy character who was flawless and also to the enthusiastic, polite,kind ,funny and brave fighter pilot who signified those times very well.They broke the mould sadly.<br/><br/>As to all of the others no no no!
They were horribly modern !
And I agree with someone here. Why is Lois's character a successful night-club singer, but ordinary town girl by day. THe latter would have been sufficient. It felt 'clunky'. And her pregnancy bump!/foam under the dress! You don't have to be very old to know that it is a truly recent thing to sport your late pregnancy in a slinky dress. She would have been told to go home possibly from the street and I don't believe she would have been allowed on a stage at all. Women just did not display pregnancy at home or publicly until the 1970s and it did not become common practice until late 80s at the earliest. I think this was the deal breaker for me concerning this 'show' The bump is ludicrously anachronistic and made me more sensitive the the multiple blunders this series comprises.<br/><br/>I was drawn to this at first. It is clearly high budget. Some of the scenic touches are very good. I Iike that steam comes from the teacups and the hearth fires are realistic.
But I am haunted by Helen Hunt's tormented face. Has she had a horribly unhappy life ? I'm deeply sorry for her for if so, but her face in repose is really worrying. She does not have the kind of presence to overcome such difficulties. What was her character meant to be? Quietly intelligent, calm, kind and steely strong was what I thought she was going for. Then some idiot director has her suddenly hold a steak knife at a German officers and spit venom at him for suggesting she go to bed with him in return for a favour for her nephew. He's an occupying soldier for God's sake governed by a force by then known for its random and capricious brutality. Her character knew this better than most according to the flimsy plot. ""I did my best and he just wanted to do me!"" she blubbers to her nephew afterwards. Paris is occupied. She wants information and behaves like an hysterical adolescent out of the blue .....oh I give up! Even just mocking him and walking away would have involved deadly risk and she would have had to pack her bags pronto, American or not.<br/><br/>
Referring back to flimsy plots the main man gets sent to Poland as a terrorist spy (because his few months of living in Poland will have rendered him as fluent in Polish as a native and be undetectable) and immediately 'bumps into' his ex ..also spy girlfriend in a wood....perlease !!!
Does the writer have any idea of how big Poland is? It would have been coincidence enough in Hull.<br/><br/>One brilliant director was required to keep this badly written pastiche afloat.
It is disrespectful to both audiences and the material to rotate between several. Why should their entertainment be prioritised? Any one of them could have worked harder and more respectfully and still allowed it to speak to audiences of today.<br/><br/>I won't go on.
But will finally say that I will watch it to the end having made it to episode 7.

Jonah Hauer-King plays that young man, but does not embody the demeanour or, especially, the mode of speech of the time. He speaks a student's London dialect of today, replete with glottal stops. A few moments viewing of any British film made in the 30s would have provided suitable models. It's not the only anachronism. Helen Hunt, playing the American journalist, presumably stipulated in her contract that she would not wear anything close to 1930s' makeup, hairstyle or clothing. (In fact she looks oddly like Penelope Keith in her prime.) She sends a radio report from Berlin back to the States, but afterwards asks her German neighbour if she heard the broadcast. I'm still wondering how that was supposed to have functioned. Perhaps it worked like the 1930s phone system, using which Jonah HK is able to chat to his mother on a crystal clear line from Poland back to England, just as war has broken out in September 1939.

It is intentionally meant to be campy and silly as it is mocking the horror genre and typical themes of those types of movies or shows. So there are stereotypes all over the place, but for me, that is part of the charm and what makes it funny. And there are so many little jokes and references that younger people might not get and maybe that is why some don't appreciate it. But I find it to be very clever.<br/><br/>The basic storyline is that of a killer or killers stalking and killing girls on a college campus in a particular sorority. Who is/are the killer/killers? Well, I have a feeling we will be led down a path to each person at some point during the series only to find out it isn't them until the ultimate reveal. And while American Horror Story (also by Ryan Murphy) is usually bloody and gory for the shock effect, this is much tamer and much more easy to watch if you aren't into gore.<br/><br/>There is a lot of innuendo and sex references, so may not be appropriate for some younger teens, but nothing over the top. And the dialogue is very fast paced and you will probably want to seriously smack Emma Robert's character after the first few minutes, but her narcissism is what makes it all work. It's all about her. At least in her mind. And you are supposed to hate her, that is the point. She is another stereotype.

2913,Scream Queens, This Fresh Hell is Brilliant,"This has got to be one of the best shows I've seen so far this year. It puts a comical spin onto what was already comical about the 90s slasher movies, while still keeping us wondering. The clichés in this are brilliantly served....and it has mystery which you want to keep watching! <br/><br/>I has the comedy that people would think of with something like Scary movie, but it still has the suspense and thrill and mystery that keep you wanting to watch more. The cast are playing the roles very well, and the writers have added the depth to them that will be fleshed out as the series progresses. There are some real good one-liners in there to remember, and the sets/locations suit where its set very well!<br/><br/>Definitely gonna keep watching this one!!!!!",73 out of 96 found this helpful.,10.0,30 September 2015
2914,Scream Queens, This show was hilarious!,"Scream Queens really lives up to the hype and just by watching the first two episodes I can see so much potential for the rest of the season. But I can also see people taking this show to seriously, which will make it lose its charm. I think that most older adults will probably not enjoy this because of the language and will think it's to silly, but it being silly is what makes it good! This series is a comedy horror which makes it creepy but also hilarious at the same time, like someone could be about to die and then something funny will happen in that same scene which will make you laugh out loud. And just seeing Emma Roberts on screen being sassy is amazing. Also the old school horror movie slasher vibe works so well! If you liked Heathers, Mean Girls, Friday the 13th and Halloween you'll definitely love this!",125 out of 170 found this helpful.,10.0,23 September 2015
2915,Scream Queens, Humorous satire on 80's slasher and youth generation of today,"""Scream Queens"", Ryan Murphy's new show is basically a horror comedy take on 80's slasher and the stupidity of certain youths today. Now the plot of the show as of episode 2 revolves around a sorority with a masked killer picking them off and others one by one; and along with this, the dramas and relationships between these students. Emma Roberts is at her best here, firing out those ""Mean Girls""esque lines and its when she's on screen the show really shines. What people don't seem to understand is that it is purely a satire show and a parody of slasher movies and youth generation of today like I mentioned before. It is definitely NOT to be taken seriously, it is generally over-the-top and ridiculously stupid (in a hilarious way). <br/><br/>The Pilot episode was overall a bummer and quite off-putting (in my opinion because it was very uninteresting) with the exception of the last quarter being quite thrilling. Episode 2 changes all this, it suddenly becomes humour-filled on every level and the true essence of campy slasher films is parodied perfectly. A scene in this episode where the girls discuss what to do with the body was hilarious, and again it is NOT to be taken seriously. Think of ""Scary Movie"", this is exactly like that (only not as over-the-top while it still is), there is entertainment to be had from ""Scream Queens"" and I'll definitely be tuning in each week. Another important mention is the identity of this masked killer, you really don't know who it is as the hints are quite out there and in your face but they apply to multiple characters. <br/><br/>Take it for what it is and don't complain about it being a ridiculous, cringing show - thats exactly what its meant to be and nothing else.",86 out of 121 found this helpful.,10.0,23 September 2015

I absolutely love Jamie Lee Curtis and Emma Roberts in this. It also gives us an opportunity to see Lea Michele in a completely different light. Kudos to her. I'm certainly not a fan of slasher movies but this is just too funny to resist.<br/><br/>The whole fashion thing, it's as fake as the people represent, and it's just another deliberate attempt and slant to make fun of this whole idea.

In my opinion it was a fun twist to the usual coming of age sorority dramas. Tad strange in places, even ridiculous in parts but some solid acting and an interesting set up, I'll be watching the next episode for sure. <br/><br/>If you don't like sprinkles of silliness then you won't like this.

2919,Scream Queens, Surprise Entertainment,"I started watching the pilot not expecting anything but found myself totally entertained the entire time. I found the acting to be amazing. Especially Emma Roberts (the evil sorority leader) who pulled off a spiteful angry girl so well and yet is somehow charming and funny. And Jamie Lee Curtis (Dean) who really seemed to be having fun in the show.<br/><br/>The show is much more comedy / mystery than it is horror / suspense. Which I really like, if I wanted another suspense show there's plenty of others to watch. This however is a very original mix.<br/><br/>A lot of people are going to not like the satire humor about racism and homosexuality. But that depends on the viewer. If you don't take it seriously it's hilarious, and like all good satire it breaks down barriers instead of puts them up. For those of you who like to be easily offended, well you may want to move onto another show. Overall it was an uplifting show that takes a fantastic twist to comedy.<br/><br/>Final verdict: Watch it! Unless your easily offended or don't like gore.",76 out of 115 found this helpful.,10.0,23 September 2015
2920,Scream Queens, More comedy than horror,This series has the right balance for a comedy with some horror. It's less graphic than American Horror Story and less hectic than Glee. The horror isn't as sickening as AHS so a wider audience can watch it. The pace is less hectic and slapstick than Glee. The one liners are funnier and you have time to digest the jokes. It's more comedy than horror and I'm fine with that.<br/><br/>Emma Roberts is the queen bee of a sorority where murders are taking place. She is given a lot of the good lines and she delivers them quite well. You can see her learning to be a comedienne here. She looks prettier than in AHS. Abigail Breslin is a bit under utilized. Lea Michelle doesn't dominate the other cast and that's good.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis has a juicy role as Dean of the school.

Its not meant to be taken to serious which some people just don't get. scream queens plays into the clichés like the jock and his girlfriend the mean blonde popular girl who would rather die then chip her nail polish, and i think its hilarious.<br/><br/>If American horror story was a bit to gory for you or glee was a bit to dull give scream queens a shot I think its a great show and it doesn't hurt to a least watch an episode.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,7 September 2016
2922,Scream Queens, Fun and dark slasher comedy,"This is a show that definitely stands out from a lot of the stuff that we see on TV. First of all, practically all of the characters are hard to like, but to some degree it adds to the humor. Scream Queens definitely has a lot of different layers and it pays tribute to old school slasher movies and even college comedies. You have the typical stuck up sorority president, the college dean that is out to get them, and the underdog pledges who really shouldn't be trying to get into the sorority in the first place. And yet, it takes all of these things and adds some fun twists! I love Lea Michele's character who is not that innocent and very weird. In fact, each of the characters have secrets and darkness to them which keeps you guessing on trying to figure out who the killer is. I will definitely keep coming back to try to uncover all the mysteries going on. Can't wait for more!",78 out of 121 found this helpful.,9.0,23 September 2015

I also liked that it would leave you hanging like ""Oh no, what happened?"" and it kept me waiting till the next episode. I always looked forward to the next show.

The humor is sick and twisted which is the ""better"" kind of TV Show. Once you get used to the irony and strange behavior it's actually pretty addicting. I love Emma Roberts in her psychopathic roles and this by far tops her American Horror Story: Coven performance. The amount of times I had to question my intelligence at some of the humor was worrying. The Story line leaves you wanting more and at the end of the season you can't help but think how Season 2 will be. I rate this excellent only because there aren't enough series like this out there with a complete and utter ""crazy/Psycho"" appeal.

For everybody else this is a must watch show. I cannot get over how good it is and hope it retains it's awesomeness through each season.<br/><br/>It has taken heaps of inspiration from various pop culture references but it doesn't feel awkward or unnecessary. It just makes the show even more hilarious and relevant. It's not your average show but even so it reminds me of Glee, Pitch Perfect and Scream all rolled in together, just without the singing.

2929,Scream Queens, Hard to watch.,"'Scream Queens' comes off as trying too hard. <br/><br/>I get that the show is not meant to be taken seriously and it's supposed poke fun at current social behaviors but their attempt at humor fails miserably. Instead, I get quite irritated and I find myself cringing almost half the time as the scenes are constantly silly. <br/><br/>The characters lack depth and charm – they're either way too stereotypical or way too weird. I've got to say though, Emma Roberts really shines in this. Her character reminds me of her role in the movie 'Wild Child' where she also plays a rich, spoiled brat. She's the one that makes the show easier to watch for me.<br/><br/>At this point, I don't give the slightest care in the world as to who's the Red Devil as there's basically zero build up from the get go. Such a shame as the costume, makeup and music choices were all quite wonderful.

2932,Scream Queens, This show is not for adults.,"I'm 29 years old and I could tell within the first 25 minutes that this was not made for my age group. I was excited to watch Scream Queens because I'm a huge horror fan. And with Supernatural getting old, The Walking Dead not being my cup of tea, and my lack of love for American Horror Story I figured I might have finally found a horror series I can cling to. WRONG! <br/><br/>This series is about b**tches being b**tches towards helpless nerds. We've seen this so many times before. It's played out. It's not funny. It's boring. And it makes the show appear down right juvenile. I understand what they're trying to do. They're trying to be Clueless meets Scream, meets Mean Girls, meets Scary Movie but it ain't working. It comes across as try hard and obnoxious. I think I laughed twice out of the entire 2 hour special although they attempted to be funny numerous times and failed. <br/><br/>If I were a 15 year old girl then I think I ""might"" would be able to appreciate this.

2933,Leverage, Fun,"""Leverage"" is an entertaining, fun show. The cast is stellar, the writing snappy, and the characters are likable. It's nice to see a show that doesn't focus too heavily on the ""dark side"" of everything and can exist without a message.<br/><br/>That's not to say that there aren't poignant moments. (Nate in ""The Snow Job"" and Parker in ""The Stork Job"" are particularly memorable.) But they aren't in the majority. Although not every episode is brilliant, none have failed yet to make me laugh at least once.<br/><br/>The show follows a group of thieves who take on corporate villains who have too much power for their victims to defend themselves under normal means. Timely? Oh, yeah.<br/><br/>Timothy Hutton is the much-advertised Oscar-winning face of the team's leader, ex-insurance investigator Nathan Ford. At first, I was incredibly underwhelmed by Hutton's performance. After a few episodes, however, I started to think that maybe he was deliberately underacting (while the others are overacting) to contrast Nate's ""honest man"" to the thieves who make up the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Gina Bellman plays a sympathetic Sophie Deveraux. Sophie is the team's ""grifter"" who moonlights as an actress. How well does that go? As Nate puts it, ""she can act... when it's an act."" Although she's hilarious, Bellman isn't the funniest of the cast by any means. Christian Kane, the badass Texan you might remember from ""Angel,"" is even tougher, funnier, and angrier as the team's strangely likable fighter Eliot Spencer. Beth Riesgraf contrasts his deadpan humor perfectly as Parker, the crazy but lovable money-obsessed thief. And Aldis Hodge is hilarious, playing the cool geek of their techie, Alec Hardison.<br/><br/>The group has their conflicts, and in the first season, it looks like their biggest problem might be staying together. But the quirkiness and bickering creates a team of misfits that will have you rooting for them from the beginning.<br/><br/>""Leverage"" is a good, escapist show where everything is sexy and exciting and the good guys always win.

2934,Leverage, A Very Engaging Set of Capers,"After catching the first few episodes of TNT's new series ""Leverage"" I can honestly say that I'm hooked on the adventures of Nathan Ford (Timothy Hutton) and company.<br/><br/>The series involves Mr. Ford, formerly an insurance investigator, and his crew of felonious recruits: Alec Hardison (Aldis Hodge), a very technologically savvy cyber-criminal. Eliot Spencer (Christian Kane), the muscle man with sincere martial arts training and speed that would make Jet Li envious. Parker (Beth Riesgraf), an expert cat burglar and thief. And Sophie Devereaux (Gina Bellman), a charismatic con-artist with aspirations to the acting world.<br/><br/>I believe Nathan Ford says it best, ""I am an honest man leading a team of criminals."" And I find that premise to be truly entertaining with Timothy Hutton at the helm.<br/><br/>Each episode Nathan Ford and his team are hired by individuals looking for their own brand of justice. Ford and company provide the means to an end, focusing on gathering a form of leverage to force the villains to pay their due.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a series I would recommend for those who like a bit of comedy with their justice.

2935,Leverage, Excellent new TV series! Well worth watching!,"It usually takes me about three episodes of a new series to decide if it's worth continuing to watch. With ""Leverage"" I was hooked after the first 15 minutes. I think it's because it seemed to be an amalgam of some of my favorite TV shows of the past. This includes ""The Equalizer"" (righting wrongs using unconventional methods), ""Mission Impossible"" (the TV series)(putting a great team together to work towards a common goal), and ""Banicek"" (solving seemingly perfect crimes).<br/><br/>What I really like about it is the team. It is made up of very independent individuals who are master criminals. The key is how they have been enticed to work for Nathan Ford (Timothy Hutton's character). They all contribute to the cause and, because of it, find they are a very powerful force that can get them more of what they are looking for. There is also a camaraderie that I haven't seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>What I also like about this show is that it is not dark and seedy. While there is violence, it is not gratuitous. And, so far, there have been no plot lines that involve stalkers or other misogynistic individuals. One can only hope it continues that way.<br/><br/>While there are great special effects, great sets, great actors and great acting, etc., I find that it is the writers who deserve the lions share of praise for concocting such an enjoyable storyline.<br/><br/>I am REALLY looking forward to more ""Leverage"" episodes! 10 out of 10",137 out of 157 found this helpful.,10.0,12 December 2008

Watching the pilot episode of Leverage was really a treat. It's been a long time since I've seen a show at the end of which I found myself truly satisfied. <br/><br/>There is a depth to Nathan Ford's plans that constantly leaves you guessing what will come next which makes every episode so much more than just the two-dimensional plot-lines that we have come to expect with even the ""deepest"" of today's shows. And the individual members of his team are every bit as interesting. The combination of an arrogant, sociopath of a combat expert, a psychopathic thief, a brilliant improv actress and a savvy tech genius come together to give us a TV family that we can actually get behind.<br/><br/>The concept of a Robin Hood-esquire plot-line seems almost to be grossly overdone in today's culture, but by accomplishing it through the use of some truly colorful anti-heroes, who truly are in it just for the money, we end up with some great House-Like characters. It's never the client who is truly important, they're just the justification.<br/><br/>In short, Leverage is a truly refreshing experience that should attract fans of a number of different prior franchises.

Yummy! I was really upset when they cancelled this show after season 5, but I really think they should bring it back! The premise of the show is essentially a group of the 4 best highly skilled criminal operatives in the world ranging from a hacker, grafter, cat burglar and a hitter are brought together under the supervision of an ex-insurance investigator to pull a heist that goes slightly wrong, so then they start to help average everyday people get leverage over large corporations, millionaires, the authorities and pretty much anyone who tries to screw over us honest hardworking everyday people.<br/><br/>One of the most important things for me is not only the portrayal of the characters on screen but the chemistry of the characters, if I am invested in the characters and their mates I don't care what the story is I will watch it, examples: Castle, NCIS, NCIS: LA, NCIS: New Orleans, Person of Interest, CSI, Elementary, Death in Paradise The thing that shines throughout these TV shows is not only a phenomenal cast and the writing, but the relationships between the characters.<br/><br/>Leverage has an amazing cast who play some very lovable characters with their physical, emotional and verbal banter with the backing of their dramatic, flawed and charismatic performances, with a teaspoon of deliciously funny and a dollop of whipped quirkiness and not forgetting a chocolate flake this show has everything you want.

2942,Leverage, Wow!,"""Leverage?!!!"" People said when they first saw the name of the television series when it came out in 2008. I asked myself the same question when I saw the preview for it on TNT, but when I saw that Timothy Hutton was in it I wanted to see it no matter what the name might be. We all know the Timothy Hutton from the Nero Wolfe T.V. show, on which he played Archie Goodwin, who was a smart, wisecracking, and handsome assistant to the detective of the same name. How could Timothy Hutton be in a movie that is about bad guys? I asked myself after looking up to him most of my life. ""Sometimes bad guys make the best good guys"" which is the motto of the television show. Even though I had my suspicions about it being another profane T.V. show it turned out to be a great show that had great messages in all of its episodes. My brother turned to me one day and said to me about Leverage that ""all of the episodes would make great movies!"" And now after watching all of the first season and part of the second I am convinced of this statement. Is there bad stuff in this show? You are asking yourself at this point and with good cause, but the answer is: no. There are some innuendos in it, but they are very minor.

2943,Leverage, Entertaining depiction of pluses and minuses of team work,"/refers to all Seasons in a sequence/<br/><br/>Although I have my hesitations regarding how realistic those events and characters are (well, organising such scams and cons in a country of multiple and high-level security organisations), the idea behind is good and the process well explained - whether during a con or later, using flashbacks. When at first, Timothy Hutton seemed to excel his counterparts, then as the episodes progressed, one could see more virtues in others as they appeared more often on screen than Hutton. True, there were moments when some recurring or supporting cast provided stronger and/or funnier elements (e.g. Skerritt, Stormare), but holistically, it made the Series more interesting and intense.<br/><br/>I can´t say that the seasons became weaker or so, but as modern technology enables to watch as much episodes as and when you wish, you seem to ""become exhausted"" as the main characters become part of your family and daily routines. Luckily, the creators knew when and how to stop - and the very final episode is interesting and resourceful.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,9 December 2019

2945,Leverage," A Fun Series, Grows on You - May Contain Spoilers","Although this certainly won't win any awards and will always draw comparisons to the BBC's ""Hu$tle"" and the ""Ocean"" movies, it makes for a fun hour of TV watching, carving out a nice niche in American TV.<br/><br/>Timothy Hutton provides an effective counter to the sometimes ""devil may care"" attitude of his team members as Nathan Ford, a divorced alcoholic who has had difficulty getting over the death of his son, and rightfully blames his old company for not providing the health care he needed to survive. When a desperate executive hires him to recover some stolen airline plans, he takes the job of leading a group of con artists and thieves to retrieve them. However, when the job becomes more than it appears, it's up to Nate to keep the team together and turn the tables. Even though everybody in the group became financially set for life after the first episode, the lure of helping out others keeps them coming back for more.<br/><br/>Although we've seen shows like this before (""The A-Team"" is the closest comparison), there's something lighter and more fun about this hi-tech redux of a group of cons helping out those who have no one to turn to. The characters grow on you as the show progresses, most notably high-tech uber-geek Alec Hardison (Aldis Hodge) and the goofy, lithe, acrobatic Parker (Beth Riesgraf). Nate's on again-off again repartee with Sophie Devereaux (Coupling's Gina Bellman) has hit both highs and lows in the show. Some consider Eliot Spencer (Christian Kane), as the team's ""muscle,"" to be a weak point in the show. However, there is a good rapport between Eliot and Hardison, similar to Jack Cates and Reggie Hammond from the ""48 Hrs."" movies.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good addition to the TNT library of shows. Not it's best show, but it's certainly worthy of another season.",13 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,19 February 2009
2946,Leverage," Generally positive, but the jury's still out","I could tell from the trailers that Leverage would be the kind of show I'd enjoy - good guys vs. bad guys without the ambiguity of the legal system to get in the way. It did indeed deliver on that promise. It was cleverly paced and scripted and populated with interesting, likable characters.<br/><br/>So why is the jury still out? The short answer is that I DVR'ed it and watched it more than once.<br/><br/>Although it's slick, the script had holes it just hoped you wouldn't notice. When compared to a show with really clever scripts (e.g. Burn Notice), I found too many ""wait a minute"" moments - places where your successful suspension of disbelief depends on the viewer's short attention span or lack of reasoning ability. I won't drop spoilers to name some of the more obvious ones - if anyone doesn't notice them, who am I to point them out?<br/><br/>There's a lot of talent in this series.

Great direction. Great stories. I don't care that there were some ""wait-a-minute"" moments, watching this show made me feel good. That's something so lacking in today's entertainment world. I just don't get ratings. Smart is definitely not the goal. The goal is to play to the lowest common denominator of the human race. I'm so saddened that this show was not extended.

2950,Leverage, I'm not bothered by its similarity to other shows,"I discovered Leverage late and am now watching it on Netflix and loving every minute of it.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, it is reminiscent of other shows, but that's true of a lot of series and films. This one reminds me of ""Mission: Impossible"" a little. I actually did not watch Burn Notice, The Equalizer, or A-Team. Someone else mentioned Banacek, but I thought the crimes and solutions on Banacek were much more elaborate.<br/><br/>Timothy Hutton plays the leader of the team, Nate. Anyone who saw ""Ordinary People"" remembers his searing performance as a troubled youth. Here he plays, basically, the sane one, driven by a need for revenge against monolithic companies.<br/><br/>Nate is driven by revenge, but the rest of the team is made up of quirky characters who are thieves. Most notable is Gina Bellman as an atrocious actress, Sophie, who, when it comes to doing a con, could win an Oscar. Joining her is Christian Kane as the rough, tough, and funny Elliot, Beth Riesgraf is Parker, driven by money, and Aldis Hodge is Alec the techno-Geek. <br/><br/>They all come together for one job, but their work together becomes ongoing. All of their acting is terrific, and each character is unique.<br/><br/>The show is well-produced, with plenty of humor, special effects, and not a lot of violence. It's very enjoyable.

2951,Leverage," Slick, Witty, Entertaining","The show features a team of crooks trying to seek revenge on big companies/people who have done wrong to many people and are seen as bad people. The show in itself is very good, the script is well written, it is slick, witty and entertaining. <br/><br/>The only negative I can find in 'Leverage' is that it is predominantly the same as the BBC's (British Brodcasting Centre) Hustle, which involves a team of intellectual crooks taking money from and destroying reputations and careers of the 'bad' people previously mentioned. (sound familiar??) However, I do see this as a positive as Leverage has more than lived up to the brilliance of Hustle, one of my favourite shows, and I intend to continue to watch both for as long as they continue. <br/><br/>The main positives of Leverage is how unpredictable it is, with twists at every corner, and another is the intelligence. This show is similar to the 'oceans eleven' series of films, and if you liked them, I can assure you that you will like this as well!<br/><br/>Give this one a try, I think you will like it!",13 out of 18 found this helpful.,8.0,20 June 2009
2952,Leverage," Great show, but Hustle was better.","After watching two seasons of Leverage, it seems appropriate to review it. I enjoyed every moment of watching it and it's not a bad show at all. Some cons were easy to guess, others were not. Interesting characters, but I haven't learnt much about most of them so far. There was some back story to Nathan Ford's character and to Parker too, but very little on the rest. This makes it difficult to relate to them and the impact of the cons less effective on me as a viewer.<br/><br/>I have to admit, I watched the British show Hustle first, and I must agree with another reviewer and say that Hustle is better. So if you like and enjoy Leverage, watching Hustle is a must! In my opinion, the cons in Hustle are much more elaborate/intricate and the narrative is played out really well. I'm sure other reviewers have mentioned how the pauses in Hustle are entertaining and when a character breaks the fourth wall, it's amusing, intriguing and it's like you're being taught how to be a grifter - which is simply fantastic! This also brings out the personalities for each of the characters. I have to say the characters in Hustle are more unique than those in Leverage - especially when it comes to the team leaders. I prefer the cocky Mickey Stone (from Hustle) with a bad past and something to hide than the tragic hero that Nate Ford is. NOT saying that I don't like Nate, but with him already beating the insurance company that hurt his son, it doesn't seem like there could be more development in that area.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Leverage is a good show and I only hope to find out more about Parker and Eliot in particular. If you enjoy watching the real bad guys go down, and seeing justice served (especially the rich and corrupt), this is definitely something that will brighten up your night.",10 out of 14 found this helpful.,8.0,2 June 2010

2954,Leverage, Leverage gets your dose of white hat-black hat conman every week,"Leverage might after a first show look like a series replica of Oceans Eleven with even the same generic music attached to some scenes, it fares deeper into a storyline you might expect being left on the cutting room floor of that same movie. Revenge being a large element of the series and changing plots, schemes and situations putting a viewer on the wrong foot this show delivers what all the polish and high-speed actors in forenamed picture couldn't actually deliver: credibility!<br/><br/>Many TV fans were loving a show like Thief (2006) but for the big audience that's called TV this is too grimy and realistic. Don't expect somebody to get actually hurt in ""Leverage"". The grimy and therefor risky aspect of the show has been rooted out carefully and in comes a storyline that could have been a ""A-team"" episode. Maybe halfway the season Colonel Decker will start chasing the headliners of this show but until then it's a risk-free show that won't be canceled.<br/><br/>Agreed, whoever thought of this format was far from a genius (the genius invented ""Thief 2006"") but he'll have a job for that much longer mixing Oceans Eleven, Thief and the A-team together in a show that doesn't offend, hurt, kill or mame people and yet stays funny and interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Leverage is a good TV-show among other good TV-shows but will eventually wind up in decay like other good TV-shows will. In one more season it will be more boring to watch then the new episode of Prison Break. Maybe it will generate the same cult status and devotion with viewers they will keep watching and it survives 2 seasons more. I hope so since this quiche of TV-shows is the most entertaining and relaxing show i've seen this year...<br/><br/>9/10 (won't last 2 seasons)<br/><br/>P.S A delight to see Gina Bellman again after a brilliant role in Coupling.

2959,Bewitched, I dreamed of Samantha,"`Bewitched' is one of my favorite shows of all time. `I Dream of Jeannie' did indeed have its moments, but I truly dreamed of Samantha! `Bewitched' offered lighthearted comedy while staying true to the `escapist' themes of the 1960s. Additionally, it was well written, and one of the few shows able to work seamlessly through numerous cast changes.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Montgomery WAS Samantha. No one will ever take her place. She was stunningly beautiful, creative, talented, and convincing in her role. Personally, I don't think she knew how great she really was as an actress. Likewise, Dick York WAS Darrin (yeah, I like 'em neurotic). The chemistry between York and Agnes Moorehead was one of a kind - and the chemistry between Montgomery and York was quite memorable, too. All three were at the top of their game in my two favorite episodes, `Double, Double, Toil and Trouble' and `If They Never Met.' Don't get me wrong, though - Dick Sargent deserves a lot of credit for coming in and taking over a role that had tough shoes to fill. In addition, Paul Lynde also offered some memorable moments - it would be a crime not to acknowledge his contribution to the show.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that I'll be `bewitched' for the rest of my life.

Like many other people I also liked Jeannie, but not as much as Bewitched. Because Samantha was married and had children, and she seemed so in love with Darrin, she really tried so hard not to use her powers out of love for Darrin, but of course she couldnt help it once in a while, when all of her relatives would always do something to get her or Darrin into trouble specilly Endora, I really liked her. She was such an evil mother in law, but arent they all? ha ha ha. And what about Aunt Clara, the poor thing never got a trick right. And Esmeralda, Dr. Bombay, Cousin Serena, Aunt Hagatha, Maurice, Uncle Arthur was such a clown, and all the others who just pop in and out with out an invitation, is a surprise Darrin didnt run away LOL<br/><br/>All of the actors who played on this show did a great job, for a show that was from the 60s it sure had some great scenes, all that magic it was just so much fun to watch, I think we all wished Samantha was our mom, the things she could have done for us.

2966,Bewitched, How Inane.....But I Just love it!,"Jeannie and Bewitched have to be two of the most formulaic and predictable shows ever aired on TV. Every episode of Bewitched had ,in different orders and combinations, the same formula of Endora zaps something to muck up Darrin, and it pays off in Darrin's favour; witchcraft of some sort interferes with Darrin's work and he gets fired, then re-hired, when the witchcraft again pays off, or is foiled. While in the meantime, Gladys Kravitz, Mrs Stavens, or some unsuspecting extra is baffled by it all, and theres always some unbelievable explanation at the end of it all which the long suffering cast members swallow. With that in mind, its bizarre that it still rates in re - runs, and its bizarre that I've taped about 7 blank tapes worth of the show from  TV that I watch again and again. I can't get enough of it. So. obviously the show has a lot of appeal which allows viewers to look beyond, or perhaps enjoy the formula. I think the appeal lies in alot of things. First, the magic is a huge and fascinating drawcard. Wouldn't we all love to be able to make things appear and disappear with a twitched, and wouldn't we all love Barbara Eden as our Genie who's madly in love with us? We all would (males, anyway RE Barbara Eden), and thats what draws us to the shows. Its also brilliant and magical itself to see the special effects being done nearly forty years ago without computers or complex editing machines. That really put a smile on my face. The characters were all so far - out an exotic, all kind of like British aristocrats who had lost all air of conservatism, and lived carefree lives zapping from the Riviera to lunch in Shanghai. They were so funny, fantastic and appealing. I loved the conflict too; Endora and Darrin, Darrin and Larry; Darrin and Serena etc. And the actors of course were all brilliant, and having a tremendous time playing their roles, and fun roles they were. The chemistry on set between York and Montgomery was so believable and real, the flamboyance and gestures of Endora and Dr Bombay was loads of fun, and the comic timing of York was always perfect. Yes, Betwitched and Jeannie have to be my two favourite TV shows of all time, because they're just unpretentious, lightweight and appealing entertainment, and thats why they've lasted so long, because who would take a show about witches seriously anyway.

2967,Bewitched, It is a crime that they stopped airing reruns,"As I said, it's a crime that they stopped airing reruns (at least where I live). I remember being a kid and every night I would watch a double-bill of two wonderful magical (literally) programs on Nickelodeon- I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched. I always liked Bewitched a bit more for reasons I can't explain. Bewitched never quite got laughs out of me the way Seinfeld and Friends do but it is still a very cute television show that I will always love. Elizabeth Montgomery (who unfortunately passed away at a rather young age in 1995) plays the part of Samantha (and she plays it very well, as all the actors on this show, who unfortunately also all died before the millenium- besides the Tabitha and Adam twins), a witch married to a mortal husband in the advertising biz. Her husband, Darrin hates her mother, Endora who hates him just as much- but has an advantage, if he p****s her off she can always turn him into a frog or a doormat or send him off to Iraq. The characters also include a nosy neighbor who is sure of Samantha's powers but no one will believe her (not even her husband), Darrin's advertising boss, Larry Tate (who fires and re-hires Darrin quite oftenly), Samantha's evil twin sister (also played by Montgomery) and Samantha's very clumsy aunt who couldn't turn a man into a frog if he were green and lived in a pond.

The episodes were very formulaic-Darrin would mess something up and through a sequence of events Samantha would put it right with a twitch of her nose whilst trying not to arouse the suspicion of the neighbours/friends etc.<br/><br/>The funniest thing about this show was how true to life it was. I think it's safe to admit that us males usually need a woman to sort out any problems we have. Okay, she may not literally do it with the twitch of a nose but a woman is always good at sorting a problem out. That was the crux of Bewitched. Darrin was always making mistakes and getting into a predicament but he could always depend on his wife Samantha to sort things out.

2969,Bewitched, Utterly bewitching,"Despite being a younger viewer of 'Bewitched', with the show being aired well before my time, one doesn't need to have been born in the 1960s or before to feel that the 60s was a great decade for television, 'The Munsters', 'The Addams Family', 'Doctor Who' and 'Bewitched' being just a few very good to classic shows.<br/><br/>'Bewitched' may not be a perfect or completely magical show, but at its best (with the early seasons being better than the later ones) it was utterly bewitching viewing that puts a spell on fans and doesn't make the mistake of trying to put too much into the cauldron. A mistake that the frustrating missed opportunity that was the 2005 film based on the show committed.<br/><br/>The later seasons did have some overripe acting (Alice Ghostley for example) and some of the story lines lack the freshness of those of the early seasons, some being lacking in variety and feeling a little stale.<br/><br/>However, 'Bewitched' has production values that were clearly made with love and affection and the slick photography complements them well. For the 60s, the show does still look pretty good. The effects are not always special (particularly early on) and there could have been more of them but most of the time they are hardly slapdash, make interesting use of film techniques and have a good deal of charm, putting some effects seen on television these days, and in the past 30 years or so, to shame.<br/><br/>When it comes to the music, 'Bewitched' is unique especially in, as has been picked up upon in its critical reception, the synthesised sound of nose twitching. The theme tune is memorable. The writing is very funny, touchingly charming, very snappy, provokes thought and is very true to life. The early episodes narration delivered by an uncredited Jose Ferrer gave a lot of sociological insight into a witch adapting to life in middle class suburbia and her role in society.<br/><br/>Most of the story lines have a real magical charm and have a huge amount of humour and truth. That they do these so well more than makes up for the formulaic nature of them that one is willing to overlook. The sociological insight is fascinating, though nowadays viewers may find what is said and the sociological insights very of the time.<br/><br/>Particularly successful are the large assortment of likable characters and the large cast clearly having the time of their lives. A large part of 'Bewitched's' charm is the peerless acting of lovely Elizabeth Montgomery. Likewise with Agnes Moorehead, one cannot imagine anybody else as Endora (certainly not equalling her if tried let alone outshining, Moorehead was one of a kind).<br/><br/>Her chemistry with a splendidly neurotic Dick York is one of the best in the history of television, though York and Montgomery aren't that far behind either. Dick Sargeant does a valiant effort filling big shoes replacing York and does a good job, though he lacks York's spark. In secondary roles, the hilarious turns from Bernard Fox and especially Paul Lynde stand out.<br/><br/>In summary, utterly bewitching. 8/10 Bethany Cox",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,8.0,19 September 2017
2970,Bewitched, Great American Show,"Now I believe I saw the very first show, when curiously wide-eyed Dick York's character discovered that his wife was a witch. From then onwards I was hooked. I also developed a juvenile 'thing' for Elizabeth Montgomery. She conveyed just the right mix of maturity, fun and allure. Witch or no, she seemed like the ideal partner. Special-effects were of the simplest. The entertainment rested entirely with the comedic situations and the chemistry between the characters.<br/><br/>I think the early series was inevitably the freshest, with the more original ideas, even though they were black &amp; white and had lower production values.<br/><br/>The theme music was also one of my favourites. It's light-jazz melody had a warm homeliness that seemed to idealise the affection in their relationship.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,29 August 2010
2971,Bewitched, groundbreaking in so many ways,"First, perspective. This was from the so-called ""golden age"" of TV comedy. Laugh tracks. Censors. Guys in suits approving everything, including the catering. Formulas pretending to be scripts. Three networks competing for timeslots (on a good day, two only on most days.) Against this backdrop: 1. The show was all about Montgomery. The daughter of a major actor, and the wife of a major director, she had been mainly under-exposed until Bewitched (see my review of Johnny Cool on IMDb, an exception to this rule). But all that changed with this show. The general view prior to BW was that sitcom wives should be pleasant but not stunning. The template was believed to be set by Lucille Ball who, despite being a chorus girl in her youth, was looking a little shopworn by the time the mid 50s rolled around. (And the wife of the second banana was always 10 notches below the star -- Ethel in Lucy, Millie in Dick Van Dyke). But this show broke the mold. Montgomery was stunning. An entire generation of young men grew up determined that they too would find a mate who was not only a good homemaker but looked like her. In fact, her popularity was so far off the charts, that the lacklustre TV movies she did in the 70s scored uniformly high, solely because audiences wanted to see her again. 2. The show proved conclusively that audiences were loyal only to the star, not the second stringers. Dick York, the husband, was replaced mid-season with another character (also played by a Dick -- this became fodder for jokes) and no one seemed to care. The same fate befell the actress playing the nosey neighbour. But the show moved on. 3. The idea of recycled major stars playing TV in retirement also came from BW. Agnes Moorehead, believe it or not, was once a major starlet, and considered glamorous. But work is work, and she was happy to take the role of Samantha's mother, essentially playing a harpie. 4. The notion of giving the star two parts, playing different characters, also started here. EM played herself and also her more extroverted cousin, with good results.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,2 November 2013
2972,Bewitched, Very entertaining 60s fantasy sitcom.,"Bewitched was one of several 60s comedies, that had fantasy themes. Other shows in the same genre, included I Dream Of Jeannie, The Adams Family, The Flying Nun, Mister Ed, My Favorite Martian, etc. <br/><br/>Bewitched's shtick revolved around an ordinary housewife, who had extraordinary magical powers. Samantha Stevens happened to be a witch, who was married to her husband, Darrin. Darrin was a regular guy (a mortal in witche's lingo) without magical powers, just like the rest of us. <br/><br/>Darrin had to deal not only with the powers of his wife, but also his wife's many relatives, including his little daughter, Tabitha. Samantha and her witchy family, were always twitching their noses and conjuring-up chaos, for poor Darrin. He was forever trying to hide Samantha's, and her family's, supernatural mischief from his boss, Larry Tate.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Montgomery was excellent in her role as suburban wife, mother, and witch, Samantha Stevens. There were two different actors who played Darrin, throughout the series. Both of them, coincidently, had the same first name; Dick. Dick York, played Darrin early in the series. Dick Sargent, stepped into the role of Darrin, after Dick York left the show in 1969. <br/><br/>To me, Dick York was better than Dick Sargent, as the high-strung, overwrought Darrin Stevens. Other supporting cast members, really shone in this series. Especially David White as Darrin's demanding boss, Larry Tate. And also Agnes Moorehead, as Samantha's meddling mother, Endora.<br/><br/>Bewitched was a very entertaining show, that was enjoyable for all ages. And it's really stood the test of time. I highly recommend it, for fans of '60s sitcoms.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,28 March 2009
2973,Bewitched, A great show that lost its way,"Bewitched was a great show with some funny stories at the start but I felt it lost its way when Dick York had to leave because of ill health. Dick Sargent wasn't quite the same and I thought the stories suffered for it. What else didn't help was that the latter stories were often a rehash of earlier ones, it was obvious at the end that the scriptwriters were running out of ideas. Marion Lorne played Aunt Clara brilliantly and when she sadly passed away in 1968, the series suffered from this body blow as Alice Ghostley, who played Esmerelda was no Marion Lorne. I actually found her character irritating as well as Samantha's cousin, Serina. It's sad looking back at the show, to realize that hardly any of the stars of the show are still alive. Dick York, Dick Sargent and Elizabeth Montgomery all died within 3 years of each other and all in their 60s.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,,4 September 2004
2974,Bewitched, Your Typical New York Suburban Housewife....Except!!!!,"The originality in this series was incredible!! Elizabeth Montgomery twitched her way through eight successful years of ""Bewitched""... This show had a definite impact on my childhood!! The premise being: This is your typical All-American housewife, except, this woman happens to be a witch!! Envision if you will, a house wife who can zap up this and twitch up that.. Basically conjure up anything your little heart desires with just the twitch of her nose!! Now enters the myriad of upper middle class complications!! I sort of identified with the Stevens household!! My opinion of it was that you could not get too much more Republican than this.. Especially some of the furniture, and the executive potpourri of golf, business, and drinking!! Sammantha's magic was not geared at just whipping up expensive accoutrement that your typical upscale white collar guinea pig cannot afford, rather, it was about evening the score on what matters and how people should actually behave!! Relative's of Sammantha's use to literally pop in all the time... Endora (Agnes Moorehead) the mother, used her powerful sorcerer's chicanery to make the banal life with a mortal husband (Darrin) more interesting!! To her, boredom was the ultimate felony!! I thought both Darrins were really well cast (Dick York and Dick Seargant)... Tabitha was the little witch and the daughter, and Adam was the mortal and the son!! The onslaught of guest stars were endless, including Richard Dreyfuss, and Raquel Welch!!... I thought ""Bewitched"" was was of the better shows in the history of television... I was not too crazy about the writing though.. When it premiered, it was considered one the most lewd and suggestive shows ever to be put on the airwaves... By today's standards that seems ridiculous, at the same time, when I heard this, I realized what they were saying in that this show illustrated numerous insinuations of attempted infidelity with one lecherous curmudgeon after the next!! These alcohol induced endeavors were relatively transparent!!.. Samntha had to be the disciplined one who quelled these charades, usually with her witchcraft!! In 1971, ""Bewitched"" ratings began to plummet, finally, programming directors at ABC basically killed it by putting it up against the enormously popular ""All in the Family"" on Saturday nights!! All good things must come to an end. including a television show which epitomized the idealism of the imaginative honey pot ""Bewitched""... Part of my childhood, a very good part of my childhood.. I think that that is why the latest movie of ""Bewitched was so popular too!!",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,28 July 2007

2976,Bewitched, Truly Magical,"I love Bewitched! It was and still is the most perfect series ever created. It's a shame that they don't make TV like they used to.<br/><br/>Bewitched was way before my time, but when I first started watching reruns of it a couple of years back, I couldn't believe how good it was. I think that it was a gem in its own time, and now it looks kind of silly to some people.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Montgomery was a remarkable actress who played the perfect witch. Dick York and Dick Sargent both played Darrin in an excellent way. Agnes Moorhead was a terrific witch as well. The entire cast performed so well together and Elizabeth and Dick made it look like they were a real married couple. Cheers to the cast and even to little Erin Murphy.<br/><br/>The writing wasn't extremely funny, but they made it to the point where you couldn't turn away. Each episode contained some kind of witch problem and it was always entertaining. I can honestly say that I enjoyed EVERY episode.<br/><br/>Every time that I watch Bewitched, I have to remember that it was back in the 1960's. For the years it was on the air, I believe that it was way ahead of its time. The thought of watching a witch twitch her nose and make anything appear or disappear every week, makes me wish that I was alive back then.<br/><br/>The show is based around magic and I can't believe some of the stuff that they did. Today, we have computers doing almost everything in entertainment. I think that it was great that a show took the time and patience to make all the magic happen.<br/><br/>Bewitched was and is truly magical. I would just like to see the reruns back on the air.

2977,Bewitched," fun show, typical of the times","Fun and surprisingly long-lasting series (8 years on the air), hanging in there despite all kinds of problems. Cast members became ill, or even died, but no problem--- the character would simply be played by someone else! It's amazing now to think of the show getting away with this to such an extent; even the male LEAD was played by two different actors.<br/><br/>""Bewitched"" was the story of beautiful suburban housewife Samantha--- who just happens to be a witch with magic powers--- being married to Darrin, a hapless advertising-executive mortal. Although both Samatha and Darrin were white, this was the mixed marriage to end all mixed marriages. Her relatives (and there were a lot of them) all had magic powers, and most of them thought of themselves as being quite superior to Darrin, in fact, superior to all mere mortals. They also had a hilarious tendency to pop in---literally, appearing out of thin air--- on Samantha and Darrin at most inconvenient times.<br/><br/>It was understood by all the ""witchy"" characters (Samantha and her relatives) that, even though they mixed and mingled with ordinary humans, their magic powers were not--- for the most part--- supposed to be witnessed by the general public. Nobody believe in witchcraft, and the witches liked to keep it that way. This made for some of the series' funniest moments; on the occasions when it was simply unavoidable to display a magic act in public, great pains were taken to cover it up or confuse the witnesses so that they wouldn't quite believe what they'd just seen. Darrin was the only mortal who knew about all the magic going on.<br/><br/>Samantha was played by the beautiful and talented Elizabeth Montgomery. It's interesting to see how Montgomery's appearance, and her acting style in general, loosened up so much as the series went on. In the early episodes, she was very prim and proper, controlled, dressy/""elegant"", her hair stiffly coiffed, you just knew she'd been to finishing school or something. She had ""debutante"" written all over her. But by the end of the series, she was much looser in style and action, often seen wearing jeans and stylin' sweaters, her hair long and straight.... she looked a lot younger (and better) at the end of the series than she had eight years earlier at the beginning! <br/><br/>Darrin was played by two actors, Dick York (from 1964 to 1969) and Dick Sargent (1969 to 1972). Thankfully they did vaguely resemble each other, both being tall, slender, dark-haired guys about the same age. Otherwise all credibility would have gone out the window. <br/><br/>Dick York was far more tense, nervous about his wife's witchcraft. When he got frustrated or exasperated, you could just about see his blood pressure rising! But he did seem to be warm and loving, and even funny underneath his neuroses.<br/><br/>Dick Sargent, the second Darrin, was more ""cool and collected""--- and this seems to be why a lot of people didn't like him the part; I think he came off as being downright cold at times. He was more stiff-upper-lipped, and didn't seem to be quite as affectionate towards Samantha. I don't know..... both styles have their good points, and actually there were a few times when I thought Dick York's popped-eye anxiety and strangled-voice nervousness got a little bit over-the-top.<br/><br/>The chief supporting character, almost a third lead, was Samantha's mother Endora, played by the great Agnes Moorehead. She was heavily made-up and always looked just a bit exotic in her flowing, colorful robes and caftans. She wasn't really a mean, wicked witch, but she couldn't stand Darrin, and felt that he was FAR beneath her daughter. Endora had no hesitation about turning him into a frog or some such thing if he got in her way. She and Darrin were always at each other's throats, with often hilarious consequences, and with an exasperated Samantha always being caught square in the middle of it.<br/><br/>There was a long list of other supporting characters and recurring roles--- the nosy neighbor Gladys Kravitz (played by two actresses) who knew there was SOMETHING fishy about Samantha, but who never quite figured out the ""witch"" angle; Darrin's parents; his boss Larry Tate; Larry's wife Louise (also played by two actresses); Samantha's father (Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans); Dr. Bombay (whose one-liners were hysterical, along with the fact that he bellowed with laughter at his own jokes); Samatha's wild, swingin'/60s cousin Serena (played by Elizabeth Montgomery--- Samantha herself--- in a clever dual role); befuddled but kindly Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne, who died during series production--- thankfully, at least HER character was not reprised by someone else); the flamboyant Uncle Arthur, played by the late Paul Lynde; and Samatha's well-meaning witch friend Esmerelda (Alice Ghostley), who wanted to please everybody but who always managed to screw things up. <br/><br/>""Bewitched"" occasionally touched on serious issues of the day--- there was one rather heavy-handed episode about race relations--- and there were some genuinely touching moments (I think in one episode, Darrin had been transported back to the 1600s and was going to be tried--- and, it was implied, executed--- as a witch himself. But Samantha came to his rescue with an impassioned and clever plea on his behalf.) For the most part, though, this show was light-hearted escapism, and it worked.<br/><br/>The series faltered a bit towards the end, with several of the ""Darrin""-related episodes (with Dick Sargent) being almost word-for-word remakes of earlier Dick York episodes. Maybe they thought the audience wouldn't remember! But still.... the acting and character interplay were always top-notch, and the series at its best WAS very funny.<br/><br/>By the way, in case you didn't notice, Serena--- always played by Elizabeth Montgomery--- was credited to ""Pandora Spocks"" (""Pandora's Box"", get it?) in several episodes.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,,21 June 2005
2978,Bewitched, Bewitched Still Weaves It's Spell,"When Elizabeth Montgomery passed away in 1995, it was one of two times that I cried when I heard of an actor's passing. (The other was Lucille Ball in 1989). Elizabeth would always be the beautiful, winsome Samantha Stephens of Bewitched on film. Forever young, forever magical. Bewitched was an excellent fantasy sitcom in it's first three seasons. Great casting, terrific scripts and a slick production. Who can forget Agnes Moorehead as Endora? Or the other great actors that trouped through the series? Alice Pearce as the first Gladys Kravitz. Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara. Mabel Albertson as Darrin's mother. Paul Lynde as Uncle Arthur. Dick York and Dick Sargent who both did good jobs as Darrin. Unfortunately, the show began to lose steam after season 3. Scripts became more silly and repetitive and the good acting was reduced to exaggerated mugging. But those first three seasons were pure TV gold and are shows to be cherished.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,,22 July 2013
2979,Bewitched, A Hit Gimmick Show Later Goes Downhill,"In the early 60s, ABC had few sitcom hits. Then in 1964, Bewitched made its debut and became a hit gimmick show. The key to the show's success was the premise of Darren and Samantha trying to live a normal suburban life much to the chagrin of her witching relatives, especially her mother Endora. Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York had outstanding chemistry and Agnes Moorehead played the role of the meddling mother-in-law so well. <br/><br/>There was also David White as Darren's boss Larry Tate and frequently adding to the chaos were Alice Pearce and Sandra Gould as Gladys Kravitz, who shouted to her husband ""ABNER!"" when she saw something suspicious next door. There were a number of talent people who played Samantha's relatives, including Marion Lorne as Aunt Clara and veteran Shakespearean actor Maurice Evans as Samantha's father. But the funniest of her relatives was Uncle Arthur, played by Paul Lynde. There was one episode I remember when he gave a magic show at Tabitha's birthday party and conjured up a Playboy bunny instead of a real bunny. <br/><br/>But in 1969, Dick York left the show and was quietly replaced by Dick Sargent. Sargent, to me, wasn't as good as York and it showed in a sharp ratings decline. Also, the show was starting to get old and tired and even some of the later episodes were remakes of earlier ones. Some later episodes i remember were the ones that were filmed in Salem, MA and Europe. It brought some life to a tired sitcom but after eight seasons, it's last up against All in the Family, Bewitched was zapped from the airwaves and into syndication after ABC reran the show in both daytime and Saturday morning. Bewitched was a great show for several years until it started losing its magic.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,7.0,3 September 2010
2980,Bewitched, The Twitch We All Loved,"Bewitched was one of the best of the Sixties comedies, beginning in 1964 and sailing on through the counterculture years. In that decade we liked a bit of fantasy in our comedies. These were the years of I Dream of Jeanie, Gilligan's Island, The Addams Family, The Munsters, and heaven help us, My Mother The Car.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Montgomery was a centuries old witch wooed and won by a mortal, Dick York. She's so taken with her husband who's a rising executive in the advertising field that she promises to give up magic and live as Mrs. suburban housewife. Of course the temptation to use magic was too great and sometimes it was real necessary. Usually to get her husband York out of a mess. During the series run, York retired due to health problems and his role his taken over by Dick Sargent without fans missing a beat.<br/><br/>York/Sargent's problems were usually caused by Montgomery's family who frowned on these mixed marriages. First it was mother Endora, played by Agnes Moorehead. But Moorehead too developed health issues and we saw some other relatives emerge like Aunt Clara (Marion Lorne) and Uncle Arthur (Paul Lynde). These people had nothing on her father played by Maurice Evans and his visits were a special treat. The classically trained Evans looked like he was having a ball in the part.<br/><br/>As much as I remembered Montgomery's family and the problems they caused, the advertising field was a gold mine of situations that the writers were able to exploit. York/Sargent worked for the McMahon&amp;Tate Advertising firm and the boss was David White. He brought to the firm some of the funniest, most arrogant, most egotistical clients you are ever likely to see. Half the episodes involved how the pranks of Montgomery's family caused such grief in his professional life with these people that out of necessity he had to cajole and flatter and otherwise kiss up to. If York/Sargent didn't, David White certainly did.<br/><br/>That nose twitch that Montgomery used to for creating magic did in fact create a lot of magic with the show's devoted fans. Bewitched ran until 1971 and it left the air just as another kind of situation comedy was starting. When Archie Bunker debuted and was such a hit, it was a sign that audiences now wanted a little more realism in their viewing. So shows like Bewitched left the air.<br/><br/>But they left a lot of good memories.

2981,Bewitched, An Outdated Look At Middle-Class Suburbia With Magic,"I admit I've always been a fan of this show ever since I was a little kid. I also bought the DVD box set for the entire series. Every character that came on (particularly Samantha's family) had me grandly entertained.<br/><br/>The music score, not to mention the special effects for magic, were major highlights of the show. It got overwhelming at times and you can't help, but feel sorry for mortals like Darrin, who got changed into a monkey, mule and other things whenever he annoyed his mischievous mother-in-law. I'm surprised he never saw a psychiatrist for all he's been through.<br/><br/>This program is definitely an excellent depiction of American middle class suburbia of the 1960s looking so dignified, rich and ""white"". Darrin worked for an advertising company called ""McMann and Tate"" and was best friends with his boss which was a major highlight,considering the many times he got fired and rehired due to Samantha's zany magical antics with her meddling family.<br/><br/>Larry Tate, Darrin's boss, proved himself to be a good, but somewhat, nosy friend who always showed up at the house at the wrong times, especially when Endora turned Darrin into something. I mean, how easy is it to hide the fact that your husband is turned into a jackass?<br/><br/>As I watched my ""Bewitched"" marathon recently, I learned that ""spells"" were hard to ""cure"" with Samantha's seemingly incompetent coven. They'd cast it to upset Samantha's household and later have major trouble in reversing it to set things straight again. They'd have to look up the likes of Dr. Bombay, or their ancient witchcraft books, to seek a cure.<br/><br/>With each episode, they always found a solution to the problem and everyone was all happy and satisfied again. A great piece of TV nostalgia, but you can't help, but notice how ""white bread"" the Stevens household appears to be.<br/><br/>Larry is always talking about saving five hundred thousand dollar accounts from prospective clients and arranges a ""formal dinner"" either at his fancy house or at the Stevens'. It's all a dignified ""tie &amp; dress"" affair with upper crust conversations like ""golf"" going on. Can anyone who isn't in the same caliber as them fit into that? I think not.<br/><br/>Regardless of the social setting, this is a wildly entertaining classic show with superior special effects of it's day. For older folks, you can't help, but feel nostalgia while watching it. Samantha Stevens has gotta be the best wife there ever was. She can even zap you onto the moon for a holiday if she wanted to.

It was a perfect medium.<br/><br/>Period pieces can be beautiful and transportive, but we are always left with a sense of otherwordliness. The use of modern language and music in this show changed all of that. Instead of us being transported to her world, she was brought just a footfall into ours. I can't imagine a better way for Emily Dickinson to be brought truly alive and tangible and approachable to an audience who may not be familiar with her.<br/><br/>We never forget that she was from a different era with different requirements of women and different social ethics, but we are also invited in to see her... not as a woman from some long ago world too far away from ours to really understand... but as a young woman as real and vibrant as if she were alive today.

3000,Dickinson," Not your typical period drama, thank goodness!","I watch a lot of period dramas and this one is not average to say the least. Frankly, as a lover of Emily Dickinson's poetry for decades, I'm thrilled that it is not a milquetoast version. Perhaps they've been a little heavy handed with adding rap and such, but I think it can allow the younger generation to get interested in something other than The CW teen scenes. I love how they relate her poetry to the story line. It makes one consider the depths of her words. I don't find it confusing, at all.
As for the sexual content, mainly there is kissing, but everything else beyond that just lends to the fact that sex occurred in every time period and none were quite as prudish as we think they were. 'Polite' society just didn't write about it, but you can bet it was going on despite our wanting to think our past generations were good little girls and boys.
For those that don't like this version, at least there is plenty else for them to watch. Not every show is going to make everyone happy. Personally, I can't wait for season 2.

3019,Strike Back, Not a great reboot,"Let me start by saying I love this show... right up until Season 6. This season has really big shoes to fill, with the departure of the old Section 20 and the development of a new one you might think there was a slightly different tune to the story but not really. The friendship and banter that was shared between Stonebridge and Scott along with the a great series running story line, and brilliant action scenes (both in and out of the bedroom) really worked because it looked natural and real. This season is not off to a great start because they have tried to replicate that exact same team dynamic using different actors who just don't cut the mustard. The cast I am sure in many other roles would be great. Of the now four person bravo team we have a team leader that looks as natural with a rifle in her hands as a fish is out of water, a pair of US and UK Sgt's trying desperately hard to replicate a friendship from seasons 2-5 and it really shows, and an Australian Engineer who is the only one that shows a little promise. <br/><br/>Episode one for me, total let down. The scenes were terrible, the story line was too rushed, and the acting was looking forced. The entire show was spent trying to duplicate the formula that worked previously but with an entirely different cast, which is why it failed. I really hope for some improvement over the rest of the season because the strike back legacy is an important one as the rest of the ""action"" genre TV shows never came close to this saga.",29 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,1 November 2017
3020,Strike Back, Action/Adventure UK Style,"Looking for a hero? Well Sky 1 served up a good one with John Porter (Richard Armitage). <br/><br/>This series has six 45 minute episodes which equates to actually three films. Sky 1 decided to bundle two episodes and so they ran the series over three weeks. Each film has its own flavor.<br/><br/>Situated in Iraq, the first sets up the main characters with lots of tension and action enough to satisfy. There is a damsel in distress (nice performance by Orla Brady),some mystery, tension between characters (Andrew Lincoln does a nice job as Porters nemesis &amp; boss, Collinson), two rescue plots and lots of action. Oh, and lets not forget the smell of betrayal in the air. It ends with a cliff hanger.<br/><br/>Second two episodes involve Porter rescuing (if that is what you call it) an exSAS operative and it becomes like a 'buddy' movie. There is an unsuccessful assassination attempt,prison cock fights, nuns in trouble, kids in trouble, a jump off a cliff, and plenty of our Hero doing what he does best - thinking and acting his way out of impossibly tough situations. Armitage &amp; Shaun Parks are great together. Cliff hanger again. You'll be anxious to see the next story.<br/><br/>The Third episode is much more intense than the first two - more action, more head count, more explosions, more blood and tension plus more close ups. Porter is sent into Afghanistan to extract a renegade computer geek - This episode has a few funny moments, the computer geek played by Ewen Bremner is really fun to watch and beware of the veiled ladies! O, did I mention we have the CIA with their nose in the plot and Porter is protected by the two ladies of Section 20 Layla &amp; Danni (Jodhi May and Shelley Conn turn in nice solid performances also) This film really showcases what an amazing actor Armitage is and what a nice performance in this episode by Lincoln.

The resolution of this plot-line was not only very exciting but also very moving. Well done, Richard Armitage and Andrew Lincoln! You were both magnificent in that final scene.<br/><br/>These two actors were outstanding throughout. Lincoln held my attention as the man with a secret and Armitage, who seemed to appear in practically every scene, was a superb hero; he was the perfect choice for John Porter. The supporting actors were also wonderful. We particularly enjoyed Orla Brady as the hostage in episodes 1 &amp; 2, Shaun Parkes as the imprisoned SAS man in episodes 3 &amp; 4 and Ewen Bremner as the bi-polar technical geek in episodes 5 &amp; 6. Armitage played out some wonderful tender/macho/funny scenes with all of them. Back in the office, Jodhi May also had impact as the gutsy operative determined to get to the truth.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this production including the beautiful African scenery and the pounding music.

But if you want something that entertains, provides lots of action, has a deep enough for what it is plot line then this is for you. It reminded me very much of Ultimate Force in the first couple of series. Richard Armitage is just too hot to handle and is credible as the tough, damaged (ex) SAS officer who just seems to keep coming back for more - plus he takes his shirt off a lot which for the shallow amongst us is a definite bonus. Great supporting cast including the fabulous Andrew Lincoln, gorgeous Shelley Conn(although I think she could have had more to do) and Jodhi May who's character is strong and definitely ""kick ass"".<br/><br/>I hope this manages to get a second series - not much on TV at the moment that both my husband and I can watch together but this certainly ticked that box.",52 out of 71 found this helpful.,8.0,29 May 2010

Luckily the show turns around after season 6 and Strike Back gave us 2 memorable seasons to finish off the show. With the new super soldier pair in Wyatt and McAllister we got the same entertaining camaraderie that Stonebridge and Scott had but this time, with one slight difference, the excellent and fearless Lance Corporal Novin joins the team. And in Colonel Coltrane we finally had a Section 20 team leader capable of leading this secretive British military group with honor and grace. The series ended in an admirable and fitting way finally dispelling the bad memories of season 6 and reminding us that in Stonebridge, Scott, Porter, Wyatt, McAllister and Novin there are some truly amazing soldiers out there.<br/><br/>Please get in another season, bring back Stonebridge, the guy is the ultimate soldier that all TV series and movie actors should aspire to.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,13 June 2020

I have watch 4 episodes and yes there are still clichés but this show is far from bad if fact I find it rather entertaining.<br/><br/>Strike Back episodes so far have been action filled and like usual Richard Armitage doesn't disappoint us, this show is on equal footing with many great, TV shows such as Ultimate Force, The Unit and Over There. Which all should of never been cancelled in my opinion and have seen many shows ""reality especially"" that should be cancelled yet they continue to bore a good majority of people. If I had to choose this show up against any reality garbage out there this show would win hands down.<br/><br/>I not a huge fan of Chris Ryan novels and I have read a few and is a good writer but to be honest I prefer Andy McNab's work.

3031,Strike Back, Action and thrills movie style Armitage is fabulous,Sky spent a lot of time advertising this show and I have it certainly lived up to the trailers. The production values were excellent and the energy in all the scenes were brilliant.The script was tight and at times humorous.It was like Bond or Bourne for TV very superior in every way to Ultimate force.<br/><br/>Each two parter was linked by the Collinson/ Porter tension over what had happened in Basara 7 years before the story began.<br/><br/>Richard Armitage as John Porter was excellent it is hard to believe that this is the same actor who played John Thornton in North and South and Harry Kennedy in the Vicar of Dibley. He captured the dilemma of being a paid killer with the moral issues that raises quite brilliantly.The expression in his eyes and the inflection in his voice when he is telling Ewan Bremner the techno geek about how his daughter won't look him in his eyes because he was incorrectly accused of causing the deaths of his men was mesmerising. Richard Armitage is an actor who realises that you do not have to chew the scenery to convey depth of emotion.<br/><br/>Andrew Lincoln was also very good as Collinson the man who destroyed Porters life in a moment of cowardice. I am guessing that a lot of Chris Ryan fans will be disappointed that by confessing and sacrificing himself he earns redemption from Porter unlike the book where Porter gets his revenge.<br/><br/>Jodhi May really grew into the role of Layla and episode 6 was her strongest I loved how she kicked ass with Collinson.<br/><br/>Shelly Conn's character was great as the analyst but I disliked the honey trap element she could have just fancied Porter.<br/><br/>All the guest stars were wonderful and the chemistry between them and Richard Armitage was fabulous.

3042,Breeders, parents behaving badly...too much?,"First came the series/movie concept of ""men behaving badly"", then came ""women behaving badly"", now we've got a number of examples of ""parents behaving badly"". But the thing that makes or breaks each movie or series is keeping the parents likeable enough to where you're still on their side, even if it's just barely. This is where I think Breeders pushes it a little too far. It's noted early on that Paul has a big anger problem, and when he's not neglecting the kids, he's yelling at them. Later on, Ally begins acting out like a petulant teenager whenever she hears news that she doesn't like. The two of them don't even support each other, each is obsessed with their own career and personal success in life. They need some positive personality traits to balance things out. I see from the reviews on here that the series is cathartic for many parents, and that's good, but it seems like these two characters are presented to us as if we're supposed to feel sympathetic towards them, when by the end of series one, I just felt really bad for the kids.",11 out of 15 found this helpful.,4.0,23 June 2020

Dialogue that made me scream in a laugh out loud way. The days start out chaotic and a constant stream of bad luck will culminate in a comedy of errors that have been beautifully crafted. All accompanied by a stream of eff's.
Swearing is a lot more common these days, the puritans have been proven wrong by many studies, smart people swear, it's now a scientific fact. It's a social glue, a vent for frustration, it's even effective as a pain reliever.
By the end of ep 3, dad, (Martin Freeman) is starting to question his parenting 'skills' and realise that maybe he needs to stop shouting and swearing so much. But I think that his short fuse and constant frustration will sabotage his new found resolve.
Kids don't come with a manual and we've all learned from our mistakes, they survive and continue to love us, luckily. It's nice to see others going through the ringer, I almost got broody but I've done my bit, never again!
Thanks for this Marmite show, people are either loving or hating it. If you hate it too? Lighten up, the scenes with the kids in were filmed without swearing and then it's dubbed over. The little darlings were perfectly fine.

For me I was about 3 episodes in and couldn't decide whether I liked it or not(partly because I was expecting a comedy) but my advice is to stay with it, get invested in the characters and don't make any attempt to categorize the show.

This show represents many of the frustrations experienced by parents and though I may not condone poor language towards children, this is a fictional comedy and not real life.
I have found the show to be hilarious and full of heart; the scenarios are original and well constructed with characters becoming more fleshed out with each episode.

I love these FX series like 'Married' 'Your the Worst' and 'Breeders' certainly doesn't disappoint. If you have kids and they are driving you mental, bribe them with candy, lock yourself and your wife, husband, partner in the bedroom with a bottle of red wine and press play!
Laugh out loud funny and extremely honest. As a 37 year old father with teenagers and toddlers I felt like these characters were based on my daily life. As an Australian living in the US I also felt so at home with the english characters as a great cultural bridge, my wife is American and hates my language with the kids but that's the culture a lot of people grow up in!!!

3055,Breeders, Oh. Em. Gee. This show is hysterical.,"First off, I LOVE Martin Freeman and Daisy Haggard. I knew Daisy was hilarious from ""Man Stroke Woman"". I had no idea that Martin was such a comedic genius. Yes, I am a parent. I have a teenage son. And, I absolutely adore my child. I would not survive if anything (implied ""bad"") happened to him. That said, I have always maintained that it's a good thing that babies are so adorable, because they would not survive the first couple of years of child rearing. And, yes, I am kidding when I say that, but, like this show, there is an element of truth to the dark humor. Parents love their children. That does not mean that parenting is happy or easy, it's not. It's the hardest thing I've ever done. But, I wouldn't have it any other way. I laugh each and every day about something that pops out of my child's mouth. And, yes, there are some days when I have to scream into a pillow. The first episode had me giggling. Like a crazy person. It was awesome. I can't wait to see how this develops. If you like Andrea Savage's show, ""I'm Sorry"", you will enjoy this one. If not, this may not be your cuppa, move along.

3058,Castle Rock, Give it a chance,"I wasn't going to write a review, but after seeing the majority of people giving this 5 stars or less, I felt like I had to. Preface - I am not an avid reader of King's books, but I appreciate the films I have seen. This show was well written, acted, and had really beautiful cinematic moments. And yes - it's confusing, but it all gets explained in episode 9 and 10. Now, if you're not a fan of mystery or supernatural-ish/alternate realities, this is not for you. And if you want an answer to something right away, forget it. In my opinion, I disagree with those stating that it's poorly paced, slow, boring and written badly. There is a reason why the show flows the way it does. It kept my attention the entire time, so much so, that I didn't ever look at my phone (that's saying a lot).",290 out of 331 found this helpful.,8.0,11 October 2018
3059,Castle Rock, Worlds upon worlds upon worlds,"If you have read The Dark Tower series, Needful Things and The Talisman, chances are you will 'get' Castle Rock. If not, you will probably sympathize with - or be one of - the many reviewers here who are fond of words like Plotless, Aimless, Boring and Confusing. If you liked those particular novels I urge you to watch this series, and dare you not to be intrigued by it's cleverness, complexity and continuity. Of course feel free to reach the same conclusions as those unfortunately lacking in understanding who gave Castle Rock the thumbs down, though I very much doubt you will. If you are fluent in the King universe, you CAN'T.<br/><br/>First off, this is NOT another Stranger Things. Nor is it IT. It's not quick, but the tension builds steadily. It's not action packed, but it's rich in intrigue. It's not a conventional jump-scare horror story scattered with random King references as many seemingly expected it to be. Yes, there are many shallow references to names and places familiar to King readers, but these just make up a thin pretty layer of glitter sprinkled on top of a thick dark writhing rope of interconnecting themes and subplots that keep the viewer guessing right until the end. What it is, is a dark, devilishly smart, adult, contemporary psychological thriller accurately set in the King universe.<br/><br/>The main deep references in Castle Rock, the conceptual ones, are unmistakably End-World / The Territories influenced. Amazingly the writers have even tied these concepts in with the effects of dementia, providing a grounded analogy that explains King's familiar concept of multiple worlds and timelines through the experience of Spacek's character in a subplot. This genius achievement in itself is worthy of at least 5 stars to anyone with half a brain.<br/><br/>The plot is complex and many stranded, unexpectedly divergent at times, yet never loses it's continuity - every digression always finds it's way back to where you left off. And the twists are unexpected, you won't see them coming until they have sped past. I recall 4 major *gasp* moments throughout the series which caught me by surprise. Without giving anything away, it's fair to say the storyline itself is the biggest twist of all, a twist that winds through from start to finish like a steel cable - and one that asks the two biggest questions: IS he or ISN'T he? and: Who plays those Jerry Bledsoe changes daddy-o?<br/><br/>I don't need to tell you about the cast and crew, there are some big names and they all do their jobs very well, with King watching over the whole process. Cinematography, direction, sound, score and production - all exceptional for a TV series, it's all big budget movie quality. Season 2, as I understand it, will be a different story that has interplay with some of the same characters as in the first. Highly recommended to seasoned King readers and anyone who is thinking of picking up The Dark Tower or The Talisman for the first time.<br/><br/>Go then, there are other worlds than these.",217 out of 278 found this helpful.,10.0,20 October 2018

3065,Castle Rock, Had An Intriguing Start But Goes Nowhere Interesting,"First of all, I do not get the impression the two creators of the show ever read a Stephen King book other than the synopsis on the back of some of his books. There is little elements of Stephen King in here or his books, other than keeping the names of certain buildings, and off-handedly mentioning things, here and there. I feel like the creators sold the idea on the interesting concept explored in the first episodes...but had no idea where it was going beyond that. It shows. You're intrigued at first and follow along despite the show being slow, because Bill Skarsgard is just so creepy, weird, and intriguing, and Sissy Spacek is great, and you feel like it's going somewhere...but then you realize, maybe it's not...and then eventually you don't care where it's going because it just seems like a ship adrift that doesn't know where it's going either.<br/><br/>Also, the main character, Henry is seriously out classed by his fellow actors which as the show goes along stands out more and more. You begin to wonder how the heck this guy was hired to lead a cast of Sissy Spacek, Melanie Lynsky and other big name TV actors, and the excellent performance of new star Bill Skarsgard. I also was finding it hard to believe that every women he encounters seems to be throwing herself at him or flirting with him. He looks like he had a chest hair graft put on his face as a beard and it's very distracting. It eventually became all I could focus on when I saw him because his acting was so one-note. His character is also such a jerk, always angry, it is hard to believe why anyone would like him, including the audience. It's like the actor is stuck on one emotion the whole time which makes it really hard to follow him through most of the show.<br/><br/>I really got the impression the creators are big David Lynch fans and not Stephen King fans. But even David Lynch could follow a steady, engaging plot the majority of the time and was great at creating mood. The mood in this show is also one-note. There's simply no depth. No evolvement. The people think it's a crap town from the beginning of the show and it only gets worse. Why? The town looks cute. It's Maine. Maine is beautiful.

3072,Castle Rock," Brooding, with a sense of doom, without much meaning","Stephen King isn't my favourite kind of writer, even for adaptations, however one could expect original material by him to have at least some kind of recognizable, coherent structure. This feels distinctly different even to someone with only passing knowledge of Stephen King stories, as it is clearly not an original.
This series is full of a sense brooding and doom, however without any coherence or anything to justify one's interest, instead it does what is the norm nowadays in TV writing: it simply assumes one's interest, takes it for granted, because watching stuff is practically a civil duty nowadays. What one is fed then is merely a pastiche of vague thematic references to Stephen King stories.<br/><br/>Aside from lacking any hooks, and generally a sense of believability, it also has these little signs of inferior writing: when a prison guard walks around in the semi-dark with a drawn gun, while the alarm is blaring, a colleague silently creeps up on him from behind to touch him on the shoulder, and because this moment of ""surprise"" formally ends the clichéd moment of fake-tension, it is supposedly the fault of the guard with the gun when he reacts hostilely, rather than the idiot's for not announcing himself (or saying the other's name) like an intelligent human being. People behave as demanded by the structure, not by any sort of logic or realism.

I understand one must watch few episodes until things start to clarify but in this case, with each episode, more confusion is added, less clarity, and tons of nonsense keeps piling up.
The expectation wears out, one gets tired of constant background suspense music and darkness. I even had to add close captioning because the actors kept mumbling things.

3075,Castle Rock, This show is the problem with longform in 2018,"With the rise of streaming services there has been a huge renaissance in longform storytelling. This is great and had lead to some truly compelling and amazing works being showcased and celebrated for us all to enjoy.<br/><br/>The problem, though, is that in 2018 there seems to be more of an effort now on stretching storylines out to meet the demands of this new ""binge culture"" and ""castle rock"" seems to be an example of this.<br/><br/>I know it's Stephen King and fans of his enjoy a slow burn. However, it is evident that there seems to be more time to fill than there is story once these episodes hit the editing room.<br/><br/>A plague in recent longform releases this year are very long scenes with little to no plot movement. The plot suddenly will take a backseat to an actor breathing heavily or staring into space (or slowly walking through an empty house for 5 MINUTES). There are a lot of times on this show, thus far, where it seems something is about to unfold and the story is going to move forward, but then the actors just stare at each other while mediocre suspenseful music plays.<br/><br/>There are more Easter eggs than you can count, and if you're a king fan your appetite for references to his previous works is well satiated by the end of episode 1. <br/><br/>Rather than go forward with the plot in episodes 3 and 4, however, we're faced with more Easter eggs than whatever is supposed to be going on here. At this point, it's just a Stephen King setting with Stephen King characters and with a few disturbing Stephen King moments. <br/><br/>The plot is moving forward at such a slow pace that episode 3 in its entirety has less dialogue than a nature documentary. It is clear that they have more time than story and I have completely lost interest.<br/><br/>It's also chocked full of actors from other shows, some who have been featured in 5-6+ big shows since the early 2010s and I'm very familiar with their range, what kind of characters they're playing, and what to expect from them. <br/><br/>This show has potential but it is extremely slow and fits comfortably in the ""streaming show"" cookie color mold that I, as a binge watcher, as getting sick of.<br/><br/>I watch these shows for the plots, first and foremost.

This is the most intriguing, exciting, riveting, thrilling, mesmorizing, mind baffling thing I've ever watched. Castle Rock will pull you into the mind of Stephen King and it won't let you go. The references to King's books are perfect and well put together. The story line is absolutely amazing. I didn't think a TV show could surpass Stranger Things or The Walking Dead but we may have a dispute on our hands. I cannot wait a week for another episode, I am craving to watch just one more! Castle Rock is beautifully mastered. This show is a thriller book that you cannot put down, something that has been twisted up, mixed with King, added with a dash of insanity and poured into your television.",177 out of 296 found this helpful.,10.0,26 July 2018

Sissy Spacek (the original Carrie) is a main character but she wasn't Carrie (??), Bill Skarsgard (the new Pennywise) is in it but doesn't seem to be a human Pennywise...a little confusing. Then tried again a few weeks later and was glad I did. It gets going and I was picking up on a lot of references to many of King's stories. Even at the end of S1 I still was a little confused as to what I had watched...was the parallel universe episode a tribute to The Talisman with twinners?? Anyway, still a good watch, well acted and directed. THEN I started watching S2 which is a whole new season completely removed from S1 about the origins of Annie Wilkes and they must have listened to the critics that said S1 was slowly paced.

3093,Colony," Intriguing, gutsy dystopian mystery","I don't often write reviews, leaving this to more learned critics, but I just had to mention what a successful mix this is of drama and sci-fi thriller. The actors all do excellently, and the show benefits greatly from letting your imagination paint a worse picture due to what you don't see. 
There are ominous echoes of our own history here and there, as the occupying forces are rarely shown, but their power is obvious, especially given the traitorous collaboration of the government.
This show really keeps me looking forward to more of the unraveling mystery; what is the true intention of these mysterious invaders?
There are some gritty characters that work well and one feels for the family. The effects are few but shockingly effective.
All throughout the series manages to maintain a tense paranoid atmosphere which never allows you to relax.

3095,Colony, This show is underrated and under-appreciated,"Title says it all and this got me scratching my head and asking myself, what the heck people want anymore. When I take a look at shows like The Shannara Chronicles (which I finished and don't even ask me why I had do so). with higher ranking, while show had lower production quality or most recent The 100 season, I don't think audience really knows itself.<br/><br/>To cut to the chase, don't be fooled by low ratings of this show because it's TV show with carefully crafted plot and characters.Characters are designed in the way that you are going to like them or hate them, or even find idol among them. Casting crew is good, I have to say that acting is really decent.<br/><br/>Plot is unfolding slowly, by the end of season you have basic grasp of what is going on, since everything is still wrapped in the veil of mystery but what's really important is that plot is strong and rich. Also, it's lightweight, meaning there aren't mysteries under mysteries that will bore you to death while watching a show.<br/><br/>Action is present but it's nothing fancy, CGI generated, it's actually as humanly as possible, show is more about intrigue,crimish orientated.Simply put it's classical thriller.<br/><br/>I highly recommend everyone to give this show a shot, if you are looking for thrilling and enjoyable TV show.",234 out of 272 found this helpful.,9.0,18 March 2016

3097,Colony," great writing, casting &amp; acting...","Can take you a long ways!<br/><br/>What happens when giant space ships land in your city, the ships themselves forming a great dividing wall that traps you, your family - everyone in the immediate environment captive in what once was their city, neighborhood, home? What do they want? What do we do? A lot of questions have been asked, without many answers, but this is part of the entertainment following this well made show.<br/><br/>Colony really is surprising on every level, but in today's era of amazing television this is an easy show to overlook. In a way, this problem is self inflicted. Here we have a show with an extra-terrestrial component - that through a season and a half, has had very few big budget pay offs with regard to the off world oppressors. However...<br/><br/>If you're patient, this actually becomes a good thing. For reasons not yet explained the aliens remain puppet masters using sophisticated drones and recruited people to do their work, which is again, very mysterious in terms of objective. Colony provides very little information with regard to the invasion or whatever type of occupation humanity now faces. Which puts the viewer right into the position of the mystified characters, who are not only trying to put the pieces together, but also learning to survive the new reality.<br/><br/>The people recruited to do the alien's dirty work immediately fall into various levels of collaboration against their own kind. All collaborators work for what is vaguely labeled, ""the authority"" who are the alien overseers. People are divided, must take sides, choose the greater good - and stand with or against friends, family, co-workers and complete strangers. The potential dynamics of this new reality has been well developed with all the main characters.<br/><br/>And who are they? A dedicated cop, his business running wife (bar owner) and their three children. There are also a handful of periphery characters - but all connect in some way to this core family. The viewers share each of their difficult journeys, and watch their transformation as a result.<br/><br/>The content is timely, too, but I would argue that Colony borrows much more of its content from historical context, such as the French resistance of Nazi occupation. There is a grit and reality to this show that keeps everything grounded and believable - which truly is remarkable, given the premise.<br/><br/>Colony can be surprisingly brutal, but I never feel it is doing so in a gratuitous fashion. The cast have to make difficult choices, and the main character (Dad, Will Bowman, Josh Holloway) is a man of action. I really appreciate the way this show presents the destructive potential of firearms, and really coaching up the actors on how to handle weapons. The last episode I watched included a brutal home invasion that I thought was really well presented.<br/><br/>There are going to be a lot of unappreciated's, underrated's, under-watched type comments handed out to Colony, but I'd just call it a really good TV show. It has the added interest of science fiction elements, but they are utilized in a completely unique way to keep the show about people.<br/><br/>It also helps that Colony is well presented - good technical qualities, occasional special effects where needed, really good audio - and a nice look (that has to do with lighting, set design and again - camera work). The casting is near perfect and watching the characters evolve with the story has been one of the best treats.<br/><br/>Colony is a great example why every show with potential deserves a second season. <br/><br/>Incredible potential fulfilled, and one of my current favorite TV shows. 9 out of 10",109 out of 125 found this helpful.,9.0,10 March 2017

3101,Colony, Very few shows capture my attention this well,"Josh Holloway (Sawyer, from ""Lost"") heads a fine cast that includes Peter Jacobson (Taub, from ""House"") in a thrilling dramatic take on what the world might become once aliens have landed and divided humanity into those who collaborate, and those who suffer if they don't. A wall has been erected to keep the huddled masses out of the 'good' part of California, and the stage is set for conflict and character development. Jacobson's character heads the 'Red Hats', the security forces that enforce the division of mankind into the 'regular' people &amp; 'the new elite'. Smuggling and resistance is a large part of daily life under the alien overlords' rule. The parallels between real life in the 21st century &amp; the fictional world of 'Colony' are nicely handled, and the political statement that the writers are making is clear: there already is a division between the haves &amp; the have-nots is real and disturbing. Robotic drones patrol the skies, your neighbors may turn on you at any minute, and the tension is palpable from the very first scene. I liked the first episode a lot, and I hope the quality of writing stays this high.

Not only is the plot centered around a bunch of teens, but they seem to think like teens, and make stupid typical teen mistakes. The problem is, in TWD universe -- they'd be DEAD. There was nothing uncanny about them, their skills, or their situation which made it seem plausible.<br/><br/>Now, I've seen show aimed at teens or kids, which I truly enjoyed. Either they were more deeply layered, or had fun/excitement/action, or were just plain funny enough, to be enjoyable.

3133,The Office, Absolutely brilliant,"Had this been a 'Britcom-proper' it probably wouldn't have been as funny as it is now. <br/><br/>The tragic elements woven into it make it so much greater. Admittedly, there are a lot (and I mean A LOT) of cringeworthy moments in The Office. Moments that make you put your hand over your eyes and look through your fingers, moments that make you gasp and look away, and moments that will make you go ""Aaaargh! Noooo!"". <br/><br/>Everybody (who is not David or Gareth) who has ever worked in an office setting (especially those who worked in several ..) will feel that The Office is a condensed and compressed series of events, but very true to life. Everybody knows David and Gareth, everybody wants to slap them and shut them up forever. Everybody feels for (and feels like) Tim and Dawn. And everybody knows that an office would be a downright suicidal place were it not for common foes like 'the boss' and 'the wannabe boss' to loathe.<br/><br/>Don't watch The Office if all you want is a quick laugh .. you would feel way too uncomfortable for that. The Office is a true slice of (office) life, a bit larger, a bit darker, a bit more painful, but ultimately more humorous than anything I've ever seen. Make sure you catch the Christmas special(s) as well, as that puts the icing on the cake and makes life slightly more bearable.",210 out of 238 found this helpful.,,17 October 2004
3134,The Office, Laughter through the tears,"While admitting to being a general Britcom slut (Fawlty Towers, Ab Fab, Monty Python,) with the exception of Coupling which I wasn't that big a fan of, I think The Office is quite possibly one of the greatest TV shows ever to be put on TV. The show takes a few viewings to really get all of the humor/tragedy that the brilliant Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant have built into the script of the show. The first time it seems sort of blah, but if you watch the whole 1st season, by episode 4 or 5 you pick up on the style of humor and realize that it lies mainly in the simple throwaway lines that the abhorrent David Brent and other employees of Wernham Hogg's Slough branch utter throughout the show. Also, like Gosford Park, the dialogue is very quiet and to an American not used to British accents it is tremendously helpful to put on the subtitles to understand what the characters are saying (it also makes the cringeworthy things that much more cringeworthy when you see them written out). Once you get the humor further viewing will allow you to appreciate the horror of ""The Office."" Watching all of Season 2 in a marathon viewing session left me so emotionally drained (even though I have never laughed harder in my life) that I was crying by the end and I couldn't tell if they were tears of sadness or laughter. At the same time I was relishing David Brent's demise, the new levels of obsequiousness and insensitivity he descends to by the end of the series is almost painful to watch. Tim and Dawn's will it happen/it won't happen relationship is one of the sweetest and most soul-crushing romances I have seen in television history ranking right up there with Sam and Diane from Cheers and Ross and Rachel from Friends. The beauty of ""The Office"" is it mixes some of the most hilarious sitcom humor with a level of epic tragedy that is hard to capture in any performing art form and does it so effortlessly that it is hard to tell where one begins and one ends. I cannot wait to see the special and finally finish the emotional roller coaster that was ""The Office.""",112 out of 135 found this helpful.,,9 December 2004

3136,The Office, Genius,"""The Office"" is quite simply worth watching. I am tired of hearing people criticising it. It's not that it's not worthy of criticism, but the fact that those who label it as ""overrated"" and ""falling short of expectations"" have only ever seen one episode, or the Christmas Special, or 'The Dance'. It defies logic to make a judgment on a 14 episode programme on 2 feature-length episodes that merely act as a means of updating and rounding-off the series. I have yet to hear anyone make a solid argument as to why The Office fails in any way.<br/><br/>If you have not yet seen it, get Series 1 and 2 and settle down on a rainy afternoon ready to emerse and commit yourself. Forget the hype, put the dance scene that you've seen a million times out of your mind, and just watch each episode in order. Then make your own judgment. If you liked it, you will want to see the Christmas Specials; if you didn't, you won't.<br/><br/>Using a cast of unknown, yet perfectly chosen actors, The Office is a sharp, funny, painful, emotional and fabulous take on office life.",110 out of 137 found this helpful.,,30 November 2004
3137,The Office," The funniest, most intelligent thing since Monty Python","Brits. You gotta love them. They got the best bands AND the best comedians. ""The Office"" is probably the best thing in comedy since Monty Python. This show is almost perfect. It's got an original concept, the writing is brilliant, and so is the acting. A group of people completely unknown outside of the U.K. has definitely made a mark in the history of television with this so-called ""mockumentary"".<br/><br/>A program like this was really what we needed, but hadn't dared to hope for anymore. In a time when it seemed like T.V. would forever be ruled by sitcoms with canned laughter played over the same old jokes (let's face it, even ""Coupling"" was little more than an edgier version of ""Friends""), Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant came along with their accurate observation of everyday life in an office as we all know it. What they did was take ""This Is Spinal Tap!"" and put it in the context of an everyday working place. In lesser hands, this idea could easily have turned boring all too quickly, because what we are being shown is basically just reality. It could also have gone the other way with stupid and forced jokes thrown in to keep the viewer interested. Gervais and Merchant, however, managed to pull it off just the way it needed to be done. ""The Office"" is tragic, funny, sad and moving all at the same time. This show is so popular, because people all around the world can identify with it. You feel for these characters. Tim, Dawn, Gareth and Brent (especially Gareth and Brent!) are far from being perfect people, but it's because of their little flaws and personality problems that we care for them. We know colleagues like them, we know those grey days at work. And like this crew a lot of us have big dreams that are moving further and further away as we're stuck in dead end jobs getting older. ""The Office"" doesn't comfort us, it doesn't tell us that there'll be a happy ending, but it tells us that we're not alone with our situations. The fact, that we know most of those truly horrible scenes from our own lives makes us laugh. Sometimes the laughs are bitter, but they're always cathartic.<br/><br/>SEASON 1 is flawless. Hands down the best first series in a comedy show ever. We get to know Gareth, the annoying colleague who has no life whatsoever and makes up for that by taking himself way too seriously. We meet Dawn and Tim who are fighting their desperation and dissatisfaction by playing pranks on Gareth. The two are secretly attracted to each other with Dawn's boyfriend Lee standing the way. Most importantly, we are introduced to David Brent, the boss who somehow manages to always say the wrong things and embarrass himself and everyone around him all the time. The humour comes mainly from facial expressions, nonsense philosophies (Brent &amp; Gareth), sarcastic comments (Tim) and incredibly awkward situations. Lots of times you'll cringe and the situation gets so uncomfortable you'll cover your eyes with your hands so you don't have to see anymore of it. It's a delightful torture.<br/><br/>SEASON 2 is still very good, but Gervais and Merchant fall into the joke-trap too often. In season 1 they successfully avoided any jokes with punchlines or gags that seemed scripted. It was more or less a chain of uncomfortable events and funny interviews. In season 2 we already know the characters and the concept a bit too well. People expect a certain behaviour from the respective characters and Gervais and Merchant are feeding those expectations a little too often. Side character Keith gets a bigger part in these 6 episodes and sadly his wackiness is a bit overdone, too, so that sometimes you get the feeling that whole thing is getting a bit worn out by now. What I really thought was unrealistic was that everybody hated David so much. After all, he is a funny guy and if you don't laugh with him you'd be laughing about him trying so hard to be funny. People just giving him bewildered looks became a bit annoying at some point. However, the writing was still fine, especially considering how little time the makers had and under what kind of pressure they had to come up with new stuff. <br/><br/>The final Christmas SPECIALS are a tearjerker. After the genuinely tragic ending of season 2, you hope so much that all will turn out well in the end. Let me just tell you this much: when the credits roll you'll be moved to tears. This just shows how well Gervais and Merchant have built their characters.<br/><br/>The way this show found a balance between comedy and drama, the ideas and observations that were put into it and the glorious performances are simply adorable and unmatched to this day. Thankfully, Gervais and Merchant knew when to stop and said that the Christmas SPECIALS were going to be the definite end of ""The Office"". As with any good show that's sad for the viewer, but it was the right thing to do as there was really nowhere else to go with the story and the concept. Remakes have already been made (""The Office"" 2005 - USA, ""Stromberg"" Germany), but those will always just be a poor man's rehash of the original.<br/><br/>""The Office"" made me believe that even in days when Will Ferrell saying ""San Diego means a whale's vagina"" is considered the ultimate revelation in comedy, there are still people who will come up with clever and original ideas.",75 out of 93 found this helpful.,10.0,8 September 2005
3138,The Office, The rise and excruciating plummet of David Brent,"After having watched both seasons, plus the two extended Christmas episodes, I have to say that The Office is one of the most excruciatingly brilliant bits of television I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It's like what Irreversible would be if it were a sitcom, because it's all about setting up the audience for a savage emotional beating, of sorts. The first season introduces the characters and playfully chucks them on the shoulder with some embarrassing mishaps. And it reveals them as very human fallible convincing people. They would be caricatures if they weren't so honest -- we know people like them, so we know them.<br/><br/>But the second season is really sadistic, partly because you've come to know the characters so well in the first season. I've talked to a few friends who say they didn't like The Office because it was so hard to watch. After having seen only the first season, I thought they were just silly lightweights. But after having seen the second season, I completely understand the sentiment.<br/><br/>Season two takes the gloves off and leaves marks. Ricky Gervais' character in particular, David Brent, is subjected to a series of painful humiliations. From his botched introduction to the Swindon crew (""...and I don't approve of that in the workplace!""), to his first and last motivational speech, to his ridiculous dance when he tries to top Neil's Saturday Night Fever riff, to his final scene pleading for his job. It's a sadistic plunge, a human trainwreck, fascinating and repulsive.<br/><br/>
And there's not a shred of hope. Gareth takes David's job, with no sign of gratitude. He gloats that Tim is going to have to dress better. Tim has lost Dawn, who has obvious misgivings about leaving and getting married. Everyone is in a state of limbo, if not hell. It's amazing to me -- and I have enormous respect for the uncompromosing brash creativity of Gervais and Stephen Merchant -- that it would end like this. Ouch. Bravo.<br/><br/>
The two Christmas episodes are a bit of a relief, if not something of a cop out. In fact, they let me breathe a bit easier. I wonder if they'll be on the season two DVD when it comes out next month. Because I think season two, straight with no Christmas chaser, is one hell of a slug to the gut.<br/><br/>

3139,The Office," The most funny, truthful and profound TV series for many a long year.","A TV crew move in to the Slough offices of paper wholesalers Vernom-Hogg to focus on how the ordinary British work place responds to change and business upheaval.<br/><br/>What a surprise this series was when it first came on the TV. Given that it was on BBC2 and not given much promotion you didn't expect much, but boy is this series good. Not only is there moments of absolute comic genius, but it is also very profound. Stand assured I have met all the characters on this show in real life - I have even worked alongside a few of them!<br/><br/>It is impossible to know what foreigners make of lead and star turn Ricky Gervais playing boss David Brent. Americans might not get the full satire of his off-centre and cliché bound management speak. Like another great British character Alf Garnett (of Till Death Us Do Part) he is not so much an invention as an acute observation of a particular type of crass over-promoted idiot that lurks among us. Incompetent and ludicrous, but full of the misplaced confidence that comes from never having to face a reality check. The office runs despite of him - not because of him.<br/><br/>If this was not comedy it would be considered the best portrayal of a man living under self-delusion ever put on film. His belief that he is incredibly popular and has the support of the full staff is clearly false and yet nothing can shake his beliefs. He is not blind but yet he cannot see. He is living in a land of fantasy and time-wasting - for example, inventing game shows instead of writing office reports!<br/><br/>Brent is a self-styled ""chilled out comedian"" that cracks rude or racist jokes to just the type of people that don't want to hear them. Wearing a fake wan smile he has the unerring ability to make difficult situations even worse. He is always aware of the camera and even plays to it - even lurking in the background to join in other people's on-camera moments as if he has nothing better to do. <br/><br/>Brent has a mini-me in the form of Gareth Keenan played by Mackenzie Crook. A wan and skinny man-youth who is chief support to Brent in the mismanagement of the office. A weekend soldier he makes constant references to this and how it applies to office procedure, as well as trying it on with spare office female talent - with no success whatsoever. He also runs the office course on safety - which is one of the funniest pieces of business I have seen in a long time. Instructing female employees on how NOT to put cups of hot coffee on the top of monitors and how to correctly lift boxes.<br/><br/>Only slightly more sane is Tim Canterbury (Martin Freeman) the college drop-out that is always threatening to quit and return to his books. A bored mediocrity that fills his days by winding up Gareth and flirting with receptionist Dawn (Lucy Davis) - who has less of a role, but looks on in disgust at some of the antics that the others get up to.<br/><br/>Special support comes from Chris Finch (played by Ralph Ineson) who is chief rep and office big mouth: Perhaps the most revolting person ever to appear on TV. His recollections of drunken evenings and stupidity being listen to with wide eyed wonder by the males - with only Dawn daring to show what he really is and even then not in words. When he leads the gang down Chasers (the local small town disco) things really hot up.<br/><br/>This show only ran two series (plus Christmas special - that was only so-so), but in the second series the nature of the Brent management style comes under pressure. Reality starts sweeping in to his little world and his bubble is finally popped, but not without some really funny moments - including the ""Comic Relief"" day episode that is perhaps the best of the whole lot. <br/><br/>I have seen all the shows and most of them more than once. This series warrants repeat viewings because it is just so funny and perfectly realized. This series will put off thousands of people from working in an office and maybe some of them will go off and do something more creative and interesting with their lives.

3140,The Office, The best TV show ever made by far,"I hold everything I watch to a very high standard and in general I can't watch the vast majority of what is put on TV - 24, Lost, Gray's Anatomy, Heroes, essentially anything you can think of that people seem to go crazy for... and the reason is simple: they aren't driven by the writing.<br/><br/>And to those who are already upset and ready to describe the genius of the plot of X TV show or one I named above, consider that none of those shows are driven by the characters, by pureness of emotion created, by novelty of the plot, it can all be reduced to a few things: 1) Love triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, etc. 2) Action (doesn't take a PhD to blow something, put a child in harm's way, etc.) 3) THE BIGGEST ONE - leaving you hanging (which makes the viewer, in between episodes, feel like they just can't stand to not be watching this show, but really, you could tell one of the worst stories ever and stop just short of an important climax and people will naturally be interested - but why not ask for more)<br/><br/>And in general, what I like to think of as the plot skeleton (the core conflict or plot outline) in these shows is tried and cliché in all of these shows. There's nothing new.<br/><br/>The US version of the Office is just plain unbelievable. The characters are not real people. It's very funny SOMETIMES and I do watch it (which makes it like 1 of maybe 5 shows in the last several years), but Michael Scott could never exist in real life, and he's the only decent actor in the show. Jim and Pam don't have the incredible subtle, Victorian, romance that Tim and Dawn had. Martin Freeman is also 10x more the legitimate actor, and Dawn was significantly better than Pam - Jenna Fischer just doesn't have much of an emotional range. Dwight is just always high strung - Garreth had depth and incredible subtlety and a range of moods. Stanley's humor was meant for 9 year olds. Keith was infinitely better at deadpan and numb-skull humor. Angela, Meredith, Oscar, Creed - all 1 dimensional. Ryan's not awful.<br/><br/>AND THEN THERE WAS THE OFFICE (BBC)...<br/><br/>Incredible realism. Incredible and subtle use of the documentary genre. A barrage of original, subtle, diverse jokes. No laugh track (which many people notice, but it's more than that - it's that the show doesn't hit high hat cymbals to cue you to laugh too, it creates genuinely funny and awkward moments). The actors are outstanding too - such an incredible repertoire each of them has of emotional capacity (even, and in fact ESPECIALLY, Garreth, whose US counterpart Dwight can't come close to the pathos and sadness Garreth can evince - or really even realism, Dwight is just always high-strung and not a real human character).<br/><br/>I've seen lots of movies. More than anyone I know. I'm a pretty smart guy (at least on paper). Movies are my favorite thing in the world. If I put this series as a whole into my list of top movies of all time, and ignored the differences of the media, it would make the top 5. <br/><br/>My life is better because I've seen The Office (BBC). Just don't watch season 1 and 2 and forget about the Christmas special, like I did for a year. But I do think if you give yourself at least a week after watching 1 and 2 before watching the special, you can better ""simulate"" the time lapse that is meant to exist before the fictional creation of the documentary.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor.",131 out of 191 found this helpful.,10.0,17 December 2006
3141,The Office, Cringeworthy genius,"Set in the bleak, awfully-named industrial town of Slough and the fictional office of the Wernam-Hogg paper merchants, a BBC film crew documents the expressionless workers, ringing phones, copiers churning out clone after clone after clone, pointless meetings and pointless bureaucracy that exist within typical, uninspiring companies.<br/><br/>Sadly, the majority of people in Britain work in dull, dead-end office jobs with lives that go nowhere and even the most meager of ambitions going unrealized. Maybe if they had a boss like David Brent their day would be livened up. Not because he's the 'boss/entertainer' he thinks he is, but for the morbid curiosity of watching a desperate, delusional and detestable man slowly crash and burn.<br/><br/>The majority of laughs in The Office come from awkward and embarrassing situations. Brent constantly forces his bullheaded and bawdy humor on unwitting staff. At first they appear scared of his ruthlessly imposing presence but towards the end they all ignore him completely. But he never realizes this and resorts to even more tasteless ways of getting attention. He loves the camera and rather than acting 'normal' for the purposes of the mockumentary he exaggerates his beastly character to the point of being sickening. He gets what he deserves in the end and by this point the audience has lost all sympathy for him.<br/><br/>His brutalized and beleaguered staff struggle to get on with their work as Brent's tyranny escalates. Among them we have Tim, an increasingly unhappy man who wishes to escape the monotony and drudgery 'ordinary life' brings him. He's long had the confidence crushed out of him but still has more humanity than anyone else.<br/><br/>Gareth is Tim's worst enemy. A dorky, 95 pound weakling who boasts of being in the (territorial) Army and is keen to assume more and more power from Brent's failing management. Like Brent, he has no clue about social interaction and behaves strangely among potential friends.<br/><br/>
Dawn is the receptionist. She is engaged to a controlling, unloving boyfriend who insists she spend her life doing dull work despite the fact that she has higher and happier dreams. She has feelings for Tim, and they are more than mutual. But fear of change and happiness stops her from falling for him.<br/><br/>As soon as once branch of Wernam-Hogg incorporates the other it becomes clear how useless Brent is. The new staff are amazed at how such a horrid man has been employed at all, never mind become a boss. Complaints and unfinished work rise and the upper management are forced to take action. Sadly, Brent just won't learn.<br/><br/>In the end, his staff have the slightest chance at happiness and escape. Brent however doesn't learn from his mistakes and will probably go on to have an endlessly miserable life.<br/><br/>If you work in an office, get out! Among the blackest of humor there is a message; office life is fit for no human being. And Ricky Gervais' dark comedy is filled with thousands of examples of why this is so. It's absolutely classic stuff that is far ahead of dozens of canned laughter sitcoms.",93 out of 138 found this helpful.,10.0,15 May 2004
3142,The Office, Brilliant show! It's going to be timeless!,"Absolute magic! This is one of the best comedy series of recent years. It is brilliant stuff. This is a documentary about an office who make paper. What is so funny is that it is played so seriously that casual observers will believe that this is a real documentary and these characters are real. It's all larger than life in many ways and with some of the situations but it is pure genius. <br/><br/>The cast play their characters brilliantly. Ricky Gervais is outstanding. He, as an actor, writer, and director of this show has created one of comedies great characters. He is the imbecile and arrogant boss who we all have had experience of and who we can see some of our own traits in. It's frightening how many faux pas this guy comes out with, its cringe worthy and we all know we have said things like he has. You feel sorry for him because he acts so deluded but at the same time he can make you wince and burst out in laughter at some of his actions (remember the dance?). Also superb is Mackenzie Crook as Gareth the dorky and also deluded young worker who follows the book down to every crossed T and dotted I. He plays it to perfection, like Gervais. Also good is Lucy Davis, as receptionist Dawn. The one who I think plays it really well because his character has a more emotional element in his performances is Martin Freeman, as Tim, who has a big crush on Dawn. There is a great dynamic and he plays the lovesick worker, bored with his life with a real depth which is really evident in the Christmas special and end to the Office. The Christmas episode was the best from the Office; it was hilarious, tragic and brilliantly cringe-worthy. <br/><br/>It is no more and the American version will not hold a candle on this.

3144,The Office," Funny, vis a vis, ergo, de facto humorous stuff","I rented the first season almost at random--I'd only barely heard of the show--and I'm so, so glad I did.  Within the first ten seconds Ricky Gervais had me quietly snickering; within twenty I was laughing out loud; eventually a few tears welled up and my stomach began to hurt.  And I didn't quit laughing until the show was over.  Gervais is possessed of the very rare talent of being funny on several different fronts, simultaneiously; he's like a comedic juggler: he's a teller of conspicuously (but not too conspicuously) bad, often tasteless, jokes; he's a backstabbing hypocrite of Tartuffian quality; and for those who have worked in offices and have had bad (or even mediocre) bosses, he is like a balm for the lost dignity office workers experience through petty politicking.  (So the show is rather cathartic.)  That little look Gervais gives the camera at times (which seems to state, ""You didn't see that, did you?"") is precious.  I have to be careful to not oversell this show, but right now I would say that, as a character, David Brent (Gervais) is right up there with Reginald Perrin and Basil Fawlty, and that is sacred territory in my book.  But while writer-actor Gervais is the brightest spot in the show, the other cast members, namely Tim Freeman, Mackenzie Cook (who some will recognize as the eye-popping pirate in PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN), and Lucy Davis, are great too.  This show, I predict, will go down as one of the great TV comedies, up there with with FAWLTY TOWERS and SEINFELD but perhaps just below MONTY PYTHON and SCTV (at their best).  A word of warning: if you don't like (i.e., don't understand) irony, this may not be the show for you; stick with Jim Carrey and Martin Lawrence.  (Nothing against those actors; THE OFFICE, though laugh-out-loud funny, seldom hits one over the head with its comedy.) I only hope the second season approaches the quality of the first.",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,25 March 2004
3145,The Office, I come from Slough!,"Even people from Slough have signs on their car windows ""Happiness is seeing Slough in your Rear View Mirror"". During the war the enemy was invited to bomb Slough; ""Come friendly bombs rain on Slough"")(no joke).<br/><br/>The Office is one of those programs which when you happen across it, for the first half-hour or so you're completely baffled, its format is so unusual, then before you know it you're hooked. <br/><br/>It's really about the horror of passing so much time with the SAME people (more than with our families).

3146,The Office, absolutely hysterical,"Gervais and Merchant have crafted a hysterical, ridiculous, and absolutely poignant world in their show The Office. The show follows the embarrassingly pathetic David Brent, the regional manager of a paper company. The office itself is the picture of tediousness. The employees slave away mechanically, it is so painfully tedious that the office itself becomes a hysterical character within each episode. Brent is the pinnacle of horrid bosses; completely inappropriate, lacking in tact and backbone, who yearns to be the fun loving popular boss, and fails with a train-wreck like horridness. I'll give it to Ricky Gervais, the guy is a genius. His subtlety has hints of Peter Sellers. It seems that only the brits can pull off this kind of comedy. The cast that supports Gervais is fantastic, each subplot works so well and the characters are all so subtly developed that you're rivited by the mundane life these characters lead from 9 to 5. I'm not surprised that once The Office won awards, the Americans decided to jump on the bandwagon and started to make a US version. Happily it tanked completely. You must rent the DVD's of both seasons. For any fan of that wry Brit humor, The Office is a must have in your DVD collection.",84 out of 150 found this helpful.,,17 June 2004
3147,The Office, What television was and will never be again.,"Needless to say, this is not a show for everyone. It's not a light-hearted show about fashionably single twenty-somethings' pursuit of love with whatever hilariousness that may come from that. It hasn't got a laugh-track, it doesn't concern itself with a target audience, and it isn't about delivering a punchline.<br/><br/>It's remarkable in its own right, that it was even picked up by the BBC, but that it would go on to be such a huge success, transcending language and culture is nothing short of incredible. <br/><br/>The comedy is in the characters, in the awkward silence between remarks, and how you see yourself in Tim, and people you know in David, Gareth or even Chris Finch. there are so many things to emphasize, but basically it's just about working in a job you don't really like, for a boss who thinks he knows everything, for much longer than you ever imagined. David Brent is such a pathetic man, that you can't help but like him just a little. He's a man completely defeated by society, fire-branding trite, political correct clichées with one hand and being petty, racist, derogatory and cruel with the other. ""It's the hypocrisy about this place that I couldn't stand""<br/><br/>The fact that none of the characters realize their true nature is what makes it so funny. Tragic irony if you will. David doesn't know nobody thinks he's funny, gareth doesn't know no one respects him, and Finch doesn't know nobody really believes his stories. The authority figures in the office is either disillusioned or conceited.<br/><br/>But there is a very real and affectionate story of love here too. About finding happiness within a system that has been failing you for so long.<br/><br/>I haven't felt this way about a TV-show since I saw the Simpsons the first time. 'Action' came close and so did 'Scrubs', but this one takes the pot.<br/><br/>Honest Comedy.",10 out of 14 found this helpful.,,31 August 2005

3150,The Office, Simply a comedy classic,"It's hard to imagine how this series was successfully pitched to the BBC. There is no canned laughter. It is a faux documentary set in the administrative section of a paper manufacturer. The boss is a remarkably unpleasant person and none of them lead very interesting lives. When the show was being made none of the actors or writers were even mildly famous. The Office is hilarious though, possibly because of rather than despite these points. <br/><br/>David Brent is one of the great sitcom characters. He is extremely unpleasant to deal with, completely self-absorbed and seemingly oblivious to how much he is disliked and ridiculed. Initially it is impossible to have any sympathy for him. However by the end of the Christmas Specials, when his ego has taken enough of a battering, I was glad to see a bit of hope appearing in his life. <br/><br/>While Brent is definitely the main character the supporting roles are integral to the series. The ""will they, won't they"" romance between Tim and Dawn is well done. Even these characters have an edge as we wonder why she stays with her fiancé and why Tim will neither take a promotion nor go back to college. Brent's slightly scary sidekick Gareth is also an excellent character. Most of us come have had to work with a Gareth at some point. <br/><br/>The scripts are brilliantly written by Gervais and Merchant. The best scenes I'd pick would be - Brent breaking into song on the training day - Brent in the bird costume on Comic Relief Day - The dance (of course) <br/><br/>Sit back and enjoy one of the best situation comedies ever made.",10 out of 15 found this helpful.,9.0,10 February 2010

Never in a million years would i ever expect that this series would live up to those expectations; yet it exceeded them, ten fold. If you are a fan of the American ""Office"" series, then the UK is right up your alley, as it never fails to blow the NBC series right out of the water. David Brent is single-handedly THE best character i have ever witnessed albeit in film or television. Not only is ""The Office"" the funniest show ever created, it also has more heart than any show that i have ever witnessed. I say this with complete honesty: if i were to be stranded on a desert island for the rest of my life with only a TV and DVD player, and could only choose one work of television or film to bring along, it would hands down be the complete series of BBC's ""The Office"".",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,,26 December 2006

3155,The Office, A comedy that isn't based on just one person!,"We had Fawlty Towers that took place in a hotel in Torquay.  Now we have The Office which takes place, well in a Office in Slough in the UK.  That's all you need to know when watching The Office.   <br/><br/>I remember Ricky Gervais when he had guests slots on the 11 O' Clock show which was hosted by Daisy Donovan and Ian Lee which was sometime between 1998 to 2000 but I can't remember.   When Ricky came on to talk to them about what he had been up to or something along that lines I didn't find him very funny.   The more I watched him on the program the more I didn't like him so I gave up on trying to be humoured by him.   When the first series of The Office came out I knew if it's existence but decided to ignore it and I did the same when the second series came along.   Summer 2003 came and I was very bored with nothing to do so I asked a friend if I could borrow his recorded tape of The Office Series 1 and 2 to get me through my days as I was planning to watch them all over that week.  <br/><br/>So I started to watch the first episode of the first series and I was unbelievably hooked and I was loving every minute of David Brent played by Ricky Gervais which I thought would never happen.   Even though every scene with David was cringe worthy it was the best type of comedy I had seen since Alan Partridge.   It was not only Ricky Gervais who was the centre of attention there was also another six or something people who rallied around the story.    <br/><br/>Gareth played by Mackenzie Crook is a star that has already been made and I think is a lot more funnier than David Brent and everybody would think the same if Gareth got the amount of screen time that David has.   Tim is a senior sales rep is goes on his days by winding up Gareth the whole time and lusting after secretary Dawn who also has feeling for Tim but keeps them to herself because of her intimidating boyfriend Lee. Through all this we have the story of The Office.    The basic story of why David is the way he is and always insists on making a plonker of himself is because he is being filmed for a BBC Documentary about the work placement of an Office hence why people play up for the cameras in parts.<br/><br/>It goes down as one of the best sitcoms ever made and an unusual and original one at that.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,,16 April 2004
3156,The Office, And we thought Basil Fawlty was a despicable character!,"Hail to Ricky Gervais- A truly hilarious series about the office from hell, with an assured cult following and endlessly quotable dialog. Yes, the realization that this is a mockumentary/comedy series was quite baffling after watching the first episode (the lack of laugh-ins was equally welcome) and I was instantly hooked. The next realization was that it's utterly and painfully tragic as well- there truly can't be so many sad people gathered in one place in real life, can there? Ooohh yes, is my answer, after relating to my own previous office-jobs... it's human nature almost at its lowest... and funniest!<br/><br/>Watching the most embarrassing situation or line after another, the ingenious mockumentary narration technique of ""The office"" made me cringe with laughter. And, regardlessly of how perfectly cast with memorable characters; inevitably, we cannot escape the completely unreal presence of Gervais' David Brent. If you thought Basil Fawlty of ""Fawlty Towers"" was despicable, think again! Man, how can anyone revel so much in his own childish narcissism? How can anyone thrive so much on insidious insult, degradation of other people, and yet still honestly believe he's god's gift to office life? Yet, the episode where Brent begs to get his job back really grabbed me emotionally, as we realize that this job is really all he has in life.<br/><br/>Favourite episode: The pub trivia night with the equally despicable Chris Finch!<br/><br/>9 out of 10 from Ozjeppe",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,1 April 2004
3157,The Office, David Brent is the Anti-Christ! (And he doesn't know it!),"This show has gained an enormous amount of praise and hype, and all of it is justified, as `The Office' is hilarious, ingenious, breathtaking, original and just flat out laugh-till-you-cry funny.<br/><br/>David Brent is the manager of a British paper company. The day-to-day goings on in the office is boring, dull and mundane. The employees try to find ways of relieving themselves of their boredom, including putting dorky Gareth's stapler in jelly and making prank calls. A documentary crew have come to the Slough branch to document the daily events and this footage is the basis of the show.<br/><br/>This is such a funny show, I'm sorry it only lasted 12 episodes (but at least it never had the chance to go stale). At the end of each episode I longed for more. But thankfully this is from the BBC, so it runs for the full 30 minutes, unlike sitcoms that contain ads, where the actual show goes between 22 and 24 minutes.<br/><br/>A lot of the humour is very subtle, and a lot of it is going on in the background. In the second last episode, I was laughing so much I almost couldn't breathe! I'm not kidding! My mother wanted me to stop but I couldn't, it was that funny. Even after the episode finished I couldn't stop laughing, I was crying with laughter.<br/><br/>David Brent is one of the greatest creations in television history. In the beginning I felt sorry for him. He is so dorky, sad and pathetic. But over time I became really uncomfortable. My skin crawls whenever he is on screen. He is so pathetic and everyone knows this except himself. He thinks everyone loves him and looks up to him for being a great leader and an entertainer! It's not that he is pompous or stuck-up, but just really inept at life. He is like that kid at school who really wants to be your friend but actually already thinks he's your friend. His stand-up comedy' routines are truly painful to watch.<br/><br/>Just wait for the scenes where the documentary crew are interviewing other office workers and David Brent just happens to walk into frame in the background, and then walk away, then back and then interrupts the interview with some meaningless chat and walks away. He is constantly doing this and whenever somebody is being interviewed I'm just waiting for David's head to pop into shot.<br/><br/>And actually there is quite a bit of drama as Tim realises he might have feelings for receptionist Dawn. Their awkward silences around each other are excruciating. You really start to feel sorry for Tim.<br/><br/>The theme music is refreshingly excellent. And I know you don't need to have worked in an office to find this funny, as I haven't set foot in an office. But if you have, then you probably will have even more reasons to love this.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the funniest television shows that I have ever seen in my life.

The director/writer had put this story into another film called Patient 7, their section running 16 minutes.

So it was a brand new show - that I already knew what would happen.<br/><br/>It was nicer to see the plot stretch out decently, another group of people was added in and more character development - I especially liked Aurora Perrineau's acting, she was comic relief and also the common sense in a horror film.

There are 12 episodes, usually released close to holiday periods like Christmas or Thanksgiving Day, and that obviously are somewhat related to these festivities.<br/><br/>The pilot was just okay, nohing that hooked me so much. The network should have begin with something more interesting like the ""Pooka!"" episode that, at least for me, was one of the best episode, with an unexpected ending. Most of them contains many clichées and the real good ones are a few. Some topics are interesting but too much present, like for example the gender discrimination and the physical and mental abuse.<br/><br/>Being an anthologic serie, you don't have to watch the complete season (I did it because I was watching it, while it was aired), so I will simply tell which are for me the best episodes: ""Flesh and Blood"", ""Pooka!""<br/><br/>The acting was almost always good and I was happy to see in the cast actors like Carly Chaikin (Mr. Robot), or Jimmi Simpson.

3184,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, Review of Season 1 and 2,"The famous ultra-violent video game franchise gets a ""Dark Knight"" styled make-over. This is Mortal Kombat revised. Mortal Kombat redone.......as yet another live action iteration of the fantasy fighting game. Originally conceived to be realistic remake which cleverly replacing the more out-of-this-world concepts with gritty real world explanations, MORTAL KOMBAT LEGACY drops that ball right into its second episode where we have mercenaries firing plasma weapons. Two episodes later, we are right back in familiar fantasy territory of other realms, monsters and magic. This is Mortal Kombat rehashed, Mortal Kombat repeated with merely cosmetic changes, and Mortal Kombat recast in such a haphazard way between its two seasons.<br/><br/>This web series, originally debuting on the Machinima youtube channel, consists of 6 story arcs over 9 episodes for season one. Season two comprises an ongoing story arc of the tournament plus three origin stories told in flashbacks for a total of 10 episodes. Each episode is so distinct in tone, style and entertainment value that they are almost like mini- movies unto themselves. Two things that permeate the both seasons seems to be director Kevin Tancheroen's indecisive directing style and the annoying music. Tancheroen seems to be copying the style of other directors like Zack Snyder's slow motion speed ramping, Neveldine and Tylor's high speed shaky cam digital photography, and Luc Besson / Paul Greengrass's hyper fast cuts. All these stylistic touches seem thrown in at random and overdone in many instances. Much of the fight choreography for season one is fantastic. But it is done great injustice by Tancharoen's quick cuts, extreme close ups and shaky camera.<br/><br/>The first two episodes of season one go into the back story of Sonya Blade, Jax and crime boss Kano presented in a familiar ""Cops and Crime boss"" setting. Sonya is taken prisoner and Jax leads a special forces team to take down Kano's gang. This is a strong start, with a look not unlike modern Hollywood action movies and a realistic gritty tone. Next we get the tale of washed up action star Johnny Cage trying to pitch his latest production. Again, realistic and right in place in our real world, done very creatively in the form of a TV documentary. <br/><br/>Now after that, in comes some hokey fantasy. Kitanna and Mileena: a tale of sibling rivalry and teenage identity set among the CGI mountains of Edeina and the dark Canadian- looking woods of Outworld? Our first dud of season one, the Kitanna / Mileena arc spans two episodes but half of the second episode in this arc is a flashback to events in the preceding episode, making the actual runtime of content a lot shorter. Flash animation is used to pad out the story almost like a motion comic.<br/><br/>Thankfully the subsequent episodes return to the more realistic setting and more ambiguous fantasy. Take Raiden for instance. How would people, realistically in today's world, react to some dude claiming to be a thunder god? The highlights of the season are of course Scorpion Vs Sub-Zero arc and the final episode about the Lin Kuei Cyborgs. Scorpion's backstory and ensuing vendetta against ninja leader Sub Zero is explained via a beautifully shot period piece, seemingly set in feudal Japan. Characters speak Japanese, authentic Asian actors play the roles, even the costumes seem true to the feudal period. Lastly, the Lin Kuei cyborg segment. This is real eye candy here, featuring cutting edge CGI and motion capture work, creating one of the more brutal bouts in the series. <br/><br/>So after a generally enjoyable season one, disregarding some missteps here and there, season two comes around. Season two showcases a little more backstory of other characters like Kung Lao and Liu Kang, as well as finally showing the start of the titular Mortal Kombat Tournament. <br/><br/>It may have well been a completely new show altogether as only a couple of returning faces and story elements bear a resemblance to season one. More than half of the roles have been recast with new actors, there are many continuity inconsistencies, the special effects look cheaper, and so do the costumes. <br/><br/>For an example of cheapskate costumes and inconsistencies just compare the stories of Scorpion and Sub Zero across the seasons. Season one was simple yet effective, giving a production design of outfits that may have been plausible during feudal Japan. Season 2 reveals that our feudal japan period piece actually takes place in modern day; a modern day where Japan never outgrew its swords, samurais and shoguns and everyone suddenly speaks American English! Season 2 also downgraded the ninja outfits from realistically plausible to ripoff Power Rangers and pyjamas. Lacklustre fights which lack the gritty brutality of the previous season lead up to one disappointing conclusion that is all build up without any payoff.<br/><br/>With season three set to veer off into adapting characters and concepts from the recent Mortal Kombat X video game, MORTAL KOMBAT LEGACY's first two seasons ends off on a low note. The episodes of Sonya/Jax/Kano, Johnny Cage, Raiden, Scorpion/Sub-Zero and the Lin Kuei Cyborgs Cyrax and Sektor stand as true gems. Featuring feature film-like production quality and design, brutal fight choreography, as well as cleverly reinterpreting the established mythos in a fresh manner. Downer episodes include the Kitanna/Mileena and most of season two (except perhaps the Kenshi Vs Ermac episodes).",11 out of 13 found this helpful.,6.0,8 May 2015

I like how they are showing stuff like how Kano lost his eye and they eventually mention that Jax's arms are bad after saving Sonya from the explosion. So if anyone sees a Character like if they had Kabal or Cyrax, you'll see them before they became who we all remember from the games. <br/><br/>The Johnny Cage episode was pretty funny since they gave Ed Boon a cameo appearances. Mat Mullins does an OK job for acting but he is a good martial artist. The episode at least stays true to Johnny Cage's character and story.<br/><br/>This is a great Series to the fans who love the series. I believe that they keep up the good work.<br/><br/>P.S.

I was in awe, completely for the last episode of season 1. Cyrax and Sektor were just terrific. How Hydro was pulled off the stream in just one episode was meticulous. I'm just looking forward for the next season and hope the seasons continue, to include all characters that were never touched aptly in movies and games, like Noob Saibot.

3187,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, Definitely worth a look,"I don't understand why people are so easy to criticise this film, at the time of writing this review, only 2 episodes have been aired. It is petty and immoral to slate a film that they have not fully seen. E.G ""I didn't like the first ten minutes of the film, therefore, the rest of the film is crap."" So hear is some advice for those who want to slate this series, YOU MUST VIEW SOMETHING FIRST BEFORE YOU CAN REVIEW IT! Rant over.<br/><br/>Since the Rebirth trailer in 2010, a division has been made between the fans of Mortal Kombat; those who are for the remake and those who are against. Now the series has begun, this still seems to be the case. Fans of the ""Rebirth"" trailer, i believe, will enjoy this thoroughly, and those that did not, have already convinced themselves that the series is a failure, straying too far away from the source material.<br/><br/>There are many fans who refer to this reinvention as the ""End of Mortal Kombat,"" Curiously, the same thing was said about Batman in 1989 AND Batman Begins in 2005. It deserves a chance. Fans have to ask themselves if they would want something fresh or, another Mortal Kombat Annihilation? Even if you enjoyed the Rebirth trailer or not, its worth a watch, if you still don't like it, don't be a bitch about it, just go play Mortal Kombat 9!",37 out of 56 found this helpful.,7.0,19 April 2011
3188,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, Really Good Reboot,"I have been a fan of the Mortal Kombat franchise since MK2 and have watched and enjoyed both the live actions films and the animated series. While the films were entertaining to watch (for simply being MK films) they were far from being exceptional...especially Annihilation. However, I really think that Legacy is bringing the live action MK universe back to life. I have read mixed reviews but cannot see why fans are opposed to the show...it is Mortal Kombat. The shorts keep leaving me wanting more and more, the back stories are a great way of starting the show off and combined with the fantastic fight scenes it actually looks like a well put together mini-series. Sure there are going to be some comedic and cliché moments cuz this is the MK universe after all. I read somewhere that a fan was annoyed that Jax didn't follow protocol when Sonya's life was in danger and reacted 'emotionally'....did you even play the games or follow the story? If you did then you might have understood the relationship between Sonya and Jax....<br/><br/>Anyways...the series is good. It really does leave me wanting to see more and more and I am especially looking forward to seeing some of the other characters.

3190,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, This is all that the previous movies and series failed to achieve...,"Well I wouldn't really call myself a huge fan of the ""Mortal Kombat"" franchise, but I did play the games when I was younger, even got a couple of them for my PS3 today, and have watched the older movies, series and even read some of the comic books. I like ""Mortal Kombat"" for what it is, martial arts fighting without the need to implement a deeper understanding for the reason behind it.<br/><br/>However, I will say that this ""Legacy"" series is impressive. Especially compared to the older movies and the earlier ""Conquest"" series. Why? Well simply put because of the production value behind it. It outshines the previous stuff by a mile and a half. There is just a heavier and better feel to this series, it is more in the spirit of ""Mortal Kombat"", if you will.<br/><br/>I like how it takes each character and gives you some background behind who they are and what drives them. It is all done in a relatively short period of time in each episode, so of course it is limited just how much background story you get about each character. But so far it has been great entertainment and added some nice details to the characters portrayed so far.<br/><br/>As for the acting, well I have been content with the people they have cast for the various roles. People have been doing great jobs bringing the characters alive and believable on the screen. My personal favorites are Scorpion and Sub-Zero, always have and always will be.<br/><br/>I find ""Legacy"" to be a well worthy addition to the ""Mortal Kombat"" universe, and it is well worth watching just for the production value behind the series alone. It is really, really great.<br/><br/>I sort of gave up on this franchise as a plausible rendering on the screen after the ""Conquest"" series, so it was just by sheer random luck that I came across ""Legacy"", and it was just out of boredom that I sat down to watch it. But after the first episode, I just kept going watching it all, it was just that good. So perhaps ""Mortal Kombat"" can have a glorious comeback on the screen and justify itself after some questionable previous movies and an even less so series.

3191,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, mixed feelings,"OK rebirth exploded onto the scene and i must of watched it 30 or so times i was amazed at this alternate take on mortal kombat which dared stray away from the myth and magic that has made the game so popular, as camp as the original movie was i loved n still love it the sequel was vomit inducing and the TV series i couldn't stomach, but rebirth was like what batman begins was to batman it was dark gritty realistic and bad ass, the fight scene was so well put together and the idea of scorpion rampaging through fight after fight was an interesting idea.<br/><br/>OK so then we get legacy after reading the first review i think the user was a bit harsh, but first things first this is nothing like rebirth its gone back to the campness of the first movies and so far nothing has really been shown, its laid the foundations of kanos eye and jax arms but thats it so i don't want to be too harsh as yet, but im still waiting for that wow factor to hit.<br/><br/>as yet tho if a movie is to be released i can only hope they follow on from rebirth.<br/><br/>one thing i have noticed tho is that this is being brought to us by netherealm studios and it is sorta a background on the characters for the release of the game i can only hope thats what KT had in mind with it and that his movie project will follow rebirth, anyways sorry for my poor grammar lets hope this series gets better and leaves us drooling at the mouth and the first episode is just a slow starter for somethin epic to follow",23 out of 46 found this helpful.,6.0,18 April 2011

3194,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, A Comedy of Clichés and plot errors...without any good action,"I enjoyed the ""Mortal Kombat: Rebirth"" short that came out late last year. Sure, there were a lot of silly clichéd lines, and the ""story"" was non-existent, but I liked the originality of the fights. They hired legitimate martial arts actors, practically unheard of in Hollywood these days, and did some neat choreography rarely seen outside of Hong Kong. And since the short was centered around a single fight, it ended up being worthwhile.<br/><br/>Sadly, based on the first episode of the web series, the stupidity of the work is ratcheted up to Michael Bay proportions, and the cool fighting we saw in the original is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>Every single character and scene in the series is the most cardboard cut-out cliché imaginable, and they boggle the mind with their stupidity.<br/><br/>For instance, Sonya Blade relays a message back to Jax and headquarters informing them that Kano is smuggling weapons at a warehouse. The lead guy then tells us that they need to follow ""protocol"" to ""make sure"" of this fact, to which Jax Briggs, showing off what a loose cannon badass he is, responds ""FUCK PROTOCOL!"".<br/><br/>Hey idiots, if a FIELD AGENT who you have sent in on a covert mission relays intelligence to you, what further confirmation do you possibly need? The scene's only purpose is to establish Jax's character, but it's done in such a pathetic, lame manner that it's childish and disengaging.<br/><br/>And then, when Sonya gets captured and Kano talks to her, we're presented with another scene witnessed a million times in low-budget, B action films.<br/><br/>Namely, with the female tied up, the bad guy proceeds to taunt her (why not just kill her, since that's what you said you were going to do?), she spits on him, he hits her back, threatens her, and then...reveals all his future Bad Guy plans for some unknown reason.<br/><br/>Later, when Jax and his crew arrive, one of their men gets easily killed by a sniper. So, rather, than continuing this sniping, especially with the entire special forces unit sprawled out and stunned, what do Kano's men do? They walk out into the open, talk a little, and engage Jax's men face-to-face. Lovely.<br/><br/>Also, apparently, a woman screaming in a secluded room during a gunfight between over a dozen men is not only audible, but tells Jax exactly where she is.<br/><br/>Oh, and Jax tosses away his gun to fight barehanded against Kano...who has a tiny knife.<br/><br/>I could go on and on. Look, absurd plot holes and clichés in action works are okay as long as two things are true; it doesn't take itself seriously, and the action scenes are good.<br/><br/>Sadly, Mortal Kombat: Legacy takes itself as seriously as terminal illness, and completely fails with its action scenes.<br/><br/>The originality of the MMA-influenced fight between Johnny Cage and Baraka is now replaced with ultra slow motion shots, horrible-looking CGI blood, and the standard undercranked (shooting a scene at 18 fps and playing it through at 24 fps), boring American martial arts style choreography.

3197,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, This is NOT Mortal Kombat,"Don't get me wrong - it's a well-made series, rather entertaining and enjoyable to watch. It would just be better off if wasn't a Mortal Kombat title.<br/><br/>Kevin Tancharoen got carried away and went too far from the MK universe in many ways. First thing that strikes your eye is the cast. They look and act so different from the characters in games, movies and earlier series that it's impossible to believe that you're actually looking at Sonya, Johnny Cage and the rest of the gang. In fact I think Legacy has the worst cast possible for an MK series (except for Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa - he's the best Shang Tsung ever!).<br/><br/>The other disappointing thing is the spirit of the series. For some reason Tancharoen laid emphasis on gore while MK has always focused on mystery and darkness, and the whole MK world would give you the chills. Gore has always been a secondary thing that just added to the whole dark spirit of the story.<br/><br/>Random stupid jokes don't help building the right spirit either (a drunk bum sees a man disappear and looks at his bottle of booze in astonishment? come on! this joke stopped being funny about 100 stupid movies ago!). They just make you miss Christopher Lambert's outstanding performance.<br/><br/>And the story itself got transformed beyond recognition. Why Tancharoen decided to make Liu Kang and Kung Lao best buddies instead of distant relatives is beyond my understanding. It's a great idea to shed light on the characters' backgrounds but the stories this series tells are just too far-fetched and unbelievable.<br/><br/>Of course all the above might concern you if you used to love the games or MK movies. Otherwise you're just about to watch an entertaining series that will give you a distant idea of what Mortal Kombat is all about.",5 out of 10 found this helpful.,6.0,6 October 2013
3198,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, Quick to the inter-webs!,"Everyone remembers the old Mortal Kombat games, and to a certain degree fans try really hard not to remember the movies that resulted from them. For the most part, Hollywood hasn't been too great at adapting fighting games (or most video games for that matter). Funny that you-tube was able to make it work after all these years.<br/><br/>Fans are no strangers to web series taking over where Hollywood has abandoned them, and probably the most well done series I've had the pleasure of watching is Mortal Kombat Legacy, which just released its second season. Of course, it features everyone's favorite characters from the games (and even a couple of obscure ones nobody liked playing with), but it manages to breathe new life into them while remaining faithful to what fans loved most about the original games. Essentially, the entire series is updated without being butchered, which was no small task, considering just how ridiculous the original premise actually was. Legacy though manages to offer an original story with new twists on the characters (just wait until you meet the new Liu Kang).<br/><br/>Legacy is directed by Kevin Tancharoen and produced by Warner Bros. Digital Distribution, which means that it's not really an indie project, but it's still a pretty big step as far as taking advantage of the potential for releasing series online. The episodes themselves are pretty short and chapter-esque, usually only lasting about ten minutes or so. The thing is, that Legacy manages to pack those minutes with some pretty impressive features. The fight scenes are awesome, and the series has even featured a few well known action stars like Michael Jai White (guess who he plays). Even the effects and the costuming would be impressive for a feature film, much less a web series.<br/><br/>The thing that has bugged me about the first two seasons is how many characters changed actors. Sure, there was almost two years between seasons, but I'm pretty unhappy about Casper Van Dien taking over as Johnny Cage (I actually kind of liked Matt Mullins and his washed up portrayal of the former action star). The other casting changes though are relatively unnoticeable since characters like Stryker didn't play much of a part in the first season. However, I'm not sure I like this direction of them changing actors, especially with season three rumored to be heading toward production.<br/><br/>The reason why Legacy is such a success is because it is basically fan service. It knows what Mortal Kombat fans want and it tries to give them exactly that (I say ""tries"" because ""real"" fans are never satisfied for some reason), and despite the fact that each chapter manages to stand on its own two feet, it's a very addicting web series and easy is very easy to watch. That being said, it's still a series about Mortal Kombat, which means that it's not exactly high art. Don't get me wrong, it certainly pushes the envelope at times with its strong vision and astounding execution, and really does deserve the utmost praise. However, it's not something that stays with the viewer after the credits have rolled. I really liked Mortal Kombat Legacy, but I wasn't exactly fawning over it the next day. I guess that means I'll just have to watch it all over again, and you know what? I'm alright with that.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,7.0,3 October 2013

One scene which involved breaking out of chains which included a long fall to the concrete ground, this could have been done for real expertly - instead it was over shot (zoomed in &amp; jump cut) to hide the overly basic acting onto a false floor.<br/><br/>Fight scenes by some actors are better than others.

3203,Mortal Kombat: Legacy, Shold have stayed with the rebirth concept.,"I had decent, if not high, expectations from this series, given how Rebirth was conceptualized. Rebirth was the kind of take on Mortal Kombat that would have worked. If camp was all we needed, then the original MK movie was good enough. Unfortunately, we now have a series that relies on the same camp, as canon as it might be. The thing with MK is that as a game it is pretty straight forward, opponents enter the arena and kill each other. For game fans, the motive is not as important. But translate that into a movie and we need a proper story, a less campy and more gritty story. Rebirth did that. This series goes back to being campy.<br/><br/>Honestly, as the series progresses, I am losing interest. If a movie is ever to happen after this series that picks up after this series, it will be as campy, if not more, than the original MK movie.<br/><br/>In its defense though, I do feel that 10 minutes, including the end titles is a very short time to fully realize a concept. And, the Sub-Zero v/s Scorpion part was done well.<br/><br/>But still, some logic holes can't be dismissed. For example,<br/><br/>--Why did Raiden endure 90 days of the psych ward when all he had to do to get away was to get stabbed?<br/><br/>--Why did Kitana believe a man she was hunting (King Robert) when he tells him she is his daughter, especially when that is all she has to go with? I mean, she was raised by Shao Kahn all her life. Just one piece of dialogue to change her entire belief system?",11 out of 37 found this helpful.,3.0,3 June 2011

3208,GLOW, The Most Authentic Depiction of L.A. in the '80s I've Seen to Date,"The 1980s wasn't just neon fabrics, side ponytails, and cream colored suits with t-shirts. It was also too much moose, too much make-up, and sock-less penny loafers. It was ugly. Brilliantly, gloriously ugly and tacky. And that's what you see in this show. Superficially speaking, this series (and its characters) looks more authentically of the era than anything else I have seen portrayed on film in the last two decades.<br/><br/>Much of the credit goes to costume designer Beth Morgan, who sifted through photo albums to research the look of the decade, rather than fashion catalogs and television shows and seeing an obstructed, romanticized vision of the era. The characters either wear too much or not enough of everything. This was the eighties, warts and all, and just for that alone, this show is worth a look.<br/><br/>But on top of that, you have a rich, diverse cast of characters, almost all of which are multi-dimensional and bring more to the table than just what they appear to be (while ironically trying to play up their stereotypes to promote the show they are working on). And though some characters sadly don't get the time to fully develop in just ten half-hour episodes, you have reason to believe that they will in future seasons, as the executive producers have proved before in the ongoing seasons of 'Orange is the New Black'.<br/><br/>And then there's the men of GLOW. The women are getting plenty of praise - and deservedly so - but the few male characters depicted also get a chance to shine. Chris Lowell plays the fascinating benefactor to the entire GLOW enterprise. He's the only one - initially - with the vision of what the show should be, and although he isn't introduced until episode three ('The Wrath of Kuntar'), his presence is felt as the unseen force propelling a reluctant director and inexperienced cast to pursue this venture. Bashir Salahuddin is the epitome of the phrase ""no small parts"" in this series. He exudes a warmth that instantly brings calmness and security to anyone and everyone around him. And although he is given minimal lines and - what some may argue - a generic character in the handful of appearances he makes, you genuinely feel invested and supportive of the developments he undertakes in the latter half of the season.<br/><br/>And finally, there's Marc Maron. Whether or not you've heard about him yet, you will soon and it will be because of this role. He plays the director enlisted with putting an all-female wrestling show together. He comes from a B-list, schlock horror background and only takes the job to finance his dream project, but despite being a sleaze ball with a predilection for the vices of the time, he also genuinely cares for people. He's a guy who will step up and stick his neck out for the people he believes in, and unlike just about all the other characters written with a drug problem, Maron's character isn't dictated by societal expectations to flounder and jeopardize the other characters around him. He's an asset, and not only that, but an absolute necessity. He's also an addict, but a functioning addict, which sadly many people in the industry were back then.<br/><br/>Maron exemplifies everything great about this show. It's not glorifying the era, it's a raw, unapologetic, and - at times - brutally honest depiction of the 1980s in southern California: Flawed, hilarious, and tacky.",113 out of 132 found this helpful.,10.0,1 July 2017
3209,GLOW," So, I had to write this cuz there are some nasty reviews here","I don't typically write reviews anymore because, who cares, really. It's just that I've seen some really lame-ass reviews for this show, so I had to chime in. In a world were people are going ballistic that Tim Allen's last opus to moronic men was canceled, shows like GLOW give me hope.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp - funny and moving. The characters are all well drawn with each having clear and distinct personalities. The music, costumes, sets are all authentic-feeling and look just great. And the actors ... wow! These folks are all perfect in their roles. Brie and Maron are almost too awesome. I see awards attention for them - or at least hope I do. Gilpin and the other beautiful, fabulous ladies are all perfect. Each episode you find yourself loving somebody new. Even Bash and Florian.<br/><br/>This show is funny, it's heart-felt, it's energetic, it's wicked fun!

3210,GLOW, So good I've watched both seasons twice... In a week!!!!!,"After watching mediocre series, GLOW was a breath of fresh air. Every single character had texture and were so compelling to watch. I found myself invested in every one of them. I felt I was watching real people, as opposed to actors acting like real people and what made this possible was the writing AND the talent. <br/><br/>What really sold this series to me was the true depiction of the 1980s; the cinematography, the soundtrack, the casting (this is how people looked in the 80s) and the grit. Such an awesome production. Alison Brie, Betty Gilpin, Marc Maron and Chris Lowell really stood out for me but the whole cast were amazing. Kia Stevens is also a talent to look out for. Her voice alone stood out for me; it was soothing yet powerful. I digress...<br/><br/>The writing was so brilliantly done that I felt every nuance was necessary and added to the overall story. Whether it was a pause, an unspoken word, a sigh, every bit of it was crucial and made the script meaty and real. I can't stand a script that sounds pedestrian and forced, like it has been overly rehearsed. The GLOW writers have the conversational flow of script writing down pat. They deserve awards!!!<br/><br/>Another element that makes this series what it is, is the chemistry between cast members. I believe them; Ruth and Debbie's tension but care for one another, Sam and Bash's good cop, bad cop routine and the ladies ensemble as a whole. There's drama, suspense, COMEDY and great music! A winning combination.<br/><br/>It's so good I've watched both seasons twice. Bring on season 3!",50 out of 61 found this helpful.,9.0,9 July 2018
3211,GLOW, GLOW Season 1 Review,"Wrestling is a 'sport' I don't know too much about. All I know is that it is scripted TV that plays out in front of live crowds. And they 'fight'. After GLOW, my thoughts on wrestling haven't change much, but I can appreciate the behind the scenes a lot more.<br/><br/>GLOW is one of Netflix's newest additions to their ever so growing library. It follows a group of ladies as they take up a wresting job purely for the money. Set in the 80s where many females struggle to get big time work, the show explores the behind the scenes of wrestling while looking into the life of an actress in the 80s.<br/><br/>There is so much to talk about for this show that it is going to be hard to touch on all the bases. Firstly, this is a show about wrestling but it is a story about the characters. That is my biggest take away from this show. Considering that they only had 10 30 minute episodes, they managed to make you care about all these characters and give each an arc that some shows manage to do across several season. <br/><br/>I have to give a lot of credit to the writing, because without this show being written the way it was, there is no way it turns out as good as it does. Whether it is comedy or emotional dialog, every moment of this show is well crafted and not one line of dialog or one action from a character seems out of place. <br/><br/>An equal amount of credit has to go to the cast. While Allison Brie was the only name I knew entering the show, I exited the show with many stand outs. While Brie was one of them, I thought Marc Maron, Betty Gilpin and Britney Young stood up as the other standouts. That however takes nothing away from the rest of the cast. Each one of them nailed their performance and I couldn't name one member that stood out for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>I thought the whole show was shot wonderfully. They really captured that 80s LA that I am use to seeing in movies, and if it wasn't for the camera and audio quality, I would have believed that this show was shot in the 80s. Much of that also came from the music choices. Similarly to Stranger Things, the music gave the show so much authenticity when it came to portraying a time period.<br/><br/>Overall, I was really surprised with this show. Firstly it was one of the easiest binge watches I have ever had. I watched the whole show in an afternoon because it was only 5 hours long rather than 10+. I'm not sure if this show will be getting a season 2 but I am all on board with it. I think this is one of the most well made shows around at the moment and it deserves all the credit it can get.<br/><br/>9/10",57 out of 71 found this helpful.,9.0,29 June 2017
3212,GLOW, This Show Hits It Out of the Park,"For all the Gen X and Y audiences this show is a nostalgic blast from the past! The music is spot on, the characters engaging, the story smart and funny. Definitely another hit for Netflix.<br/><br/>The show runners fully understand what wrestling is all about. The soap opera drama, the choreography, the archetype characters, it is all there.<br/><br/>I was curious and skeptical when I saw the previews, but I gave it a shot because Alison Brie has great taste in roles so I took a chance and am grateful I did. There is something for all viewers.<br/><br/>I hope there are plans to have a Brett Hart cameo in this show. As far as wrestlers go, he was the true master at making everything in the ring look painfully real.<br/><br/>This is a definite watch for anyone who enjoys good comedic dramas.<br/><br/>Be sure to check it out.",56 out of 70 found this helpful.,9.0,26 June 2017

It's part of a new wave of ""direct-to-VoD"" series that don't have to bow to cable TV standards in terms of language or nudity, but also concerning story development. Glow is a comedy alright, but it tackles difficult subjects like adultery and hard life choices. I would not say that this combination clicks every single time, but there are really quite awesome moments (and very funny ones, too) and I enjoy the basic setup and characters a lot. The acting is also pretty good.<br/><br/>I am curious to see where this is going, but I have to say that I'm very happy that there are shows like this that try to break a little from the mold.",76 out of 99 found this helpful.,8.0,24 June 2017

It's really well done and my only complaint is that it's a half hour show when I thought the episodes could have been longer. --I guess I just wanted more of a good thing!

3215,GLOW, Goosebumps,"Glow is about a completely dysfunctional group of women wrestlers, American style in the 80's. That sentence alone should spark everyone's interest. And it keeps on giving. This series let's its characters screw up to triumph brilliantly. It's mix of sex, drugs and wrestling is a stroke of genius. <br/><br/>I know it's high praise. But don't worry going in with too high expectations. Glow will not disappoint. If anything, it'll still blow you away, even if you see the perfect 10's. It's well deserved. The actors seem to relish their roles. It becomes hard even to pick a favorite character. Every episode has you rooting for someone new. <br/><br/>It's characters are all desperately seeking both love and success. They often don't get it but it doesn't matter. They become a team against all odds and persevere. The build ups to the finales are so well crafted I frequently found myself having goosebumps when all the drama outside the ring comes together when the wrestling starts. <br/><br/>It's just... see it.",28 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,5 July 2018
3216,GLOW, It's Simply A Treat,"I don't know as to why so many people hate it. It has 3 very important things going for itself: 1) Stellar Cast. Allison Brie is unrecognizable.

Albeit a bit cheesy but it's intentional, I think and it's good kind of cheesy. 3) Brilliant screenplay and impeccable cinematography.<br/><br/>If you've ever been a fan of 80's comedy and you are a sucker for some good old underdog story, then this is the show for you.<br/><br/>It's mostly predictable yet every scene feels like a breath of fresh air. Every character is flawed and yet incredibly likable.

Racism and infidelity) and you get GLOW! What cinema in the 80's SHOULD have looked like. Just like Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Back to the Future and The Breakfast Club, this show is going to be one that I watch again and again....and again. Something that I put on when life gets stressful and I just need to disappear into my kitsch 80's fantasy for a while.

3222,GLOW, A GLOW-rious beginning,"GLOW is loosely based on the actual GLOW (Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling) TV show which was a cheesy but charming women's wrestling show which ran for four seasons in the late 80s.<br/><br/>This is a really funny, heartwarming and sometimes exciting show. It is a very good combination of characters and wrestling. As a lifelong pro wrestling fan, the show successfully shows wrestling for being fun without making fun of it. I could have appreciated more insight into how hard it is to be a wrestler especially taking bumps which take a toll on the body. That being said, it does a very good job showing the people and getting us behind them. They are flawed people but likable and ultimately, you root for their success.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly excellent. Alison Brie is a capable lead who keeps the movie centered. Marc Maron, as the frustrated but deep down decent cokehead director does a fabulous job. Betty Gilpin as the slightly arrogant former soap opera star is brilliant especially since she has a lot of emotional scenes. I loved the wrestler cameos which I will keep a secret.<br/><br/>To conclude, the show is a wonderful love letter to wrestling fans. It would have been convenient to mock wrestling as stupid and dumb but the show avoids that pitfall. For new fans, it would serve as a good conduit into the crazy world of wrestling and for wrestling fans, it shows a simpler era where we were not smarks who picked apart every booking decision.

3227,GLOW," Season 1 great, Season 2 good, Season 3 awful","I've been a big fan of GLOW - both the original wrestling series in the 80's, and the Netflix series. Just finished watching season 3, and was very disappointed. I realized that the funniest and most entertaining aspects of Netflix seasons 1 and 2 happened during the wrestling-related scenes, where the cast members were either in the ring or training. Season 3 was almost all about personal relationships, with very little wrestling. It went from a show that appealed to everybody in the first two seasons, to a ""chick-flick"" or ""rom-com"" type of series that was directed mostly at female viewers in season 3. (I'm a guy.)<br/><br/>Way too many sex scenes, which I consider to be what bad screenwriters do to fill time when they can't come up with entertaining ideas.<br/><br/>And even though I consider myself slightly liberal, I am getting sick of political correctness and social justice being crammed down my throat, which season 3 of GLOW decided to do.<br/><br/>That said, I hope the series gets renewed for a 4th season, that season 3 was an aberration, and GLOW returns to what it was doing for the first two seasons.",38 out of 59 found this helpful.,7.0,11 August 2019
3228,GLOW, Season 3 - Lost its way,I loved the first 2 seasons but season 3 is a disjointed affair.

3229,GLOW," Back to the Future, Old Boy and deep dark humor. I liked it.","I usually dislike Netflix shows. Especially those with super heroes. But I gotta admit. This was a pretty good one.<br/><br/>When it comes to reviewing good shows or movies it's just too hard for me because there are too many aspects that I liked about the show. So I never know where to begin with. But here are the things I enjoyed about this one:<br/><br/>1) The time setting. I always enjoy 80's and this show gave me that sense of 80's pretty well.<br/><br/>2) Acting was really good too. Especially with the character Ruth. This show involved a lot of acting within acting within acting. I mean it's a hard one. As an actor Alison Brie, you are the character Ruth of the show GLOW portraying a mediocre actor trying to find a good job for yourself. Once you find a fake wrestling show to take part in then that involves another level of acting which she ""learns"" by training within the show. Geez it's really hard to explain but I can summarize it by calling it something cheesy like actingception (derived from the movie inception just in case...) It's not just with Alison Brie but all the other wrestler women too. <br/><br/>3) The humor from time to time was predictable but it was still enjoyable and was a little dark, which I enjoy a lot. I believe there was even an OldBoy reference when one of the wrestlers happens to be the daughter of the director and then his daughter tells him what is what when the director tries to make out with his own daughter unkowingly. That moment was so odd and uncomfortable I was both smiling and at the same time embarrassed. Again hard to explain.<br/><br/>This show could get a 10 from me if the wresting moves were just a tiny bit more realistic. Of course they were doing it cheesy on purpose but the level of cheesiness could be reduced just a little bit more to make it seem like these women worked really hard and they started as desperate actors being clueless about wrestling but in the end they put out something that's the result of hard work. I guess I was expecting a much better development in terms of wrestling. They could even use rope tricks green screen CGI I wouldn't care really. <br/><br/>For instance the part in the show where Ruth and Machu Pichu were demonstrating their moves for the first time. They were so amazing. I was like wow these are going to turn into real wrestlers by the end of the show. But as the show proceeded it actually turned into camera techniques to hide actors' incompetence at wrestling. <br/><br/>I don't criticize the show because of my own expectations. I criticize because I fear that some people might find wrestling scenes too cheesy and it might turn them off. Wheras people like me would be okay thinking all that wrestling to be really good on a symbolic level.<br/><br/>Anyways I talked too much. You should really give this show a try.",29 out of 45 found this helpful.,9.0,24 June 2017

3233,Henry Danger, Remember to Not Take It Too Seriously,"So I can admit that I'm an adult woman who watches Nickelodeon (I grew up on it, and I've found that watching kids shows and kid movies helps me ease my stress because, let's face it: a lot of the shows on t.v. aimed at adults feature topics/scenarios that are too ""like real life"" for a person like me who just wants to relax). Call me an immature escapist if you want, but isn't that what t.v. is for? Anyhow, I gave ""Henry Danger"" a try -- and let me say, I was surprised that it made me laugh so much. The first eppie that I watched was the birthday party episode. And this led to watching three more episodes on-demand (my faves so far are ""Man Beast"" and also the episode where a new ""kid"" joins the basketball team). I adore the kind of humor in ""Henry Danger"" -- there are many side-jokes that are aimed at an older crowd so parents/adults won't get left out. The jokes also include pop culture references.<br/><br/>I enjoy the whole adventure, superhero aspect of it all. I don't mind Piper -- she's supposed to be a brat and I find it funny. The show has a lot of potential, and so do the stars. I watched this show on a Saturday night (I'm handling some tough stuff in my life at the moment) and it helped me to cope because I felt like a kid again.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, if you don't take this show too seriously and expect golden gold at every moment, it's a nice way to pass the time. Glad to see the show got picked up for more episodes.<br/><br/>If I could make any suggestions for the show, it would be to keep including the supporting characters (not just Charlotte, Piper,and Jasper) because it gives me a good ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" vibe, and also, please give Charlotte a last name, lol!",60 out of 79 found this helpful.,7.0,14 December 2014
3234,Henry Danger," Try and watch a few of the episodes, it does get better:)","So this show had been around for quite a while before i actually started to watch it. Nickelodeon had been introducing loads of new shows at that point and honestly, Henry Danger looked boring and a childish show aimed at 8 year old kids just like all the other new cheesy shows and i had no desire to watch it. But it must have been a couple weeks later before i noticed that Dan Schneider had written it and as i had enjoyed all the previous shows that he had created (icarly, victorious, drake &amp; josh, Sam &amp; Cat) i decided i might give it a try. And of course, it was really cheesy as expected but i forced myself to watch it and i found out that the episodes were actually quite entertaining and lighthearted. Of course, some of the characters do annoy me like Jasper, Charlotte and Piper but because i really like the personality of Captain Man and Henry i am able to watch it. So even if you say to yourself that you can't bear to watch one whole episode, just do it and maybe you will actually like it. It'll bring out the kid in you if nothing!

It kind of has its own unique plot. A kid becomes a superheroes' sidekick and has to deal with his normal life along the way. Sure, this plot is used everywhere but this one takes the cake.

3237,Henry Danger, excellent show for kids!,"I absolutely love this show! When I first watched the hour-long episode I was hesitant at how it would continue. But this show proves once again, that Dan Schneider knows how to write hilarious scripts for the characters. Jace Norman, Ella Anderson &amp; Riele Downs are great actors that only get better as the episodes continue! The kids have enjoyed watching Ella Anderson as a guest on different Disney shows &amp; the Fairly Odd Parents movie, so we were all very excited to see her on this show. She has done an amazing job! Her character is hilarious because she captures the very essence of today's generation on social media, of course a little exaggerated to make it funnier. And she does a great representation of being a bratty younger sister! Jace Norman is fantastic as Kid Danger. A very natural actor who makes the kids laugh a lot! Overall, this is a great show that makes the kids laugh hysterically &amp; the adults enjoy some family time!",24 out of 39 found this helpful.,10.0,2 November 2014
3238,Henry Danger, Give it a chance,"Come on guys, give the show a chance. I know the plot is blurring with the acting off a little but, everyone van admit that it is fun to watch. When one is worked up or bored, this show provides the fun to keep you smiling. Maybe everyone not caring for Jasper is bad but haven't we seen good films with that same situation? I do admit that I don't see any essence in the role of Jasper the movie because even though he is the best friend of Henry and Charlotte, the film barely makes you notice it.<br/><br/>The only thing I mostly hated about this movie was the fact that the way Piper disrespects her parents is like, teaching kids what they shouldn't do. Her rivalry with Henry is OK, but how she talks back at her parents, orders them around and his her parents fail to even discipline her. <br/><br/>Well aside that, the movie us great. The episodes are fun and maybe we should give it a chance, maybe as it progresses further, it would be better.",11 out of 16 found this helpful.,7.0,17 June 2017
3239,Henry Danger, Henry Danger sucks,"I've watched all of Dan Schneider's shows beginning with The Amanda Show followed by Drake &amp; Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious, and most recently, Sam &amp; Cat. All of Dan's shows have been hits in my book so I thought I'd give this one a try. I couldn't even get half way through the episode before having to stop. The plot was stupid and the laugh track kept getting on my nerves. I was surprised that the show didn't turn out well due to Dan's previous streak of shows. This show seems mostly aimed at kids 8 years old. Even for them, the concept is outrageous. I think this is the excuse to have a show aimed for boys because most other shows are aimed towards girls. What makes it worse is that it's not set in the same world as his other shows. I wouldn't recommend this show to other people.",54 out of 105 found this helpful.,1.0,27 July 2014
3240,Henry Danger, Decline of Schneider's Bakery Quality,"Dan Schneider has done so many good things for Nickelodeon, but this was not one of those. In this show, Henry Hart is a thirteen-year- old who works as the sidekick of Captain Man. In these stories, we get a bunch of cheesy and stupid conflicts. This show seems to take place on another planet, I'm convinced. One example of weirdness was Miss Shapen's large toe from ""My Phony Valentine."" Who on earth was asking for that? The main characters are far from good too. Piper Hart is Henry's little sister who acts like Megan, except that she's a social media freak. Megan may have been unlikeable, but she was charming enough to be a fun evil girl. She was on the lines of Orochimaru from Naruto or Aku from Samurai Jack. I really ought to give it up to Miranda Cosgrove as an actress. Not just that, but she was able to manipulate everyone else, so they never believe Drake or Josh when the duo blames Megan. However, everyone already knows Piper is unlikable. So, idiocy ensues when she tries to act like Megan. Jasper is Henry's best male friend who exists as comic relief. However, his gimmick either comes across as annoying like in Henry and the Man-Beast or uninteresting like in Let's Make a Steal. Captain Man comes across as the most annoying character on this show. One example of his jerkiness was getting Piper to lose her temper. The reason why was Henry and Charlotte have to eat pumpkin guts from JAM Session. Speaking of Henry and Charlotte, they're the most tolerable of the main cast. Nevertheless, that's not saying much. Overall, this show is a big mess. If they want to be surreal, that's fine. But if they want to do that, they must hook that to real world logic. I don't recommend that anyone should watch this.",12 out of 20 found this helpful.,2.0,14 June 2017
3241,Henry Danger, Henry Danger - Modern and refreshing approach to classic theme,"Henry Danger is a show with a very different story plot and ideas, which make it quite interesting. It takes the ""superhero"" concept and applies it in a modern sense, which make the show a refreshing one. That being said, some of the humour is pretty dry and forced....and also quite repetitive. I find Henry's little sister to be extremely annoying and bratty, and her screaming irks me, although she does pretty good for her character. Henry and his friends are pretty funny at times, but that's about it. Many of the actors act well, but again, the seemingly repetitive humour makes the show a bit boring. At least it steps out of the typical sitcom high school setting, where everyone is dominated and controlled by silly stereotypes, and uses a different concept and approach.<br/><br/>*7.5/10*",12 out of 20 found this helpful.,7.0,26 February 2015

I watched the movie premiere of Henry Danger, and though didn't completely love it, was willing to give the show a look. I just tried to watch the first episode and aside from the Henry character, pretty much all the characters are completely annoying.

3244,Henry Danger, I Despise This.,"I love Dan Schnieder. I have watched Drake and Josh, Victorious, ICarly, The Amanda Show and even Game Shakers. They are all great shows but this one annoys me so much. Where to begin??<br/><br/>1. Acting is terrible<br/><br/>I swear to Lucifer I could punch Jace Norman in the face. He is terrible! He acts how me and my best friend acted in year 2.... I am 16. He sounds and act so annoying and stereotyped. I find him to be a show off ""I am Kid Danger now and I have to keep my city safe...."" And crap. WE KNOW! The girl who plays Piper is SO cliché. She acts all sassy and acts as if she's the boss and acts as if she can get everything she wants. Pretty much a spoil ed brat who hasn't been brought up right. Don't even get me started about the parents! The only one I particularly liked was Charlotte. <br/><br/>2. Storyline.... Boring and Unactive <br/><br/>*sigh* This is supposed to be a show about superheroes and fighting crime. All I see is a cruel sick joke. One episode Henry Danger has to track down a guy with metal teeth who appears at a wedding. WHAT?! It sounds amazing but it really isn't. Even when he has to take him down all he does is flip him over a table.... CMON! Dora the Explorer has more drama than this show. And there was even one episode where Captin Man couldn't even open a pickle jar.. REALLY?<br/><br/>3. Laugh Track .. JOKES ARN'T FUNNY!<br/><br/>I swear to god every 5 seconds there is a laugh track. When someone is walking through the hall, laugh track. When someone can't get their locker open, laugh track. When someone falls flat on their face, laugh track. Even when Brad dies from getting run over by a bus, laugh track. I wonder how it's gonna play out when it takes place in Brad's funeral. The jokes are boring and uninspired, It didn't make me laugh once, not even a grin. Cringe worthy fart jokes. I would rather watch the return of Barney.<br/><br/>4. Dosn't hold anyone's attention<br/><br/>This is something that all TV shows need to do, hold and get my attention. This did neither. The trailers don't want to make you watch. Even if it did it certainly dos't make me want to keep watching. It isn't interesting, exciting or even amusing so why is it still going?<br/><br/>Even if you love Dan Schnieder there is no way you should watch this!

I hate that they try to call it a movie, and then claim that so many people liked ""the (hour long) movie"" that they decided to make it a series.

Because it had depth, quality, everything made sense and most importantly it wasn't forced. All the LGBTQ+ representation (and there was so much of it), diversity and everything worked flawlessly.<br/><br/>My point is<br/><br/><ul><li>Diversity = Good</li><li>Forced diversity in the name of being progressive, to fill a quota = Bad</li><li>Strong female lead = Good (Alien, Kill Bill, Annihilation etc)</li><li>Man bashing female empowerment just for the sake of it = Bad (Starwars, the new Ghost Busters etc)</li></ul><br/><br/>Everything got too political in our day and we just want unbiased entertainment.

The show takes absolutely nothing from the ancient stories we all know and love about Arthur, his knights and the quest for the grail other than the names of those famous characters. This show rips away everything you know and love about Excalibur and the true story of the Lady of the Lake as well and turns it into a weak story about female empowerment and diversity. I also have problems with technical aspects of the series. Such as when she's fighting off the wolves on top of the rock there's a white wolf that's trying to jump up and eat her. It's obvious that the CG wolf is stuck in a repeat animation. Like a GIF. Also, for a bunch of villagers back in medieval England living in the woods. They sure seem to have access to a lot of make up and laundry detergent. Netflix isn't a new platform anymore and you'd think they'd have learned by now how to make their shows a little less amateurish and a bit more professional.","855 out of 1,305 found this helpful.",1.0,17 July 2020

Not to mention, she's also a witch but has trouble using her powers to get out of tough situations and to kill her enemies.
That's TWO of the talents wasted on her.<br/><br/>Now, let's come to the casting.

(And 'bots' giving fake reviews),"'If you look at all the reviews that are giving it 10/10.. 95% of them are all 'new' or mainly 'really old and unused' accounts that are just 'bots, Langford 'stans' or the same people being asked or paid to give a single or several, 'fake' reviews on this just to try to increase its rating.<br/><br/>Apologies for this lengthy review beforehand.<br/><br/>Side note: Yes I did watch all 10 episodes, hoping that it would get better, sadly, it does not. It's about 8 episodes to long so they should of just made this into a movie or a limited series and left it at that, it's not one of those shows that keeps you enthralled, on the edge of your seat and wanting the next episode, far from it and it's definitely not going to be a series you are going to remember or stick with you after a while.. I have to ask now but why does Netflix continue to cancel and cut short, extremely good shows but then go on to invest, produce and give multiple seasons to shows like this?<br/><br/>Anyway, to begin, Quote: 'The sword chooses a Queen' and then a 'Queen becomes legend'?! The people of her tiny village choose her as a Queen, near the end of the series, well the dozen that are left alive that is and that's only because of the sword, the sword does not choose her, her mother gives it to her, the sword does not lead her, she is not drawn to it by its power, she obtains it by pure coincidence and then goes on to lose it or hands it over to others for most of the time anyway while skipping off on her over extended lofty quest to return the Sword to Merlin as per her dying mothers last wish.. And how does she become legend? She doesn't even have the sword that long and really does nothing of any significance to even earn that title.<br/><br/>Nothing really happens from episodes 2-9.. Nimue has magical powers but barely uses them when they are needed most, like watching on as almost her entire village gets slaughtered but uses them to alter the outcome in a game of dice!? She spends about 8 episodes hiding, whining, running away or crying instead of being this apparent badass 'powerful warrior Queen'.. she doesn't really, stand and fight, at all, like we were lead to believe she was going to do in the running up to the start of this series and when she does actually use the sword, she just swings it around as if it's way to heavy for her, against skilled opponents and prays for 'hit and hope' moments, I believe that she was actually taught how to 'sword fight' before production started, so was she intentionally taught how to wield it badly?<br/><br/>The book itself is aimed at young adults so they would have done better by sticking to that, although in some scenes you'd think it was for children. At one point I was half expecting a few animated birds and a menagerie of other animals to suddenly appear as Langford bursts into song.. What child doesn't love a Disney princess right?<br/><br/>The acting is bad, the script/dialog is shocking, the CGI, especially the Wolves part, is poor, the choreography is shameful and all the clan 'Fay' have different accents and most of the extras with actual dialog cannot act at all.
I believe they chose the main lead, Katherine Langford, due to her popularity, definitely not because of her acting abilities.
I'm from England and her mediocre attempt at an English accent is atrocious and laughable, it changes so many times in this series.. we see in episode 1, she tries way to hard with it and over annunciates everything, then as we progress, she just becomes lazy with it and her accent constantly shifts as if she seems to forget it, the reason being, she simply cannot maintain the same accent throughout, it's really poor, messy English. They either need a better dialect coach or to put it bluntly, a better actress.. as some good looks, a couple of fake accents, the two facial expressions she uses in literally everything she's done and the first Season of 13 Reasons Why, which is not good and is the only reason she is the lead on this is by riding off the coattails of its teen popularity, as Season 2 onwards are complete trash. Everything else she has been in, her acting has not been good, she is just way overrated, very two dimensional and has the range of a teaspoon, all she seems to play is whiny, mopey teenagers, 13RW, Knives Out, Love, Simon. EndGame? sorry, you can't really count that last one, deleted.. and she's only in others to just simply fill the margins, and from the start, this role was far to big for her to take on the main lead and she can barely carry a scene without it being painful and embarrassing to watch at times, there are far more talented actresses out there that could of filled this part successfully.
As for Skarsgård, someone ought to let him know as he thinks he's still on the set of Vikings, if you've seen it, you know.. either that or a poor mans Jack Sparrow, he can't seem to make up his mind on that one, moody Sharman basically spends most of the series just prancing and somersaulting about like a child that's had to much sugar, he needs to calm down a bit and Terrell, he's an emotionless plank and couldn't be more wooden if he tried.<br/><br/>As we progress we find out that the Weeping Monk is actually Lancelot and the bad child actor who plays Squirrel is Percival, Uther is portrayed as a whiny, petulant child that acts like he's thrown his toys out the pram, Arthur is a thief, a gambler and a liar and Merlin the so called Wizard, is now a drunkard and apparently the true wielder of the Sword of Power.. Ohh and he (Merlin) is also Nimue's father!?!.. Wait, hold on, what!? who wrote this stuff?? none of this makes any sense or relates to any of the Arthur/Excalibur/Lady of the Lake legendary folklore tale, it's ok to do a re-tale of this mythology but if you do, it has to be good, actually the only thing it had relating to the story were the characters names, so it just looks like you've just used the characters names to attract viewers, that was not going to be enough to stop this car crash I'm afraid and by episode 5, if not earlier, it gets more painful as you continue watching and has a willingness to end and I found myself, quite a few times, pausing it just to see how long I'd got left to watch.<br/><br/>There are so many different plot lines in this, some pop up from nowhere without resolution or closure and some carry on way to long and make no sense. I think most of the budget must of gone on Miller's animation contributions that pop up half a dozen times an episode.. If you're a fan of Miller's work then you can see he's obviously gone for the pay check over his reputation on this one.. Apparently this was supposed to be The Witcher meets Game of Thrones.. (maybe season 8 of GoT if you understand what I mean?) but it's none of that.. it was just never seems to get going.. There is virtually zero chemistry between the two main leads, Langford and Terrell, it's just woefully poor and the one song contributed to the soundtrack by Katherine Langford, she sings it in this terrible, fake American accent, (She knows she's Australian right? Just checking and she's obviously trying, very poorly, to mimic Lana Del Rey, it's atrocious) they put it in over their one passionless sex scene, its cringe and tacky.<br/><br/>The best part of this series is the 2 minute 'misleading' trailer running up to it.. It's the kind of series where you could get up mid way through an episode, go do something more exciting like, watch paint dry, come back two episodes later, and not miss anything.<br/><br/>The reason why I gave this such a low rating, is not because of it's diversity, empowerment of women or the LGBTQ+ aspect etc that's been deliberately forced into it, that doesn't bother me, this is the world we live in nowadays, take it or leave it, in the end it's not going to change and I understand why with this, that not everyone is going to be happy about it and it's not just because of the bad acting or poor script/dialogue etc, It's because you took the Arthurian mythology, yes I know it's mythology but everyone knows the basis of it, it's legend, you took that and deliberately turned it completely on its head and so far from its original concept and thought it would be a good idea, if this series had been well executed or even if you'd not used any of the actual characters from it at all and made it it's own, people may or could see it differently, I said may, because there is so much more wrong with it as I've already mentioned but you didn't, this series doesn't know what it wants to be, or where it's going.. it felt like they'd just made a lot of it up as they've gone along, the age in which this is supposed to be set, the costumes, backdrops etc don't fit, I know it's mythology but it probably would of been best if you'd of sort the advice off a true Historian due to actual historical figures mentioned, costumes and timelines etc, to actually give you actual facts to fit the era it's supposed to be set in, the majority of it, it just feels rushed, it's not polished and it drags on for far to long, I'm a fan of the mythology, I grew up with it but I'm open to new concepts, new takes on it etc but this has not been thought out well or had any idea how badly its been received and for most of it, it felt, at times, like I was watching one of those poorly scripted, cheap TV movies, so if you like those, you'll love this.<br/><br/>It seems to be doing well in a few countries by the looks of it, do not be fooled, if you know how Netflix's algorithms work, you literally only have to watch less than 10 minutes of it, for it to count as watching the entire 10 episodes. It would be interesting to see the figures of how many viewers actually made it to the end?<br/><br/>Netflix has obviously put a lot of money into this production but if they have any sense, they'll cancel this while they're not ahead but judging by the ending, it has been left open for another season, please don't..!! it is not good but we know that they do like a money cash cow.",268 out of 461 found this helpful.,1.0,18 July 2020
3280,Cursed, I loved it,"The comments here are rude and unfair. I fully understand and respect if ""Cursed"" is ultimately not the cup of tea of some people or just hasn't met their expectations , but giving it the lowest rating is definitely not what this show deserves. This is pure exaggeration.
""Cursed"" deserves a 7 or 7,5/10.
It was a good first season, with interesting characters; captivating universe, and story. I was impatient and excited to see each episode, and it took me just two days to finish the season. I can't wait for Season 2.
Are there any flaws? Obviously, especially visually (CGI), and I think there are some scenes that could be better filmed, especially Nimue's badass moments. It's rushed and a bit sloppy. But in the end, these things don't ruin the story or anything, and they can be better the next season.<br/><br/>Thanks to all the cast and crew, and of course, thank you Netflix.",245 out of 423 found this helpful.,7.0,20 July 2020
3281,Cursed, Why all the bashing?,"I just finished the first season and it may not be really accurate in a mythology way, and it's fair to say some bits are a bit cheesy or flat, but overall I enjoyed the story and development. I do not inspect too many details, as a lot of so called directors who can do better are claiming here, so these elements didn't bother me. I like the characters and diversity, though I'd recommend a bit more deeper personality in the next season. The first two episodes were not the most convincing but from there things get very entertaining. And Katherine Langford is playing a great Nimweh. Why all the hate?

3296,Sweet Magnolias, Every Southern Cliche Possible,"Create a drinking game out of every southern cliche on this show and you'll finish an episode quite toasty indeed. Take a sip for every ""bless your heart,"" another for every ""yes ma'am"" two sips for characters with two names for a first name (Dana Sue). Also, the dialects! So terrible. If these people all grew up in the same town together, shouldn't they all have the same dialect? Not all southern accents sound the same and for those of us who do live in the south, every actor bringing their own dialect is unnerving. I gave it five stars because I like the premise of three best friends Supporting each other and I love the architecture of the homes. It's light-hearted and feels warm and family friendly, but this is more of a show I would play in the background while doing other activities around the house, not one with a storyline with which I'm actively engaged.

3308,Fauda, Changed my views on the conflict,"I am American. I am biased. <br/><br/>With that out of the way, I wanted to... no, felt that I HAD to write a review about Fauda. Being completely honest with myself, I can't review this show based on ""realism"" or the whether the portrayal of ideological differences are genuine or not; I'm not exposed to that on a daily basis like those in the Middle East are. What I can review is how this show changed my mind and opinion about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and how it made me feel. <br/><br/>I went into this viewing with a prideful appreciation of Israel (I still have one) and expected to see an action-packed thriller about undercover operations. You do get that, don't get me wrong, but that's not the point of the show. What you get from this show is a very poignant lesson about the physical, emotional, spiritual, and ideological toll that is felt in the battle that this show is portraying. You get the sense that what you are viewing is real. The writers do a masterful job of convincing you to sympathize with even the most unwavering of Hamas supporters and warriors and with the Israelis tasked with hunting them down. You get a front row seat to the endless killing that is carried out by both sides for reasons that are not even clear to the triggermen. ""An eye for an eye"", to what end? There is no Hollywood romance sideplots, no flashy explosions or high speed car chases through oncoming traffic, only death and despair. <br/><br/>This show has been incredibly difficult for me to describe to my friends and family, and I can only tell them what it's about and why I believe it's not a biased depiction of the real war going on. But I can't describe how you feel watching this show. It's profound and eye opening. All I know is that we're all human, we all mourn the same way.",244 out of 320 found this helpful.,9.0,9 July 2018

3310,Fauda," 'Fauda' Isn't Just Ignorant, Dishonest and Sadly Absurd. It's anti-Palestinian Incitement","""As a Palestinian living in the occupied territories, I understand that a lot of Israelis, and many viewers worldwide, genuinely believe that the Netflix series 'Fauda' presents an informed, even ""neutral,"" point of view about the conflict in Israel and Palestine. Indeed, the series' strapline is: ""The human stories on both sides of the Israel-Palestine conflict.""<br/><br/>That faith in 'Fauda' is badly misplaced. The misperception that the series offers any kind of accurate portrayal of Palestinian life and identity has, sadly, wide-ranging and unfortunate repercussions.<br/><br/>In the just-released season three, the same Israeli undercover commando unit that completed operations, successfully and controversially, inside the West Bank over the first and second seasons, has a new theater of operations: Gaza. The unit, whose members speak Arabic and are trained to both assasinate and ""blend in,"" participate in an operation to release two Israeli youngsters kidnapped by Hamas.<br/><br/>Palestinians in Gaza have been under an Israeli and Egyptian land, air, and sea blockade since 2007. Since the only other border is the sea, that means there is no way out and few ways in, too. Very few Israelis may have entered Gaza in the last 15 years. Very few Palestinians from the West Bank have either. I happen to be one of the few, entering several times on humanitarian missions. So does Fauda offer a rare window into an effectively closed-off territory?<br/><br/>Well, the season's writers clearly thought they had done their duty to truth-telling by showing, from time to time, Gaza's endemic electricity outages. They showed how dirty and contaminated the water is there.<br/><br/>But the reality is worse than even the most dystopian television script: 38 percent of the population lives in poverty. 54 percent suffer from food insecurity. 39 percent of the youth are unemployed, and over 90 percent of the water is undrinkable. I saw kids from Gaza leaving through the Erez border crossing for cancer treatments in Israel without their families: it's almost unimaginable, but you won't learn that from Fauda.<br/><br/>The reality of life in Gaza is even less than the most basic backdrop to the real action. In contrast, the writers grab every opportunity to focus on the radicalization in Gaza.<br/><br/>In one of the episodes, Doron Kavillio, the key protagonist and leader - by force of personality but not title - of the undercover unit, enters a shop in Gaza disguised as a Palestinian. He starts with greeting the shop owner with a very cool ""Hi"" in English and finishes by calling the young lady ""habibti"" (my love/my dearest.)<br/><br/>It is true that we Arabs tend to use the word ""habibi"" beyond its actual meaning, but almost never towards someone random of the opposite gender, and definitely not in Gaza. Using ""habibi"" in that way is an Israelism. In the ""real"" Gaza, Doron's cultural impropriety would have raised a flashing red light - enough reason for him to be caught.<br/><br/>While Doron is getting unduly linguistically over-familiar with the Gaza shop owner, his two colleagues, Eli and Sagi, are stopped by a Hamas police officer while waiting for Doron to leave the store. They're wearing rough, dirty clothes and riding a battered old car. They introduce themselves as traders from the West Bank and Eli announces he is getting married in Gaza tonight. Honestly, I couldn't not help but laugh out loud.<br/><br/>First, the number of West Bank traders who enter Gaza in a good year can be counted on the fingers of two hands, and they are invariably the richest and best-connected businessmen. Secondly, the idea of a West Bank man getting married to a woman from Gaza is bizarre and incongruous, as since the blockade, it no longer happens. Thirdly: the sad absurdity that Israel would grant the trader's friend a permit to attend the wedding too? That's just too much.<br/><br/>It's reasonable that the series' vast global audience might not have the information and tools to know Gaza's reality, but that makes the culpability of the directors, who don't even try to present the truth, far more egregious.<br/><br/>In the same vein, there are other examples of a pronounced unfamiliarity with how Palestinians speak. Any Palestinian would have understood there was something fishy about the boxer featured this season who is supposed to come from Hebron. Most West Bank accents are reasonably similar - but Hebron's is famously distinctive. There was not even the smallest effort to reflect this.<br/><br/>It leaves the impression that Palestinians are good enough to appropriate for dramatic material but not for anything approaching an authentic representation. Perhaps Fauda needs more Palestinian advisors.<br/><br/>This leads me to my biggest problem with the show. Every chance that they have, Fauda's writers present the Israeli commandos as personally and operationally principled, lingering on their deep concern for protecting the civilians of Gaza, going out of their way to fulfil their promise to the family of the Palestinian informer who supported them. They aren't shown shooting or killing any Palestinian women or childen.<br/><br/>But this is Fauda's war on truth. All the data shows that the opposite is true. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in relation to just one of the Israel-Hamas conflicts, the 2014 Gaza war, 2251 Palestinians were killed, of which 1462 were civilians 551 were children and 299 were women. Israelis need to know the unvarnished truth: that their army is responsible for killing all these civilians, and to recognize the chasm between those deaths, their perpetrators and Fauda's fantasy soldiers.<br/><br/>And if it's too hard to trust Palestinians and international humanitarian organizations - hear it from Israeli military veterans themselves, whose testimonies Breaking the Silence compiles, who describe how entire neighborhoods have been virtually wiped off the map, and soldiers told - and I quote - ""shoot anyone in your proximity."" Read the words of Israel's own government ministers, like then-Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, who declared in 2018, ""You have to understand, there are no innocent people in the Gaza Strip.""<br/><br/>But for me, one of the worst, even dangerous, scenes occurs towards the end of the third season, when an Arab physiotherapist, as he's starting a therapy session in an Israeli hospital attempts to kill the head of a Shin Bet branch in the West Bank.<br/><br/>It's worth deconstructing this plot: 17 percent of Israel's physicians, 24 percent of its nurses and 47 percent of its pharmacists are Arabs. There has never been a single incident in history where Arab medics in Israel have betrayed their Hippocratic oath and harmed a patient.<br/><br/>It is beyond ridiculous to platform a character and plotline that marks Arabs working inside the Israeli health care system as untrustworthy and disloyal, and capable of violent attacks. It can only create further mistrust between people. To promote such an image is completely deceitful and false - and worse, it feeds those voices, including at the top of Israel's government, who constantly demean Israel's Arab citizens, legislate their inequality and incite against them.<br/><br/>Having a future fourth season based in the Palestinian territories, whether Gaza or the West Bank, would push the limits of credibility too far, after three seasons of serially blowing up both their cover and having exhausted their ""authentic Palestinian"" schtick. The obvious candidates for Fauda's future script location would be Lebanon or Syria.<br/><br/>If so, I hope the writers and producers take more seriously their responsibility to present a more faithful social and political reality. That they retreat from the barely subliminal anti-Arab incitement. And that they can bring themselves to offer even the superficial respect for the essential nuances of Arab culture and the value of human life that they serially failed to provide for Palestinians.<br/><br/>With the region already bursting with so much disinformation, name-calling and dangerous propaganda, there's no need to further confirm prejudices and deepen ignorance. Fauda can do better.""",291 out of 485 found this helpful.,1.0,27 April 2020

3319,Fauda, A captivating and engrossing program.,"Kudos to other reviewers who intimately understand the Palestine/Israel conflict. Their reviews are in-depth and broadly cover the topic.<br/><br/>Allow me to present the perspective of someone who knew little more than the fact two countries are battling over land. One heavily represented in the media as an ally of the Free World, the other portrayed as a nation of extremists and terrorists. And this from the occasional media I watch and hear in Australia (another allied nation).<br/><br/>So here's the kicker: Fauda, an Israeli series depicting the very conflict I've just mentioned, manages to infuse its tale with humanity, love, family and friendship. And it does so on both sides of the fence. Two clear enemies, major stakeholders in the war they wage, are shown with objectivity and fairness. Both men are flawed, both men are biased and heavily indoctrinated in their cause. Yet both have wives and kids they adore, and both men wage their war in the hopes of creating a better future for their families.<br/><br/>That being said, war is ugly and the price paid is often high. Fauda does not stray from this reality and the ripple effect is ever-present, slicing its way through the lives of those embroiled in the fight; some guilty, some innocent.<br/><br/>Woven through these fundamental connections are the various political and military involvements. Watching the puppet masters at work is both interesting and disturbing. Nothing is ever straightforward and Fauda is no exception. There's always someone watching or listening and there's always someone a step ahead of you. <br/><br/>In essence, Fauda is wonderfully acted, riveting, fast-paced and even educational. It is a superior series and deserving of the praise it has received. I truly look forward to Season 2.",55 out of 100 found this helpful.,9.0,7 November 2017
3320,Fauda, Captivating,"I have never lived in the West Bank, and thus cannot speak to whether the script is as severely biased as some claim. What I do know is that among those who voice this particular criticism, there does appear to be roughly the same number of people who think it is demonizing the Palestinians as there are those thinking it's the Israelis that are getting the unfair treatment.<br/><br/>Why I don't believe it is possible to ever be completely unbiased, I do not get the sense that the show is trying to convince me one way or the other. This tale of ruthless killing and unending retribution does not, in my opinion, make any attempt at justification. I believe it a story, not primarily about the common Palestinian or Israeli, but about the combatants on both sides. <br/><br/>However, I can see how a passionate supporter of either side might find this show a bit unpalatable. Those who simply want their convictions justified can probably find something more to their liking elsewhere. Propaganda is easy to come by these days. The rest of us can enjoy this well made fiction, listen to the beautiful semitic languages and be captivated by the awesome culture and piety of these ancient civilizations. <br/><br/>I pray for lasting peace among all the seed of Abraham.",34 out of 59 found this helpful.,8.0,10 October 2018

3323,Fauda," It grabs your attention, but it can make viewers hate Arabs or Israelis even more.","I just finished watching season 3, and in short, it is a good series that depict the life in both Israel and Palestine, like what they eat, their culture and traditions. So in the beginning, you feel hopeful that Israelis want to learn from Arabs and vice versa, but then, the series become very cyinical, when in fact the only reason they ""learn each other language and culture"" is to creates pain and sorrow.<br/><br/>I wanted to root for the Shin Bet team headed by Doron, but I couldn't. The lack of morals and restraint when inmocent Palestinians are involved, just show how imbalanced this war is. They have no policy of taking prisoners. They simply shoot to kill, even enemies that already surrendered.<br/><br/>Also, they recruit informanta and collaborators among Palestinians, who endanger themselves to help Israelis, but Israel never helps or rescues them, so normally they end up dead.<br/><br/>And another irony, is that the more terrorist they kill, the more replacements they create, because all the orphans, siblings that become destitute and homeless (it shows Israel blowing up houses of innocent people), so in the end offering their life to Hamas is the only resource left.<br/><br/>The show missed an opportunity to show how to de escalate the conflict.

3325,Fauda," Not without merit, but 10 out of 10, seriously?!?","The many 10/10 reviews for 'Fauda' are a bit perplexing? A series without any flaws?<br/><br/>Undoubtedly realistic action scenes, I'm sure popular with Netflix who are trying to create a homegrown 'Homeland' I suppose, but I don't think 'Fauda' is great drama. Sure, some of the acting was great, but some less so, seemed to be a lot of 'workshopping' of ideas going on. Absence of a script? On a more personal note, weren't the women characters much more complex and interesting than the men, credit to actors Laetitia Eido and Rona-Lee Shim'on (and Hanan Hillo in the first season)? The so-called 'realism' of the series also seems rather flimsy. In Season 2, leading character Doron loses his father and lover in the space of 24 hours, both deaths of which he's partly responsible for, and then after a bit of moping around at home and a helpful barbie from his mates he's back on the road again to wipe out his nemesis ... No, sorry if it upsets the glowing reviews but I don't think you can call 'Fauda' serious drama.<br/><br/>For me, the profoundly depressing thing about it is its one-dimensional subject matter. OK, at its core 'Fauda' is about an Israeli-backed intelligence unit that infiltrates the Palestinian territories to root out suspected terrorist cells. Although I've never read about nor seen TV reports directly related to these activities, very little in 'Fauda' surprised/engaged me. It didn't tell me anything I didn't already know really.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the series features nothing really about the causes of terrorism, the complexities of Arab-Israeli relations and the need to find peaceful solutions of co-existence. It's true you learn things about the people in the situations portrayed, realistic according to many who have posted reviews up here, but it all seems superficial on a personal level. Violence overwhelms the attempts at drama and 'Fauda' doesn't challenge our view of the situation in the West Bank and Gaza, only reinforces stereotypes and seems to excuse all the violence and destruction. <br/><br/>I'm not going to give it a 1/10 review because frankly that would be as ridiculous as 10 out of 10, in a limited way 'Fauda' works very well. I found the series to be rather limited in its outlook. To read the publicity surrounding it, you'd think they were trying for something different here?

3332,Fauda," Fauda is merely a white knight saviour, romanticised Hollywood depiction of the Israeli Occupation","Fauda is merely a white knight savior, Hollywood depiction of the Israeli Occupation of Palestine. It shows the Israelis as strong, righteous and constantly trying to tame the Palestinians -in which they're depicted as potential terrorists and untrustworthy. The Israeli undercover unit (the Duvdevan Unit or the Mostaribin unit) is an unethical unit that exploits innocent Palestinians. They have infiltrated many Palestinian homes and families and destroyed them. there are approximately 12 million Palestinians around the world, 2 million of them are trapped in Gaza for over 10 years. Gaza is not a separate entity in the region, it is an hour and a half drive from Jerusalem and a half an hour drive from Jaffa (which in international terms is an Israeli city). Most of the Gazan Palestinians are refugees from different cities in Israel. They were kicked out of their homes and forced into making refugee camps their new homes and then besieged. it's almost impossible to leave and to enter. The Israeli Defense Forces fight with their uniforms on, we fight with our civilian clothes on because we are not allowed to have a Palestinian army. This show shows war criminals as heroes, justifies the killing of innocent people. Israel has brought this upon itself, by brainwashing their soldiers and making them believe that the Palestinians are the enemy. Palestinians right to resist, to defend themselves is constantly delegitimized while Israel's war crimes are justified because, well... white supremacy. this show is aired as if it's a done deal as if the occupation has stopped and as if we are part of history. they have no right to make such a show, that is based on the lives of people that they've never even met.

In this year's humdrum of boring freshman shows and networks trying to squeeze ratings out of old worn out sitcoms on their last legs, Felicity comes across as a refreshing journey. Felicity is somewhat of a lost soul, her father has planned out her future, pulling strings to get her into Stanford to pursue a medical career. But right after graduation, Felicity asks a guy she's been eyeing for the whole time she was in high school.... Ben Covington... to sign her yearbook. What he writes genuinely touches Felicity, so she decides to pursue Ben to NYU. Many of the plotlines of the series (at least so far) almost seem to be along the lines of something found in Melrose Place or 90210, but they are handled with a sense of care, and the series achieves poignant moments comparable only to moments spent watching movies. The whole show has a movie like quality to it, each scene looks planned, camera-work brings a little extra oomph to the scenes.... This is some of the best work I've seen on television.

3337,Felicity, Loved the show except for a few things,"I absolutely loved Felicity! Although I did not watch it when it was first aired, I have watched all four seasons on DVD. The only big issues had with this show were that after the first season, I think it was they stopped having consistent sally-felicity ""tapings"". I think in season 2 felicity sent tapes to Sally, but you never heard anything back from Sally. I think for season 3, there was hardly any tapes at all! Then in season 4 you only heard Felicity sending tapes to sally again. What's up with that?Also, towards the end of season 4, it was COMPLETELY unrealistic when Ben cheated on Felicity with Claire! I mean come on- the guy goes through EVERYTHING to be with her and then just cheats on her with some dumb blonde? Ben would not do that to Felicity at that point in the show and it was really horrible that they wrote that in. Also towards the end of Season 4 when they had that whole ""back in time"" sequence, I thought that was really stupid. I mean it was just NOT felicity. I, personally am a HUGE Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan and that show is all about magic and the super natural, and I also LOVE felicity. But the thing is, the two do not collide in any way. They are completely different and they shouldn't be intertwined. I accepted it in the beginning when Meghan did those few spells on Felicity and they supposedly worked, because they were little things and it was really up to you to decide whether you thought the spells worked or not, but when they had that whole back in time thing was just too over the top- it was felicity trying to be Buffy and it wasn't pretty. I think Ben and Felicity are perfect for each other and that in the end they should be together, but the way they did it was horrible. I loved the seen when Ben came to the airport and he and felicity got back together, it was perfect. I think they should have done something like that for the ending, not felicity forgiving Ben for cheating on her like a million times. Also the whole thing about Ben getting Lauren pregnant was not so good. It was also unrealistic because since she was like 40, the chances of her getting pregnant on a one night stand were pretty slim and she was mean and TOTALLY screwed up the story line. And finally at the very end when Elena was back at the very end and when they didn't explain it was horrible. I know, I watched the DVD bonus features so I know that Matt reeves, I think it was, had to cut it out because there wasn't enough time, but this was the final episode and you can't do something that big, and not explain it. You just can't.So I am sorry I had to focus on the negatives, but there are too many positives to mention, but overall I thought Felicity was an excellent show with the above exceptions.",12 out of 15 found this helpful.,,21 March 2005

However, I was rather disappointed with the ending. Although the series revolved around the love triangle between Felicity/Noel/Ben and her inability to choose between them, I felt the ending ignored what was obvious in the ""Back to the Future"" episodes - that although she loved them both, neither Ben nor Noel were the ""right one"" for her: Noel found the love of his life, and Ben once again proved unworthy of Felicity's affections through his unfaithfulness. Felicity began the series following a girlish whim - and putting her crush before her own success - and she ended it still immature, putting someone else first. I feel that the series would have remained more faithful to its premise and mature presentation of storylines if Felicity had found the strength to stand up for herself to Ben (whose actions suggest he doesn't truly respect her)and take the next step on her own, or maybe meet someone new (remember the ending of The Wonder Years?). I felt that Felicity's situation at the end of the series was sort of sad, stuck.

3342,Felicity, I cannot believe I got sucked in,"I think I am slightly too old as the audience that the makers of this show try to reach.

Well, put aside the anomalies  such as how do these NUY students without jobs pay for their rent and cool clothes (I mean, c'mon, there is a very weak evidence any of them have jobs and if they do they get paid minimum wage and I know NYC isn't exactly the cheapest city). Well, anyway! ... it's the second season I'm watching the show and I am amazed on how much chemistry there is between the characters of Felicity and Ben. That's some fine acting. I still think Keri Russell hasn't developed the character as much as she could have (or maybe she's not allowed to?, after all they need to keep it simple for the kids) but I also think she does the job well. She's sweet (maybe too sweet) and sincere with her facial expressions. Ben is more deep and complicated and the other guy Noel is just plain easy on the eyes.

Unfortunately, their characters are, well, boring.  I'd prefer to watch a group of my own friends run around in a field for an hour.  At least that may entertain me for more than five seconds.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that the actors are quite talented, but I hasten to add that none are great shining lights, good enough to break through the severe repetition of each episode. The quirky moments the characters enter or find themselves embroiled in simply do not work.  In a quality youth-orientated show, such as that gem ""Press Gang"" (although I'm aware it's ridiculous to compare this TV show with most of today's attempts at that genre), the actors have the ability and the instinctive comic flair to make these silly moments work.  The actors on Felicity take themselves too seriously, as though they're afraid they won't be nominated for an Emmy if they crack a smile. Instead it's a wrinkle of the nose and a roll of the eyes. You can tell that these guys are ultra mature.<br/><br/>Worst of all perhaps are Felicity's 'reflective' moments.  The same thing, week in, week out, sometimes more than once an episode: Felicity leaves the college (or is it the halls of residence?), the film is slowed.  A boring acoustic guitar/female singer number is played over the top.  This is sickening stuff.  It seems that life only runs on normal time inside the walls of the college or the dorms.  The rest of the city must have broken watches.<br/><br/>As Colin Matthews of 'Press Gang' would put it: ""Boredom City""",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,,6 July 2000
3344,Felicity, Loved the show!,"I really liked ""Felicity"". I thought it was a very good show and it caught my attention at the very first beginning. The characters felt so real and I fell in love with them all. They were all so different in their own way and each one of them contributed something special to the show. Meghan's weirdness and Richard's humor worked for me! I will never forget the scene where Noel drinks that weird drink before their final exams and gets a little crazy - it always cracks me up!! I love watching reruns and I really wished I had it all on DVD. Have to get it one day - soon! ""Felicity"" was a really good show because it was actually very close to the reality of people at that age. Lots of problems that people in their early twenties deal with was portrayed on the show - for once in a normal degree.",13 out of 21 found this helpful.,,11 February 2005
3345,Felicity, started good and end horrible,"Felicity was a show about life in University. The main character was a beautiful girl who have too choice in the boy of her dreams and her soul mate. The first year was great because explain . all the university student problem, and young adult troubles (like lost the virginity, violation, obsession, relationship, ambition and frustration). the following start excellent, reinventing the show (like the ""Twilightzone"") and with more actually controversial topics  (not Russell hair cut)like the gratuity use of pill, it was also much more about Felicity than his friend  and  life in collage but end bad with a too nice  reunion of Felicity and Ben. The third one was the shorter, it was good but not long enough in that season Felicity seems very tired. However the other characters were more interesting (Elena Virgin boyfriend, the relationship of Maghan and Sean, The English girl and his violent boyfriend, the depression and goodbye of Julie, Noel's failure marriage). The last season started excellent with the leading affair with his friend. Most of the audience I think they wan to see Noel with Felicity, but the producer decide to finish with Ben.  The only good topic   of the first part was Noel depression. After Ben unfaithful, she back to the past to rescue her first love Noel. That was a funny idea but end horrible. She return to the present with Ben. Not only who choice one guy, also Elena who died in a car accident was alive with his fiancée (totally incoherent). The first season end good because the audience didn't know her choice. In the end she not only return to Ben, also she decided to stay the rest of her life with him. Most of the people wants to see in the end to see Felicity with Noel. I think that the propionate ending was a much more open mind final, where she end alone or with a third guy, because it's difficult to marry and have a nice life with your university boy/girlfriend. Maybe a good idea was when she choose Ben, then Noel left her fiancée in the church and all the story begins again. Not only end worse the whole chapter was a mess, there is not a dramatically scene between Elena (that supposed to be dead in the future) with Felicity, and the Sean Maeganhan relation end in chaos. In others time creative screenwriting's, destroy complete the end of the series with this horrible ending.

3347,Felicity, The human soul and spirit on display in a new twist of drama.,"Both cerebral and moving, this insightful drama has the capability of waking up a viewer to the world of the soul. Thematically the show centers around risks, those that we take, and those that we do not. The title character, portrayed by the beautiful Keri Russell, more often than not has story lines that allow her growing spirit to reach new heights of understanding, in a world that can be confusing and harrowing. Russell is aware of what love can do for a character, her acting ability is to be commended, because it represents the essential need for a gift of empathy and soulfulness. Her character is unique, and one who viewers should wish to get to know as her journey continues. The rest of the cast too, display a rawness to their talent that  is encouraging to see in the theatrical and film industry to date. Canadian Scott Speedman brings an intensity to his character which is quite unsettling, and Tangi Miller is both edgy and endearing as a young woman who is branching out into the adult world of temptation and desire. Amy Jo Johnson and Scott Foley provide wonderful character foils to the two leads, whether that be the intention or not, and they remain subtle in their acting techniques, as they seem to be the veterans on the show. It is nice to see some of the casts natural talents coming into the show, from Johnson's musical talents to Speedman's athletics. And all the supporting cast and guests- from an outrageous Dean &amp; Deluca manager to a Wicca Camp voyaging roomate- are superb and layered with nuanced performances. The WB should be commended for their casting, writing and directing. I am truly moved every week to watch this show, thank you for that, and best of luck in the future to come.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,,3 June 1999

3349,Felicity, Now this is what television should be,"When Felicity first aired in 1998, I was only 13 years old and lived in a little town in nowhere, Alaska that didn't have TV. So I missed out on the episodes when they were first aired.<br/><br/>It wasn't until my own Senior year of high school that I didn't have many classes to take and a lot of time on my hands before going off to college that I surfed through the channels once after we finally got satellite, to land on this show as reruns on the WE network.<br/><br/>One single episode was all it took for me to fall absolutely head-over-feet in love with this show. So many of my classmates would talk about other shows like Dawson's Creek and My So Called Life. They examined high school however, and since high school wasn't something I could relate to nor did I want to - I decided to catch a glimpse of the college experience through the eyes of artists.<br/><br/>I don't use the term ""artists"" lightly. This show not only captured pretty realistic viewpoints of what college life is actually like, but it dealt with serious issues in a way that was not over-dramatic and really heartfelt.<br/><br/>So many people like to point out that teens are always the ones with the complex lives and all the nostalgia to look back on. This show proves that its actually the people just starting the rest of their lives after high school that can really reach a place within themselves and discover who they are through ""the smallest decisions"".<br/><br/>And Felicity, not only as a character, but as a show, really takes the audience on that same journey of self-enlightenment.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,2 February 2011

It is a shame that such quality entertainment should leave the tube, and I appeal to WB for reconsidering and sticking with it for another season for the sake of keeping a good show on TV, despite the ratings slump (hey, Keri Russel can grow back her hair, and then maybe ratings will surge again).

3351,Felicity, Went from Soapy fun to just plain soapy!,"I was an avid fan of this show its first season. I suppose it had something to do with the fact that I was a senior and was on my way to college myself. Anyway, I knew that it was soapy and the whole premise was decidedly laughable, but some parts rang true like how even when we have someone who really likes us we have to go for the unattainable. Still, the show went downhill the second season by not only moving to Sundays, but by having uber-soapy scripts. The third season had momentum, but that was ruined by the return of the ill-conceived ""Jack and Jill"" and ended with a kind of thud. Undoubtedly, this show will return for many more seasons and will get worse and worse, but it was good guilty pleasure fun while it lasted.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,,21 August 2001

Real life is not really like this and neither is college. This is a nice fantasy show for people who don't have to work for a living.<br/><br/>The only real characters are Megan and Sean.

It's extremely good, even though I never expected it, while I was believing that MSCL, Party of Five and Dawson's Creek were the only teen shows that could stay on television. There's always room for one more. I witnessed some extremely dramatic and tragic scenes such as Felicity and Ben being robbbed at their own apartment or Felicity's shame as her diary is heard throughout the big party. Anyway, there were also extremely funny moments, which I never saw in teen shows, like the episode about the final exams's eve in which Noel gets really crazy when he consumes that weird drink and yells to Felicity at the study room, while those captions made for the silent conversations are displayed on the bottom of the screen.<br/><br/>It's a well done show. Not as funny as Ally McBeal or as dramatic as MSCL, but a good show nonetheless. The theme song is incredible. There could've been more scenes outside NYU, showing more places around New York itself. I don't believe Felicity stays secluded in that university never going anywhere else. Then again, like all teen shows, it's probably a low-budget show.<br/><br/>Watch Felicity at least once, even if you hate it. It's worth the effort.",5 out of 9 found this helpful.,,16 March 1999

Felicity captured my interest due to the interesting story lines and the way in which it was delivered by the actors.  I did miss most of season 1 but the story line was easy to understand.  Girl watches boy from afar then in a heart lead move changes her path to follow him.  This decision proves foolish at first but other doors open (Eg Noel) and Felicity finds herself engulfed by the realities of life.  Were as my interest stayed to follow Fecility's journey, sometimes I found the script lacking as so many story lines were started and never followed through.  I tuned into the last episode two weeks ago today and was not impressed.

3358,CSI: Miami, Horatio Caine and his crime-fighting sunglasses,"The original CSI used to be fun, before we got love stories shoved down the viewers' throats and victims wearing raccoon costumes. Preposterous, but entertaining: a different cop show.<br/><br/>CSI Miami, on the other hand, has all the flaws of CSI Las Vegas - like a penchant for overly implausible situations - without the strengths - like interesting protagonists and gripping story lines.<br/><br/>Emily Procter, Adam Rodriguez and other secondary characters are flat. The best was by far Rory Cochrane as moody Speedle, gone too soon - after Kim Delaney's Megan, who was quickly (and thankfully) written off.<br/><br/>The core of the show is David Caruso, who gives an unspeakably terrible turn as smug Horatio Caine; Horatio shamelessly chews the scenery and is so pompous and obnoxious, one doesn't know whether to incredulously shake his head or laugh at the sheer absurdity of this performance.<br/><br/>In a ludicrous amount of scenes we have a majestic shot of Horatio silhouetted against the dawn (or dusk), self-satisfaction oozing from every molecule of his body, as he puts his sunglasses on (or takes them off) in slow-motion, with a stoic smirk and a triumphant background music: all he is missing is a cape billowing in the wind. It's so cheesy that, if the show had not been trying so hard to be grandiose, it could have passed for a form of self-parody.<br/><br/>If you want to give a try to a CSI series, go for the first seasons of Las Vegas.<br/><br/>4/10",75 out of 91 found this helpful.,4.0,30 August 2007
3359,CSI: Miami, 3 for the price of one,"I guess this is, as much about exploitation of audience as it is about pleasing all corners of U.S. territory - So the next CSI would be shot on Hawaii or in Alaska. An more interesting take on the whole forensic/pathology/ballistics's, etc. idea would for instance to place it in the Victorian era in London or revolutionary France, where some of the greatest luxuries would be a ruler or a microscope; that to me would seem like a greater challenge.<br/><br/>There are three versions. I have chosen to review the Miami one since this land in the middle of the two others, although all three of them are equally naive and borderline stupid. If the reason is too present escapist, fastfood-like plots all three shows actually work quite well when you're home from work with a cold or suffer a hangover.<br/><br/>This is where all three shows fail on equal basis: 1. Forensic investigators do not run around with guns, turning the city they work in, into a Sam Peckinpah shoot out.<br/><br/>2. If any city would spend so much man power on every case, the city's economy would be ruined pretty quickly.<br/><br/>3. It would ad grit and realism if the CSI-teams failed every once in a while. When 15 minutes remain of every episode you pretty much loose interest if you haven't changed the channel already after the mandatory montage scene with electronica music pounding over the soundtrack while the investigators use q-tips and coloured liquids in different vials. Take Note: Laboratories don't look like post-modern night clubs as they do here.<br/><br/>4. If police employees would treat suspects/witnesses the way they do in all shows they would get no collaboration. If some muppet-officer would treat me the same way these teams treat people I would obstruct justice for the fun of it. They are so unlikeable (all the characters) you actually root for the bad guys to get away with the crime. They're all pretentious, rude, cold, unempathetic and unpleasant; had they been really persons they would never get into any academy unless they tried out for CCCP's KGB or Gestapo.<br/><br/>5. Why must every team leader pull this strained, cheesy one liner before every opening credit. If some prostitute is found sliced and diced in a hotel room the team leader always looks into the camera and says something like: ""That was the last time she charged you an arm and a leg.""

Do not and I repeat DO NOT confuse it with the original series. This is crap to anyone with more than 2 brain cells of use. The scriptwriters must've been recruited from a primary school - we cannot otherwise explain the lack of originality and the whole world of errors that emerge in every single episode. Clues that appears as soon as they're needed, always stupid suspects that A) are awaiting for the cops to come and arrest them; or/and B) leaving crucial evidence of a crime in the crime scene so the mighty Horatio (which is loathsome mockery with the Shakespeare's immortal Hamlet) can interfere. He is always right, he is carrying his head always climbed right so he can look more intelligent, he is carrying gun with intention to use it in every possible moment, the feelings of fear are unknown to him. There are no such things as corrupt cops and always and I mean really always the suspect is found and captured at the end with absolutely the right decision. The suspect always confess at the end, showing every possible remorse a suspect can give, leaving nothing to the judges to prove just because of the wonderful Horatio's job done. The evil is punished and the children may now go to bed. An ideal world, isn't it? The reality - there are plenty of wrong convicted persons serving time s in prison for crimes they do not commit. Showing ideal world does not help the society as whole for wrong hopes can do more harm than just showing crimes.<br/><br/>I wouldn't be so critical if this hadn't been taken itself so seriously.<br/><br/>Something to avoid.

All of them look great on disc but the colors in here are the boldest and the most spectacular of any. Each episode is a tremendous visual treat.<br/><br/>2 - I know David Caruso is a controversial topic among CSI fans because of the way he delivers his lines, but I personally find it great. It's so outrageous it's fun. Sometimes I just laugh. Hey, it makes him different from William Petersen (CSI: Vegas) and Gary Sinise (CSI: NY). I may be in the minority but I enjoy Caruso's overly dramatic delivery.<br/><br/>3 - This series has gotten better and better. I had some doubts the first year. It didn't seem half as good as the Las Vegas show, but it has improved significantly and I now rate it higher than the original CSI.<br/><br/>4 - As a guy I appreciate all the beautiful Miami women in this show, and there are tons of them, but I also think the show is geared more toward the 20-something crowd which leaves me out, being considerably older than that.

They make CSI look like super cops, about the same way Columbo and Monk make detectives look super impressive. Almost ever show is adorned with sexy guys and girls, rave music, and special effects that always go way beyond normal. <br/><br/>Most police don't have time or resources to investigate common deaths (no brainers) to the point these people show. There is such thing as a departmental budget to follow but apparently not in Miami. The pseudo science is enough to make you sick. Apparently computers can enhance a photo from a gas station camera, bounce an image off the chrome bumper of a car, and see with great detail and color, to see who the attacker was in the reflection of someones glasses.<br/><br/>If the show wasn't trying to be so serious, it would be fun to watch, like the old 1960's Adam West ""Batman"". The writers and producers of this show are not the only parties guilty of making this a bad TV series. Most of the actors are not that impressive either. The lead role of Lt. Horatio Caine by David Caruso, has his share of corny one-liners at the opening of each show. The actor says cleaver clichés, one example of this might be him arriving at the scene of an exploded bakery truck and he retorts, ""Well looks like someone made toast out of this driver."". Then he puts his sunglasses on his face. <br/><br/>There is also no ugly people.

They at least exhibit rational adult behavior, unlike Horatio who is so dramatic and unrealistic in just about everything he does. The problem is is that the 3 good characters carry the show, but they're downplayed. Seems the newby Wolfe gets more attention than the seasoned team members.<br/><br/>I agree the pictures of Miami on HDTV are exceptional, but Las Vegas is starting to show some great shots now and the acting is so much more superior from all of the team members.",31 out of 47 found this helpful.,1.0,22 September 2006
3370,CSI: Miami, The sci-fi CSI,"You know, at least when the original CSI aired, it showed a pretty standard method of crime fighting. Gather the evidence, and figure out whodunnit by hard work and elbow grease.<br/><br/>Then these spinoffs. And Miami is the worst, I call it the sci-fi CSI. In this show, they can find a cellular phone, set it on a piece of plexiglass and some mysterious technology not only accesses the phones memory but displays it on a ludicrous transparent display.<br/><br/>Im sorry, but this show is hilariously bad. I don't mind a realistic show. And I don't mind out-of-this-world sci-fi, but when you try to mix the two you end up with a show that even a 5 year old knows is ludicrous. Either go whole-hog in a realistic format fitting the current time period, or go whole-hog into a sci-fi show, using technology that we wont have for 50 years. Trying to do both is as laughable as Hackers, with 3d flybys as someone hacks a computer.<br/><br/>And please, am I the only one who absolutely hates the YEAHHHHHH at the beginning of every episode?

3372,CSI: Miami, Enough is Enough,"I've missed a few of the episodes of the current series of CSI: Miami. Initially I thought it was because I couldn't be bothered to set the video recorder, having seen the latest episode I've realised it's because this is really dreadful.<br/><br/>I think you have to take a break to realise how bad this program has become. I could originally put up with Caruso's inane posturing and the idea that he only has one character which he trots out for every performance on multiple different series and films, now however it appears that the rest of the cast is copying the style of the pregnant pause followed by the supposedly significant ""bon mot"", either that or jumping to conclusions without a shred of evidence.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned this is not just the ""poor relation"" to the otherwise excellent CSIs, it is the illegitimate and genetically damaged offspring. Please someone, put us out of its misery and dump Caruso. Miami is a fabulous setting, the other characters could become interesting again and the basic premise of the shows is tremendous, I can even put up with some distinctly ""odd"" procedure and some very doubtful science because of the interest in the characters and plots. The only plot that would interest me now for Miami is one where ""H"" is killed off and we get a professional investigator without the rampant ego, micro management style and distinctly creepy attitude.<br/><br/>Enough is enough; that was the last episode for me, I'd rather see reruns of New York or the original CSI.

3373,CSI: Miami, David Caruso has dragged this show down; it's no longer worth watching,"This is the worst dramatic show on television and I attribute most of that to David Caruso. His stilted line reading in ""dramatic whispers"", constant posing, and egotistical characterization are just AWFUL! Maybe he's a nice guy, maybe he's easy to work with, maybe he came cheap, there must be SOME reason he was hired because it surely wasn't his acting. I think he may very well be the worst actor to hold a SAG card and have a steady paycheck. His idea of acting is to say every line with a quarter turn to the camera, lift up his chin, spread his legs out overly wide and throw his hands on his hips. I'm serious; EVERY single episode, he uses exactly the same moves over and over. Apparently the directors are powerless to do anything about it. Perhaps he just can't take direction; or the producers are hiring really bad directors every week; or maybe it's in his contract that he doesn't have to listen to directors. No decent director would allow this to go on week after week. (I suspect they just throw up their hands, since Caruso appears to be completely unrepentant.)<br/><br/>It's well known that actors who work together for any length of time rise (or fall) to meet the level of the lead. A really good lead actor makes his/her co-stars look good, too. (A prime example is ""The Good Wife,"" where the secondary actors and their characters have quickly risen to meet the standard set by Julianna Margulies.) David Caruso is so bad that the other actors have no option but to meet him where he works—in the pits. I've seen many of these actors in other roles and they were excellent. Now after several years of having to work with someone who is being rewarded for bad acting, the others are slipping to his level. The line readings have become almost uniformly bad. On one episode, I would sworn that Khandi Alexander was on drugs—her reading was so bad she almost couldn't get the words out. Emily Proctor, whom I've always liked, is practically sleepwalking through her part. She is, and has proved herself, capable of soooo much better than this. As is Adam Rodriguez, who, though enthusiastic, still seems to be phoning in his lines.<br/><br/>In my opinion, writers and camera operators also rise (or fall) to the level of the characters as the actors portray them. And, BTW, does the make-up department on this show hate the actors or are they merely incompetent, too.<br/><br/>A show which wasn't great to start with has gone downhill badly and I blame it directly on David Caruso.",11 out of 15 found this helpful.,1.0,15 March 2011
3374,CSI: Miami," Emily Schloctor, The Prostitute Medical Examiner, and Dr. Cool !!","Would you believe a stone-faced unnatural blonde in spike heels, a low-cut top and a push-up bra? She's a ""real crime investigator"" in the ""real world"" of Miami. Isn't she? When she opens her mouth to speak, your ears are assaulted with a squeaky, winy, nasal monotony falling from a face covered with so much paint that it rivals that of Bozo The Clown. You keep watching with anticipation that she just might smile. And if she did, what would happen? Maybe her face would crack and the first five layers would fall off onto her spiky heeled boots, contaminating the crime scene. She enters the crime scene lab and puts on her white lab coat. Leaving it unbuttoned and open as to keep her cleavage well exposed to the air, (it must be hot in Miami) she pulls out a slide and places it under the microscope. The hippest of music starts to play as her camera-like eye probes through the lens, searching, investigating, not missing an atom or a microbe. What does she see? What is it that her brilliant Einstein-like mind has wrapped itself around? She must be a genius, or at least some kind of superior being. Isn't she?<br/><br/>How about a Medical Examiner that looks and carries herself like a prostitute? She also wears tight, low-cut tops and push-up bras as well as 10lbs of makeup. She has conversations with corpses, calling them ""Sugar"" and ""Honey"". She softly touches them and at certain points you are almost certain she is going to crawl on top of them! Maybe she'll have to in order to find out the ""real cause of death"". ""You poor sweetheart"", she smiles at the corpse. ""What is it that you're trying to tell me?""<br/><br/>What if we added a guy who is so cool that your beer would chill while he handed it to you? Hands propped on his hips in a riveting stance, sunglasses ablaze, he scans the crime scene. Now here is a ""real"" man in the real world of Miami. ""They're not going to get away with it""! And they never do! Just like his platinum blonde sidekick, he never smiles. He can't. His life and work are far too serious for such infantile trivialities. He's got a crime scene and it's a real bad situation, especially with bloody, decapitated, bullet-ridden, hacked-up corpses lying all over the place and a horny Medical Examiner crawling all over them.<br/><br/>Would you believe any of this?

3376,CSI: Miami, CSI Miami - Not the worst show ever made,"I have not seen every show ever made, but I'm sure that there have been at least 5 or 6 shows in the history of TV that have been worse than CSI Miami.<br/><br/>I saw CSI Miami for the first time last night. I thought it was stupefyingly bad. David Caruso's acting style has been the subject of numerous parodies, the way he punctuates every fifth word with an overplayed dramatic inflection (when he does his lines, he sounds as if he is reading a never ending series of voice overs for incontinence medication commercials) and the famous ""taking the sunglasses off when he does the big line"" thing. Unbelievably, Caruso did them all, over and over, in the 30 minutes of CSI Miami that I saw (I just could not watch the whole show). Doesn't this show have a director? Can't anyone restrain this guy? <br/><br/>As others have mentioned, the implausibility of the story lines is little too much to take. In one scene, Caruso is in a lab, doing all this time consuming evidence research and in the next scene he is shooting a kidnapper in the head - is the Miami PD that strapped for cash that evidence technicians are out doing the work of SWAT teams? Also, every suspect caved in and confessed when presented with a little bit physical evidence - did anyone see the OJ trial? OJ was confronted with a mountain of evidence, he stuck to his story and he is out playing golf right now. Real criminals don't confess so easily.<br/><br/>Fans of CSI Miami defend the plot holes and improbable story lines by crying artistic license. CSI Miami negotiates the gray area between serious drama and super hero sci-fi so badly that they may as well just give David Caruso a cape and have him fly from scene to scene.<br/><br/>Sorry CSI fans, I think there are better ways to kill an hour.",59 out of 107 found this helpful.,1.0,5 May 2008

The regular shots of bikini-clad eye candy are truncated to disallow audience self-pleasuring, but other than that, the elements are almost identical to the earlier, trashier show.<br/><br/>The big fall-off: Daivd Caruso and Emily Proctor. I can't remember a series in which even one actor has rivalled the zombie-like insipidity of these two losers. (On the other hand, Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx matched Caruso and Proctor's heavy-lidded sleepwalking in their work in ""Miami Vice."")

3378,CSI: Miami, Verdict; Stick to CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,"After ""discovering"" the original CSI television show, hearing great things about this spin-off, seeing its high ranking in the weekly ratings, and enjoying the pilot episode (the second season CSI episode, ""Cross-Jurisdictions""), I was really looking forward to seeing CSI: Miami. Upon viewing the first season, I found it to be pretty unfulfilling, and it left me with no desire to watch the second season. However, I decided to give it another shot and watched the second season, which I enjoyed much more than the first. While I still thought the case stories were poor, the second season was where the main characters' personal lives began to take up some of the episodes, which I found to be the best thing the series had going for it (especially the subplot of Horatio's brother and his possible corrupt ways, as well as Horatio's feelings for Yelena). But upon starting to watch the first eight episodes of the third and fourth season, I found myself getting the same bitter taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>I believe that the way the CSI writing team works is, they save all of the very talented writers who have new, fresh, and great ideas to the original CSI show, while they assign their writers with not as much flair, but the ability to turn out a script every week for the spin-off shows. The sad thing was I really wanted to like this show, and I keep going back to it, trying to give it another chance, however each time it fails to win me over. The unfulfilling and often predictable cases (the original show's cases are almost never predictable, even if there is a formula that all three shows follow), the corny one-liners that Horatio spits out before every episode's opening credits (usually spoken while putting on his sunglasses to make him look ""cool""), and the lack of flair that made the original show so good, keeps this one from making the grade. I like the character of Horatio, but David Caruso (and/or the writers) take his character a bit too far with his constant threats to suspects and caring for victims. The show focuses too much on having Horatio get into a gunfight and trying too hard to make Caruso seem like the new Rick Hunter rather than show how the science solves a case. Notice that in this show, the Miami CSI's are always the first to enter a house with their guns drawn, whereas in the original show, they always have Brass and a few uniformed officers clear the scene before they enter. The idea of using a tsunami and hurricane as the backdrop for stories were good, but they were just wasted. The only episode that I can think of which even comes near to the greatness of the original show is the first season episode ""Broken,"" about the child killer. That episode possessed some of the same shocking and original content that made the original show so great. I'll even so far to say that the sloppy handling of this show impairs my love for the original CSI. When the fifth season of CSI was released on DVD, I found myself unexcited to watch it, having just previously spent so much time giving CSI: Miami another chance. That was until I had gotten two episodes into it, and was quickly reminded just how great the original series is. <br/><br/>It's really too bad that I can't get into this show like so many others have, but I can't say I didn't give it a real hard try. And after my dislike for this show and my being unimpressed with its pilot episode, I think I'll pass on CSI: NY.<br/><br/>My personal verdict: stick to the original.",36 out of 63 found this helpful.,1.0,25 January 2006

The main reason being David Caruso, he cannot act. He is such a joy to make fun of though. But has anyone else noticed that these people only solve ONE crime an episode. The other ones solve only one crime an episode when it's like the miniature killer, or the beginning or end to a long story arc similar.

And as bad an ""over-actor"" Caruso is, Emily Procter under-acts, as if she were sleepwalking through her lines. The story was just plain silly, with a mixture of absurdly contrived situations involving a plane crash, ""billions"" in checks as cargo, a dead ex-drug addicted girl who ran a charity for other such girls, etc. The ""cops"" do no real detective work, but simply announce one plot-induced conclusion after another to ""solve"" the crime, throwing in a little psycho-cop nonsense and sexual harassment to fill in the extra space in this very thin story.

3381,CSI: Miami, Superior To The Original,"I'm gonna get creamed with e-mails from fans of the original CSI show, but I can't help it. In my opinion, CSI: Miami is superior to the original and a good foundation for (the also superior) CSI:NY.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the original is the original, but the fact that the real Miami/Dade CSI's are cops first allows this show to explode in gunfire at any moment...and place our lead, David Caruso, at the center of the action. Now I want to make something clear: Almost 15 years ago I saw some of Caruso's early work and I was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about. What makes THIS guy a sex symbol (on NYPD Blue)? Then, just as fast as he becomes a major star, he exits Blue, makes two movies that bombed (the really good ""Kiss Of Death"" and the laughable ""Jade"") and he's suddenly poison. It was after seeing Caruso in Kiss of Death and a previous film, The King of New York"" that I realized we were missing one of the last REAL tough guys.<br/><br/>CSI: Miami has brought him back. Caruso spearheads this show with a vengeance. Sure his line readings have their own stilted rhythm, but he did the same thing on NYPD Blue and people loved him then. Caruso with a gun in his hand looks more natural than anything else I have seen on TV (and my favorite show is The Shield).<br/><br/>CSI: Miami is action packed. The stories are seedier. The cinematography is unmatched by any other show. Go watch the DVDs. Tune in Monday nights.

While in interrogation, he whips off his sunglasses, flips his coat back as he puts his hands on his hips, says some smart ass remark to the criminal and then rolls off camera. End Scene. The chick that plays Calliegh is good looking, but I have seen people that have just got botox injections have more facial expressions then she does in one episode. Jonathan Togo looks like a the robotic brother of Gregg of CSI, who is constantly flawed, and the guy who plays Eric has a look on his face like he is constipated. The stories are not that good and the characters are laughable. This show is bad. To say it is better then CSI and CSI:NY someone is smoking something that impares their judgment.

3383,2 Broke Girls, Awful awful show,"One of the worst ""sitcoms"" I've ever seen in my life. I've never been compelled to write a review on a television show but with something this awful, I had to. The writers must have thought to themselves ""hey, let's create as many annoying characters as we can and cram them all into one show.""<br/><br/>Where to even start with the characters? Not one of them can act and have the most painfully awful delivery for every punchline. Everything seems forced, and the lines are recited in loud obnoxious voices that I guess is supposed to make the jokes more funny (it doesn't.)<br/><br/>The characters that are supposed to be immigrants all have terribly unconvincing accents.<br/><br/>Most of the dialogue in the script is just one rapid fire unfunny predictable punchline after another. 90% of the jokes are overly sexual in a way only middle school boys would find funny. And if they're not sexual, it's some joke based on racial stereotypes or a very obvious pop-culture reference.<br/><br/>Kat Dennings character ""Max"" only speaks in lame comebacks, delivered in her obnoxiously loud nasal voice. Her ""I'm so edgy and too cool for school and had a terrible upbringing"" act gets old really fast, especially when she mentions it every five seconds. Does this chick ever talk about anything but herself? Not only that but her and her co-star are downright rude and mean-spirited to every customer that comes in the diner. Someone can't order a water without Max or Caroline making some unnecessary rude comment and glaring at them until they leave. Is that supposed to make these characters likable?<br/><br/>And then there's Jennifer Coolidge who gets a cheer from the ""audience"" every time she enters a scene. And why?

Mainly they work as waitresses at a diner in Brooklyn, run by their boss and sometimes-nemesis Han, a likeable enough and short Korean man. Also working at the diner are crude Ukranian cook Oleg, and elderly and forgetful Earl, the diner's cashier. Finally, the other main character is Sophie, a Polish neighbour of the girls who frequently visits the gorls at the diner or their apartment. The humour of the show is very crude and in your face, but it's not pretending to be something it's not.<br/><br/>I find the show easy to watch, the story lines are not complicated and the humour is not too clever for its own good, if you want a show that's easy to get into, you can have on in the background with a few laughs guaranteed, give it a go. To be honest, the only thing I don't really like is the character of Sophie, her accent and voice annoy me and the audience cheers every time she enters the diner are slightly baffling to me. I never liked Jennifer Coolidge's characters in Friends or Seinfeld ether, maybe I'm just not a fan of hers.<br/><br/>Anyway, to summarise, it's a crude, in your face show that's pretty easy to watch with not too-confusing plot lines, and features the wonderful Kat Dennings, watch it for her and her ample bosom alone, you'll not regret it.",27 out of 38 found this helpful.,8.0,17 November 2019

Even if said women were fictitious characters in, again, a comedy TV show. <br/><br/>It's really not surprising for I have seen this happening ever since I signed up, and it still goes on, strong as ever. The level of sexism among users on this website is astounding. You can see it all over the place really, Indiana Jones -All of his movies-, above 8 stars, Lara Croft, below 6. If the main character is a woman that portrays strength in any way the reviews will be bad. It's sad but it is there.<br/><br/>To the non-narrow minded and modern individual, 2 Broke girls is hilarious, witty, unpredictable, funny, original and, unlike some other comedy shows, it won't bore you. <br/><br/>And to the bitter people whining about it being ""shoved down their throat."" Nobody is holding you at gunpoint, if you don't like it don't watch it, find something useful to do with your obviously copious spare time. This show is being sold all over Europe and it will won't be cancelled any time soon. Ha, ha.",121 out of 206 found this helpful.,8.0,19 February 2016
3392,2 Broke Girls, Still haven't laughed once,"I honestly have only seen a handful of episodes so if this is a show that is mainly plot driven, I may have missed it (i sincerely doubt it). Here are a few observations about what the writers/producers of the show think: raunchy = automatically funny, saying raunchy jokes louder make them automatically funny, delivering cue-card punchlines in an 80's fashion is still funny. I hear the ""punchlines"" and the laugh track and constantly find myself saying ""was that supposed to be the punchline?"". I like every brand of humor and am extremely easy to please in the humor department, and this show is completely unfunny. I really like Kat Dennings too and was hopeful for this show, but there are only 4 reasons this show is somehow still around: each girl has two of them.

The characters are flat as well as the comedy! A comment was made about the actors look like they are reading from cue cards and I 100% agree! The lines usually have nothing to do with nothing!

The canned laughter punctuates the mindless rhythm of the inane witterings as it drones on and on and on and on and on...

I mean, the plot is not supposed to be plausible, it's supposed to be comedy, and a feel good show, and that's exactly what it is, with a little cynical twist added from Kat Dennings. Kat Dennings run the show, and she is the main reason I follow this series. For people who like Kat Dennings kind of humor, this is a show for you, where she gets to play a little more freely with her puns than she has been able to do previously in movies and other shows. I love it!It might not be a very popular show, like Glee or all these other vampire shows that people are into now, but that's why I like it, it's plain and simple, back to old school stories of the rich and the poor, but I'm not gonna be surprised if this is one of those shows that aren't gonna be around for long since it's not main stream popular.

3396,2 Broke Girls, on the good side of mediocre...,"It's not bad... It's not good. It's exactly what it needs to be. Very okay. <br/><br/>Lots of sex jokes, sometimes cheesy, sometimes raunchy but most of the times enjoyable. The actresses that play the lead roles are perfectly cast. Especially Kat Dennings, who, even with material that isn't always up to par, lights up the screen with her wonderful, sensual, charismatic, yet sometimes almost painfully sarcastic and bitter sense of humor. <br/><br/>I don't know. I've watched a lot of episodes of season one, and somehow I just keep watching whenever I need some harmless, simple humor. I think that this show completely proves that good leads really can carry a show and capture an audience. It's just a sweet concept, literally, with the cupcakes and all, and it's a warm show, made with some love and fun. I'm not impressed by it but I like it. At the moment it's the only comedy show I watch. Much better than a lot of other crap out there. Maybe not as good a some shows, like modern family and community or 30 rock. It's not brilliant in any way, it's not new and original in any way, but you really feel for the characters, maybe not right away but after a few episodes you start appreciate them. <br/><br/>This sounds like such a ""meh..."" review, but it's really not. Beth Behrs, who I really haven't seen in anything else, portrays the part of the naive rich girl who just landed in the gutter just fine and endearing. It's a joy to see Jennifer Coolidge working again, she's just wonderful in portraying ""over the top"" characters, sometimes I almost feel ashamed that a movie and TV fanatic like me likes her, but hey, everybody has their guilty pleasures. At the moment 2 broke girls is mine.

None of them convinced me to watch it. One day, there was nothing on the television except for the pilot of 2 broke girls, so I decided to give it a shot. After watching the pilot, I was hooked! It is such a funny show! The jokes are funny, and easy to understand, so that you aren't watching wondering why the audio audience is laughing. Also, I love how the show is realistic. The show is about two girls, one lives in Brooklyn and has two jobs to survive, one as a waitress as a dinner and another is a nanny for a wealthy family. The other girl is a spoiled rich girl who lost all her money due to her fathers schemes.

I still have my doubts with Behrs, but let's hope her acting stands up for herself and Kat doesn't overshadows her role. Recurring characters may ad some good stories as well. Probably everything will spin around the two girls by now, but I hope the creators are able to develop other people roles, like Oleg the Russian chef, he's got potential.

I was shocked when I was flipping through the channels and saw this show; I honestly don't understand why it's still on the air. I watched it to see if anything had changed since the first season. Nope! The acting, if you can call it that, by the two main actresses is horrendous. Speaking very loudly and looking like you're trying really hard not to look at the camera (or worse, looking like you're reading off of cue cards off-set) is not acting. The jokes are not funny and you can see them coming a mile away. Put this thing masquerading as a situation comedy out of its misery!<br/><br/>Think I'll stick with Mom and reruns of when The Big Bang Theory was good (aka Season 1).",51 out of 96 found this helpful.,1.0,12 December 2016
3403,2 Broke Girls, Contains more broke girls than laughs,"Oh dear. I've tried with this show, I really have. For some reason, I keep going back to it and giving it one more shot, but every time I end up disappointed. Surely, at some point, we're going to get a proper laugh out of this, right? I'd settle for a snigger. Or even a brief ""Hah!"" moment. But nothing.<br/><br/>The premise seems sound enough: Streetwise but poor kid working two jobs meets silver spooner who's had all her wealth stripped thanks to her daddy getting caught for embezzlement. Cue the interest as these two girls, poles apart, develop their friendship through a variety of classic sitcom-style outlandish situations, with some laughs along the way. How hard can it be to make a mess of that?<br/><br/>Apparently, not very hard at all. And I'm sure Max would come back with some largely unfunny joke based on the inevitable double-entendre.<br/><br/>Thing is, as much as I'd like to enjoy the show, it just misses every single time. Max, who is supposed to be streetwise, is merely rude. Then there's Caroline, who looks desperately like someone who wants an inroad to the show, but is perpetually denied. Between them, they rattle through their dialogue at the speed of sound, with a delivery as wooden as Sherwood Forest and a vocal pitch which my dog finds deeply disturbing.<br/><br/>And to add even more to the quagmire, we have some lovely racial stereotypes: a token Black guy, a Ukranian man (played by an American), an Asian man (played by an American, but at least is of Asian origin) and a Polish woman (played by an American). Most of the ""jokes"" seem to revolve around either poking fun at these characters, or the characters themselves indulging in a bit of poking fun at themselves. And when they're done doing that, it's on to the innuendo and blatant sex references. Wow, it's like being back in the Seventies!<br/><br/>But wait, there's more: Because the script is so weak and obviously being read from a teleprompter (and thus removing any need to act), it's not funny. So to crank up the fun factor, everybody shouts. And just to make sure we never miss a ""gag"", there's masses of canned laughter piped indelicately over the top.<br/><br/>There's room for a recurring plot here, with the cupcake business. But all they ever do is talk about it. Why don't we see where they're going with it, aside from the cash display before the end credits? And where's the character development? Oh, wait, that's not going to happen with such one dimensional characters.<br/><br/>Oh, and one last thing: Jennifer Coolidge. Aside from the hugely annoying ""whoop"" she gets when she appears - no, wait, I'm not parking that one. Why? Why does she get that? Because she was Stifler's Mom? Or am I missing something? She's not Fonzie, she's a bit part. Pack it in! Anyway, aside from that, can someone please explain where her Polish accent is from? I've heard plenty of Poles talking (we have a fair number live in my area) and none of them sound like she does.<br/><br/>And a final last thing - promise! - how has this show got a rating of 7? Almost every review rates it lower than I have!<br/><br/>I can't understand how a show as engaging, warm and genuinely funny as ""My Name Is Earl"" can get canned so easily, while dross like this is allowed to carry on unabated. I miss that show, because I want to know what happens next. But this one? Well, we don't worry about that, because nothing is happening at all.<br/><br/>EDIT: Having read a few more reviews, it seemed I'd been trying with the wrong end of the show. So I found an online source with the first season and started watching. And they were right, it's much better! I enjoyed the character progression in the first few episodes and now feel like I've got a better understanding of the characters, especially the two girls. Watching Max's initially wobbly relationship with Caroline and the way she bonds with Chestnut shows off a softer, more emotional side, that you just don't see in the later seasons.<br/><br/>The writing is a bit tighter and there's a few laughs to be had. Not many, but a few. And yes, there's still way too many sex jokes. But there is something there that's at least worth 20 minutes of your time and for that I have increased the score to 3 stars. Just don't get too invested beyond the first season.",50 out of 94 found this helpful.,3.0,6 February 2015

Kat Denning(Max) has an irritating voice that could be put to good use if she could act. She has a few funny one-liners, but she sounds like she is reading her lines. Jennifer Coolidge(Sophie) has been a very funny character in movies, but I can't put my finger on why she is so bad in this TV show. The men-(Earl, Oleg and Ha Lee) are not likable. The only redeeming character may be Beth Behrs(Caroline). She can actually act. There are some humorous moments and that is why I rated it a 3. I wish I could give it more because of the few times when it has some comedy that is appealing. Great premise but missing the mark.

3417,Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, A perfect example of how damaging milking a popular franchise can be,"While I enjoyed the amazing story,action and depth on Naruto and Naruto Shippuden,I can't describe how awful and boring Boruto can be. The characters are carbon copies of the previous story,but while in Naruto series each character had depth and an amazing story background,where each villain was likable in a certain degree,Boruto completely lacks this. The main series for the series sucking so bad is ,according to its fanbase 'not enough episodes ',which I disagree completely as over 20 episodes have passed(since I'm writing this review) and absolutely nothing happened. You can compare the (lame) quality of this series by comparing it with the 20 episodes of Naruto/Naruto Shippuden. In Naruto,the main characters already learn some skills,almost die,and quite a bunch of character die too (major and minor roles) leaving a deep emotional impact and making you amazed at the main characters personal development. In Naruto Shippuden first 20 episodes again,the stakes are huge,an entire country is in peril and some major characters die while in Boruto nothing happens,no one learns any new skills and there isn't any major treat or character development(except the power of friendship if you wanna count that) . Someone on youtube even made a video of all the action that happens in over 20 hours of screen time in Bouruto:an underwhelming 8 minutes of fighting from over 20 hours,out of which 7 minutes are Boruto using his shadow clones to fight.

Boruto scraps that all away and puts a ton of filler and when the canon events appear they're usually under performing. Moving on to unoriginal, if you compare boruto to both parts of naruto youll notice their children havent really developed their own skills, just copies of their parents and also the plot is so shallow it signifies nothing no symbolism, no philosophy, no talk no jutsu, they threw that all out and made it a barney kids show. I just explained how it lacked depth, but still this isnt written by the original author of naruto and its not performing too well in the anime industry so what i suggest is dropping the anime and watch the better anime out there and if you really like boruto read the manga it isnt as awful as the anime but still underperforms.",71 out of 112 found this helpful.,1.0,11 January 2019

3426,Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, An UTTER WASTE OF TIME,"Honestly, a disgrace to anime and Naruto. This series has no good story, humor, or anything linked to the impact Naruto has had in our hearts. It's an utter waste of time and I hope the creators look into this.<br/><br/>Moreover, the animation is just poor and looks very very ugly, almost hard to watch. At this time when we have good animes like Black Clover and Boku No Hero Akademia, I wonder how do the creators of Boruto expect to have any competition when they keep living in the shadow of the success behind Naruto.",38 out of 63 found this helpful.,1.0,25 December 2018

I never saw any of the movies the other reviewer is talking about, hence, for my taste, all of the characters fit in nicely in this tale: Cassie with her confidence and words of wisdom always spot on, her daughter Grace always very exact on the course of action, even the mayor is a pleasant villain. It is the only show right now that I cannot wait for a few episodes to accumulate to watch them.

3437,Good Witch, I really enjoy the show and would hate to see it go.,"I have read the reviews so far, and I disagree with most of them. I have been and always will be a fan of the movies, I loved every single one of them. I have been hoping that they would make it into a series and I am so glad that they have. I realize that many things have changed, but life changes so why shouldn't the stories change as well? I do wish that they could have dealt with Jake's death a little bit more, but, come on people, we all know it is a show and you can not force someone to do a series when they can't or won't so how could they have handled it better? Iam just glad that they were smart enough to not replace him with someone else, I think that would have been worse. <br/><br/>I am enjoying the series and look forward to it each week. As with any series they have to work on things and it will just keep getting better. I think many are not giving it enough of a chance yet. As for those who think it is overly sweet and things, I agree with the person who reviewed it and said that it is a nice change from the crap that is on TV these days. It is nice to see a show that everyone can watch and that just tries to show that acting nicely and responsibly are good things. I am so tired of reality TV and all the drama and crud that is on now days this is a very welcome change.

3440,Good Witch, Delightful,"Cassie is a magical woman. Not in the tradition of Samantha or Sabrina. It is hard to say that anything that would be considered true magic ever occurs. Cassie does have a habit of appearing out of nowhere, of knowing who is there before she sees them, and of saying just the right thing to make a ""coincidence"" happen where it is needed. This was true in the movies as in the TV series.<br/><br/>The TV series starts out rather abruptly if you didn't see any or all of the movies. Brandon, Cassie's stepson, is being separated from his wife. Lori has a background of storytelling, if not outright reporting, that leads her back to the town newspaper.<br/><br/>Yes, Cassie is magical in the sense of being a wise and discerning woman who is both beautiful and loving. Cassie is the definition of optimistic. She wants to give everyone a chance, even long past where others would.<br/><br/>The TV series is a welcome addition to the Hallmark lineup after having been a fairly regular annual TV movie tradition.",13 out of 15 found this helpful.,9.0,7 April 2017
3441,Good Witch, Not normally a series watcher - But love this,"I am a big fan of the movies, (wish Hallmark would make a while box set of all of the movies together) I was very excited that a weekly series was created.<br/><br/>I miss some of the old characters but have been pleasantly surprised with the new additions. I was sad to see Jake not on the show but with his character gone it leaves way for a new plot - where this is home for Cassie and a new home for a stranger. Some reviews were against the loss of Jake and feel the plot is the same as the movies. I have watched every episode and been left with cliffhangers that make me return each week. - give it a chance- its a series and will have more entertainment value weekly instead of waiting for one movie once a year.<br/><br/>I will miss the movies as they did have a magical charm about them, but was more focused on how Cassie was able to influence outcomes.<br/><br/>But..... I am glad to see a weekly show where you get to see Cassie influence people on a more long term wide-scale base.<br/><br/>Grace is definably a great character add to the show. It will be fun to see her grow with Cassie's guidance - or family-frenemy Abigale :) I always loved the bond Cassie and Lori had from chasing monsters away to cleaning up Abigale's ""help"". I am happy to see Lori came home and is a part of the family again.<br/><br/>The character Sam is good for Cassie - he challenges her in a way nobody has and I feel his time as her neighbor will help her grow as a person and a parent.<br/><br/>The series is more about the characters than the magical charms - that was the spirit of the movies, I hope they show a little more witchy-woo I cant wait to see whats next!

3442,Good Witch, I love it!,"I just starting watching after Jake's death, after it started up again, and I love it. I know it's hard when you get used to a storyline, and then there is a significant change. Those of you who didn't want Jake to die, don't stop watching, keep an open mind. This is still a great show. There are so few of these types of programs on TV these days that a parent can watch with a child. This is something that I completely enjoy, and my ten year old daughter does as well. It definitely holds her interest. I love the mysterious aspect of it, and so far I love all the characters. Truly a refreshing change from a lot of the garbage on TV these days. It's sad to see how well all those Disney shows full of family dysfunction are doing.

3444,Good Witch, Delightful Cringe,"Instead of giving a traditional in-depth review of the series, I will just discuss a few elements of it which I personally find hilarious (without the creators intention) and are part of the reason that someone like me would even watch this series (although Netflix just forced me). Also, I have never seen any of the original movies, so there are no anchors in the past for me, just what I have seen in the series. <br/><br/>1) Cassie. Cassie is the main character and wants to do good for everyone. She is the ""good witch"". It is indicated that she sees some things before they happen or she knows a few things about people without them saying anything, but that is as far as it goes. Her ""magical powers"" are kept very minimal. However of course, she indulges in some hocuspocus clichés, such as ""herbal medicine as a cure for almost everything"". People seek her out for advice and she is not shying away from giving it. All conversations end with some nondescript, generic and pseudo-deep one liner like ""Sometimes we all need a bit of this and that"" and then the camera focuses on her face trying to squeeze a ""mysterious"" smile through those collagen injected lips. Naturally, this is always the revelation the person in need has been looking for. This really cracks me up every time. While this is just silly, it is dwarfed by the fact that Cassie behaves like an undecided teenage girl standing between two (even three at times) men, while portraying a really wise, older widowed women with supernatural powers. No, this doesn't make her ""look human"" it just makes her look ridiculous. <br/><br/>2) Bell, Book and Candle. Being perhaps one of the continuously funniest things in the series, BB&amp;C is the store that is owned and run by Cassie. It's portrayed as a huge deal and the ""go to place"" for almost everyone with any kind of issue and/or need. Examining this store a bit closer is just marvelous. It is a hopeless amalgamation of new-age paraphernalia, like candles, crystals, vials, tacky decorative items, cheap jewelry and even a few textile items. It is not even organized like a store – bottom line: it is the kind of place that has almost nothing that almost anyone would ever want (even for free) and yet, it is always ram-packed with customers. Seriously, when I see the shop coming into a shot, I am smiling already. <br/><br/>3) John the Archaeologist. An old time friend (lover?) of Cassie, John is a professor of archaeology. He is adventurous, tall, muscular and handsome with a slightly smug twinkle in the corner of his eye. Also, he wants Cassie and is not subtle about it. For the audience to believe that he is actually a distinguished academic is about as likely as to believe that last Halloween my cat was actually a real lobster. The plumber boyfriend of another character in the series would have been a more credible choice. Another delightful reality-twister that never fails to entertain. <br/><br/>In summary, next to the small hints at supernatural forces in play, the series is rattled with elements that might be possible by the laws of physics, but are at the end of the day as fictional as clairvoyance providing actual insight or an incantation causing any consistently observable material interaction. Somehow it works though, it kept me watching. To be blunt – the series is really, really stupid. So stupid in fact, that I have to think the creators are kind of aware of this and just as amused as I am by it. There are so many delightfully cringy moments in this, how could one not be captivated?",85 out of 129 found this helpful.,3.0,30 October 2016

3448,Good Witch, So sickeningly sweet I developed type 2 diabetes about 15mins in,"Good God, my teeth started to hurt from watching a few minutes of this show, its so cute and sweet it almost made me angry. This feeling soon passed as my brain went into damage control mode powering down all non essential functions like the ability move, a single tear rolled down my cheek as I accepted the fact that I was actually going to watch this visual corn syrup to the end. Little did I know that this wasn't a 20min episode with a few breaks in the middle type of deal, OH NO NO!! <br/><br/>What this show lacks in any form of entertainment it more than makes up for in LENGTH!! Sweet baby J it just doesn't stop. So I jabbed a insulin pen in my arm and powered through the next 4 hours to see whats it all about, well it felt like 4 hours. To be honest after a while I blacked out every time a Hallmark moment was jammed through my eyes and ears and they come thick and fast so I was out for large portions, so my review might be a bit patchy with details but believe me I felt the full force of the Hallmark message. That message being ""Hey science doesn't know everything and if we all wiggle our noses and click our heals maybe a little magic will happen to you to, Awwwwww"". <br/><br/>In truth watching a week of this tripe would have a similar effect as a frontal lobotomy. Sure the occasional bit of drool may slip out the corner of your mouth and run down your chin BUT hey, you'll look happy, always smiling, for no reason, much like our leading actress. <br/><br/>With her one expression, that ""I know something you don't"" look. She always looked so pleased with herself like she had just farted in a room full of people and stood there smiling at everyone seeing who was going to smell it first. She thoroughly annoyed me. Shows like this don't promote alternative medicine it just enforces the preconception that they all sell snakeoil and cure-alls. <br/><br/>There is not one redeeming element in the entire show, the flogged to death story lines and plots. The loss of a father figure, the caring step mom (Because you are all my children now), The wayward son returning home to fill the absent fathers shoes, the go getter big city reporter realises a small town paper is where her hard hitting editorials will have the most impact. <br/><br/>And worst of all the daughter/clone of the witch mother has inherited supernatural gifts for knowing things like, who's calling on your phone, I'll just look at my phone if I want to known who is calling thanks. <br/><br/>Maybe a quick heads up to your old dad that he was about to be killed might have been handy. It never really works like that does it, because that might prove something. Ahhh proof the incurable cancer to anything faith based. For example why are the dead always so vague, they never know there own name, sure they know what it sounds like but nothing specific, ""Is it Ben, Ken, Kevin, Karl? ANTHONY!!! Yes yes its all so clear now"". <br/><br/>Please please save yourself from this candy covered calamity of a show. Avoid if you value your brain cells and or time. If you want to punish a friend suggest it to his girlfriend for movie night other than that I see no reason any intelligent human being would ever watch this utterly dreadful mess. It was my own fault for watching it, much like my twice yearly McDonalds, I know I will feel like crap, sick and angry for ingesting this muck but we all want a bit of dirt every now and again and ""The good witch"" was my twice yearly TV junk food.......",98 out of 171 found this helpful.,1.0,14 March 2015

It's also nice to find that Cassie's work has become more professional. Without giving too much information away, Cassie's skills as a healer have been enhanced. She's a wonderful match for the new doctor in town. The children are growing up, acting more sure of themselves. The original Brandon was wonderful. He must have moved on to new challenges.

3452,Good Witch, Was searching for a redeeming quality because this is rated too highly on IMDb,"I believe that since I never saw the Good Witch movie, I was never initially invested in the characters or their lives. Therefore, seeing that Netflix had matched me with this TV series, I decided to check it out since I enjoy fantasy-like and whimsical-type shows. <br/><br/>I can honestly say that I feel as if I wasted a bit of my life trying to discover why it was/is rated so highly on IMDb. The plot lines are not very interesting. It seems to be a show about nothing of significance--empty, if you will. Specifically, the episode plot lines are remedied quite lazily--Brandon and his wife always on the verge of splitting, but always conveniently realizing what they mean to each other by the end of the episode. <br/><br/>I also don't feel that Cassie exhibits much witchy power at all, and for a series deemed ""Good Witch"" she doesn't seem very magical besides that of her herbal abilities and premonition (dejavu). Backed by her never ending list of spoken clichés, her character is so completely flawless that I find her uninteresting. <br/><br/>I'm going to go ahead and give this show a review that it deserves.",33 out of 55 found this helpful.,3.0,21 April 2017

3455,Good Witch, The spell has been broken,"The Good Witch movies were marvelously magical, mysterious fun. The whole town of Middleton was infused in that magic and the characters were warm and interesting. And their interactions with each other were meaningful. Life was cozy and safe in these movies despite the dangers and problems that cropped up. The magic and the love seemed to fix everything at the conclusion of each one.<br/><br/>The TV series is unsettling because so much, too much has changed and the magic spell has been broken. Jake's death is just too depressing for the series to recover from. The addition of Bailee Madison as Cassie's now-teen-aged daughter is just jarring. She and Cassie just lack chemistry. One of the things that made the first few movies so charming was that Brandon and his sister were little kids and Cassie has such a sweet rapport with children. Perhaps this all would have worked out better had they made Grace younger and more vulnerable in this series. As it is Grace's teen-aged life is just too clichéd and uninteresting. The young man that plays the doctor's son is dour and seems to lack personality. And so many of the young men in the show seem to look alike and I had trouble telling them apart. I was confused about the real estate agent being Cassie's best friend as prior to this we had not seen him in any of the movies.<br/><br/>The doctor himself seems to be a boring and grim character, devoid of the sweet boy-next-door charisma that Jake had. And it was always so much fun to watch his comedic interactions with his deputy and the mayor. A lot of the humor left the series with Jake. And a lot of the heart.<br/><br/>Why was Brandon's character replaced with a different actor? Where is George's wonderful wife Gwen? With all the town now so steadfastly behind Cassie what will the story lines revolve around? I found that the story in this episode was weak and lackluster. Cassie had very little opportunity to show off her magic. I am more than a little sad that they have potentially ruined a really wonderful thing that appealed to so many people. Moving 10 years ahead and removing Jake put everything off-kilter and out of focus. I continue to hope that the vague way in which they described Jake's demise means that he is not really dead after all, hence the candle that re lit itself at the memorial service. I will continue to watch but with a heavy heart.",51 out of 92 found this helpful.,,3 March 2015

3458,The Secret Life of the American Teenager," Unrealistic, stereotypical","As a teenager--15 years old, in fact, the same as the main character--I have to say this is an awful, unrealistic, cardboard-cutout teenage drama program. While I understand the thinly veiled message of abstinence, it is not brought forth in a intelligent or believable manner. If we're old enough to have sex, I think we're old not to be pandered and talked down to, which seems to be the primary aim of the show. Amy, the main character, is a shallow, boring, sour character. The show's attempts to make her seem remotely geeky or normal at all tend to fall flat, and in general the plot and character development of all of the characters is very poor indeed. The script comes off cheesy and overdone, the acting is terrible, and it's really just a show of stereotypes, not interesting, complex people. Not real people.

There are plot holes all over the place, and most things are never explained. Remember Rumer Willis? Who, what, where, when, wtf? Amy's dynamic with everyone just sucks, especially with Ben. According to them, they were in love after like two minutes. (A side note, the world love is tossed around excessively on this show, along with sex, funeral, baby, etc.) If they are so madly in love, why do they seem to hate each other? Another thing that bugs me is how nonchalant the parents are about their young children having ""serious' relationships. Just because you are a high schooler does not mean the only thing you think about is sex/omg I need a boyfriend!

3460,The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Absolutely ridiculous,"I watched this show just because of a tiny little interest, and have been astounded on how ridiculous and nonrealistic it is.<br/><br/>Amy, the main character (a fifteen year old) is pregnant. In the wake of the popularity of ""Juno"", this show caught a wave because of its seclusive title and snapshot of its pregnant main character. The surrounding backstory with her family and friends includes the typical silly soap opera plots: everyone cheating/sleeping with each other, growing up, identities, blah blah blah. The Christian stereotype of the bouncy blonde cheerleader is especially reminiscent of ""Saved!"" characters. <br/><br/>I am most frustrated with Amy's character. She is clueless, foolish, and naive, with no distinct other personality traits. She accidentally slept with someone, oh no, here comes baby. She thinks it'll go away if she forgets about it (how can anyone be that stupid?). And when the poor sap Ben comes along, groveling at her feet, she seemingly has no interest, even when he rushes the ""i love you's."" He finds out she lied to him, is having some other dude's baby, and what does he do? Of course, he proposes to her! How romantic, and he even says he'll pretend the baby's his! This show unfailingly portrays teenagers as foolish and aimless, with half baked goals and impulsive decisions. Amy expects her mother to take care of her baby, doesn't think she needs to get a job, and thinks she'll live happily ever after with her non- baby daddy. Of course its that easy, just pop out a child, you're mother will take care of it, you don't need a job either! I am sad for the audience of this show, if young girls watch this and take it to heart, what kind of message are they taking away? It takes no steps to give any teenagers credit. All of the characters combined have an IQ of 40.<br/><br/>This show should not be as popular as it is. This is sad, America.",68 out of 85 found this helpful.,1.0,7 January 2009

ALL of the characters.<br/><br/>It's nothing but stereotypes, and really bad dialogue. And unrealistic in regards to what life as a teen really is like.

3462,The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Without a doubt the worst thing on TV,"I'm sorry, but how much money did ABC Family have to pay the New York Post to call the show ""beautifully written"" when it truly is anything but. Brenda Hampton has no sense of what a teenager really acts like, all she seems to go on is stereotypes from other shows/movies. Grace is the overachiever who wants to go to med school: of course she's pretty and blonde. Adrian is Hispanic/Latina, of course she's the school hussy, and of course she has a mother who is never around. Jack is on the football team, so of course he'd be dating Grace. Amy is such a waste of a character. No teen is that naive, unless they have some sort of metal disability, and no: I am not dogging on the mentally disabled. Ricky is actually the only character that I could possibly see as a real teen. Ashley's personality doesn't fit the girl playing her, at all. Is she monotone, or is that her voice for the character? She's a very pretty girl and I do hope she can shed this image of Ashley.<br/><br/>The only reason why ABC Family picked up this show is because all the ten year old girls are watching it. And can we be serious for a second? Why do you think this airs on ABC Family and not ABC or the CW? Everyone tries to pinpoint ""Oh this is a family show, this is great for ABC Family!"" Not really, if Secret Life had good writing, then maybe another network would have picked it up. Brenda Hampton sold the show to ABC Family because they're so desperate for ratings they'll pick up anything that they hope will make them money. Oh and another thing, the Network acts as if Secret Life is some record breaking hit for TV. It really isn't. The pilot averaged 1.2 million viewers. That's hardly anything to the big Networks like Fox or NBC. Hell, even The CW has better ratings! The reruns of Gilmore Girls get just as good ratings from my last comparison, and that is a show that's syndicated.

As a female who not that long ago was a teen, I felt like I was hurting the human race by giving this ratings. What a way to put down American teens. This is NOT the secret life of the American teenager. What a way to generalize. The main character Amy is made out to be some innocent damsel in distress who gets pregnant her very first time with a guy. While yes you can get pregnant your first time. Most teens who have kids have had sex more then once. Most of them, though made stupid decisions also weren't as naive as Amy. It's insulting. Teens know how to get pregnant and they certainly know how NOT to get pregnant. It is a choice they're making. This show makes Amy out to be so innocent she didn't know she was having sex. What??? I can hear teens now using that excuse after seeing this. Why are guys always the jerks. They make it seem like all of the problems on the show are the fault of the male characters. The female characters eat up everything the male characters feed to them as if they are so easily coaxed and have no minds of their own. They make the male characters to be out only for themselves with nothing else on their minds but to coax these ""innocent"" females who don't know any better. Please, females aren't stupid.

3464,The Secret Life of the American Teenager, The oversimplified and unrealistic life of an American Teenager,"Wow. This show was pretty bad. I was hoping the show would dig deep and find true secrets and struggles teens go through, but it was just so bland, predictable, and unrealistic! First of all, that is not how teens talk! It felt very scripted the whole time and didn't reflect how teenagers truly interact. In the 1st episode when Amy's friends find out she is pregnant, the pauses in their conversation and reactions are not how people would react. once they find out, they kind of carry on as if the news wasn't a HUGE shock to them.<br/><br/>Secondly, Ben and Amy's relationship is so....just...things don't work like that. He claims he loves her and barely knows her and shes totally fine with it. I find that HIGHLY creepy and obsessive. When 15 year olds claim they ""love"" each other, they're just saying it because they think its the thing to do.<br/><br/>Lastly, I really hate how they never let you figure things out. The script just goes and and tells you what happened. It would've been much more interesting if you had to figure out and got subtle clues that Ricky was sexually abused as a kid, but in the 1st episode, they just go out and say it. Instead of thinking and being engaged with the show, you are just spoon fed interesting information.<br/><br/>The show is okay, just not something I would follow.

It's attempting to capitalize on the subject from ""Juno"" only in a clumsy and completely un-entertaining way.<br/><br/>First of all, as a 26 year old woman, I can't relate my teens to any of these characters. Amy as the main character is the most unreasonable and unbelievable. Yes, teenagers have sex. And yes, some get pregnant. I'll even give in that a 15-16 year old might make many mistakes such as ""pretending it's not happening"" or continuing to date a guy even though she's starting to show.<br/><br/>However this Amy is not likable, has no personality, and is poorly developed as a character by the writers.<br/><br/>The episode that ended it for me was the 4th, where parents laughed over the young Christian girl defending herself against two men trying to abduct her, and she was the one punished for being out, rather than her parents being grateful that she was strong enough to defend against two predatory men. Only furthering the complete fallacy of what would REALLY happen in EVERY scenario this show presents. Not to mention, said girls parents making remarks against Amy and her pregnancy completely breaking doctor/patient confidentiality.<br/><br/>The show is gross. I can handle a show about teenagers having sex (because, lets be honest, many are) - but this is not only vanilla coated to try it's best to be ""family friendly"", making it all that much more inaccurate in every sense - dialogue, storyline, character development, etc.<br/><br/>Definitely one to skip.",81 out of 116 found this helpful.,2.0,1 August 2008

Instead of actually educating teens about sexuality, it makes sex a dirty thing, and further represses healthy sexual growth. In the second episode, when the counsellor tells Ben that whatever a woman does before she meets you is none of your business i was actually positively surprised. But then he follows with saying that thankfully she probably feels ashamed and guilty (about having done ""anything"" with Ricky)-making it okay. So let's make teens feel guilty about sex! How ridiculous is that? Also, i hate the fact that the two sexually active people (Ricky and Adrien) are portrayed as ""broken"" sociopathic individuals. This is not a healthy example for young people, i think it is much more relevant to make sexuality a matter open for discussion, about enjoyment, love, and safety.

Yes, some teenagers have sex and get pregnate, but not every sentence is about who's doing who, when they do it, why their doing it, who wants to be doing it...come on. Every line in this show is about sex. And that is completely inaccurate.<br/><br/>The character of Amy is also unreasonable and irritating...she always seems on the verge of tears...why Ben loves her I don't know. Her mother is useless and is too wrapped up her own sex life. The only character I can stomach is Adrian because she is not as fake as everyone else and I especially can't stand Grace.

No teenagers I've met talk about sex that much, nor are they this stupid. I am sure that teenagers do not think about marriage, and their immediate reaction to pregnancy would probably be abortion. The only seemingly reasonable adult is Amy's mom, but then again, I haven't seen all of the episodes. But overall, my least favorite character is the school counselor. He's too unrealistic and stupid. No school would give a student a schedule change in order to chase after a girl, and he never discourages sex, he just goes along and pretends to be friends with the students. He doesn't really seem like an authority figure. All the characters either lack personality or extreme stereotypes, and badly acted ones at that.

Secret Life runs over you with a steamroller. Then, they back up over you and do it again, and again, and again, and OH Dear yet again. Aside from the flat, stereotypical, unlikable characters (yes, they even made a kid with Downs Syndrome a sex-obsessed total jerk too), they drone on and on about the only thing that is on any of their narrow minds. For fun, I counted the number of times they use the word ""sex"". It was 17 times just in the scenes from previous shows. For the show itself, the total was around 40 - including references to oral and anal sex as well as a mother recommending masturbation to her daughter. Of course, one must suspend disbelief while watching a fictional program, but how much can you hold back the urge to scream BULLS**T when a teenage boy tells his girlfriend that he wants to ""have sex"" for the fourteenth time in one episode. No teenage boy EVER got what he wanted by whining ""I wanna have sex"", yet this clown is climbing off of her in the very next scene. People DO NOT live this way. Although my daughter will not miss this show, I can see how one with no life experience might overlook the bizarre departure from reality.

I'm sure there are so many other talented young actresses out there who can show a little bit more emotion than just staring intently with a sour face. The girl who plays Ashley has one look, blank, and when she changes her mood all that happens is her voice gets louder. Amy another lifeless character, all see does it fiddle with her hair and then start crying and go on about how she can't have the baby.<br/><br/>I gave it one extra star just because the underlying storyline ie teenage girl getting pregnant and dealing with it is a good idea, but they could have worked a little harder with getting better actors and a making a better story.",12 out of 16 found this helpful.,2.0,9 January 2009

3473,The Secret Life of the American Teenager," Clichéd, but Interesting","I agree with what a lot of people are saying, it's clichéd and preachy, BUT I also find in completely fascinating. That's my opinion, of course, but the whole premise is fairly new for TV. Sure, sure, we have about a bazillion lifetime movies about underage girls having babies, their parents wanting them to give the baby up or have an abortion and the father of the baby wanting or not wanting to be in the picture. But I can't recall watching a TV show about it.<br/><br/>For such a young cast, they're not half bad with the acting. Shailene Woodley is very cute, as far as annoying, well, I hate to break it to you, but she plays the typical fifteen year old, to a 'T'. She seems selfish and vain and emotional, because, stereotypically (which this show is all about, stereotypes), she is the perfect example of a fifteen year old, and to top the sundae off, she's pregnant. Ken Baumann is absolutely adorable. He's the perfect boy next door, geek chic, that a girl would like to have around. The rest of the cast is on the ball, for the most part. Molly Ringwald is a little stiff in my eyes, but that could be because I'm so use to watching her in her 80's glory.<br/><br/>The Characters are pretty much predictable and completely set in their stereotypical roles, and there are moments where you want to slap every single one of them. I don't remember being like that at 15, but that was way back in the day. Ricky... Ricky just blows my mind, that boy needs to be hosed down. And for most of the episodes I want to beat Adrian with a stick. But Amy's two gossiping gal pals crack me up, and the adorableness of Henry and Ashley (individually/together) is entertaining. The parents are all having just as much drama as their kids, which is somewhat mind blowing, but it leads to an entertaining quality.<br/><br/>Personally, I love it, my brand new addiction for the season. It's mind blowing, especially when Amy and Ben talk about forever and true love, but highly entertaining. I want to know what's going to happen next, for all of them ;) Worth a watch if you're bored.

3474,The Secret Life of the American Teenager, my friends and I get together every week to watch/criticize it,"I absolutely think this show is a wretched depiction of a pregnant teenager's life. At 15 you should know if you had sex or not, even if it was bad an short lived. It's kinda obvious what it is. Once you're pregnant, it is very rare that you are going to start dating some other guy, and fall in love within dates (that doesn't happen to non-pregnant teens). This guy is not going to propose to you, and if he does, his father definitely won't approve. The chances that your father's x-wife's husband is your pediatrician are impossible because your parents wouldn't be imbeciles. You probably wouldn't be the same age as your dad's x-wife's daughter, considering the time it takes to divorce, move on, and move on again (that's what Grace's mom did because she cheated on Amy's dad with someone who wasn't her current husband). Cliques in high school are not named, it is completely generic (Majorette is a cliché-ed term and a ten year old could think of it) The fifteen year old's sister who is supposedly 13 would not look older than the elder. Your dad's x-wife's daughter's love interest would not be your baby daddy. You would speak using contractions (ie. can't instead of cannot). You probably wouldn't be oblivious to the fact that your parents are having a rough patch. You won't be stupid enough to think that fake id's (with a different name on them) will legally be enough for you to get married. You're friends would probably act like they are five (Madison and that other girl are so immature) but their IQ's would be higher than that of a five year old (they take the longest pauses before they say their lines).<br/><br/>Also, Molly Ringwald can't even act that well, or she is being given the worst character to portray. My least favorite moment with her was when she found out about Amy's condition. She was just making her coffee and she jumped because Amy was sitting there in the dark. And I quote, ""I didn't see you. (LONG PAUSE) You startled me."" duh, I think we got that from the jump back and gasp. You had to say it twice in two different phrasings? And she used such clear syllables as if she was talking to a two year old. Honestly, I don't think she was ever a great actress...but that kind of melodramatic style was considered good...in the 80's. The best actors on the show are Adrian and Rikki, and they are playing the most stereotyped characters written. I feel sorry for these actors, and I encourage them to find a loophole in their contracts and find new jobs.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the characters are all unrealistically connected, the plot is very weak, and the dialogue is terrible. This makes it a very suspenseful show. How much cheesier can it get? And gasp, is that finally a real tear rolling down Amy's cheek? Because every time she ""cries"" she is smiling. Also, that disclaimer at the end of the episode should really be updated. I'm sick of seeing the same one after every episode. Have a different character do it for a change. Maybe have Rikki do one on child abuse.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,7.0,16 January 2009
3475,The Secret Life of the American Teenager, I keep watching with a morbid fascination.....,"I have too much time on my hands as I am currently watching the second season of this tripe, but I can't seem to stop watching. It's like looking into an alien world where creatures roam a high school, who look human, but act like they have just stepped off the mother ship.<br/><br/>They all fall in love in 2 seconds and then decide to get married after 2 weeks before having sex. Oh, the ""sex"". This word is used hundreds of times each episode. There are periods in the conversations where it is used in every sentence for 5 minutes running.<br/><br/>I'm not going to be affected by any of these idiotic characters but I seriously hope this doesn't make teenagers feel guilty for wanting to pursue a sexual relationship with their partners. The attitudes are so unhealthy and almost Victorian bar the fact everyone constantly talks about ""SEX!"" like its the word of the day.<br/><br/>As an example of the programs mono tonal viewpoint one of the main characters, who is a Christian, changes her mind from "" NO SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE EVERRRRR"" to "" Well, I love my long term boyfriend and he loves me and god wouldn't mind if we shared that love physically as it's natural"". So what happens? The second she has finished having sex she learns that her father has died. The plane he was on just fell out of the sky! The program is one long abstinence lecture with a script filled with characters who are barley recognisable as human beings let alone teenagers, who are just starting to discover the opposite sex and beginning to feel comfortable with their own bodies.<br/><br/>And why is abortion never mentioned? I know that this show would rather show a montage of Amy self flagellating and weeping with guilt over her dirty, filthy sexual desire than show an abortion, but its never even mentioned, not once, even by her parents or her friends on learning she is pregnant.<br/><br/>In conclusion if you fancy a laugh and have an hour to kill why not but be warned that this is rubbish of the first degree and you will want to reach into the TV and slap all of the characters silly and tell them to grow a pair.

I am actually fifteen years old, and a freshmen in high school. My school is very similar to The Secret Life school as far as students go. I come from a very large, blue-ribbon, public school, and with so many kids, and so many kids who want to go to my school (although they think we're stuck up rich kids), I've met many people who are exactly like one of these characters.<br/><br/>There is a senior at my school who happened to get pregnant. There are the perfect boyfriends, the perfect cheerleaders, the slutty cheerleaders, the band geeks, and the player guys. There are also, however, normal people (and I'd like to think I'm one of them).<br/><br/>The Secret Life shows the basic high school stereotypes, not everyone. It does not show the 'normal' children. Christians are not all preppy, the boyfriends aren't usually perfect or terrible, best friends don't always gossip (although they often do) about what's a secret, and not all sex addicts have trouble at home in some way or another.<br/><br/>If you actually understand the high school brain mind, not individually in each student, but as a whole, it's a perfect show.

Molly Ringwald of ""Sixteen Candles"" fame plays her mother.<br/><br/>As often happens with good girls, who also are naive, Amy gets charmed by a student whose goal is to have sex with as many girls as he can. It is all about ""him"", and in a therapy session we see that he is this way because his father mistreated him when he was younger. Ernie Hudson is good as the shrink, Dr. Fields.<br/><br/>The nice young man who is attracted to Amy is Kenny Baumann, 18, as Ben. He joins the band to play cymbals just to be closer to her.<br/><br/>The story line of the first episode has Amy falling victim to the boy who just wants to have sex, and she becomes pregnant.

However, the final product is a bit half-baked.<br/><br/>The Good) Let's not kid ourselves: sex education in public schools (and in private homes) always has and still does take a back seat to more 'important' activities such as sports, honor society, being popular, and all kinds of other BS that has nothing to do with real life. Kudos to Secret Life for finally addressing the elephant in the room that nobody wants to acknowledge. Most kids learn about birth control on the Net or from friends, but rarely from parents or educators. While the show gives virtually no beneficial information about birth control, at least it slams the issue right in front of parents' eyes so they have the option of discussing it with their kids if they're brave enough to do so. <br/><br/>Acting-wise, Mark Derwin (George), Francia Raisa (Adrian), India Eisley (Ashley), Megan Park (Grace), Luke Zimmerman (Tom), and Amy Rider (Alice) all do an excellent job portraying multifaceted characters despite the limitations of the script. They have realistic emotions &amp; give a zing to their dialog that the other cast members lack. <br/><br/>The Bad) Realism, where art thou??? -- Not on the set on 'Secret Life', that's for sure. I would not send *my* kids to ""Ulysses S. Grant High School"" because, apparently, anybody who wants to can just stroll onto the grounds and enter the school at will. In fact, they can even take up residence in an official school office and nobody seems to notice. It's a good thing that Eric Harris &amp; Dylan Klebold didn't go here... The school counselor would've been fired, if not tarred and feathered, a million years ago if he even said one quarter of the highly unprofessional things we are to believe he got away with. Speaking of which, kids don't converse in real life the way they do on the show, nor do they react to situations the way the show portrays. It's so absurd that it's a complete farce. Listening to the dialog, I am reminded of *every* training video from every job ever where the actors react in a completely silly way. <br/><br/>Everyone is sleeping around with everyone else and nobody has gotten an STD? Yeah, that's realistic! And this point, in particular, really demonstrates the half-assed way the show is put together. On one hand, the show wants to be socially responsible, while on the other hand, the show leaves out all kinds of relevant issues. The show is an accurate portrayal of most American families: complete lack of respect for each others' boundaries, little if any emotional intimacy, isolated kids and non-communicative parents. But so what? ""Square Pegs"" and ""My So-Called Life"" pioneered this technique back in the 80's and it's nothing new. If series creator Brenda Hampton wants this to truly be a family show that is a vehicle for positive social change, she should write more episodes where the family tries to heal itself rather than just maintain the status quo.<br/><br/>The Ugly) Throwing around all the just-add-water ""I Love You's"" between Ben and Amy is disturbing to say the least. But even more disturbing is the tacit approval of this behavior from all the parents. Earth calling Brenda: these are 15-year-olds; they don't know what ""love"" is and any remotely competent parent would certainly not endorse this by taking it seriously. Also, nobody ever gets punished for *anything*. The kids run around doing all manner of outrageous things and all they get is a slap on the wrist. Using fake ID's to get married? Call me crazy but I suspect that most parents with an IQ higher than that of a dyslexic trout would come down on their kids like Eliot Ness on Al Capone. <br/><br/>Also many of the characters are flat, contradictory, or absurd. For example, the characters Amy Juergens, Ben Boykewich, Jack Pappas, Kathleen Bowman, Madison &amp; Lauren, Henry Miller, and several others have no depth whatsoever. After watching the first season, I was tempted to make a call to Disneyland and tell them some of their Animatronic's escaped from Pirates of the Caribean. I don't blame the cast for this; they try their best to do a good job with the hollow, wooden roles they've been handed. No, the fault here lies with the crappy writing. <br/><br/>The characters Ricky and Amy, arguably the main stars of the show, have less personality than Scooby Doo. Enough said.<br/><br/>Some other characters that, to use the youth's vernacular, ""suck the big one"": are Anne Juergens and Leo Boykewich. Molly Ringwald is a very accomplished and talented actress whose ability is being wasted in this role. Her character is weak, puny, and flighty. Her portrayal of Claire Standish in ""The Breakfast Club"" was much stronger and she was only 18 at the time! Once again, the blame lies with Brenda ""Quaaludes"" Hampton for crappy writing. Likewise, Steve Schirripa is a extremely talented actor who is being wasted here as little more than a caveman in a tux. If I was his agent, I would catch up with Ms. Hampton in the parking lot and kick her in the box. <br/><br/>The Secret Life of The American Teenager has a lot of potential and could be a excellent vehicle for family discussion and growth. However, in its current incarnation it is little more than a flaccid, predictable teen drama with all the excitement of C-Span.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,4.0,16 December 2009
3483,Absentia, A little confusing,"Not a bad watch, lots of twists perhaps too many but really deterred me at times was the sound production you seem to bounce from almost unhearable whispering to crash bang wallop action sound which meant spending several minutes adjusting the volume up and down..... think I'm getting old :-(",151 out of 177 found this helpful.,7.0,14 November 2018
3484,Absentia, I wanted to like this show,"When I first saw the commercials for this show I was so excited! Such an interesting idea. The acting is fine. My issue is with the writing. The writing in this show is honestly terrible. They clearly have no idea how trauma affects human beings. You're telling me she spent 6 years in a glass tank and survived? In total isolation, trapped, consistently drowning on/off? I'm sorry but that is not possible. EVEN IF that was possible, the amount of trauma she would then have to overcome. She would not be good to go and fight crimes after talking to a professional twice. NOT ONLY THIS but the amount of animosity that people are holding towards her. The new wife acts as if helping her find a place to stay and having visits with her son is the greatest act of betrayal from the lead male character and instantly treats her like a homewrecker and him like a traitor. People don't do this? Why would she ever have so much hate for someone who has been traumatized for 6 bloody years. Tortured for 6 bloody years. It's like the writers don't understand what motivates human behaviours. The new wife's character has so much potential for a good story line. She could be conflicted with feelings of pity and jealousy. She could be understanding to her face but behind closed doors crushed in this situation. That's how real people would handle this impossible situation. There is no way you would be flat out hostile to someone who your husband thought was dead and turns out they were just being tortured this whole time. Instead they make her a vindictive bitch and it's intolerable to watch. The main woman ""emily"" seems to wade through this show only slightly traumatized and still able to fight crime, which is ridiculous AND everyone in this show is bloody victim blaming like she just disappeared for 6 years like it was shits and giggles. I just don't get it. I feel for the actors because they did their part, they acted well. And that's probably why it's rated so high. But the writing is just garbage. I think the writers need to look at the roots of what motivates human behaviour because literally no one acts the way they portray it.",68 out of 77 found this helpful.,,19 February 2018

3487,Absentia, Truthful review to help potential viewer set expectations,"I was home sick for 2 days and watched this in its entirety. I'm the kind of person who once starts watching a series will usually see it through. I wish this was 2-3 episodes shorter. They could have done it and it would not have felt so long and had a lot of the ridiculous things happen that did not seem to add any value. That said, the fact I'm posting on this (unusual) means both the show has grabbed my attention and also left me confused and disappointed and I came looking for answers. The reviews that mention huge plot holes are right on. UNLESS, there is some VERY clever writing and it has been done purposefully in a longer story arc. If you watch network TV shoes (CSI) and want to step up, this might be a satisfying show. If you like and keep track of character arcs on HBO drama's, this will feel thinly written.",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,4.0,24 October 2018

It felt like the writers and producers at different parts of the series came up with ideas that didn't work and forced them into the story. Trying not to bash this show but it's pretty hollow, boring, with poor story telling.

He has one actor face, pensive. He constantly looks like he has the worst headache ever or has use the bathroom.<br/><br/>Oh and it took me a minute to realize this series was set in Boston because the accents are so bad, especially on the Boston PD homicide officer. I realize this was shot overseas but they could have at least cast a few people who could do Boston accents.<br/><br/>I'm sort of invested in this car crash now so I will finish it but man it is some pretty convoluted stuff.",77 out of 104 found this helpful.,,30 September 2017
3491,Absentia, This show is an IQ test,"This TV show is a mess....
It is a literal assault on your intelligence. 
.Characters pop in and out of existence for no reason. The producers were trying to be ""clever"". Keeping the audience guessing, but never coalescing into a coherent and logical ending. 
It's as if the writer(s) placed possible suspects names in a hat and pulled out the words (random person from the past)... EYE ROLL MOMENT. 
.People know each other with NO explanation at all. 
.FBI Agent has book that points to him being the killer, yet agent has no affiliation to accused. 
Lead actress is homeless, disheveled, injured, bruised in one scene. 
Has make-up on and hair curled in next. 
.People are driving cars that are only found in Canada and not legal to drive in the US. 
. Mass grave found, only one person is identified. Mass grave not part of original back story. 
.Brother into snuff films, references names of deceased females; just into kinky stuff. 
.Lead ACTOR tried hard to show he's watched every Ryan Gosling film and that he can imitate his facial expressions. 
.BPD officer is 100% cliche', he's a caricature, no substance at all.

Most other reviewers have covered the good and not so good points- and I am curious to know how it ends. However I can't sit through another 6 episodes of mumbling and quiet speaking or whispering. Audio is 50% of a film and it isn't working if you are straining constantly to hear what the actors are saying.
Ok - yes, I could put on the subtitles, but should I have to? No, not for an English speaking TV series. With even better and more sophisticated sound recording equipment why is it so difficult for sound engineers to get the balance correct!

3494,Absentia, Pure and simple drivel,"Almost every detective story is a fairy tale. But what differs a good detective story from a bad one? In a good detective story the events are somehow possible and believable. In a bad detective story what's going on on the screen is a continuous deception of the common sense. That's exactly what happens in all ten series of Absentia. We are asked to believe that the heroine doesn't need food, clothes, money, a place to sleep. She can run and fight the next day after an abdominal operation and losing a lot of blood. Her brother can operate on her without anesthesia, without the necessary surgical instruments, and the heroine miraculously avoids any infection. The way she's making on a bus for four hours, the police crosses just in ten minutes. But enough. The story is absolutely unbelievable, implausible and false.

3495,Absentia, A terrible show for the great Stana Katic,"Okay, so I watched all ten episodes. The plot could be interesting, but the writing, the characters, and most likely the script is simply terrible.<br/><br/>This show is flawed in so many ways, it lacks logics, common sense and it is full of plotholes... Nick is such a stupid person (and sadly a really terrible actor with only one face expression and a pinching voice) in the movie that it is unbelivable how someone like him could become an FBI agent. Not to mentioun the bureau itself... Real agents watching this show must have been laughing all the way watching these guys work... <br/><br/>I ""loved"" when Nick accused Emily of kidnapping his wife and child. Seriously, why the hell would she do something like that? WHY? Also, did the FBI not find any evidence in Alice's sister house confirming that it was Emily? Why did Emily forgive this idiot out of nowhere at the end?<br/><br/>How is it possible that the FBI needed 10 agents and a lot of time to find out a name of guy who is being treated in a psychiatric institute when it only took a phone call when a retired police officer asked his friend to help (the pidgeon guy).<br/><br/>I ""loved"" when Emily had to take a 4 hour long bus trip to get to a place. Nick needed like ten minutes to get there. He must also be super fast like the Flash, since he can catch up to the running Emily in like seconds from the 4th level of a building from where he just saw her running away into the woods.<br/><br/>And one of my favourite plotholes out there: Emily walked into a night club and simply shot like 4-5 people and it seems everyone has forgotten about this ""simple"" issue. Really?<br/><br/>I could continue this list, but you probably get my point.<br/><br/>The whole show is unbelievably stupid and painful to watch sometimes.

I understand everyone once in a while characters have to do dumb stuff, but this was too much. They didn't get super simple relations or they jumped to this conclusion that no one would have guessed, and it was still wrong. 
And then at the end the cop who was hell bent on persecuting her tryed to make a pass at her and she was all giggles about it. She was also cool with her ex just completely not believing her (and doing the worst detective job ever).",25 out of 32 found this helpful.,1.0,8 August 2018

Looks great on a superficial examination but when you get into the details it falls about and you realize it is just a giant waste of time. The characters are highly unsympathetic and show less emotional depth than a 12 year-old. Except the actual 12 year old who acts like he is 4 and hasn't had his nap. The writers fail utterly at giving voice to feelings and the behaviors and plot points are calculating and artificial in moving from point to point. Which you could live with if it was a least as cerebral at it is lacking in heart. But it just isn't. And it doesn't get any better as the episodes roll on.

I did very much like those series but found Absentia nothing like them. My attention can often be grabbed. I was hoping someone would come up with the goods - something, anything... from either the script writer, the director or at least one of the actors but nadda.<br/><br/>This series (for me) was a complete let down.

3502,Absentia, Psychological Overture,"Let me start by saying this is going to give you some serious deja vu to psychological thrillers like the SAW series and mind twisters like Kidnapped.<br/><br/>So the show starts out with a suspect being sentenced for the murder of FBI agent Emily Byrne(Stana Katic). Meanwhile you keep getting these flashes of her being tortured. So than the show fast forwards to six years later where her ex husband is remarried to her sister, and her son is living with them. Her husband gets a call telling him where to find her still alive! He of course rushes over to where the caller told him she would be and sure enough there she is, in a tub filled with water and a lock. From there the story just starts to build.<br/><br/>I have very rarely seen such a good performance as Stana gave in this role, it's hard enough to pull off being abused but she looks exactly how you would imagine someone would look if they were starved and tortured for 6 years. So far 10/10, supremely strong start, the acting, plot and atmosphere is right on point. And the support cast is doing a fantastic job so far.<br/><br/>Update: So I figured in season 1 they were done with all the twists and turns and in season 2 we could finally get on with some rebuilding, which is the nature of shows like this actually getting some light before going back dark. Nope, it just keeps getting darker and darker. And here's the problem, with a show that was already on the very edge of disturbing going even darker makes it worse, not better. Because now you're not actually rooting for anyone anymore. This is one of the things that the showrunners need to understand and they don't seem to, in the first season you have sympathy, in the second one you don't. So now it's just more of the same mind bending with no one really caring about happens. This show for me took a nose dive from a 10 to a 3 in the span of 1 season. Shame, it had potential and they squandered it.",81 out of 119 found this helpful.,3.0,25 September 2017
3503,Absentia, nice dark mystery,"It's 6 years after Conrad Harlow's conviction for FBI agent Emily Byrne (Stana Katic)'s disappearance and presumed murder. Her FBI husband Nick Durand has remarried to Alice and Emily's son Flynn has long forgotten her. Nick receives a late night call from Harlow which leads to Emily's rescue from her watery tomb. Harlow is released from prison as trial evidences are proved incorrect. Emily's original target, crime boss Robert Semerov, is found waiting in the morgue and she is implicated. Boston police detective Tommy Gibbs investigates her case as she goes on the run. Her brother Jack and father Warren are her main supporters as even Nick starts to disbelieve her.<br/><br/>This has a nice dark mood and compelling mysterious premise. I like the first couple of episodes but the show bogs down into a convoluted reveal. If her past is the main reveal, then it needs to be presented right at the beginning. The way to do it are flashbacks to her childhood as the B-story. A younger Emily would allow a back and forth to the present day story. It would give better preparation for the ultimate reveal. The acting is relative good although I don't remember the villains. Without the preparation, the revelations don't hit as hard and the reveal lacks real shock. This is fine but it could have been better.<br/><br/>EDIT: I did not expect a second season. Two starts with an attack on the federal government. Emily returns to work and tries to reconnect with her son. This season suffers from a similar situation as the first season. It starts one way and finishes another way. This one starts like it wants Emily to be in a police procedural. I really like her new relationship with her son. When her mother shows up, it would have been a great family drama. I don't really love it but I can see it working. Then it takes twists which loops back to the first season. Instead of the twists, it should be simply Emily alone investigating her case without the extra layer of investigation. This show often gets too muddled for its own good. At least, it ends in a good place.",34 out of 47 found this helpful.,6.0,26 March 2018
3504,Absentia, So bad...,"This series was such a dumpster fire, I feel like a new word should be invented to fully express how truly awful it was. I will never get this waste of a day back... <br/><br/>To start with, a lot of commenters have expressed that they thought the show was bad because of the acting. This script was so terrible, Meryl Streep and Anthony Hopkins couldn't make it better. <br/><br/>I just can't fathom how something this abysmal can pass through multiple stages of drafting and editing and STILL get approved. And I will never understand why shows like this can't seem to get simple procedures and laws correct. It's almost like it was written in a vacuum where no one's ever seen or heard what law enforcement officers actually DO. <br/><br/>Then there's the added layer of disbelief over the basic human responses to difficult situations. For instance, the ex-husband totally sells her out and leads the effort to hunt her down like a dog, then he is so thick and abusive, he literally throws a torture victim across the room while she's trying desperately to save their child.

3508,Boston Legal, Denny Crane and Alan Shore .... enough said !,"Boston Legal is one of the best takes on a TV legal drama that I have seen. It manages to mix drama and comedy pretty well for the most part and introduces us to Alan and Denny who are magnetic characters, played to perfection by James Spader and an incredible William Shatner. To review this whole 5 season series (which i have steadily worked through on DVD over the last 2 months) would take forever, so let me highlight a few good and bad points as i see them.<br/><br/>Season 1 &amp; 2 had a sharper edge and better dialogue than subsequent seasons. It felt almost as if they were searching for better ratings from season 3 onwards and chose to introduce characters and plots which would deliberately jazz things up a bit. In my opinion the show suffered because of this.<br/><br/>The characters Jefferey Coho, Claire Simms, Lorraine Weller and Clarence / Clarice Bell added virtually nothing to the show that wasn't there already (other than the cross dressing element) and as they failed to perk up ratings its almost as if David E Kelly thought ""well... tried some new faces, didn't work, lets write them out and try something else.""<br/><br/>I also felt that the writers seemed to ignore the more obvious direction that they could have taken, which would have been to flesh out the Denny and Alan characters even more. You are treated to some glimpses of their past when they are discussing their lives on the balcony, but Dennys brilliant former career is never seen first hand and Alans many previous painful issues are only represented in the narrative. Perhaps if even more screen time had been given to these two instead of trying to continually bolster up the supporting characters, the show would have been more successful.<br/><br/>The recurring theme of the lawyers in the show standing trial for their various indiscretions and always getting away with it was an over used plot and began to wear a bit thin. Similarly, I can only recall one trial verdict of any kind that didn't go in favour of Mssrs Crane, Poole and Schmidt.<br/><br/>There were flashes of poetry with this show that i felt genuinely moved by.

3509,Boston Legal, Shatner is the BOMB!!!!!!!!,"I don't know, for a guy in his early 70's who has been royally and unfairly panned for his entire career, William Shatner as Denny Crane may be the absolute highlight of his long career! What a role and what a show. My ultimate benchmark as to how good a show is how fast I am back to that show during the commercial breaks. Didn't miss one second of Boston Legal so I guess that tells you that I liked it a lot. Of course the ""Shat Man"" drew me in but the overall show got me hooked. Well worth the late hour on Sundays.

3510,Boston Legal, The Best Show On TV. Period.,"Forget Desperate Housewives or anything else. Boston Legal is the comedy-drama that has been missing from TV for a long, long time. I barely watched ""The Practice"" but I got hooked when James Spader and William Shatner had guest-roles. When I heard these two would lead the spin off ""Boston Legal"", I was exuberant!<br/><br/>James Spader as Alan Shore is by far the best acting on TV. The guy is priceless, reaching a level of pure arrogance that you can't help but love. William Shatner as Denny Krane is just as good.

3511,Boston Legal, A hilarious and unlikely spin-off,"I admit I didn't watch ""The Practice"" as a regular show, but I saw enough to see that it was a dark, clever series examining the everyday work of a small Boston firm who primarily defended criminals. ""Boston Legal"" is a much different show. Centered around a civil and corporate firm that only occasionally deals in criminal cases. The place is a circus, it's David E. Kelley's hybrid of ""The Practice"" and ""Ally McBeal,"" although the latter included hallucinations and bizarre love lifes.<br/><br/>Emmy-winner James Spader, the ever shameless and subtly self-destructive Alan Shore is the slimy playboy who, like it or not, is a fantastic attorney. Denny Crane (fellow Emmy-winner William Shatner) seems like the perfect match for Shore's unpredictable fashion. Both men are unorthodox, and Denny is slipping. He's also a great attorney, but he doesn't know it half the time. The two are the perfect team, each willing to forgive the other for their shortcomings in the area of law, and cover each other as such. Paul Lewiston (Rene Aberjonois) is the figurehead of everything they are not. He is respectable, by-the-book, and without conscience. The embodiment of the sleazy corporate attorney, and more concerned with keeping a client than with admitting a falacy on their part. Brad Chase (Mark Valley) is in the same boat insofar as playing by the rules, but he's Denny's man, and it pisses him off that Alan gets all the attention for his crimes. Laurie Colson (Monica Potter) is the idealistic attorney who has dabbled in Alan Shore's method of practicing law with disastrous consequences. Tara Wilson (Rhona Mitra) is finally sleeping with Alan, and happily playing along in his little game. And Sally Heep (Lake Bell) has all but disappeared since she broke up with Alan, so that she is little more than an errand boy (girl).<br/><br/>And most recently Candice Bergen has joined the cast at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt, as Shirley Schmidt (Edwin Poole has gone off the deep end after showing up at work, having only dressed the top half of his body.) and she appears to be Alan Shore in reverse. She's manipulative, wisecracking, and short with answers, but she seems to appeal to the ethical way of practicing law. Now back from New York and busting balls due to a law suit filed by one of their employees, she seems a welcome edition to the show.<br/><br/>Perfect follow-up to ""Desperate Housewives,"" and just as funny. It's proof that David E. Kelley still has a few tricks up his sleeve.",108 out of 123 found this helpful.,,10 January 2005
3512,Boston Legal, Excellent Show,"Considering all the crap that is normally on Sunday(e.g. football and Nascar), this show is a refreshing change of pace. Spader and Shatner are an excellent duo. Spader already received an emmy, and hopefully Shatner will receive one too, if for no other reason than to silence the ignorant critics of this well-rounded show. Rarely will you find a legal show, that is humorous and poignant at the same time. Denny Craine's succinctness and Shore's coolness make this show a stand out. If ABC is smart, they will hold on to this show and try to replicate it's success, while in the meantime dumping all their worthless reality shows(redundancy I know). In conclusion, the great story lines and skillful acting make this show one of the best current series on television.",86 out of 100 found this helpful.,,29 November 2004
3513,Boston Legal, This show may be better than The Practice ever was,"After 8 episodes of Boston Legal, I am hooked. I was a big fan of The Practice for the first 4 seasons or so but lost interest until the final season when Spader was brought on. His emmy-winning portrayal of Alan Shore has transferred seamlessly to this spin off, and the rest of the ensemble cast is, by and large, excellent. It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the Lori Colson character but now I can see why she is the female center of the show -- she is effectively the anti-Shore. Shatner is (surprisingly) brilliant and, while the Tara character doesn't get enough airtime, I love every second she's on screen. The tone of the show is a pitch-perfect mix of quirkiness, drama and dark humor, and the pacing is much swifter than The Practice, which in the later seasons became sluggish, droning and depressing. Here's hoping Boston Legal can keep it going!",75 out of 88 found this helpful.,,28 November 2004

Or rather, this has Captain Kirk, William Shatner, as an old, demented, republican, gun totting, ego-maniacal unenlightened, philandering, unethical, sexist, homophobic anti- environmentalist powerful attorney, and it is absolutely frelling hysterical. When they let Shatner, Candice Bergman, and James Spader do their thing, this show is gold. The rest of the regularly appearing cast is fairly good. <br/><br/>Sure not modeling good behavior, mind, and sometimes the legal errors go far beyond what is necessary for the plot. I think they could loose some of the younger lawyers, who really don't add anything to the mix that I can tell but seem to be regarded as necessary for demographic reasons.

3515,Boston Legal, A near-perfect series that should not have been cancelled,"I'm going to make this as short as possible short, as I have little to say. As far as ""pure"" drama series' go, Boston Legal is the one that had it all right.<br/><br/>Fabulous actors, writers with imagination and a sense of humor, and most of all, the series had a soul. It had an opinion, and the nerve to bring it forth. Entertainment that is afraid of making a statement can be relaxing, but relaxing entertainment that manages to make a statement, whether the viewer agrees with the statement or not, is something much greater.<br/><br/>5 seasons is a lot better than a lot of worthy series have done, but still, the cancellation is a huge injustice and I will sorely miss the wits that this series had to offer.

3516,Boston Legal," ""I Can't Believe I Like Something Starring William Shatner!""","It's no big secret that down through the years,William Shatner was made fun of ""a lot"". From his,""Gremlin On The Airplane"" appearance on Twilight Zone,what some say was ""wooden"" acting on ""Star Trek"" (except all those Trekkies)to ""T.J. Hooker"" &amp; his laughable,tongue in cheek,renditions of popular songs. Not to mention a few bad films here &amp; there.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but not take him seriously. ...but now,Shatner's won an Emmy or two and I can't believe I'm saying this... he deserves it. As Denny Crane he is hilarious and at the same time kind of sad. Sad because we know his character's mind is slowly drifting into Alzheimer's Disease.<br/><br/>It's also amazing to see this character,that is everything the feminist movement ever complained about in men. He smokes,drinks,sleeps with many women and is an ego-maniac with too much power. ...but at least hes lovable,sort of.<br/><br/>James Spader's dry style is terrific and his courtroom speeches are not just powerful &amp; true but they also seem genuinely heartfelt. Which is amazing considering his character can be quite the cynic and seemingly part time womanizer like Denny. Except,he tends to be a bit more respectful of females. (Look for Spader in the classic episode of Seinfeld,as the guy who wont tell george Costanza he's sorry.)<br/><br/>I'm happy to see the likes of Candice Bergen,Rene Aubenjenois &amp; Betty White on the show as well. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw Bety White ""take-out"" a guy with a heavy black frying pan! I mean,dang! She's (for a time) reminded me of my Grandmother! <br/><br/>Candice Bergen has successfully put a ""Grand Canyon"" between her Murphy Brown character and Shirley. The difference? Murphy Brown is sarcastic but truly cares about people. On B.L. ,Shirley does stand up for human rights in the courtroom. At the firm,she can be insensitive and a bit callous twords the feelings of others. <br/><br/>Case in point,not promoting one lawyer to partner because he doesn't make enough money for the firm,as well as the fact he has a personality quirk that makes him imperfect for the image of the firm. <br/><br/>Usually I don't go for ""law"" or ""court"" shows but since this one has an almost M*A*S*H like combo of humor and drama (without being heavy handed) I finally have a dramatic show that I can also laugh at.<br/><br/>Ten stars easily!!",13 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,1 March 2006
3517,Boston Legal, You Should Watch this Show,"I think you should watch this show.<br/><br/>It's delightfully weird.<br/><br/>Totally unrealistic, it has just enough I-don't-know-what to enable the all important willing suspension, and once you got that, you're golden.<br/><br/>Here's the little stuff, the stuff that you'll enjoy but don't need to go out of your way for: <br/><br/>1) It has Candice Bergen! Bergen fulfills her role (uber-classy uber-MILF) perfectly. (Plus, she's Candice Bergen. To this date, no one does Bergen as well as Bergen.) <br/><br/>2) Clemenson/Espenson is likable and offbeat. One of the best ""spice"" characters since, oh, I dunno, Hill Street Blues.<br/><br/>3) Sometimes John Larroquette shows up, and he's so tall! He doesn't have to actually say anything funny. He's John Larroquette. It's a grin just for him to show up. (That sounds dismissive and snarky, but it's not meant to be. I honestly believe this is Larroquette's great comic gift: he shows up. That's all he needs to do. That's what he does. It doesn't matter what he says, because all the humor is in the wry, sardonic (and tall) presence. On Night Court, he had some funny lines, but that was actually a distraction. Remember The West Wing and The Practice... he had no funny lines there, but the effect was the same: Larroquette's wry, sardonic (and tall) presence = a grin. (Although, to be fair, in The Practice he did actually play a character in addition to showing up.)) <br/><br/>4) It has William Shatner! <br/><br/>And here's the big stuff, the stuff you'll never experience if you don't go out of your way to watch a few episodes: <br/><br/>1) It has William Shatner! Star Trek gave us William Shatner giving us Captain James T. Kirk. Boston Legal gives us William Shatner giving us William Shatner (as Denny Crane)... the intelligent goof we always suspected was playing Captain Kirk. Even if you weren't a Trekkie, it's such a cool feeling to feel like you're getting to hang out with the *real* Captain Kirk, the (intelligent, goofy) man behind the myth.<br/><br/>2) Despite -- or rather, alongside -- the show's unabashed unrealistic stance, it takes an honest stab at depicting honest emotions, especially (but not only) in the traditional closing scene, where Spader/Shore and Shatner/Crane share a Scotch, a cigar, a presumably rather nippy Boston evening, and a friendship.<br/><br/>3) It has James Spader! Who? James Spader! Who's Jame's Spader? I don't know, I never heard of him before I saw this show, but he's incredible. His character (Alan Shore) brings something unlike anything I've ever seen on television... a character that is, I think, truly Shakesperean in its immediacy and otherness.<br/><br/>In fact, I believe this is the secret ingredient of Boston Legal's success. Spader's Shore has a Shakesperean otherness, and once we accept this otherness (as we are compelled to do), it doesn't matter how unrealistic (or compressed or reductive) the rest of the show is. Once we (the audience) have signed up for this otherness, once the writers have that signature on the dotted line, they're free play around and cut corners as they like. Thankfully, they often (though not always) do so to good effect.",20 out of 23 found this helpful.,9.0,25 October 2008
3518,Boston Legal, Let's hope for a long and enjoyable journey...,"Programs like Boston Legal are competing for some very coveted viewers. Dangerous Housewives may be more the taste for those looking for ""the edgey dramedy"" on prime time and Nip/Tuck and Rescue Me have also found a loyal following with some pretty important demographics.* The kind of viewers that can keep a show like Boston Legal alive for a few seasons.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the show...and was one of those people who only began to watch The Practice when Spader appeared. The moral ambiguity of the show's primary characters and the splash of David Kelly made for a wonderful show. That it found the viewers it did is a tribute to the inspired casting and originality of it's story lines. I think Shatner is a wonderful comeback story and the inclusion of Mark Valley may prove to be a superb choice...introducing a fellow who is much more than a pretty face. His character will go nose to nose with Alan Shore and not in the fluttery Major Burns manner. This is a guy who's gonna a win a few...and that in itself bodes well for the show.

And last night's episode was clever and funny, with a black woman charging racial discrimination for her daughter who was not cast as Annie. Every time anyone looked at this kid, she sang ""Tomorrow."" The episode sported a cameo appearance and a hilarious bit by the Reverend Al Sharpton. There were other subplots, but for me, Annie stole the show! Rebecca de Mornay seems missing from the cast, but there is the neat addition of Mark Valley, from the ill-fated, also excellent ""Keen Eddie.""

The spin off is actually better than the original series. I like The Practice but it was too serious. It lacked fun! I like watching guest stars like the great Shelley Long who should win an Emmy for her guest appearance as a nymphomaniac divorcée.

3523,Boston Legal, Best. Show. Ever.,"If the perfect show exists, Boston Legal is it.<br/><br/>It is so ridiculously over the top in terms of the cases these lawyers handle, that you can't help but laugh at the very ideas they pull from their hats.<br/><br/>And on top of that, the acting is brilliant. I don't think I've ever seen a character quite as compelling as Jerry Espenson, or as utterly insane but at the same time brilliant as Denny Crane. Add to that the horribly arrogant but even more brilliant attorney Alan Shore, and you have the perfect cast to laugh your behind off, but that's only a fraction of the amazing characters in this show.<br/><br/>Now, one might say that this show is utterly unrealistic in that the lawyers succeed in winning even the most insane cases. But to that I will say: Television doesn't have to be realistic, it has to be fun. And that's exactly what Boston Legal is: fun. And honestly, in a perfect world these cases could very well be real, so in a sense it's a motivation for all of us to improve the world.<br/><br/>The only thing that I rest to say is: if you haven't seen this show, please do.

Religion, politics, drugs, homosexuality, crime, mirage, family and the list goes on.
I honestly can't think of any subject that is generally considered worth examining that is not present in this show in a wonderful formula of an unbiased and simplified manner. Where it gets truly genius is, at the platform of a court, where all sides present their best demonstration to support their views and leave it to us to form our own judgment.

3525,Boston Legal," Denny Crane:"" We look good together"". Alan Shore: ""Yes, we do.""","Boston Legal is my dream come true - Comedy / Crime /Legal Courtroom Drama which is a perfect combination of all genres and is as funny as it is clever and gripping. The idea of ""Boston Legal"" had came to its creator, David E. Kelley during the last season of once very popular but sadly quietly dying legal drama ""Practice"". I was a big fan of the show and I stayed with it to the end. Bringing to ""Young, Berluti, &amp; Frutt"" of ""Practice"" an ethically-challenged, arrogant, morally ambiguous but brilliant and somehow likable attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) was Kelley's great idea. The last season of Practice became one of best thanks to Spader who resurrected it by simply being there. When I heard that Spader would have a spin-off ""Boston Legal"", I could hardly wait for it and it has never disappointed me. Boston Legal is ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"", a famous and wealthy firm that specializes on civil cases. In the center of the show are Alan Shore and his older friend and mentor Denny Crane (William Shattner). To bring them together in one show and let them have a wonderful relationship that is based on their differences (comparing to Denny who is in love with the sound of his own name, Alan seems highly moral and stable model citizen) and is at the same time hilarious, sincere, and moving was a pure genius. Each episode would end with both Alan and Denny sitting on the balcony, smoking cigars, drinking scotch and having a friendly conversation and those are the best moments of the show.<br/><br/>Alan and Denny are the central characters in ""Boston Legal"" but every attorney in the ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"" is a unique individual. There is a former marine Brad, the veteran of Operation Desert Storm with the strong principles - the complete opposite to Alan. There is Clarence, a man with several personalities and Claire, the girl who loves him. Candice Bergen has joined the cast at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt, as Shirley Schmidt, sharp like a razor senior partner as brilliant, manipulative, and arrogant as both Denny and Alan are. There is also a dwarf Bethany ""who comes and goes"" with whom Denny has an on- and off- relationship. Jerry ""Hands"" Espenson with his Asperger syndrome has re-joined the firm and his return will certainly add to the practice (and the show) success. You may like them or not but they all have one thing in common - they are fantastic attorneys, always on the top of their game. All actors, the series regulars and the guests constantly give first-class performances, writing is superb in every episode, and ""Boston Legal"" has become one of if not the best comedy-drama on TV today. <br/><br/>In the conclusion, I'd like to share one of my favorite scenes in the show. Denny and Allan are on the balcony talking about Shirley. Denny and Shirley used to have a passionate affair way back and she is still the love of his life. Alan's lust for Shirley is so overwhelming that he showed up in the office party dressed up like her (and he managed to look better than she did) explaining that everyone had to dress up like a person he/she admires the most. <br/><br/>Denny (thoughtfully, remembering something very special to him) - ""Shirley...One night while making love, she recited Proust."" <br/><br/>Alan: ""Did you understand it?"" <br/><br/>Denny: ""Not a single word. I thought she was possessed.""",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,12 May 2007

Fantastic cast.,"Alan Shaw (James Spader) and Denney Crane (William Shatner) supply excellent chemistry through the one-and-one-half seasons that I've seen thus far. Shaw constantly showcasing the inward wrestling of his wit, his honour, his job and his desire for (all) women. Whomever he clashes with tends of come away shocked, appalled or at the very least, stunned. Shirley Smitt (Candice Bergman) dislikes him initially but out of respect for his skills as a lawyer begins to warm in his direction. She presents the stern serious side to the law firm and is predominately concerned with its reputation, but having previously slept with Denney (Shatner) there is room aplenty for hilarity. A special mention should be given to Tara Williams (Rhona Mitra) who smoulders deliciously whenever the camera draws near. Do yourself a favour - watch this top series!

3532,Boston Legal, The Alan and Denny Show,"Rising from the ashes of the Practise, always a somewhat leaden and humourless show, the characters that Spader and Shatner created were clearly meant for better things. Boston Legal initially struggled to be about anything but the two of them as the rest of the firm struggled to hold our interest by comparison. Gradually the increasingly redundant eye candy was dispatched, Rene Auberjoniois given increasing prominence to function as an effective foil to Alan and Denny while the arrival of Candice Bergman gave the show it's first strong female lead. The battle between the cavalier antics of our heroes and the more conventional ways of the rest of the firm has provided strong drama. In Alan Shore, James Spader has created one of the most complex and engaging characters of the small screen, his impudence, intelligence and twisted sense of mortality make him unpredictable and engaging. Denny Crane meanwhile shows not only Shatner's willingness to send himself up but also his superb comic timing. For the first time you can see him on screen and not think about you know who. All in all, an excellent series that will hopefully run a good few seasons. Of course, if Spader walks, it's all over.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,,8 November 2005
3533,Fresh Off the Boat," My life, finally projected on screen","Some background. I came to the states without any knowledge of engish and neither did my parents. It was some midwestern state in the early 1990s. In the school, there were 3 asians, and 1 black kid. From the very first episode to episode 8. I felt like my life was shown. I had the same infatuation with hiphop. My first album was Straight Outta Compton. PE and Ice Cube and Ice T were my favorite groups. I felt exactly as the series describe, it's not that the white folks were disrespectful to me (in fact there where at the beginning), but they just don't know what to do with a person of different race and culture. I could never truly be in the ""in crowd"". I found commonality in people who are different and music that's different, and most hiphop at that time was portraying rebellion against the establishment. To me, the establishment was white with Christian morales. That's not what I am about. I had 3 Asian kids in school who are straight A and musicians. I ain't about that nonsense. All through school, my best friend was a black kid and he was the one that introduced me to straight outta compton.<br/><br/>So this show is a great authentic view of the Asian minority. Stereotypes of Asian parents are REAL and of the white folks are REAL. Exaggeration of course, but the gist of it is VERY VERY real. My parents HATED rap with a passion because they don't understand it. All they care about 100% of time is where is my grade, what am I doing wrt to studying. No basketball, nothing. I had to find solace in the things that are shown in this movie. I had to conform to pizza and sloppy joe where my parents served Chinese dishes. In the 90s, Chinese is not the in crowd, unlike now. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a VERY realistic view for ANY Asian's coming to a majority white area in the 80s, 90s. I felt my life was displayed on screen. It was hilarious at the same time nostalgic of my life.<br/><br/>I signed up just to say my support for this show. I know there are many Asians like me with the same background, living in the same white neighborhoods. <br/><br/>Every other sitcom I have seen before are either non relevant or non- relateable to person like me or Asian. I get all the jokes of Seinfeld and Friends, but those are non relatable to an Asian person. Supremely refreshing to finally get our voices heard. About time.<br/><br/>US needs more shows like this.",114 out of 130 found this helpful.,10.0,10 March 2015
3534,Fresh Off the Boat, Something Fresh On Television,"""Fresh Off The Boat"" is so funny, so smart, and so charming that I enjoyed every minute of the first two episodes. I hope the creative team behind it, and the wonderful actors can maintain this high-level of quality.<br/><br/>Randall Park is terrific as Louis Huang the optimistic - perhaps a bit naive - patriarch of the family that has just moved to Orlando from Washington D.C. Park shows refreshing depth to his complex character by understanding certain realities while maintaining optimism; optimism that he hopes can carry him and his family through some rough adjustments.<br/><br/>Constance Wu is spectacular! She is the most beautiful woman on television. Her character - Jessica Huang - makes sure things get done. She makes changes at the family's restaurant, she makes sure the children study hard, and she makes an effort to get to know the neighbors; all of which is shown in smart and funny ways. As demanding as she can be, her mind is open and she shows great empathy and compassion when it makes sense. Jessica is a well-written character performed brilliantly by Constance Wu.<br/><br/>Their three boys in the show are funny, and smart which is quite refreshing compared to other kid characters on television. The grandmother character is like many grandmothers with a foreign background; she may be equal parts traditionalist and ""ready for anything"" - she seems to enjoy the oldest boy's taste in music more than anyone else does.<br/><br/>Sometimes a stranger, a newcomer, sees people more clearly than they are willing to see themselves...",84 out of 103 found this helpful.,10.0,6 February 2015
3535,Fresh Off the Boat," Rough start, but gets way better","The pilot came off a tad stilted as all the characters were trying to be developed beyond the color of their skin. However, regardless of how ""bad"" this makes white people seem...it's not untrue. <br/><br/>I grew up in an incredibly white city - and my parents owned a restaurant, too. It was both cathartic to see my life experiences on the screen, as well a tad traumatizing to remember it all again. <br/><br/>Throughout elementary and middle school, I threw away many of the lunches that my parents made for me because kids would make fun exactly in that way. The way that they handled the ""chink"" comment is a tad exaggerated, but I believe it is valid. For some reason, when it's the Asian kids being bullied, everyone expects the parents and the kids to just accept it. Standing up for yourself is...well overrated. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved the second episode as it portrays the tension of owning a family restaurant very well. As for the employees, well - I won't lie - my parents had the same idea that their white customers would be more comfortable with having white servers. My mom definitely struggled in managing them because she was 100% sure that they were trying to take advantage of us (and that they looked down on us because they weren't able to speak English well), while my dad was always the happy-go-lucky one, always striving to prove that we would be able to succeed. Totally remember after-school lessons with my mom too, and doing them at the restaurant. <br/><br/>I'm so happy that this show is being aired, even if it's rough at its edges. And heh, for those of you who think the show's portrayal of white folk is unfair - I would point you to all the unfair portrayals of Asians in other shows. We are not all kungfu masters or nerds. And how often do we see yellowface on the screen. And at the end of the day, I remember a lot of well-meaning white folks at home who constantly said offensive things...and my parents and I would just have to swallow, smile, and proceed...because we knew in our hearts that they meant well - but they come from a different culture. <br/><br/>This show has a lot of promise, and it may be uncomfortable for some to watch - but all in all, I think it's a great show - and a good day for some Asian kids to see their life experiences on the screen too.",78 out of 100 found this helpful.,10.0,4 February 2015
3536,Fresh Off the Boat, The Malcolm in the Middle for the Next Generation,"As the title says, not since Malcolm in the Middle have I seen such a hilarious family dynamic. Yes, the family is Chinese (Taiwanese) but this is just a side-story...they could be Polish (like in Malcolm in the Middle) or any other ethnicity making them unique. This is NOT about Asian stereotypes, this is about kids vs parents who are trying to keep up appearances/with the Jones'...and what could be more American than that? Superb acting by ALL the actors (even the Grandmother who only speaks Mandarin gets the funniest lines with subtitles). Add to this the nostalgia factor of the ""hip-hop"" 90's and I sincerely hope this is a formula for success. PLEASE keep this show on the air; it's got humor, good timing, good writing and it's something the whole family can watch and laugh at together. We are laughing WITH a family that happens to be Chinese, not AT a Chinese family.",43 out of 53 found this helpful.,,17 February 2015
3537,Fresh Off the Boat, FOB-ulous!,"I came into Fresh Off the Boat with low expectations, as there are seemingly endless ways to make a bad network show, especially by making it dull and mediocre by dumbing down the characters and their experiences. Add in the topic of race and immigration, where I'm certain network producers are terrified of offending anyone, and you're almost certain to brew up a giant batch of watered-down, ""family friendly"" weak tea.<br/><br/>But, amazingly, the show is good. And funny. Maybe most importantly, all of the characters are human, and they are full people while simultaneously showing different sides of the immigrant experience. I have a feeling you're not going to know who are the ""good guys"" and who are the ""bad guys,"" and this really won't be a show about Eddie but about a family. As the first few episodes show, each family member has different, and even contradictory, skills for managing their lives together, and they complement each other. I also bet people outside of the family will soon be part of this equation.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, it's ironic that some reviewers are saying the show is anti-white, as a big critique of white people is how they tend to dominate any experience (like, for instance, a show about an Asian American immigrant family) and make it all about them.",57 out of 73 found this helpful.,10.0,9 February 2015

Not to mention this is based on a real life autobiography just like the Goldbergs TV show. I really look forward to the upcoming episodes and hope they can keep the quality of the episodes the same and keep jokes coming, because adding this to my repertoire of TV shows i think this is a real step towards the the Asian American culture being on TV, i hope that everyone gives this show a chance, as i did.

3540,Fresh Off the Boat, Mighty clever and original...and occasionally kinda sweet.,"""Fresh Off the Boat"" is a show about a Taiwanese-American family who has moved from Washington, DC (where there are lots of Taiwanese- Americans) to Orlando, Florida (where there are none!). While this sounds a bit like ""Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" or the like, the show still is surprisingly original and worth seeing. There are several things I really appreciate about it: it DOES talk about race and stereotypes (something very rare on TV today) and writing is so good. The characters, as a result, are very likable. Overall, there's very little not to like about this one and I see it as actually being a lot like the wonderful show, ""Brooklyn Bridge""--but with a greater emphasis on humor. Well worth seeing--whether you are Asian or not.",26 out of 33 found this helpful.,9.0,9 May 2015

This new ABC series set in 1990's Orlando about a Taiwanses family who moved from Washington D.C. to start a new life is a big winner! It centers around the young man and oldest child in the family named Eddie Huang(Hudson Yang)who is learning more and more American culture in the 90's from the style, music, TV, movies and one liners as this series captures the 90's culture well with it's slang and one liners! A real sugar and spice treat is the performance of the mom Jessica(Constance Wu)she's a sexy and sassy outspoken loving matriarch who guides the ship for the whole Huang clan as her husband(Randall Park)runs his steakhouse. Overall great show that learns us about Asian culture all the while being funny, educated and capturing 90's culture without taking things to serious!

3542,Fresh Off the Boat, Love this show and what this show stands for,"I would first like to say that after watching the first two episodes, this show is fantastic. Not only because it is paving the way for more diversity in the industry, but also because it is a hilarious and charming show. I found myself laughing out loud a various points throughout the episodes and throughly enjoyed getting to know these characters. Regarding to the reviews consisting of complaints about the show's racism toward white people (groan), these viewers are missing the point of the show. This show is portraying what is was like, and still is like for that matter, for Asian families being the minority and the racism THEY face. Yes, the show takes some jabs at Caucasians, but that's hardly racism. It is actually impossible to be racist toward white people, as racism only applies when institutional power or privilege is involved. Since White people have the most privilege in this country, it's impossible to be racist against a white person, or rather nearly impossible. Yes, you can be prejudice toward white, people, but this show is definitely not prejudice. So please don;t write this show off because it's ""being racist toward white people."" I would like to end this review by saying that I am thoroughly pleased that there is finally a show with multiple Asian actors as its main characters. Although one day, I hope there can be shows not specifically about AN Asian American FAMILY, but rather a family that just happens to be Asian. Because yes, there's a difference. Race aside, this show is a refreshing comedy and is definitely unique. It should appeal to all audiences, as long as they keep an open mind. I would be very sad if this show were to get canceled.",88 out of 136 found this helpful.,10.0,6 February 2015
3543,Fresh Off the Boat, Life During Simpler Times,"Fresh Off The Boat is a great TV show that is definitely worth watching on Tuesdays, on A.B.C. Nowadays, a T.V. show seems lucky if it can get passed 1 Season. TV shows that aired a couple of years ago: Trophy Wife and Back In The Game were good, but did not get passed Season 1. This show started earlier this year, and has made it to a second season. I also feel like this show is more worth watching than other TV shows on A.B.C. I also watch Modern Family, The Middle, and The Goldbergs. I feel like this T.V. show is more funny, and more original than those other shows.<br/><br/>So, we can ask what makes this T.V. show good. Well, to start like how The Goldbergs is not done today, but takes place in an unspecified year in the '80s, this T.V. show takes place in the '90s, and so far 1995. I wonder if this T.V. show will ever move to the 2000s? But, I feel like it makes a T.V. show somewhat more entertaining by taking place in the past. Not like the ancient past hundreds of years ago, but recent history. Man, 1995 was already 20-years ago. I feel like they do a great job in bringing the '90s back to life. A lot of people even consider the '90s like the greatest time. Let's think about what was good back then. Well, my Millennial Generation was kids back then. We also grew up with a lot of kids shows that even kids from today seem to prefer what we grew up with, than what they are growing up with. Our parents, from the Baby Booming generation who still seem to remain the dominant generation were more in their prime age, or approaching middle age with kids in school. Now, they're becoming senior citizens. The stock market during the second half of the '90s was like the biggest Bull Market ever in history. Also, sometimes all this digital technology can be a little annoying to how much we rely on it. Sometimes, we wish we could go back to the older methods. This show will show life before the internet was an everyday thing. I again feel like this show will take us back to the '90s, be reminiscent. Like an example, today's episode showed a cereal, or a cereal similar to one we had back then but no longer have, Alpha Bits. Another episode showed a boys pump shoes. I haven't seen those shoes in a long time, like since the '90s. They also show C.D.s and I think one episode talked about a Super Nintendo game. I think it was N.B.A. Jam. So, for adults watching my age watching this show today, it will take us back to when we were kids.<br/><br/>Besides the '90s, what else is good about this show? Well, the main characters of this T.V. show are an Asian family. That seems new, as a lot of families on prime time T.V. are either Caucasian or black. Also, most movies we watch the main characters will not be Asian characters. This T.V. show involves an Asian family moving to Florida in a culture where there aren't many Asian people. Living their lives down there, including Eddie and his middle school life. How he also hangs around his brothers Evan and Emery. Also, showing the life of his Asian parents trying to make a living in the U.S. We have Randall, the Dad and his wife Constance. Constance is definitely a character you'll get to know, as I would definitely consider her the funniest character in the show. She is so cheap, that she'll do anything she can do to get her way and deceive people into getting something at a lower price. She won't spend money on something she doesn't feel like she has to. Randall is a soft-voiced man, hard working, who easily puts up with his wife, and never seems to get mad. This show also has references to Asian culture.<br/><br/>When this T.V. show started to air, at first I didn't think so much about it. It's this way for some T.V. shows. Like I didn't really care for the earlier episodes of Goldbergs. At first it seemed like a T.V. show that was trying to come up with a new idea involving an Asian family on prime-time and trying to be funny, but not really working or nothing new, and just an annoying mother. However, the last few episodes I've seen were great. I've enjoyed the last episodes and today's episodes considering it the most original new show on T.V. and definitely something worth seeing. To summarize what I've written, it will be a great comedy showing an Asian family and Asian culture. It will also pleasantly take us back to the '90s. I think some episodes took place in 1997, but the ones I've seen take place in 1995. It's a show that is a must see.<br/><br/>Oh, and one other thing I want to say that makes this show good. Some T.V. shows like Everybody Loves Raymond and Home Improvement took place in a house or places we were familiar with, like Tim Taylors Tool Time show. We'd only see one side of the house as it was built on a set, and frequently see the characters interacting in those locations. Those shows often times had minimal characters besides the main characters. This show is also good because we get to know more characters, and it seems to be filmed in actual locations, not a set they built for the show. This show also has guest stars, like today's episode had Shaquille O'Neal which was totally cool!! So, this is a show that deserves a 10 and is a must see.",10 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,6 October 2015

3551,Fresh Off the Boat, Watch with an open mind if you wish to enjoy this show,"An open mind is necessary to appreciate this show because some of the content may come off as ""racist"" or stereotypical to some who not aware of the situations in the show. <br/><br/>I've seen some really ignorant reviews of this show but that's only because people are not considering the origins of the story or taking into account the struggles Asian people went through in the 90's (those of which are still going on). I've also seen a lot of comments from white people that, for lack of a better term, are butt-hurt as they feel that this show is being ""racist"" towards white people, but that's just not true. It's true that some of the behavior of white people in the show, for example the suburban women in the neighborhood, is a bit exaggerated, but most of the other mean stuff is true to many Asian Americans. <br/><br/>This show is great on many levels because it's ambitious and bold. Fresh Off the Boat does NOT have to represent all of Asian America and it doesn't, so comments about FOB misrepresenting Asian Americans are ignorant. As Constance Wu said in an interview, ""'If you see Tina Fey on television, you're not like, ""All white women are like Tina Fey.'"". <br/><br/>I hope FOB gets more seasons and love because it is brilliant.

3554,Fresh Off the Boat, Not what I thought it would be,"I was pretty excited to hear about a Asian show since there aren't any programs on TV with an Asian cast as the leads. I think it is pretty cool to promote diversity and ABC taking the risk by allowing Asians to finally have their own show plus Asian comedic characters these days are pretty one dimensional and lack the deep personality (compared to non Asian comedic characters). That being said, when I watched Fresh Off the Boat this week, the characters I feel seem too simple, shallow, and once again you have one dimensional characters with not much of a likable personality. I guess I'm too much of a realist but we have seen these stereotypical characters before on other shows and mainstream movies. The story being centered around the little kid who is portly and acts like a wannabe gangster rapper, the mother who is stereotyped like a Tiger mom, the father sounding obsessed trying to please white people with his business and the non Asians coming across as being rather racists etc etc are all about something to do race and they're all negative for some reason. The title itself is pretty offensive and I can't believe they went with that title (and yes I know it's based on the real life of celebrity chef Eddie Huang's book). I think also too that this show seems to be only a hit to be made fun of because they're Asian like William Hung. Such a shame, I was really hoping for a positive, inspiring show with interesting characters but the negative stereotypical humor and characters just seems really distracting and not really all that funny.

3556,Fresh Off the Boat," The most racist show on TV, but that's OK because all the racism is against whites","This is a cringe worthy show that only the regressive left could find funny because there is a constant barrage of racist insults towards whites and others. Now, to be honest, I don't care. All racial groups need ribbing. But I can't help but sit and watch and consider if the roles were reversed the left's collective heads would be exploding. It's interesting because it also perpetuates a lot of Asian stereotypes that, for decades now, we've been told are either not true or are simply racist to point out. Unlike something like All in the Family, where racism was treated as something to be looked down upon, it seems to be portrayed as something that is not only OK, but something that the Chinese embrace. What's funny is that Constance Wu has come down on others for being ""racist"" but apparently cannot see her own hypocrisy. <br/><br/>Now, if not for the left's constant barrage over the course of my entire life of ""everything is racist"" this would probably be an enjoyable show. But, alas, the left has ruined the ability for people to laugh at one another or themselves (something which should be OK). Maybe, with that in mind, this show is a step in the right direction... but I doubt it.",22 out of 55 found this helpful.,3.0,1 June 2017
3557,Fresh Off the Boat, Why sell a show about Taïwanese characters and not knowing anything about Taïwan?,"The show is not that bad : it's funny - sometimes at least.
It clearly should get some fresh jokes, because it's quite repetitive, but it's ok.<br/><br/>But how can you portray some Taïwanese characters and knowing nothing about Taïwan? The show keep presenting people talking about themselves as ""chinese"". Really? Are swe still living in a world where people mistake Taïwan for China?<br/><br/>Except for the few first seasons, when Eddie Huang was still participating, it's all wrong. They don't speak like taiwanese, they don't think like taiwanese, they don't eat like taïwanese (and if you know Taïwan, you know how that part is important).<br/><br/>it's like the show became a lie about Eddie Huang's life.

3560,Into the Badlands, Not for over-thinkers,"I get that people want this to be entirely believable and that aspects, such as the lack of guns in a world where other machines exist, appears to be hard to fathom - but think of all the other movies that have unbelievable components - such as why does Obe Wan wear a raggedy robe in a time when they can fly through space? He could still wear a robe, but did it have to look like a potato sack? How can Batman really compete with Superman, seriously?<br/><br/>Anyway the mix of martial arts with supernatural and post- apocalyptic themes would make most people think this is a horrible combination for a TV series ... but not if you are a fan of old Chinese martial arts movies.<br/><br/>The fight scenes in this movie are incredible considering it is made for television. The acting isn't absolutely stunning, but acting never was in many of those Chinese movies and it was never meant to be. The main characters Danny Wu and Martin Csokas both do a satisfactory job in their roles. Emily Beecham's portrayal of the Widow has grown on me and she looks really impressive in some of the fight scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the supporting actors, particularly the fighters, I admit leave a little to be desired acting wise, but generally ... you don't want them to do much more than lose.<br/><br/>I believe if you over think the reality of this TV series, you may miss some of the good aspects of it, but admittedly this type of show isn't for everyone.<br/><br/>Having just watched the first season, I loved the finale and am eagerly looking forward to seeing more.",261 out of 316 found this helpful.,9.0,17 November 2015

3562,Into the Badlands, The next cult series.....?,"You know the moment you start watching that some series are going to attract something of a cult following. My suspicion is, Into the Badlands, is one such series. <br/><br/>Into the Badlands takes already interesting elements from 19th century Southern USA, cyberpunk, Gung (Kung) Fu and Samurai/Western action series, mystical and medieval epics and drops the whole fruit salad of seemingly incompatible concepts, into the creative blender. <br/><br/>The resulting series is an elaborate and flamboyant cocktail, that works in spite of itself. The primary reason it works, is all these cultural icons are familiar. The futuristic setting is something of an anachronism, reminiscent of any 19th century Southern plantation. Lurid splendor and vice, gained from the oppressive toil of poppy field workers called cogs(cogs in a wheel), who are little better than slaves. <br/><br/>Sitting alongside this, is a little Mad Max-ian magic in terms of machines and vehicles that populate this world. Technology, resurrected from a whispered past that has seemingly been and gone but is not entirely forgotten. <br/><br/>That familiarity contrasts another, the transplanted martial arts arena, reminiscent of classic films like Enter the Dragon, mixed with a dash of Gladiator, a little mysticism and any medieval epic you care to name. <br/><br/>The result is a highly imaginative, visually luxurious, mesmerizing watch, thats instantly engaging and very enjoyable. Provided, that is, you don't over think things and accept this creative work for what it is. I have been addicted from episode one and plan to keep watching.

The main story is decent. With tons of plot holes. It's predictable af but trust me, the directors are going to show you some good scenes. The whole world is just amazing ! They've build up some great sets, and then you can see them destroy it. The character development is ok, I guess. But the acting is just on high level horrible. Just like my grammar ! There is this character M.K who is just the worst thing in the show. Bad character and really bad acting from the actor. Same goes to Tilda. These two characters and actors are just terrible. You can see Daniel Wu who don't really know how to express a feeling ( mostly anger ) , but the guy has an awesome character. Sunny is such a badass ! Big exception are Marton, Nick Frost, Babou and Lorraine Toussaint. Maybe with some good writing ( story, diallogues and character development ) and some better castings, this show would've been perfect. And btw, the intro and the theme song are awesome ! My boy Mike Shinoda made the theme song. He did a really good job.

3570,Into the Badlands, The best new show on TV?,"In this current climate of book and comic book adaptations, we're getting used to seeing well-loved characters and stories being brought to life (with admittedly varying results) on the big and small screens. While this is all fine and good, it's a little sad to think that there's been very little in the way of completely original movies or TV shows in recent times.<br/><br/>Thankfully, shows like 'Enter the Badlands' come along every now and then to remind us that there are still some wildly creative and ambitious folks out there in the industry that are intent on unleashing their creations on an unsuspecting public. And it would appear that 'Enter the Badlands' came completely out of the blue as, despite being on many geek TV/comic/gaming forums and groups, I'd not heard a single thing about the show until one of my colleagues at work started raving about it and how amazing it was. <br/><br/>After watching the opening scene on the first episode, I had to pick up my jaw from the floor. Not only was this one of the prettiest, most visually arresting shows I'd ever seen, it was clearly going to be incredibly entertaining. It opens, you see, with one of the finest fight scenes I've ever seen on a TV show - if you think along the lines of the sublime sword-based fight scenes in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', that should give you some idea of what the opening brawl of 'Enter the Badlands' is like, but with some eye- watering, bone-crunching and bloody slaughtering of bad guys added into the mix. <br/><br/>But this show isn't all about the fighting. Well, OK, it is really but thankfully it's backed up with an intriguing plot and some excellent acting performances. It's difficult to wade into the story without giving too much away, but the show appears to be set in a post-apocalyptic world (I think?) and in an indeterminate part of the world that is ruled over by five 'barons' who are in a power struggle over the regional resources. That's about all I want to give away in terms of plot!<br/><br/>I've only watched the first three episodes so far, but I'm absolutely convinced that this is definitely one of the best new TV shows I've seen since... Well, Marvel's Daredevil, to be honest!

Even though, the writers said it was loosely based on something called Journey To The West.<br/><br/>The casting is pretty diverse and every character breaks stereotypes. I LOVE that they introduced a loveable fat character who can fight. There's no reason fat people can't be athletes. There are plenty of fat athletes in football, powerlifting and martial arts. They do all the training and don't restrict calories. Happens all the time in the real world and I don't know why they don't depict fat people as athletes at least some of the time.<br/><br/>I like that Sunny ends up meeting his sister by the latest season.

3585,Lie to Me, Excellent show with a great cast! I'm not lying!,"Lie to Me is a very interesting series, with a lot of humor and a very interesting premise in my opinion. In addition the 4 Cast members all play their role very good and add to the show's freshness.<br/><br/>Tim Roth (great as always!) plays Dr. Cal Lightman, a human lie-detector, who's able to detect any lie from people's body language. That ability comes in handy when catching criminals, but it also provides him with the misfortune of always knowing when someone is not honest with him, sometimes leading to unfortunate situations. Lightman is a cynic and unpleasant character, who's willing to do anything to find out if someone is telling the truth or not.<br/><br/>The series also features a strong supporting cast, including Kelli Williams as Dr. Gillian Foster, whose husband is cheating on her, a fact everyone of her colleagues is aware of, except herself. Brendan Hines' character is always telling the truth no matter how embarrassing and Monica Raymund starrs as Ria Torres, who has the natural ability of seeing if someone is lying. That often leads to conflict with Lightman, who refuses to believe her ability is as accurate as his, since he needed years of training, while she was just born with her talent.<br/><br/>Yes, there are parallels with other series, especially ""The Mentalist"", but those are pretty much limited to the ability of the main character being able to detect the truth from people's movements and voices. Besides ""Lie to Me"" is focused on the science of detecting lies, something completely ignored in ""The Mentalist"". For example, it will take a person who's telling the truth longer to respond than one who's lying, because the one telling the truth needs to think about the answer.<br/><br/>The only real flaw after 5 episodes is in my opinion that not enough character history is provided. We literally don't know anything about the characters, except a few details. I have no doubt we'll eventually find out more, but it's about time they start. All in all, the series is great fun and entertainment, and maybe you'll be able to pick up one or the other lie in the future, thanks to Lightman's group.",111 out of 130 found this helpful.,9.0,7 March 2009

3588,Lie to Me, Downhill slope from the brilliant Season 1.,"It started off as a brilliant premise. The first episode gripped me with its ingenuity - it's a fantastic idea to analyse the body language and verbal nuances of not only criminals but regular people. Maybe a little far-fetched at times but incredibly interesting. Cal was eccentric, a British 'House' maybe, but I enjoyed his acting and although I usually don't like mixing British and American actors in one cast I thought that in Lie to Me, it worked swimmingly. It's somewhat reminiscent of the show 'Psych', but with better actors, fewer jokes and a different target audience.<br/><br/>Now I'm watching season 3 and I'm considering not watching the rest. It's almost as if the writers assumed that their viewers all watched from the very first episode. No more clever observations with body language, no more quick zooms to show the audience what emotion the accused is showing, no more focus on the original premise. Not only do I find that there's less and less observation going on and more focus on guesswork and 'gut feelings', but it seems the range of emotions being detected has literally been reduced to the recurring 'guilt', 'fear' and 'shame'. Where is the broad range? Where is what we saw in season 1? It feels like the writers assume that their viewers already know the whole shtick of being shown exactly how a character displays a certain emotion, skips that part and goes straight to the diagnoses. Not only that but it seems that the characters are manipulated less and less and it's become more about tricking the characters into coming to the Lightman Group and being interrogated in the box.<br/><br/>I've also noticed that the 3 supporting characters are constantly being berated by Cal Lightman. He seems to give less and less weight to their opinions and it always silently criticising them. This wouldn't bother me had it been that way from the start - but as the character of Cal becomes less likable due to his now highly exaggerated eccentricity, his two subordinates are reduced to bumbling, guessing idiots in his presence. They rarely make intelligent observations - in fact...where did the science even go in this program?!<br/><br/>Another thing I don't enjoy generally in programs, something that has been used here, is the emphasis on Cal's shallow subplot. Just as the science is mentioned less, so the back story of Cal Lightman is emphasised. Granted, he and the actor who plays his daughter have incredible on-screen chemistry and she is rather likable with her ability to call her father out on his faults, all while flashing her big doey eyes. But in my opinion, her character is overly mature for a 16- year-old girl and it's becoming irritating that she constantly barges into her father's office demanding to know what he's up to. The others respond to her as if she were their boss, not as if she were a 16-year- old girl with no business being around the office. And...can someone tell her to change her facial expression? Pretty please?<br/><br/>Overall I enjoy the show but I really wish the writers would stay true to the original intent of the show - to play around with the fascinating science of human behaviour and come up with mysteries that can be cleverly unwoven by behavioural observation, rather than simply interrogating every single witness and showing a gros plan of their apparently scared faces. I'm giving this a 5 because the first season was brilliant, and as its quality decreased, so did the score.",39 out of 46 found this helpful.,,6 August 2011
3589,Lie to Me, One of those rare T.V. Show's,"Lie to me is a true rarity and gem among T.V. show's, it hasn't been done a million times over. Lie to me stars Tim Roth as Dr.Cal Lightman a doctor who specializes in body language and vocal patterns; together with his team of specially trained associates he helps the police and U.S. Government solve there toughest crimes. Lie to Me is a great show because it capitalizes on a whole new field of television, all you see on modern T.V. today is cop show's more cop show's and medical drama's.

This show has a style and mind of it's own. It doesn't follow the extremely(and I mean that lightly) worn path of other show's that maybe similar or try to be like it. Take Castle for instance, it's a show about a murder mystery writer who helps' the police solve there case's; Now how many times has that been done? Lie to me is a completely original and highly entertaining show that I know that people will just love if they give it a chance.",106 out of 134 found this helpful.,7.0,6 April 2009
3590,Lie to Me, Well done!,"So far I've only seen the pilot episode. I admit it. I've got a mad man-crush for this show.<br/><br/>The show's about Dr. Cal Lightman (Tim Roth) as a sort of a superhero. He's a human lie detector. He looks for dozens of subtle tells in the face and on the body. He's studied human communication so intensely that he always knows if someone is concealing something.<br/><br/>His company, so far, is involved with police and political matters. There's some significant room to bring in lots of personal interplay as well (we've seen a glimpse of that already).<br/><br/>This is from Imagine Entertainment, the company that does 24. I hope that, as the show evolves, that the fate of the planet doesn't rest on everything that Dr. Lightman does and says. One Jack Bauer is plenty, thanks.<br/><br/>I also hope that the show doesn't become driven by an overarching nemesis. Shows with a strong internal mythology and skin-tight story arcs can be fun, but we've seen so much of them lately that I wouldn't mind seeing the episodic adventures of a flawed hero trying to do something right.",132 out of 169 found this helpful.,10.0,22 January 2009
3591,Lie to Me," So far, so good...","Last night I watched the premiere of Lie to Me on Fox. I'd seen the previews for months, and when I saw that Tim Roth was coming to television, him being one of my favorite actors, I was both excited and dubious at the same time. Another of my favorite actors, Christian Slater, had made an awesome TV debut on My Own Worst Enemy. But the show had been canceled, and I honestly didn't want to see the same thing happen to as great an actor as Tim Roth.<br/><br/>But last night's pilot delivered many great performances, not only from Roth, but the supporting guest cast as well. The episode itself had a pleasant mixture of drama, comedy, and sharp dialog.<br/><br/>Despite what some may think, it is possible to tell from a show's pilot whether or not the show will succeed. From what I saw last night, I can see this show going a long, long way. The formula that the show's staff have come up with is, yes, still in its conceptual stages. But they're definitely on to something, and I hope to see a rising popularity in America for Dr. Lightman and his team.",101 out of 132 found this helpful.,9.0,22 January 2009
3592,Lie to Me, An excellent beginning...,"Disregarding Reservoir Dogs, I think this has to be Roth's best work. Roth is extremely in touch with Dr. Lightman and you feel as if he truly enjoys playing this character. The show leaves you in total disbelief at points and instills a hunger for more and more episodes. I strongly suggest this show to anyone who is interested in an incredibly engaging and entertaining drama series as well as to anyone who is interested about Dr. Paul Ekman's work on facial expressions, and body languages as it relates to emotion. Solid television series. I look forward to the next few episodes. For anyone who has missed the first few episodes, the television series is now online at hulu.com.

3593,Lie to Me, Revealing Hidden Lies out of Expressions,"When FBI hires a psychological specialist to derive benefit from developed interrogation techniques, detectives decide to cooperate with this specialist and his team. After a couple criminal suspects are interrogated within the usual method, Dr. Cal Lightman reveals his own method. Specifically focusing on facial expressions and gestures of the suspects, Dr. Lightman's techniques receive approval. Thus he takes his partner and a new trainee with him to settle down at the police head-quarters.<br/><br/>The rising star of villain roles from '90s, Tim Roth, had shone through ""Reservoir Dogs(1992)"" and ""Pulp Fiction(1994)"" on the silver-screen. Though he was passing over poor years of his career recently. Here in ""Lie to Me"" he's being precisely rediscovered as a leading actor, playing Dr. Lightman. Under Samuel Baum's screenplay and character development, Roth has brought himself to perfectly fit within his role, the way we know him. Wasn't he the one, who reveals that the traitor in the gang team in Reservoir Dogs, just with using his glowering glances? Then there is Kelli Williams who plays Dr. Lightman's partner. Together with Roth they have an excellent chemistry having opposite characters with each other. Dr. Lightman's new trainee Loker also adds more fun to the film, where the mood begins to get boring. Loker has made himself known as being extremely straightforward at the office, so his straightforward behaviors seem like earning him the credibility he desires to have. In fact, he's afraid of Dr. Lightman's psychological techniques which always work as effective as a lie detector.<br/><br/>Despite the interesting script and successful characterizations, story development is very weak since the plot doesn't draw any benefit from using any subplot. It's of the crime/thriller genre for a TV-series, and the story is very plain, thus leans its back against the actors. The mood gets boring through repeating the display samples of how to catch people lying; and only a bad sense of humor comes to rescue after that. If we analyze thoroughly; Dr. Lightman first explains his theories, then shows the proof of each one with a live person sample, finally he reaches a conclusion and adds his thesis as a new rule every time. His theory depends on a basis that says: ""A person's body contradicts his words, when he's lying"". If you've watched the film ""Analyze This(1999)"" ; you might consider one important fact that if somebody, whom you're talking to is unstrung for the moment, acts as if he/she is calm; then Dr.Lightman's thesis would deny itself; just like Robert De Niro did while talking to Billy Crystal. Dr. Lightman shakes hands with the suspect two times at his interrogation. After his second hand shake, Lightman gets the idea that the suspect was lying; since his body temperature dropped leaving him a cooler touch in the palm of his hand. In Michael Douglas's ""Basic Instinct(1992)"" ; Douglas was under interrogation at the beginning of the movie with three detectives and a lie detector. He used the same method that De Niro used in Analyze This, even fooling the lie detector; which works with a similar idea: Depending on the change of blood pressure in suspect's body between hearing and answering questions.<br/><br/>After the first couple episodes, I hoped we'll be seeing some criminals who can fool Dr.Lightman; to offer more tension and suspense. Yet, I was disappointed with the same formula used in the following episodes, lacking tension and suspense. There are questions of justice coming to mind; such as the lack of evidence and the ultimate question of how influential can Dr.Lightman's methods be in a law suite, if the suspect is supported by his/her lawyer. Overall, ""Lie to Me"" is a good choice for sharing an evening with your whole family. Only sex-related dialogues and mild language cannot be suitable for children at all.",18 out of 21 found this helpful.,7.0,17 December 2009

In this age of dumbing down broadcast TV to the point of being unwatchable, its ""Smart TV"" approach really is worth supporting...maybe it will start a trend; kind of an anti-Survivor.<br/><br/>Murdoch will probably kill it so enjoy it while you can.

But I don't think it's just the lies that interest me, I'm also very in love with the actors and characters. Especially Tim Roth. Aka Dr. Cal Lightman.

3597,Lie to Me, Great series ... but starting to drift,"When this series appeared in 2009, I'd have rated it a notch higher than today. As it stands, it is kind of a ""face-based"" CSI show. It's based on Paul Ekman's work on universal facial tells (""micromovements"") which reveal what a person is subconsciously feeling.<br/><br/>It has pretty cool story lines and is very well acted, but the characters are starting to drift into dangerous territory.<br/><br/>The lead character, for example, is turning into a superhuman that is always smarter than everyone, always right and no matter the dilemma, always ""playing"" (cleverly conning) everyone.<br/><br/>None of the other main characters can challenge him - even his business partner has been watered down in power.<br/><br/>Instead of experts using an amazing tool, it's becoming about an amazing person using a tool.<br/><br/>If you look into this issue, you'll find that Roth's contract allows him ""right of refusal"" on any script. Writers have complained, but this is one of those situations when the actor has storyline control.<br/><br/>Hopefully, we'll see the show move back to having problems that ""can"" baffle the expert(s) and show how they can brilliantly deal with situations when the science only takes them part of the way - which is what makes the CSI formula so successful.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,,28 January 2011
3598,Lie to Me, Canceled and for good cause,"This show burst out of the gates in the first season with some of the best television I had seen in a long time. This was a fantastic drama with great characters and a great concept. Unfortunately, the viewers for the pilot were over 12 million people, but had dropped by 4 million for the season finale. After that, the show started going off in new directions that did not mesh with the way the characters were being developed. One can only guess that Fox had a hand in this, pressuring the writers to bring in more viewers at all costs. AS you would expect, the results of that were not good, to say the least.<br/><br/>The second season was flawed, but still entertaining. The third season, however, was a complete disaster. It needed to be canceled at that point as it was no longer salvageable so, dare I say, Fox made the right choice.

3601,Lie to Me, This goes hard!,"I think it is fair to say Lightman plays God. However the real people on godmode are the brilliant creators, producers, writers and creative minds behind this show.<br/><br/>I immediately got hooked from the pilot's prologue of the phenomenal marriage between anthropology and forensic lie detection. It only got better from then on.<br/><br/>Before I pour odes on Lightman's quirkiness who happens to be a 'walking question mark' I have to laud Kelli Williams' portrayal of Dr. Foster. She sure comes out to be a clear winner - silently- of a soft spoken sage with African reginal wisdom and compassion in an absolutely empowering and strong character. Perfect foil to Lightman's eccentricity and to keep him grounded. In fact, the script reads off your mouth and inner thoughts when at one point Emily blurts out how she loved her company even more than her own mom's.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, it has a lot of psychological and emotional dynamics and sub-layers and drama. Lightman reminds me of Spader's character in Boston Legal and it does have a Boston Legal vibe all over it- which I LOVE by the way having long run out of options and fuel after exhausting each and every episode of the latter.<br/><br/>So it was godsend in a way and saved my life. I don't watch TV or TV series but some shows like this one and Prison Break forces me to be on marathon.<br/><br/>And in fact Kelli Williams was also in the The Practice - pre-cursor to Boston Legal. <br/><br/>It is a bit like a detective template with law firm office vibes. And just like Boston Legal it doesn't shy away from taking bold strides and making bold statements.<br/><br/>Interracial dating, Muslims are terrorist as well as plight of father having seen his Islamic son get slaughtered, Korean culture, holding police or fire fighter's responsible ... in fact just like any creative endeavors the producers tell hard facts as it is and doesn't shy away to sugarcoat it in a PC-laden culture and goes hard from an omniscient narrative sparing no one.<br/><br/>In fact, just like some ""god-like"" characters take neutral point of view akin to comedians- again going back to Spader's unscrupulous characters be it Alan Shore or Reddington, Jim Carrey's Mask, Deadpool, the caller from Phonebooth, Jigsaw, Hannibal Lecter, the Joker... all these are transcendent of mortal views of ethics in their human form of game.<br/><br/>I mean for God's sakes, Lightman lies as he pleases, bends rules and laws, outright and blatantly deceives, fakes news to set people up... almost as if he can transgress any boundaries simply to the carte blanche of his mastery of his game.<br/><br/>It borderlines ego- almost as if that of a sociopath- but it is more of a restrained form of narcissism developed from years and years of research in the jungle and cultivation of his talent to a form of supernatural genius which he again and again tries to drill and inculcate in his protege's head - Ria Torres- that talent without perspiration is a genius well lost.<br/><br/>I could go at lengths about the mentor-protege dynamics, the touch on his parental obligation, Loker's lack of internal filter and what not as a nice capstone, but it would be one long essay.<br/><br/>Tout court, if you love intellectual, character driven dramas that faces tough challenging question marks of the modern zeitgeist, then this show is for you.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,20 July 2018
3602,Lie to Me, Brilliant!,"Lie to Me is certainly a one of a kind show, that brings together certain qualities of other well loved shows and wraps them up beautifully into one. The lead character, Dr.Lightman may remind you of ""House"", when it comes to his decision making and intelligence and the show's dynamics perhaps a little of ""Criminal Minds"" when it comes to profiling, and ""CSI"" as far as applying science in law enforcement...<br/><br/>However, the idea behind this show is quite revolutionary, for it centers around the science of lie detection and applying it in so many fields including but not limited to law enforcement. Even though body ""language"" may be culture specific, Lie to Me exposes the fact that there are ""micro-expressions"" that we make involuntarily as our face responds to different emotions, whether fear, contempt, arousal, or even when telling a lie, that is universal to all... The show even inserts real images of real people (mostly well known politicians, athletes or felons) that have the same micro-expression the character they are interviewing does, which makes the show that much more credible and interesting.<br/><br/>The actors are simply brilliant, Tim Roth who plays the lead Dr.Cal Lightman, is excellent, and Kelli Williams who plays Dr.Foster his partner at the Lightman group makes the show that much more enjoyable as she plays the role of the intelligent yet well balanced and well grounded woman, that is perhaps the only one that can keep Cal in check, and they have incredible on screen chemistry.<br/><br/>Long story short, this show is extremely entertaining and thought provoking, and every episode is better than the last, I'm sure it will stay with us for a while, and I must say, I can't wait to see what more they have to show us.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,19 July 2010
3603,Lie to Me, Not convincing,I find this show rather weak. Roth's performance is somewhere between hyperactive and self-satisfied so for me there was no way to emote to his character. The story lines are rather confused and try to pack too much into a short period of time. All in all there seems to me a lack of focus in the writing and direction of the show. It's also difficult to understand what he actually does as he reads body language but we never really get a full explanation as to what he deduces from which gesture or facial expression.

On the basis of such tiny, simple gestures, they will set out to hang someone.<br/><br/>The only thing more ridiculous is the fact that there are people out there who believe this ignorant stupidity.<br/><br/>I've made three attempts.

3605,Lie to Me," People lie, and it can be detected","I have to say that my expectation were high. Partly, the show did fulfill them. The main character is very good actor and believable. Side characters fill their part adequately.<br/><br/>Pros: Show main idea is fresh and interesting. Acting is generally good and episodes vary in content.<br/><br/>Cons: I wouldn't go as far as saying that Im an expert in body language, but it is safe to say that I know what Im talking about. Its absolutely idiotic to say that someone lies, because they touch their face. It is very general mistake to take one gesture and misread the intention. One needs to study the normal behavior of certain person. To study how they react to different situations. If this cannot be accomplished, one needs to ""normalise"" the situation. Meaning, to decide how would a person normally act in certain situation. Moreover, one gesture DOES NOT reveal anything. Experts are generally looking cluster of gestures (meaning several clues, this can be compared to police investigation). Body language only amplifies the feeling. This really takes the edge of this program.<br/><br/>When they discover certain gesture they directly jump to conclusions, like in CSI. They wont even consider other possibilities. After watching six episodes, it gets really unreal and repetitive. As an example, they go and search a person's house, just because the person closed her hand-palm, when a question was asked. In real life it needs a warrant, which needs a probable cause. Not a hunch of a person, who is not even a police. It simply undermines peoples intelligence. ""You are lying"" ""Now you are telling the truth""; thats mainly and unfortunately only what this show is about. There isn't ongoing plot, and character development is one to two minutes per episode.<br/><br/>Summasummarum: Its good way to kill an hour, but only for four or five hours, then one has seen it all.

Maybe there's some real science behind it all, but come on, what happens if someone just doesn't admit the crime? Basically these people are human lie detectors, and mind you one of them is a 'natural', born with the ability to tell if someone is lying, or acquired that ability naturally, without studying.

3607,Lie to Me, This show is good. Now that's a Lie.,"""We're not magicians, we're scientists"" Oh, so 'Lie To Me' would like us to believe. Unfortunately for us, the new FOX show is undone partially by the silliness of its own premise. Considering the amount of lies told and believed, it is hard to imagine a person, let alone four, can tell a lie, within a few seconds and 100% of the time. Stories about a man who has an uncanny ability to tell lies from the truth defy reality in such a way that it alienates the viewer.<br/><br/>The problem with 'Lie To Me' is that it feels so fake. They way it is filmed, and the way the characters easily figure out complex problems without much time, gives the audience a feeling that their being duped. Each episode appears to be complicated but somehow it always wraps up into a neat package that's supposed to be easy to digest. As a result there is no suspense and the show feels flat. Normally, films or TV shows about remarkable people work because of the obstacles they must overcome. However, in 'Lie to Me', there simply aren't enough obstacles the characters need to overcome and everything seems so easy. There is no pleasure watching someone figure out problems when they always get it right. <br/><br/>""Lie To Me also suffers from the complexities of its premise. In order to make the show feel authentic, a good portion of each episode consists of the characters explaining things and this gets quite boring. <br/><br/>As each new episode airs, the show's formula becomes more and more obvious, to the point at which one cannot find an ounce of reality. And the clichés keep on coming. <br/><br/>The characters are quite stale and are caricatures. They lack any complexity and emotional depth and are thus hard to believe.<br/><br/>As a result, it is slick and unsatisfying. <br/><br/>'Lie To Me' feels exactly like that: a lie.",44 out of 92 found this helpful.,3.0,23 February 2009
3608,Babylon 5," Intense, breathtaking, incredible . . .","Well, what to say? For starters, I'm a die-hard Classic Star Trek fan, who had until recently been aware of B5 without ever having seen it. Then, about four months ago, my best friend lent me his B5 DVDs of season 1. And I have to admit, I'm impressed.<br/><br/>To be fair, it took a little while - I was a little wary at first, but it quickly grew on me. Once I got a feel for what was going on, and how the characters worked, yes. It grabbed me. I especially liked Jeffrey Sinclair as a leader-type - someone more thoughtful than your bog-standard action-hero.<br/><br/>Then, after a long wait, my friend lent me seasons 2-4. Again, I was a little wary at first; it had been a while since I'd seen season 1, and I knew that Sinclair had been replaced by John Sheridan. Out of the two leaders, I prefer Sinclair, and for the first few episodes of season 2, I was unconvinced. Then, about a third of the way in, the pace quickened up - considerably. And while I still prefer Sinclair as a leader, by about episode 8 of season 2, I found that I didn't have the time to miss him, things were moving that quickly, there were so many plots unravelling . . .<br/><br/>And therein lies the hook. The amount of detail is extraordinary, the way all the characters and plots became intertwined is amazing. The series is so intense - I was watching up to eight or nine episodes a day, for a week solid! And might I say again, I was a Star Trek fan who had never seen B5 before in my life! As many people before me have said, this show isn't a nice neat everything-gets-resolved-in-the-space-of-one-episode type. Details get carried over. There are long story-arcs. There are things happening all the time. Everything has a reason. You see an insignificant detail in season 1, suddenly it is explained in season 3 as being very relevant for reasons you didn't even know about back in the first season.<br/><br/>If there is one stumbling block for B5, I would have to say that some of the computer-generated images (CGI) are not always up to standard. This is especially true of planet surfaces, in particular Mars. But that's quibbling. The key to good science-fiction is believability. The characters have to act as if the basic premise of the series is perfectly normal to them. That's what makes it work. That's why in the original series of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry made a point of not explaining the workings of anything. For example, Captain Kirk picks up a phaser and fires it without stopping to explain what it was or what it did - after all, in a contemporary series, nobody goes out of their way to say how a gun. We know how it works - so by watching Kirk fire his phaser, we understand implicitly that it is a weapon. The same principle applies in B5 - although to a lesser degree.<br/><br/>Moving on to the acting - this show was blessed with some wonderful people. In particular, Mira Furlan as Delenn is worth watching; she is possessed of a presence and an aura most actors can only dream of. She is one of those people that when she is speaking, becomes the absolute centre of attention without really trying. Also, as stated above, I am a fan of Cmdr Sinclair - and I think Michael O'Hare's portrayal of him is wonderfully underplayed. It would have been so easy just to play him as an action-hero, but no. I really do miss that character. Another favourite would have to be Stephen Furst as Vir - DS9 fans just think Rom, and you're halfway there. Not to mention the ""odd couple"" of Peter Jurasik (Londo) and Andreas Katsulas (G'Kar) - wonderful.<br/><br/>Actually, that's another point - the aliens. The aliens in B5 are more real than the aliens in Star Trek. Their agendas are much better fleshed out. We understand the whys and wherefores much more than the stereotypes of so many Star Trek races (and remember I'm a longterm Star Trek fan). To use Trek parallels, the Minbari are like the Vulcans and Bajorans combined in temperament, the Centauri are probably most comparable to the Cardassians, and the Narns, well, I'd say Klingons, but that's selling them short. Klingon-Bajoran, perhaps. Any hardcore B5 fans offended by those descriptions - sorry, I'm just using them as guidelines to the uninitiated Trek fans. These B5 races are much more real, less stereotyped. (Although the less said about the Drazi, the better!) To summarise, then - I think this is the best sci-fi since Original Star Trek.

3609,Babylon 5, Great Maker!,"Babylon 5 is the greatest science fiction show in the history of television.<br/><br/>A bold statement I know, especially when one considers the original series of Star Trek which is certainly the genre's most celebrated. It's true to say that Star Trek has had a much greater cultural impact and has lasted longer than any other SF show, but when watching it again, it has dated. I'm not questioning the brilliance of some early episodes - they're still well written and thought provoking - season 1 of the old series is still fantastic. However, Babylon 5 is the Star Trek for today in that it deals with issues in a modern context. Whereas ST was a bunch of cleverly disguised morality plays about 1960's issues like communism, nuclear war and racial prejudice, B5 deals with social control, economics, war, governmental corruption, social psychology and spirituality. Although the issues discussed in Star Trek haven't gone away, they're not foremost in the psyche of mr average anymore.<br/><br/>Alongside the fact that B5 discusses issues at the forefront, it has many other virtues. The main one is that the story continues from episode to episode - even now when I re-watch season one (just released on DVD) I can see events taking shape that will lead to major plotlines in future years. I'm not just talking about Data gradually becoming more human or Worf tussling with the dying Kilingon Empire every 7 or 8 episodes ... I'm talking about characters and plots that can be seen to be evolving each week without an obvious good guys vs bad guys scenario.<br/><br/>I can't remember how many times I've watched a B5 episode and had a flashback to an earlier one - the sudden realisation of the importance of an event that seemed insignificant is very satisfying. Even in the 5th series, you'll be thinking back to an episode in series 1 and feeling smug that you got it.<br/><br/>'Ahhhh! That's what it meant!' You'll be saying that a lot.<br/><br/>The characters are wonderfully fleshed out by some great actors. They're complex beings who have to deal with temptations and failings as well as triumphs and successes. Sometimes things go deeply wrong and (get this Trek Fans) IT'S NOT SORTED OUT BY THE END OF THE EPISODE!! That's right - people change realistically - everything's not reset each week! Don't get me wrong - I'm a huge Trek fan myself, but it's always irked me that everything is just so hunky dory (don't people have arguments on the enterprise?)<br/><br/>It's very satisfying to see a character that you've come to know and love wrestle with their morals and sometimes make the wrong choices (just like we all do.) In the end, we all knew the various crewmembers of the Enterprise would do the right thing. You can't say the same for the characters on B5 - they're fallible and thus much more interesting.<br/><br/>There's many other great things about the show, but for me, the story and the characters are the most important. Sure, I know it doesn't look as expensive as Star Trek and yes I know it's hard to get into because it's not a whole load of 'one shot' episodes! If you like Star Trek and consider yourself intelligent - step up to the next level and watch B5!<br/><br/>I guarantee that if you stick with it for a while, you'll be glad you did because the payoffs are enormous.

3610,Babylon 5, Take it from me; it's brilliant. Full Stop.,"B5 is in all respects a revolutionary piece of work. It was the first SF TV-series that actually had all the episodes and story-arcs in place before shooting(as opposed to StarTrek and the likes). Although I have always been a Trekkie I consider Babylon-5 to be much better. This is SF on TV as you would read it in a good book. The actors do a fine job(especially Andreas Katsulas and Peter Jurasic) and although almost all of the aliens are of humanoid shape they manage to behave quite alien sometimes.<br/><br/>This is required watching for every self-respecting ScienceFiction-fan. In that respect it is on a par with StarWars and StarTrek.<br/><br/>B-5 just goes deeper that the Paramount-format or the eternal battle of good versus evil. In B-5 there are hardly any absolute evil creatures, all the characters have their dark side, just like you and me.<br/><br/>It was a miracle that Warner Bros was so supportive of JMS. You can tell by the result that this was somewhat of a lovebaby. I wonder how many years it will be before something better will be made, I fear it will take years and years to top this series.",134 out of 148 found this helpful.,,21 July 2004
3611,Babylon 5, The High-Water Mark of Science Fiction/Fantasy!,"WOW is the word which best describes this program! It is an epic story of legends in a world that is believable interpretation of the future two and a half centuries from now. It is set in a world where humans are now a space faring race, capable of crossing the galaxy in months using a technology called a Jumpgate. The people of Earth have at this point come together in corporation to form a world government known as EarthGov. The humans aren't alone; they occupy the universe with mysterious races like the Vorlons, Shadows, and Minbarie. The leading heroes, Jeffery Sinclair and John Sheridan are captains in EarthForce, but they soon prove to be much more. I dare not enter into the plot since it is redundant on account of it being available at this site and elsewhere. All I will say about the plot is that over its five years, it is an extremely wealthy arc of sadness, joy, comedy, and horror! It is also not without substance, full of philosophy about life, existence, war, and hope. Each episode represents a coherent story, but incomplete since each builds upon the rest. The series is essentially an extended mini-series. Like Star Trek before it, most if not all episodes are constructed with a moral or lesson attached to it. Each episode also addresses some aspect of real human experience. The quest for power, revenge, love, and corporate power to mention a few. I believe that the episodes ""Z'HA'DUM"", ""War Without End 1 &amp; 2"", ""Whatever Happened To Mr. Garibaldi?"", and ""Endgame"" are some of the best of the series. It is also the only television series that I am aware of that was made better than most Hollywood movies! Watch it, or I will get you.",148 out of 165 found this helpful.,,14 January 2005
3612,Babylon 5, working towards genius,"Babylon 5 is one of the TV shows we all wish we had come across sooner. as a massive star trek fan i saw the first few episodes of b5 in its initial run and immediately thought it was below par. at the urging of a friend i came back to it a few years later.... wow! to say i was impressed was an understatement, i immediately began to re-watch the whole series and saw he genius of the story arc and character development. in addition to this the use of aliens that looks alien, use different gasses to breath, are more advanced technologically and (shock) actually speak a language other than English was a joy! the battle scenes were wonderful, well beyond anything i had seen before and as for londo and g'kar, if there are 2 finer characters in all of television then that TV show is doing well. funny, awe inspiring, intelligent and emotional b5 has it all, the only drawback being that sometimes the walls are a little flimsy, sometimes the effects are a little below par, but willing suspension of disbelief is necessary in sci-fi, and b5 is no exception. is b5 a work of genius? definitely, without question yes, but could parts of it be better? those niggly little things that gnaw at us i'm afraid would have brought b5 up a notch, but it remains , without question, one of the finest shows, not just sci-fi, but shows that i have ever seen!",112 out of 125 found this helpful.,,25 October 2004
3613,Babylon 5, Best science fiction television ever,"Even though the final season was rather slow, and glossed over a lot of plot lines that probably would have been more interesting, it was still better than most science fiction, and any on television other than the earlier seasons. Other than the final season and scattered weak episodes, the series is the best television science fiction, and near the best dramatic television, and competes with the best movie science fiction.<br/><br/>The action in the series is mostly about the Shadow war, but the real key is the intrigue between the characters, and the personal growth of the characters. Londo is one of the best dramatic characters in any series. He starts as an ambitious schemer who drinks too much, but develops a conscience as he learns the consequences of his ambitions, and finally ends up as a tragic character who reached even beyond his early ambitions, but at a cost that he regrets deeply.<br/><br/>Maybe some day there will be a better science fiction series.

Period.<br/><br/>I'm lost lost in blind fandom.  Rather, I've come to loathe the lack of intelligence used in most television programs today (largely because of the networks' catering to the lowest common denominator).  This is one of the few exceptions.<br/><br/>It is a true shame we cannot see intelligent writing like this elsewhere in this age of miraculous special effects.",225 out of 264 found this helpful.,10.0,3 January 2001
3615,Babylon 5, A Diamond In A Pile Of Manure,"The early to mid-90's was very average in my opinion for science fiction shows. Babylon 5 was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Unlike some sci-fi shows, Babylon 5 was an ongoing epic. What happened in one episode impacted on another episode and so on. It was set on Babylon 5 (a space station)where five solar systems who have been at war try to make peace. The representatives of these races are all based on Babylon 5 trying to create lasting peace (not unlike the real life League of Nations/United Nations).<br/><br/>As I said, what happened in one episode impacted on another. There was no jetting off to planets, creating a mess and then jetting off again. There was action, political intrigue and plenty of excitement which made this show stand out in 1994.<br/><br/>J. Michael Straczynski did a great job with Babylon 5. It's actually a very good allegory of life on Earth in the 20th century. There have been two major wars this century. The League of Nations was set up following World War 1 but they soon became defunct and the United Nations were set up following World War 2 to try and bring peace to the world. Of course it's hard to find peace with so many different governments pulling in different directions. That is why I liked Babylon 5. It was realistic; there were no quick solutions for peace and there were setbacks along the way just like we have in real life.<br/><br/>I strongly urge anyone who hasn't seen Babylon 5 to check it out.",107 out of 125 found this helpful.,,14 September 2002
3616,Babylon 5, TV as good as it gets,"I just finished watched the 1st year on DVD. What a treat to see this series again, in a version mastered properly for the widescreen with surround sound to boot. I remember enough from the series to know that the 1st season was both unique and uneven in more ways than the other 4 years, and yet it lets out all the plot threads that play out over the ensuing years. I, for one, liked M. O'hare and it was too bad he couldn't have had a recurring role in subsequent seasons. Even so, this is a great series, possibly the best ever Sci Fi TV series that I've ever seen. Great CGI work that was employed for the 1st time ever, multiple engaging plots, good acting, writing, etc... it goes on and on. My only regret is that no one's figured out a good way to resurrect the B5 fictional world. I'd love to see another good series like this. If you haven't seen it lately, watch it again to remember how good it was. If you've never seen it then you don't know what you're missing.",82 out of 95 found this helpful.,10.0,6 May 2004
3617,Babylon 5, 10 reasons to watch Babylon 5,"1. The story It is probably the biggest, most complex story that was put on film so far - well over 60 hours of good TV. This had been tried never before and makes shows like Lost or Battlestar Galactica successful today.<br/><br/>2. It is non boring Besides elements of Season 4 being built up as early as Season 1, even in small details, the storyline has a lot of interesting twists, that makes you yearn for more and stay interested even over the course of five years. But nowadays you don't have to. You can get the box set and have yourself been swallowed up in a matter of weeks.<br/><br/>3. The casting Casting was done very thoroughly, obviously; as every character had been designed in detail long time before casting, including all changes and developments, actors could be found that filled these roles perfectly. And they were. For example, Richard Biggs was the most ethic and believable TV doctor I have ever seen.<br/><br/>4. The acting The characters Londo Mollari and G'Kar seem to be the most popular, they are also filled by outstanding actors, but all the others, including guest roles were no less than great. Stephen Furst is a brilliant comedian and Bruce Boxleitner is just a joy to watch, he is so 100% in every scene.<br/><br/>5. The music Only two words: Christopher Franke. The score of B5 has the magnitude and the quality of a movie score and adds to the scope of the show greatly. Look out for a Special on Season 4 Box set called ""No Surrender, No Retreat Suite"". First watch Season 4. Then listen to the suite WITHOUT the pictures. And at last, enjoy the music with the pictures. You will conclude that the music itself captures all emotions of Season 4, the combination with the pictures just makes it a masterpiece.<br/><br/>6. The special effects Babylon 5 was a ""poor show"" as JMS put it. They had nowhere near the budget of a Star Trek series. But still its scope was intended to be big, with space battles unseen on TV to this point. Although most of the ground shots did not work, as a lot of virtual sets, the space scenes reached a remarkable level of perfection by the end of the series, and the battles were big indeed, with very interesting angles and camera movements only doable by cgi. Another aspect that B5 pioneered in.<br/><br/>7. The character development SciFi is not stupid. It is not about blowing up spaceships with laser guns either. Well, sometimes it is. But not B5. It is a character driven show with most interesting development to each character. They all developed, but still were truthful to themselves. Time is taken to explore each single character in detail and entertaining it is.<br/><br/>8. The humor There was Stephen Furst of course, who literally can turn any line into an enjoyable piece of comedy, but there were other actors with great comedic skills as well, Claudia Christian, Bruce Boxleitner, Patricia Tallman, Peter Jurasik to name a few. Although the story line was very exciting, the element of humor was never forgotten; this made Star Trek TOS successful and it definitely did not hurt B5.<br/><br/>9. The philosophy J. Michael Straczynski has said that his intention was never to make a moral or philosophical statement, but just to tell a story. But as the story involves a lot of these elements, at least it makes you think. And, although being a declared atheist, JMS handles things like religion or prophesy extremely respectfully and he gave the best summary of the essence of Christianity in the episode ""Passing Through Getsemane"" I have ever heard, equally brilliantly delivered by Oscar Nominee Brad Dourif.<br/><br/>10. The harmony of the complete work of art I believe that there are three classic types of art: Picture - painting, its 3D-representation sculpture and photography Music Literature, written and its physical representation acting.<br/><br/>Film puts all of them together, makes the pictures move and includes many more like effects, stage and crop design, costume design, camera, editing and makeup. I consider film the most complete work of art because it HAS to be the team work of a number of distinct artists. If each and every one of them is great, then the whole is great. And I think B5 is just that, besides or maybe because of the extremely tight budget they had. For example, when B5 went to TNT for Season 5 the actors suffered serious cutbacks in salary. Bruce Boxleitner no doubt had plenty of offers in his drawers, but nonetheless he stayed and finished the work. So did almost all the others, and I think You can tell this kind of attitude in the show.",48 out of 54 found this helpful.,10.0,10 June 2006
3618,Babylon 5, Best TV show ever made,"Best TV show ever made, I used to watch it as a child on TV and was mesmerized, how ever back then I missed some episodes and as such didn't always know what is going on since all the episodes are connected. So a few weeks back I thought to myself. Is this show really as good as I remembered it to be? So I bought the whole thing on DVD (remastered Widescreen edition) and was very surprised that it is in fact MUCH better than I remembered, many of the subtleties of the character and story development I could only sense as a child but not fully comprehend. And watching it again I was amazed at the depth of this great story and how you could relate to many of the situations occurring here and the terrible suspense of the story how it caught you and made you feel and bleed for the heroes. And the whole ambitious yet humble scope of this epic tale. Nothing to say of the great score of the series how the intro and credits music always perfectly captured the mood of the whole season. I can only highly recommend this great series. And as for the visuals, one gets used to them quickly and they are satisfying despite their age and the giant leap in technology.

3619,Babylon 5, Statement to the best i've ever seen!,"I don't know where to start actually, it can be phrased in just one sentence. Babylon 5 is even after 20 years of its first appearance the absolute best a Sci-fi series can offer to a viewer. i started watching the series in 1994 i believe and it never catched me but there was one reason why it was that way. im from Germany and the synchronisation of the dialogs where not only been flawed in many ways it took away the soul of each character and left the viewer with a sorry excuse of a translation of events and feelings. i started watching the series from scratch in 2000 and in the mothertongue ( englisch ) and its a difference of night and day. i learned my englisch thanks to this series. i just made an account because i feel that babylon 5 doesn't get enough credit for what this series really is. Its a magnificent story telling of events / Masterclass Actors and producers. I don't even know where to begin of praising this fantastic and absolute top notch Sci-fi series. In my humble opinion there is nothing in the last 20 years that can even consider themselves to be on the same level as Babylon 5.<br/><br/>I can only urge everyone who haven't seen this fastastic top notch series to just give it a try in englisch. Its a journey where you get pulled into and you surely don't want to come out again.<br/><br/>I can only give this series a defnetly 10 out of 10... hell no i'd give it an fkn 20. By far my favorite series ever created in a Sci-fi environment. Even the Special effects seems now in 2014/15 a littly rusty just imagine this series was created with limited resources and not much budget in 1994 ! And now after 20 years i say Thank you with all my heart to all people who were there to created this absolute stunning masterpiece.<br/><br/>Thanks a lot.

3620,Babylon 5, Most Brilliant Show Written for Television (in my opinion of course),"Intro: Bablyon 5 belongs in the greatest sci-fi shows of history, in fact I will go so far that it is the greatest show ever written for television in history. This show is not for everyone however. If you search for discrepancies, focus on the antiquated CGI (an example of one of the first shows to ever use CGI on a regular basis for TV by the way), and miss the lack of Hollywood's ""perfect person"" actor who is little more than the same actor in every film/series, then you will probably not like the series. The series uses a brilliant script and ""hidden, so called B-quality"" actors and creates a TV art masterpiece. The trials and successes the characters face occur today and will continue till the day the sun goes supernova. The characters become like real people in your life for the 43 minutes you are watching the show, as if you are on the station with them. Sure, I like other characters/actors better than others (and there were a couple of characters I did not care for), but I am not going to let a few actors that I don't care for destroy the greater message/mission of the series and I hope you don't either. <br/><br/>Series Structure: The purpose of the series was to tell a story. Plain and simple. The series is so complex however it is like reading a classic novel. I have watched the series through at least ten times and in every episode I see something new or make a new literary connection (foreshadowing, irony, parallels...etc). The structure is 5 seasons that are linked by a greater overarching story. Season 1 is called ""Signs and Portents,"" season 2: ""The Coming of Shadows,"" season 3: ""Point of No Return,"" season 4: ""No Surrender, No Retreat,"" and lastly season 5: ""The Wheel of Fire."" Each season builds upon each one and can reach back to a previous one unveiling hidden meanings or explaining confusing/vague dialogue. The series is also very unique for television in that situations are not resolved by the end of the episode. What!?!? That is crazy!? I really love Star Trek, but that universe really knows how to end things on the Federation Captain's agenda. Most of TV is like this with a few exceptions (Lost,BSG...etc). B5 was a breath of fresh, exhilarating air with its sudden plot twists, unexpected turns, and that problems rarely went away at the end of any episode. Just like life problems linger, or if they are stamped out quickly, those problems have an inconvenient way of pouncing on you when you least need them. The series is also a breath of fresh air because there are actual consequences for the protagonists that plague them for the rest of the series. Again for good measure, 'what'!?!? Rarely in TV do we see protagonists do something that could have potential adverse consequences and then suffer those horrible consequences even in the name of justice and morality. The villains in the series are very well portrayed in my opinion (especially the character 'Bester'). They are like the villains in real life. They are corrupt, smart, systematic, efficient, unrelenting, hide their weaknesses well, and are awesome at using people, especially the good guys, to advance their evil schemes. The malfunctioning, imperfect technology and the state/portrayal of humanity is very believable, at least for me, in 2258 which can add to the potential realism of the series. <br/><br/>Series Philosophy/Metaphysics: Yes, this series is that deep. There are lots of messages and lessons to be gathered from this series, but there are several overarching themes that manifest themselves time and time again. 1)People are people and they will always be the same at heart. As humanity advances/evolves, the heart of humanity never varies from its naturally corrupt, chaotic state. I am a history buff and if you study social, political, military, and economic history since the dawn of time, people have not emotionally and spiritually evolved when it comes to the fundamentals. We long to be greater, even at others expense. We search for better things even if it means sacrificing other good things. We care more for ourselves than our neighbor by nature...and I could go on and on. The series addresses the human condition well in a potential future with potential authenticity. 2)It takes a lot of work and hardship to break the natural cycle of things. The characters demonstrate that in order to change the world, they have to change themselves first and that can be very painful. They also demonstrate how the world/universe shapes us into who we are, but we can choose to embrace that change or reject it. 3) There is always a choice. Whether you believe in black and white or that there is a gray option, you still have to choose. 4) The most well defined and potent philosophical element of all in this series: The individual can make a difference. Again, this difference cannot be made without sacrifice, and great sacrifice at that. However, the individual can break the cycle, fight the pain, overcome the impossible, if done at the right time by the right person (watch the series to see how they define'right person.') Battlestar Galactica (2000's series) is a great series and is also the antithesis of Babylon 5. In BSG, the individual can fight, struggle, suffer, and endure, yet is unable to break the cycle of his situation, so you will see that they revert back in many cases to their carnal instincts. The BSG characters don't really rise above their situation because their universe doesn't really let individuals rise up and buck the system. Whether you personally believe in the power of the individual over the system, Babylon 5 is the only series that I have even seen fluidly and flawlessly illustrate this point through television. <br/><br/>Conclusion: I hope you find this review helpful and I hope you watch the series.",19 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,16 August 2012
3621,Babylon 5, Babylon 5 - Lord Of The Rings in Space,"The Fellowship of Babylon 5... The Two Towers of Babylon 5 (Earthdome and B5, Marsdome and Earthdome, Minbari Homeworld and Z'ha'Dumb) — And The Return of the King of Babylon 5 - It's all there:<br/><br/>Kosh: Gandalf (Comes back from the Dead) Sheridan: Aragorn, including the marriage to an Elvis Princess, Delenn The Hobbits: Vir, Lennier, Na'toth, etc. All the ""Ambassadors Assistants"" - Who start from humble Beginnings and rise up to great positions. In a Way, G'Kar could be seen as Frodo- Who has a life changing experience carrying ""The Ring""- In other words, G'Kars sufferings during his tenure as Mollari's Ambassador, and even before that as he searched for Mr Garibaldi. Frodo loses a finger, G'Kar loses an eye. The Rangers are there, and even named as such.<br/><br/>Saruman could be Mr Morden... Sauron? Sauron could be the ""Evil Kosh""- The one that came after Kosh was killed by Shadows. In B5 there is no main huge Evil Eye, unless you consider the thing the Drakk stuck on Molari's NECK, which seems to see everything. Overall, B5 Chronicles a Space Station/City in Space, heavily fortified, which withstands an all out enemy attack against all odds and survives, and through it, the birth of a New Age comes about. In the Original B5 opening credits, Sinclair talks about ""The Third Age of Mankind"" - And so B5 takes the universe and mankind from the 3rd age to the 4th age just like Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>""The Gathering"" was an ambitious project for 1994, and especially for Television, and Syndicated TV at that. So, the special Effects were actually very good for 1994, but the main money of the show was used in the Sets and Costumes and Prosthetic Makeup - Which, in my Opinion, gave Trek a run for its money. I always thought Trek Aliens were WAY too Human, in B5 we have a huge Insect, running things in Brown Sector. Didn't look a BIT human. And the PakMara, who could eat ANYTHING, except for fish, and although human-Oid, had those Tentacle-Mouths. Then there were an assortment of Fin-Heads, Lizard Skins, Wrinkle-Faces, and some BEM's that always walk around in Encounter Suits. And KOSH. In B-5, they took special pains to keep away form the ""Homo Sapiens Only Club"" that Trek had become, and the idea that there would be poor people in the lower decks, wearing mostly rags, was superior to DS9 and more realistic.<br/><br/>But mainly, If you look at B5 versus Deep Space Nine, and I know some say that Deep Space 9 was stolen by Rick Berman from JMS, I find as a Station, B5 MUCH superior. It's a Cylinder, that rotates for Gravity, and there is a Green Belt, to help generate Oxygen. Ivanova uses a small space to cultivate Coffee beans. Ivanova vs Kira: They'd kick each others asses, and then be best friends after. There SHOULD have been a B5/Trek crossover, it would have worked, to see Worf walking through the Zocalo. Who KNows? There never was a DS9 Feature Film, and that story was left in the lurch, just as B5 was when Crusade was canceled.<br/><br/>Trek had the best looking space ships and some good realistic looking battles, but B5 was over the top of that... If B5 could have had as good quality in that department at the beginning. As you watch each season of B5, the generated computer graphics get better in quality. Season 5 had the best Look, and although some say that the 5th season, was poorly written, I enjoyed it. It was a denouement. And just like Lord of the Rings, when you have a massive, multi character and multi plot story like that, and after it has its main confrontation and several other aftershock confrontations, the story has to be gracefully put to sleep, which is why Lord of the Rings, as Jack Nicholson was quoted saying, had ""Too Many Endings.""<br/><br/>The entire 5th season of B5 was it's ending, and as I did not like the Telepath arc very much either, it was a part of the story that begged some answers. I didn't mind that much, but what I did mind was the way Lita was treated at the very end... But as JMS has said, he was showing a brand new form of prejudice.<br/><br/>I've just watched ""In The Beginning,"" ""The gathering"" and then all five seasons of B5. I wish some of Deep Space 9 could have been told in the same way... As I have always thought DS9 was the best Trek ever, but B5 shows us another Alternate Future, which postulates, ""If Mankind could not get his act together in the last 6,000 years of Civilisation, then it is kind of preposterous to think that 200 years from now, we can get rid of Prejudice, Extremism, and basic idiocy"" - And as Gene Roddenberry's future is clean, JMS's future shows us the seamy underbelly of Space, which is to me much more realistic- And also why I loved DS9 after Michael Pillar quit and it became more like B5.<br/><br/>Maybe the Shadows are right, without conflict there is no story.",19 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,14 January 2012

3623,Babylon 5, Brilliant!,"I was watching this when I was about 10 years old. (Give or take). My older brother, who I looked up to, said it was the best modern Sci-Fi show. This meant I had to watch, and follow. I couldn't quite get it right back then. Probably, I was to young. Years passed by, and all of the sudden I got this tingly feeling in my stomach, as if I anticipated something. Then images from this phenomenal show started appearing in my mind, and I understood immediately what was amiss - I was missing Babylon 5, this show that I hadn't watched in 10 years or so. After a quick discussion with my fiancée, I ordered every season on DVD. The wait for it to be delivered was horrible! But when it finally arrived, I knew I was about to experience something great! We sat down in our sofa, watched the pilot, and didn't stop watching until it was all done. I started remembering every little thing from my earliest pre-puberty attempts at watching it, the costumes and the plots, everything.<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt the best (and most epic) Sci-Fi show I have ever seen. The characters are all well fleshed out and memorable, and the plot, with all its twists and turns, is perfect. It's so epic and glorious that I can scarcely describe it. The characters are all multi- faceted, they all act in ways you would never imagine they would. They all have weaknesses. They all act bad at times. It's not black and white, it's Grey. All the characters are Grey. And the stories are phenomenal. Granted, it does somewhat taper of in season 5, but it's still good.<br/><br/>Highly recommended show. Give it a watch, even if you aren't into Sci- fi. This is so much more than Sci-fi.",12 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,3 June 2013
3624,Babylon 5, Much more than a science fiction show,"B5 and Star Trek are apples and oranges. I love them both but prefer apples. I tend to enjoy things for what they are, not what they are not. We tend to find what we look for. B5 is a show that accomplished a heck of a lot on a small budget. My wife was sick with cancer at the time B5 came out, and because her illness took so much of her active life from her it was nice to have a TV show we could watch together, and watch we did.<br/><br/>All I can say is this: No other show has ever moved me so much intellectually, emotionally and spiritually. The wonderfully interwoven arcing themes and character development of B5 is matched by its subtleties and nuance. Especially poignant to me are the way the concepts of courage, forgiveness and loss are presented.<br/><br/>Another great thing about the series are the side stories told in the 7 movies and the B5 novels. You can get glimpses in the mind of Kosh or find out Bester's fate. A satisfying story from beginning to end and one that will probably never be equaled.",12 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,10 January 2013
3625,Babylon 5, The Greatest TV Show of All Time?,"What can I say about Babylon 5 that hasn't already been said? I remember clearly watching it for the first time on Channel 4 in 1994. I came to it with some trepidation, being as I was a lifelong Trekker, &amp; Star Trek: Deep Space 9 was already on the air - did we need another show set on a space station? How would it compare to the genius that is Star Trek? How disappointed would I be? The answers to these questions were clear from the beginning. This is not a show that can be compared, with Star Trek or anything. This show is like nothing I had seen before or since. Many shows have story arcs that span the seasons, but this was different. This is not an episodic show with a loose story arc running through it; this is one story split into 5 seasons worth of episodes. It is a story about the human condition, about the holocaust, about many many big things, but, at heart, this is also one of the greatest love stories ever told.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch, the writing sublime &amp; the CGI special effects (widely known as done with Commodore Amiga computers - remember them?!) still look amazing 14 years on. The dialog (of which there is a lot - this is a very cerebral show) is naturalistic &amp; adds to the characters; each race has a slightly different way of speaking, which would be the case if this were real.<br/><br/>On the downsides (if this can really be called ""the downside""), the show can be very theatrical, both in it's direction &amp; acting. This is understandable when you see the caliber of the cast; they may not be household names but each one of them is (was) an actor-extraordinaire; and that includes the guest stars (names such as Michael York &amp; David Warner). Even Walter Koenig, as recurring villain (if such an easy term is applicable in such a complex show) Alfred Bester, shows there is much more to this actor than the ever-stereotypical Pavel Chekov of the USS Enterprise.<br/><br/>This is not an easy show to watch. It demands from it's audience a certain level of attention &amp; loyalty. It's certainly not for those who want a quick story with everything neatly wrapped up in 45 minutes. Season One is (understandably) the most episodic - that was the clever way they hooked those who were used to the more Star Trek way of doing things - but the story soon takes over. Even the rushed ending for Season 4 (written when they didn't know if Season 5 was going to be picked up) stands now as a good ""future history"" of mankind.<br/><br/>All in all, I would recommend this show to pretty much anyone. There is nothing bad about Babylon 5 that I can say. In fact, if somebody gives this show the time to tell it's story &amp; still doesn't like it, then I would propose that says more about the viewer than the show. Sadly, Crusade &amp; any other attempts at continuing this story didn't take, but Babylon 5 stands as a monument to the genius of J. Michael Straczynski.",14 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,20 December 2012
3626,Babylon 5, Brilliant. Just Freakin' Brilliant.,"If I could meet Straczynsi in person and had the chance to tell him anything I wanted - it would be this: Thank You. Thank you for creating what is arguably the best sci fi series ever to hit the small screen. Thank you for creating a story so rich, so deep, so detailed that its like will not likely be seen again for a very long time, if ever.<br/><br/>I just finished watching all 5 seasons of the series, plus the 5 movies (the sixth - Legend of the Rangers is die for release in March 2006), AND the entire run of Crusade - the sequel/spin off series.<br/><br/>This is about the fourth or fifth time I've done this now. Like the person ahead of me said - you'll be saying things like ""So THAT'S what that meant..."" quite a lot.

3627,Babylon 5, A show that makes you care,"I've read most of the reviews here, and the pattern fits what I have seen over the years. 90% of people who watch it love it, and 5% hate it, 5% are ""unimpressed"".<br/><br/>From what I've read so far, those who hate it didn't watch all the shows and likely missed the best ones, or they really didn't understand what they were watching.<br/><br/>This series was about the future and the people who make it. The acting in the first season, I found a little stiff. However the actors were just settling in, and I have seen the same settling in period on every science fiction show on TV over the last 40ish years. This all settled by the end of the season, and the show really hit it's stride starting in season 2.<br/><br/>This is the only scifi I have even seen that could make my eyes water. The only that made me really care about the characters. Star Trek (I'm a fan) hasn't done it. Spock died and it didn't really bother me. Data bites the dust and, well we could see the way they could work that out didn't we (B4). They marry and unmarry? Yawn..... I mean, they came close a few times, but never really emotionally bothered me.<br/><br/>Star Wars failed miserably at this aspect. It's a great scifi movie series. And I love them (saw in theater 10 times when it came out), but I didn't really care about the characters. Main characters die or are injured or captured throughout the movie series and it didn't really bother me at all.<br/><br/>Now B5 owes a lot to those two shows. They broke the ground that B5 followed in, and in this case the student finally out did the teacher.<br/><br/>When B5 came out, I didn't have any local stations carrying it. Some times I could pick it up if I wrapped tin foil over our antenna, but not on cable. So, I did see a few shows, but it wasn't for years I was finally able to see them all the way through three times on the Space channel. I remember I couldn't stop thinking about them all day at work, and I would go straight home to make dinner and watch B5. Best show I had ever seen. I loved the Star Trek series, all of them, but this show blew me away. The characters were awesome. After the first season they really jelled and became their characters. When they betrayed each other you cared about it. When they died, it made a difference.<br/><br/>I have the DVDs now, and I watched them several times over, always picking out things I had missed. I have all the B5 videos, and movies and give them all a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>The only other scifi series that I've come this close to really caring about was a short ran series called Space Above and Beyond. Great series and actors.",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,14 January 2010
3628,Babylon 5, For those who have n ever seen this show,"After reading through the reviews of this show, I realized that something more needed to be written. Babylon 5 is a cult classic. It came at a time when Star Trek was the only space-based science fiction on television, and as such it paved the way for later series to become successes. I personally loved Babylon 5 when it was on in the 1990s, and I still love it today. And all the reviews I read said all these things about the show, but they wouldn't make me watch the series all the way through if I wasn't a fan already. Here's why: I just bought the first season on DVD. I'd never seen all of it before; I came to the series in the middle. Remembering as I did the epic quality of the show--the interesting characters and interactions, the involved plot line, and the way it dealt with contemporary issues within its own world--I've found season one slightly disappointing. The first episodes are rocky, budget is obviously and issue, and some of the performances are sub-par. This is completely overlooked in glowing reviews by die-hard fans, who don't wish to admit that the show they love had problems.<br/><br/>But for those new to show, I say, ""Don't give up."" No television show is perfect to start out. Both actors and creators are still getting a feel for the show, what works and what doesn't. Once the ball gets rolling on Babylon 5, you won't look back. The first season is a bit rocky, but already we begin to see what the show is about. These episodes begin to unfold plot points and story arcs that continue for all five seasons, and even beyond that. There are some things, little things, that a character says or sees that will seem entirely unimportant until some point in season four when the audience suddenly thinks back and says, ""Wait, I remember this!"" This is the beauty of Babylon 5. The creators had a clear vision of where the show was going, one they never forgot, even when the realities of production forced them eliminate a character. Nothing that happens in season one will be contradicted later on.",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,8 November 2008
3629,Babylon 5, A web of characters in conflict,"I love this show!  Every character has at some point in the series a focal moment where their interaction with another character changes their lives from that point on.<br/><br/>Garibaldi is never the same after the shadow war after learning of Bester's ""Assimov Card"" up his sleeve, Leeta is different after Byron's demise, G'kar and Londo see themselves in each other, Ivanova leaves after Marcus' fate (etc al.)<br/><br/>In reality life is like this. We'd all like to be in control of our lives but outside forces disrupt the plan we have for our individual life. Life is a web and the web of charcters in B5 portray that better than any series on TV, sci-fi or not!<br/><br/>This show isn't just the most adult, the most intelligent sci-fi on TV, it's the most intelligent drama on TV ...Period!<br/><br/>As one character said in the final season ""There is no such thing as a normal life, there is only life!""",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,,19 August 1999

It truly feels like something beyond a mere TV series but much more like a novel. Written exactly like a novel, with a beginning, a middle and an ending, Babylon 5 is truly something unique in US television.<br/><br/>Easily the best science fiction US TV series ever made (I would rate Battlestar Galactica as the second best, Star Trek works on a lower level): its level of complexity and emotional depth is easily superior to anything else. Truly a work of art, but flawed, of course, as the low budgets and the huge number of episodes produce more flawed art than films.",13 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,20 February 2013

The show's approach to the interaction between aliens is well-worked. What- the aliens all don't breathe oxygen and speak English?!? Another thing I appreciated about the show is that, just as in reality, there is really no ""GOOD"" even though there is evil in he form of bigotry and prejudice and, later in the series, in the form of the Shadows.

3636,All Creatures Great and Small, Feelgood factor in period Yorkshire Dales setting.,"People like me of a certain age grew up with the wildly popular books and TV series in the 70's so there are some who will never accept a re-filming of this tale of a vet in post WW1 North Yorkshire. I happen to live near there and know people who actually knew Alf Wight who wrote the books in which he renamed himself 'James Herriot'.
Channel 5 who made this already produce 'The Yorkshire Vet' reality show which features the same vets practice still working today along with 'The Yorkshire Steam Railway: All Aboard' which features our local preserved steam railway (The North Yorkshire Moors Railway). As such Channel 5 already have a 'track record' (groans) of filming up here and this series has been on the cards for a while. The only question was 'Would this be up to the standard of the original?'. One episode in and I'd have to give it a resounding 'Yes!'.
Don't expect complex plots or action chases in this unless you include angry 1 ton+ bulls or roller-coaster local roads traversed in 1930's cars with dodgy brakes. Just instead enjoy the Yorkshire scenery pretty much unchanged since the time it is set populated with little 'feel-good' stories of veterinary life among the very wily Yorkshire folk.

And while the BBC series may be more faithful to the books, this series is basically what it says on the tin: ""based on"".

Newcomer Nicholas Ralph IS James Herriot with a subtle but masterful performance. Rachel Shenton is the perfect Helen, independent and witty, making her a perfect match for Herriot. I thought it would be impossible for anyone to fill Robert Harry's shoes but Sam West is a brilliant Siegfried. He perfectly captures his eccentricities and kindness.

While SKY are touting this as some complex thriller, it is a high budget Dallas-esq type of Drama. I should have seen earlier that this show would have issues with it's very odd casting- for example an French family who have a Dad with an American accent and three children all utterly different and with British accents (especially bizarre as one child is suppose to be a love child of two dark Olive skinned people and is ghostly white and ginger haired!) That being said there was some half decent writing and acting in parts of the show early on, a lot of different stories weaving around but it managed to bring a lot together and keep me interested. Is Constantine actually dead, who would have wanted the family dead and what, if anything are the family hiding? Around episode 6\7 it feels like someone else took over the entire story and that everything that came before was a different show. Characters and plots disappear without explanation to make way for mafia and helicopters and a whole new line of plot. All of this happens for no reason and no one questions what is happening. I really dislike it when I feel like I have wasted a lot of hours on a show and that is how this show made me feel. <br/><br/>So many plot holes and unanswered questions as the show goes and even at the end it is all left without explanation as the ending points to the fact he may have been alive or planning to run away but the show never explains these things, there are many unnecessary deaths which add nothing to the plot but sensationalism and the ending, which manages to be dizzying stupid, out of character,pointless and badly executed all in one hour episode, seems to point to them wanting to make another season. Watching the final 10 minutes which was a desperate gasp to keep sensationalism all the way through, was like watching the characters have an out of body experience. Maybe if season 2 bought the addition of aliens they would not seem out of place in this production as it seems to have multiple new personalities as it ends and nothing is off limits.

3667,Riviera, Terrible! Don't waste your time.,"Okay, the show started out promising. The main character was not like a typical barbie doll that is usually cast in a main role of similar shows. She had a rough exterior but a solid personality of a good kindly girl. The authors took care to built up her character with each episode creating an image of a girl that enjoys the perks of being rich but has morals, true values and a desire to get to the truth no matter how painful. All in all very relatable. The audience empathizes with her and overlooks her awkwardness. All is going smoothly until it's time to end the show. 10 minutes before the end of the series the authors decide to make her into a vengeful psychopathic killer. I mean, I usually like a good twist in a story but COME ON! This was nowhere near an elegant ending. I couldn't believe how bad it sucked. I mean, it's just isn't done this way.

3680,Riviera, Two stars for the scenery and settings,"I have to agree with much of what saintgirluk has said. It's also a rare occasion when you see a wooden plot with wooden characters brought somewhat to life by good actors, but I suppose that that is the mark of a good actor. I'm surprised that some accepted the parts but I suppose that the need to work and money are good incentives. I think that this is not the first time that I have seen Phil Davis (Jukes) uncredited in a production since his role as Jud in Poldark , and I'm not sure why, though he was instantly recognisable. I also wondered about the mix of accents, and the milky-skinned, red haired Adriana, looking more like a cross between a Mucha and an Alma-Tadema model than the daughter of two dusky types. There was no need for such sickening graphic violence, and there was also so much oral sex that it's a wonder that there wasn't a major outbreak of herpes. And about the sex - so fake looking, apart from when Negrescu raddled Irina on a table, that was hotly acted and realistic. At times I thought that I was watching a Victorian melodrama, particularly the ending, totally unbelievable for this character to go to the extremes of stabbing someone to death. How to explain the disappearance of a family member? Not necessary it seems as that was that in series one. This ending also reminded me of the totally naff, awkward and disappointing ending of Game of Thrones, where the writer lost sight of a natural progression to a satisfying ending in the effort to wind it up, and you wondered why you bothered watching. Just worked our way through season 2, dear me! Lacy dialogue and plot as in a lot of holes. Julia says to Irina that Adam tried to rape her, and later to Jeff that he did rape her, which is it? Or a later attempt to justify what she had done? She blames Adam for Constantine's 'death' but he just happened to mention it to his then girlfriend as far as I understood, not with the intention of killing his pa in an explosion. When Georgina sees Constantine, barely clinging to life anyway, she berates him soundly for not letting her know that he's alive, but neither he nor Cassie bothers to mention that a) he was unconscious for a month and b) he was a prisoner and his attempt to contact her was foiled. Then when she tells the family that she has seen him but he's dead now, they are angry because she didn't tell them so that they could go to him while he was alive, and yet again where you would expect some sort of explanation she doesn't bother saying that she has only just seen him and that he died before she had hardly left the building. Further along, in her obsession with pinning down Nico for Raoul's murder, incredibly she has Negrescu released on bail on her assurance of good behaviour. What!!!! The notion that a murderous gangster, who has killed one witness and was caught in the act of trying to kill another, would be released on bail is preposterous. That's the hallmark of a lot of this programme, including that she would set fire to a valuable collection of works of art including a piece on loan. So having started on Season 3, you have to ask why a reputable restitution expert such as Gabriel would steal a piece of jewellery and later try to gain from it. Action is split between Argentina and the Riviera, and Daphne turns up in St Tropez. Why is she single? Oh things have changed a lot in the last year. Could we not know why, likewise why no mention was made of Adriana who was on the verge of marrying Nico or the condition of Irina who miraculously survived a fatal fall? I would have thought that at the least Georgina would have asked after Adriana and Irina, if not from Nico then of Daphne.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,2.0,21 October 2020

3683,Battlestar Galactica," Has great aspects and awful aspects but the majority of it is ""OK"" with unrealised potential and a lack of consistency in plot and tone","Having enjoyed the recent reimagining of Battlestar Galatica I was discussing it with a colleague when he brought up the original and I realised that I had not seen it for several decades and, even then, it was fragmented in my memory. I decided to watch it again and I was quite surprised by how much I remember some of the episodes and how I don't think I had ever seen some of the others. Anyway, this was reason enough to watch it from the start to the end – a decision made easier by the fact that it was only one season long before it got cancelled.<br/><br/>To get the comparisons out of the way, watching both leaves me in little doubt that those that trash the remake and praise the original are probably heavily influenced by protective nostalgia when they say that, because there are few ways that this is the case. Indeed the ways that the original is ""better"" than the remake relates to qualities that I didn't like in the original and that the remake didn't try and have (namely a swashbuckling comedy and the clumsy aim at the family/kiddie viewing sector). With that more or less done I can concentrate on judging the original Battlestar Galatica on its own terms and not against something else. This produces a mixed feeling that I struggle to reconcile because at times this series is awful and at others times it is actually quite engaging and offers potential (that it admittedly doesn't manage to deliver on) but mostly it is a mixed bag.<br/><br/>The split is not total but the series does seem to go through phases where it is silly and for kids and then also more dramatic stuff that could have been a solid backbone for more. Sadly it gets into the silly stuff first. While Apollo and Starbuck were always going to be the lead characters, the first half of the season makes it their show, with a weekly ""theme park"" style story where we have planets that are like the Wild West or like Medieval times etc etc. Annoyingly all these stories seem to involve the Cylons – who are either already on these planets or are using these planets as a trap for the Galatica. This bugged me because it felt like the Cylons were so far ahead all the time that the struggle to watch the survivors shouldn't be this hard and it minimised their presence as a real tangible threat because they were always a handful of robots laying a trap, not a race hunting another to extension. None of it is helped by the overuse of that child and also that bl00dy robot dog thing.<br/><br/>Happily things get a bit more ""serious"" in the second half of the series, where the approach appears to be more towards action and plot rather than the kiddie theme park approach. It doesn't really pull this off though. The Cylons drop off the map for many episodes while the Eastern Alliance comes into it, but then that thread isn't done particularly well either. That said though it did generally make for a much better series than the first half had been – but it is still not that great. It is the contentment with the basics that hurt it, because nothing really convinces and nothing really engages or builds. The Cylons don't menace like they should, the human fleet doesn't feel like it is more than a handful of people, many, many threads are left with unsatisfying endings (and I mean mi-series, not just cause it got cancelled) while other threads just ""stop"" without a thought for the viewer, as if to say ""well, that's that episode filled"". The Pegasus episodes along with the Eastern Alliance and other specifics do offer a more grown up thread/feel that could be expanded like the remake did to great success but this never happens and it retains a very fragmented and unsatisfying feel.<br/><br/>There is much to enjoy about it despite this. The effects are limited but the designs are great, with the centurions, the base stars, the vipers or the Galatica herself being iconic and memorable. The comic swagger it has also works well, with Starbuck benefiting from this with some nice moments in the action. Such things as these combined with the better aspects of the second half of the series do combine to make it a solid enough piece of TV sci-fi but the ""downsides"" do limit it a lot and make it less than it could have been. The mix of aims, the lack of consistency in the central plot (escaping genocide) and in the tone (is it for kids, it is for adults, is it a comedy, is it all worthy and heavy??) are too big to overcome and, as a whole series it is not that great when you sit now and watch it with as little ""warm nostalgic glow"" as you can muster. Has good episodes and bad episodes but too many fall somewhere in the middle, showing a potential that frustratingly it never really seems to realise or do anything with.",26 out of 29 found this helpful.,,20 August 2009
3684,Battlestar Galactica, Exodus in Space,"Battlestar Galactica is one of those series you either love or hate, or else didn't watch.  I loved it.  It had a great concept and, generally good effects.  The writing was a bit uneven at times, with the ""homages"" to other genres and movies getting way out of hand (Magnificent Seven, Guns of Navarone, Shane, Dirty Dozen, Perry Mason, Towering Inferno, etc.).  As far as the criticism of ""rip-off"" goes, Battlestar Galactica was vindicated in court and in saga itself.  The only real similarities with Star Wars are that both are space opera, both have bad guys in armor, both had dogfights in space, and both had John Dykstra supervising the effects.  Otherwise, the biblical story of Galactica bore little resemblance to the mythical Star Wars.  Besides, Star Wars was inspired by Flash Gordon, Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, The Dam Busters, King Arthur, and the works of Joseph Campbell.  I think a series based on Exodus and Erik Von Danekan can be cut a little slack.<br/><br/>The acting was generally good, although the child actors were not the most skilled (but, hey, they're kids).  Lorne Greene was great as the fatherly Adama, leading his people on a search for their brethren.  Richard Hatch was the mature and stoic Apollo; the cerebral hero.  Dirk Bennedict is the reckless and fun-loving Starbuck, the true fighter pilot in space.  John Colicos is the evil Baltar, traitor to his people; part Benedict Arnold, part Herod, part Hitler.  Add a well rounded supporting cast and you have a fine ensemble.<br/><br/>Yes, there is much dated material here:  feathered hairdo's, disco clothes, social interaction; but it doesn't detract from the better stories.  The use of a unique slang was a nice idea, but a bit distracting.  The music was good and the Egyptian influences were interesting in the designs.  The uniforms were stylish and gave a sense of military symbol and function.  The ship designs were cool (can't say it any other way).<br/><br/>The biggest fault in this series is the tendency to depart from the overall saga into homage episodes.  ""Gun on Ice Planet Zero"" was a fine remake of the Guns of Navarone and the Dirty Dozen, but it also presented a threat to the fleet and a new obstacle they must overcome.  Others, like ""The Lost Warrior"" or ""The Magnificent Warriors"" had little consequence for the fleet and tended to get bogged down.  The series was at its best when the Galactica found a new clue to the lost tribe, or overcame the Cylons to live another day.  Unfortunately, the producers didn't have a timeline in mind when they created this show, unlike Babylon 5.  Had they determined how long the journey should take, they could have avoided unnecessary episodes and concentrated on the overall saga, bringing character development and drama into the story, without losing sight of their goal.  As it was, we were teased with false Earths and little idea when the Lost Tribe would be found. Unfortunately, when it was found, the series took a complete nosedive.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see what the future will bring for this series; but, for the present, I will continue to watch my tapes.  Is it too much to ask for a DVD release for the entire series?",51 out of 64 found this helpful.,,30 January 2003
3685,Battlestar Galactica, An Underappreciated Classic,"Only in the last five years or so has ""Battlestar Galactica"" begun to emerge from the unfair stigma that was attached to it for so many years as a ""Star Wars ripoff"".  Although a lot of people don't know this, based on what gets written by BG bashers in their histories of sci-fi TV, George Lucas's lawsuit against Universal was dismissed on all counts and found to be without merit.  Indeed, considering how Lucas had ""borrowed"" from so many other genre stories of the past his lawsuit claiming Galactica stole from Star Wars was the biggest case of hypocrisy ever.<br/><br/>For me, ""Galactica"" continues to age well and is even better than it was when I first experienced it as a child in 1978.  Unlike the Star Wars series, which increasingly came to be about FX at the expense of characters, BG's appeal has always lied in its characters.  The characters of Apollo (Richard Hatch), Starbuck (Dirk Benedict), Adama (Lorne Greene), Sheba (Anne Lockhart) and even the wicked Baltar (John Colicos) were fascinating and multi-dimensional.  And unlike Star Trek, there was a semblance of continuity and character development whereas the former was entirely self-contained from week to week with no development in the characters.<br/><br/>Was BG flawed?  Certainly.  But it also attracted a larger audience in its one year on ABC than any Star Trek series ever has in syndication.  What can't be forgiven is ABC's quick dismissal of this show and then insulting the intelligence of us all by bringing it back in a bastardized version known as ""Galactica 1980"".<br/><br/>Hopefully, Galactica fans will one day get the last laugh if there is a successful revival with the original cast.  It's a show that deserves another chance even more than Star Trek did.",51 out of 65 found this helpful.,,19 September 1999

3688,Battlestar Galactica, One of the top sci-fi series of all time!,"Loved BATTLESTAR GALACTICA (1978-79) series as a kid, and still love it. I've re-watched most of the episodes of this series over the years whenever they would air it on cable (they used to air it a lot) and was amazed at how re-watchable, entertaining, uplifting, and, dare I say it, provocative this series was. As a kid, it was all about the space battles and shiny-looking Cylons. As an adult, I realized there was so much more underneath. The series is a great example of instilling principles of leadership, friendship, family values, community, and heritage.<br/><br/>The 1-season series was about a ragtag fleet of human colonists who escape their home world of Caprica after a devastating attack by a species of robotic aliens called Cylons. The fleet is led by Commander Adama (wonderfully played by TV legend Lorne Greene in my favorite ever role of his). Adama commands the last remaining Battlestar, the Galactica, which must lead the way of the fleet to a star system light years away, which includes the planet Earth. <br/><br/>While Adama is the fleet leader and doles out the orders, for me, the heart and soul of the fleet (and the series) is his son Captain Apollo (brilliantly played with passion and persuasion by Richard Hatch, in his best role ever). Apollo is the ultimate sci-fi heroic role model: brave, strong, confident, decisive, caring, and faithful. Hatch was really the star of the series as he had top billing and most of the big scenes always involved his character. Apollo was the leader of the Viper fighting squadron aboard the Galactica and led most away missions and battles.<br/><br/>Assisting the stars Hatch and Greene is an eclectic supporting cast: (1) the insanely popular Lt. Starbuck, played with tongue-in-cheek humor and appeal by TV vet Dirk Benedict, who was Apollo's fellow pilot, right hand and best friend, (2) Col. Tigh, played with stern authority by Terry Carter, who was Adama's 2nd-in-command, (3) Athena, earnestly played by 70s sex symbol Maren Jensen, who was Adama's daughter and Apollo's sister, (4) Lt. Boomer, nicely played by Herbert Jefferson Jr, who was Apollo and Starbuck's fellow pilot and friend, (5) Cassie, effervescently played by blonde bombshell Laurette Spang, who was a medic and Starbuck's girlfriend, (6) Boxey, played by Noah Hathaway, who was Apollo's adopted son, (7) Lt. Sheba, confidently played by Anne Lockhart, who was Apollo's fellow pilot and potential love interest introduced about halfway through the first and only season, and last but not least (8) BALTAR, superbly played by John Colicos, a traitor to the Colonies and human leader of the Cylon enemy. All the characters were well- defined on the show and brought something to the table. I liked how effortless the interactions were among the characters and the easygoing appeal that was ever-present throughout. <br/><br/>The special effects were cutting edge for the late 70s, capitalizing on the Star Wars craze that popularized the sci-fi action-adventure genre in both movies and TV. But ""Battlestar Galactica"" was really the first TV series that got it right, like Star Wars was the movie that got it right. In addition to the great effects, the show also fostered healthy discussion and debate among it's characters that felt organic, illustrating that an action series can be both fun and provocative. <br/><br/>Much like ""Star Trek"" of the 60s, ""Battlestar Galactica"" of the 70s, enjoyed only a limited run due to low ratings, but I truly believe, that pound for pound, these two series did more for the science fiction genre on television that many long-running sci-fi series in the later decades did, most of which ended up being very repetitive, watered-down, self- congratulatory, and unoriginal. In terms of sci- fi action-adventure, I'd actually rank this version of ""Battlestar Galactica"", the original one, second only to the original ""Star Trek"" series as the best of it's kind!",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,13 October 2014
3689,Battlestar Galactica," One of those nostalgic ""space mania"" TV shows of the late 70's","Who, having grown up at the time, can ever forget the good old days, when TV shows like this were the ultimate scream of fashion?<br/><br/>I wasn't even born in the 70's, but I still remember very well that in the early 90's TV often aired TV series like this, which now looking back were made before my time but as a child I didn't know that fact nor do I cared.<br/><br/>'Battlestar Galactica' was created by Glen A. Larson, who also created 'Knight Rider', another TV series from my childhood.<br/><br/>Now, looking at it through an adult's perspective, it is lesser great than it was in the days of innocence, but still 'Battlestar Gallactica' shines in nostalgia. Although some episodes were better than others and they always had their flaws, the show really gives that feeling of nostalgia. If not perfect, at least it is authentic. It is from a time when things were real, when things had a special magic. The opening, for example, is fantastic, with those spectacular images of space and space wars. The opening music too is absolutely wonderful, and that opening quote is memorable: <br/><br/>«There are those who believe that life here began out there, far across the universe, with tribes of humans who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians, or the Toltecs, or the Mayans. Some believe that there may yet be brothers of man who even now fight to survive somewhere beyond the heavens.»<br/><br/>Like I said, it's by no means a perfect TV show. But the action scenes and their delicious sounds, the special effects, the space backgrounds... ahhh.... it's all so authentic and perfect (as it should be), without any of the excessive action and explosive noise seen these days.<br/><br/>It starred Lorne Greene as Commander Adama, Richard Hatch as Captain Apollo and Dirk Benedict as Lt. Starbuck, all of them great. Most of these episodes also had Noah Hathaway in a minor role as Boxey, Apollo's little son. Boxey is the cute little tyke. Him and his Muffit. This was a few years before he ""became"" Atreyu. Too bad Boxey doesn't have a bigger role. <br/><br/>Inevitably, this TV series resembles '2001: A Space Odyssey', 'Star Trek' and 'Star Wars'. It was even accused of plagiarism when 'Star Wars' itself heavily drank ideas from an early 70's film called 'Silent Running'.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,,7 April 2012
3690,Battlestar Galactica, A Part Of Sci-Fi History...,"ok.. I have read all the comments about BSG...  I must say I am disappointed in many of the truly negative comments.  I remember watching BSG when it first aired...  I would never miss the show when it was on.  I was sad to see it leave the airwaves when it was canceled. I did watch 'Galactica 1980' when the series resurfaced for a brief time.  The only episode I liked from that was the one featuring Starbuck when he crash landed on a planet and had a cylon as his companion for company.  Yes... the show had feathered hair styles that showed the influence of the times of the late 70's.  But who cares!  I liked the friendship between Apollo, StarBuck, and I loved when they added Sheeba into the group.  BSG is a part of Sci-Fi History.  I would really love to see Richard Hatch's film he made of BSG that he financed and made.  but unless it was ever shown at a convention...  I will never get to see it.  I will watch SciFi channels 'Re-Imagined' BSG, but hate the fact that StarBuck and Boomer will be female characters now.  With StarBuck as a Female...  it will kind of take away a lot of the friendship that Apollo and StarBuck had together.  It's not like you will see them going to the rising star or an officer's club looking for women together anymore.  No daggit Muffy either. But I'll give the newer series a chance...Just as I did for ST:TNG(Star Trek:The Next Generation).  Fans of Star Trek, and even the original Trek cast from TOS were back handed slapping TNG when it first came out.  They claimed they knew Star Trek, and the new show will fail.  But TNG made it through a rocky 1st and 2nd season.  They really came into their own as the 3rd season began.  Maybe the new BSG will be Ok?  We'll see what happens when it starts in Dec.2003.   I just wish people would stop slamming BSG in so many of the comments I have sat through for the last 15 mins. Some of them are by people that have just seen the series for the first time on the sci-fi channel.. It's really all about right now is what the fans of the show remember from seeing it back in 78/79 and appreciating it all over again in reruns on SciFi, and buying the DVD set due out 10/2003.  It's a piece of history for SciFi.  Those of you that have been slamming it. Maybe it was your first time seeing it as a rerun someplace.  Watch the newer version coming out in Dec. 2003.  SciFi has a web site up for it right now giving some background into the newer 'Re-Imagined' version.<br/><br/>Well all I want to say is.  I love the show.  It still stands up to the test of time as a great series. no matter what you others have been saying about it.  Hopefully I will be around long enough to see all of the newer BSG if it does become a TV series... Seeing as I have cancer (Hodgkins disease) and have endured a long treatment in a year and 7 months among which was a really long treatment called 'Stem Cell Transplant'.... Anyhow.

3691,Battlestar Galactica, Engaging Sci-Fi Epic,"Battlestar Galactica had so much going for it, and so much working against it from outside influences. That is has held up as an engaging sci-fi epic despite its myriad off-screen problems and short network run is a tribute to its many strengths in concept, overall production values, cast, and presentation.<br/><br/>Galactica was conceived as a series of TV movies, similar in format to the Columbo-McCloud-McMillan movie series format from earlier in the 1970s. However, late in the going ABC asked for a weekly series, a contingency for which Glen Larson, Universal, and company were not prepared. As a result, the series had a very uneven quality to the scripts, most notoriously shown in the standard-western scripts of the episodes ""The Lost Warrior"" and ""The Magnificent Warriors."" The passage of time, though, has been kind even to such clichés; the standard-western format of these early episodes can be traced to the western gunslinger themes of Star Wars and other 1970s sci-fi, and the performances of the casts, primary and guest, shine through and make these scripts work.<br/><br/>And as the show progressed mistakes were learned from and the writing became better. ""Saga Of A Star World,"" ""Lost Planet Of The Gods Part II,"" ""The Long Patrol,"" and ""The Living Legend"" were more-sharply written stories combining the excellence of the cast with very good twists. It was with ""Living Legend"" (highlighted by Lloyd Bridges' show-stealing performance as Commander Cain, for which he will always be remembered) that really got the show's writing on a truly solid base, and excellent scripts followed in ""War Of The Gods"" (another story highlighted by the performance of the guest star, in this case Patrick Macnee, who immortalizes himself as Count Iblis), the excellent character-driven ""The Man With Nine Lives,"" the surprisingly sharp murder mystery ""Murder On The Rising Star,"" ""Greetings From Earth,"" and the show's strongest and smoothest action drama ""The Hand Of God.""<br/><br/>The cast shines through good and bad in the show, from Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Lorne Greene, and John Colicos (my personal favorite of the show) down through Herbert Jefferson Jr., Laurette Spang, Terry Carter, Jane Seymour in her all-too-brief involvement, and mid-season addition Anne Lockhart. The underused George Murdock, Jack Stauffer, John Dullaghan as Doctor Wilker, Ed Begley Jr., Sheila DeWindt, Janet Louise Johnson, Tony Swartz, and Larry Manetti also sparkle in their appearances, as does veteran character actor Olan Soule as agro ship caretaker Carmichel.<br/><br/>Guest stars were used to superb effect in many episodes. In addition to Lloyd Bridges and Patrick Macnee (both as Count Iblis and the Cylon Imperious Leader - the show smartly gave Iblis an angle on the fact that his voice is the same as that of the supreme Cylon), other show-making guest performers included Lance leGault (of later ""A-Team"" fame), Lloyd Bochner, James Whitmore Jr., John Hoyt, Murray Matheson (in two roles, Sire Gella and the Cylon IL Specter), and Ina Balin. The interplay between the characters in the main and guest casts was always superb, and the off-screen camaraderie among the cast (most hilariously shown in Galactica's in-house gag reel film displaying series outtakes, where Macnee lampoons his opening narration and Colicos concludes by offering to sell some swampland in Florida in full Baltaresque charm, and in the closing top-hat number ""We Gotta Find Earth"" sung hilariously by Hatch, Benedict, and Greene) made the performances all the better.<br/><br/>Much has been made of how the show reused SFX shots every episode; the criticism usually ignores the reality that no sci-fi series of the time could afford not to reuse stock SFX footage - Galactica's practice was hardly unprecedented to fans of the earlier Land Of The Lost series. Made today of course the show could feature new SFX each episode given the advances in SFX technology.<br/><br/>The combination of concept, cast, overall production values, and presentation made for an immensely enjoyable sci-fi series. Comparisons with the new Ronald Moore Galactica series are inevitable, but both add something to a superb concept.",27 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,15 May 2003
3692,Battlestar Galactica, Space Opera Classic,"I always wanted to see original version of Battlestar Galactica, i was never impressed by new one, so i finally watched it and i loved it, yes maybe special effects are outdated but still this show has a soul, heart and message, you also really got connected with the characters, and they are all very interesting and cool. The outstanding performance comes from legendary Lorne Greene as Captain Adama, you really have a feeling he is a leader and commander of Galactica, brilliant casting, also Terry Carter as Colonel Tigh is great, also performance from Richard Hatch(Apollo), Dirk Benedict(Starbuck), Herb Jefferson, Jr. (Boomer), John Colicos (Count Baltar), are worth mentioning. Story is solid, i was only disappointed with the ending but they planned to do second season. Loved also the design of spaceships and Cylons, Cylons in original version looked better 100 times than CGI ones in new series, and their vocoder voices just amazing. Through the series in some scenes we see clear moral and ethic messages and influence of Mormon faith(creator of the series was Mormon). I really enjoyed this serial, and really don't care for the new ones, but because of bad reviews i am not planning to watch Galactica 1980.

3694,Battlestar Galactica, One of the greatest SciFi production series ever made,"This classic good versus evil is the REAL Battlestar Galactica. Sure the new revamp series has all the multi-million dollar production values etc, but this classic still wins hands down for me. In fact the only thing that ages for me in the entire series is that confounded robot dog, which was dodgy even when I watched the series as a kid.<br/><br/>The new series was good for the first 2 seasons but seriously bombed from Season 3 onwards with boring pointless crap that still leaves me speechless that there's a hoard of mad fans out there who actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>In comparison, this, the original series is exciting and entertaining from beginning to end and I still love the terrific costumes and sets to this day(notice how they didn't want to change the terrific models too much for the revamp. The simple answer is not to keep it linked to this original(which for that new series is a travesty with it's horrible season 3 and 4) but because the artwork and design of those models is so damn cool, they couldn't top it period.<br/><br/>If you want to be bored to death by the cylons, then watch the new series all the way through. If you want to be entertained and shown a great story of good versus evil and people working together to achieve a common goal then the original is the way to go. Oh and dare I say it, it will provide you with an entertaining re-watchable story as opposed to the new series unintelligible and never to be watched again series 3 and 4.<br/><br/>Also Battlestar Galactica is a great SciFi series that clearly showed that there's more to intergalactic battles of good versus evil than Star Wars, which to be honest is going to be shown for the pretender it really is, when EE Doc Smiths Lendsman series is finally adapted to the big screen(Star Wars is nothing but another work on the themes that EE Doc Smith created decades before Lucas even put pen to paper and those that have read the Lensman series must note how much of a Lensman Rip Off, Star Wars is). I mention all that because Battlestar Galactica was original despite the hideous notion that Lucas believed it was ripping off Star Wars.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,14 September 2013
3695,Battlestar Galactica, From far beyond the Stars,"Watching the new BSG (or BSG2004) has made me a fan of this. I sense people shaking their heads, but to me this remains the better even if the new one tackles issue of the day. There was a very real sense re-watching these of how a second series could go. The episodes after ""War of the Gods"" for the better part were building up the route home. ""War of the Gods"", ""Greetings from Earth"", ""Experiment in Terra"" and ""The Hand of God"", showed if anything that gradually the Galactica was coming closer to Earth and were finding more clues. Ignore the BSG 1980 series...I'd love to have seen Richard Hatch's Second Coming series come to life. His books are more or less an extension of this, showing a return of the Pegasus, Baltar and other twists and turns. Galactica is not a rip-off of Star Wars, far from it. Whereas there is a Rebel Alliance with bases, Galactica is but one battleship with a 'ragtag, fugitive' fleet fighting as she tries to find Earth.

3696,Battlestar Galactica, The million-dollar controversy.,"Like many of its viewers, when Battlestar Galactica (BSG) aired on the third weekend of my Eighth Grade year of school, I found myself both loving it and hating it, all at the very same time. And I had no idea why... for a very long time.<br/><br/>Even before it aired, I loved it, because, as a Seventh Grader, I had ordered the book which corresponds with the first five hours of the show, and even though I wound up having to share it first with each of my four siblings, and was the last to read the book I had paid for with my own money, I found the story to be utterly compelling.<br/><br/>Similar to previous Sci-Fi TV series, BSG is steeped with social, moral, and political scenarios, pertinent to the era in which it was aired: Those were the years of the heights of the Cold War, where EVERYBODY was HOPING for some sort of peace agreement between the CCCP and the USA, lest there be a nuclear holocaust bestowed upon the whole world. In fact, it was during the airing of the one episode that the episode was interrupted with a news report of a Camp David peace treaty being reached and signed, which, while it wasn't a peace treaty between the USA and the CCCP, but between Israel and the Palistinian Liberation Organization, it spoke untold volumes of how much the whole world wanted peace. So, BSG's warning that overtures of peace might not actually be what they appeared to be, became a very controversial stance to take at the time.<br/><br/>The pilot episodes for one of BSG's well-known predecessors, Star Trek, contained a notion so controversial that when Star Trek aired, it's creator, Gene Roddenberry had to leave it behind: the concept of a woman being in the role of a military leader. BSG's creator, Glen A. Larsen, revisited this theme in a completely different manner: the first three hours of the series had nothing but men in complete command of all situations.. and then, in the fourth, most of the men fell ill, leaving their whole civilization left in the hands of some unexpected heroes (who, by other characters, were bemoaned as being lowly ""SHUTTLE PILOTS"", but, who, on camera, were clearly all of exactly one gender, and not the more masculine of the two), who clearly came out to save the day (but not the series).<br/><br/>This theme resurfaced from time to time throughout the rest of the remaining short-lived series, when the commanding combat pilot of another battlegroup happened to be a much-better, albeit lesser-ranking woman, who wound up having to demonstrate her own capabilities of fitting in to the more male-dominant battlegroup, but from then on remained a firm character in the show.<br/><br/>That's when I, a barely-adolescent male, decided forever and firmly, that given the choice between a capable female or a higher-ranking member of my own gender, who wasn't nearly as capable, I would choose to go to battle with the woman at my side.. which of course, was NOT a very popular notion in the late Seventies, nor throughout the whole decade of the Eighties, for that matter.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there is the VERY overt matter of religion. The creator, Glen A. Larsen, being a member of a pretty controversial church, to begin with, of course began sharing some of his church's more controversial beliefs, as part of the story lines of this show, which can be seen in every single episode, thus earning him the accusation of forcing his beliefs upon anyone who watched the show, despite the repeated caveats that beliefs are for those who CHOOSE to believe them, and not the other way around. Having myself studied his church's beliefs to no small extent, I can tell that he didn't even share the most controversial forms of those beliefs, but watered them down quite a bit, yet, still, they stirred so much controversy.<br/><br/>Again, every single episode of BSG is laced with multifaceted socio-political problems, to which the show's creator, directors, and producors provided a very plausible solution, not only for that day and age, but for any day and age to come, for those who are at least willing to think about it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, however, this is what doomed the show from the beginning, is that although people are very willing to seek out topics of a controversial nature in small doses, Larsen's ability to present multiple controversies in each and every episode, was a bit more than the average viewer was willing to take, so ratings fell, and the series ended.<br/><br/>Or did it? It was revived in an even shorter-lived spin-off, two years later, and it has become the background of much-longer-lasting series which, to my knowledge, is still going strong, even as I type.<br/><br/>That, to me, if more than ample proof that that Gary A. Larsen's idea was nowhere near as bad as some people think it to have been, but were both entertaining and enlightening, despite the popular opinion of the day.",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,,17 January 2008

3698,Battlestar Galactica," At the time, there was nothing like it","The Original 1978 Battlestar Galactica TV Series has copped a panning compared to the vastly superior 2004 ""gritty reboot"".<br/><br/>To rate the original series fairly you need to understand not what it is like now, but what it was like then.<br/><br/>In 1978 we had never seen anything like it. We had ""Star Wars"" the year before, but that was just 2 hours and 15 minutes in a cinema, and it was three years until the next one.<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica offered us the same thing on TV every week. Girls didn't much care, but boys went crazy. Battles in space, every week! What's not to like?<br/><br/>After an impressive opening the show took a dive. Apparently intent on attracting a family viewing, they de-emphasized war-in-space and started copying other shows. The Dirty Dozen... in space. High Noon... in space. Murder She Wrote... in space.<br/><br/>Adults weren't fooled and didn't watch anyway. Half-way through ""The Living Legend"" offered some respite, but Kids wondered what happened to their space opera.<br/><br/>Towards the end they switched back to science fiction. We got a string of very good shows such as ""War of the Gods"", ""Experiment on Terra"" and ""Greetings from Earth"". This was good sci-fi and what we'd wanted to watch all along. But by then the ratings had fallen and although still good, not enough to justify the show's huge budget. After just one season the show was axed.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't up to much, but I doubt kids noticed or cared. Lorne Greene made a great Adama; a warmer and more loving fatherly figure than the reboot's Edward James Olmos (awesome, but in a different way). They replayed the same special effects shots every week, but they were spectacular nonetheless. The production design was camp, but in the 70's people wanted mindless escapism. They didn't want the gritty realism we see in today's sci-fi dramas.<br/><br/>One thing teenager boys were heartbroken over was the disappearance of Maren Jensen as Adama's daughter Athena. We never forgave Starbuck for dumping her for Laurette Spang's character of Cassiopea. Why? Why? Why?<br/><br/>As I rate shows on IMDb I realize the futility of a ratings system. It depends on who is watching, and when they were watching it. I'll try anyway:<br/><br/>A kid in 1978: 8 / 10. An adult in 1978: 5 / 10. A kid in 2013: 4 / 10. An adult in 2013: 2 / 10. An adult watching only the better episodes in 2013: 8 / 10.<br/><br/>Unless you're in nostalgia mode and really want to watch everything I recommend you only watch the better episodes: 1-5, 12-13, 15-16, 19-20, 22-24.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,7.0,11 April 2013
3699,Battlestar Galactica, What made the original Battlestar Special,"I think what made the original special was its universal themes of Family, Friendship, &amp; Survival. But beyond that is the fact the show had character you actually care about. I mean the relationship between apollo, starbuck and boomer is good enough to watch the show. This were i think most shows today fail to do including the New version of BSG. TV use to be full of great character that you actually cared about. From Spock to Data to Magnum P.I to David Banner (Incredible Hulk) to even to Kevin Sorbo's Hercules.<br/><br/>To tell the truth i was big into the new BSG until the end of the first season. When they did the whole Space Munity (witch is a name of a very bad movie) episode. It took me some time for me to realize that BSG was just Law and order in space. Unlikeable Characters, Tired Plot lines, and after a while just kinda boring. As for the Character Changes, Well with new version of BSG. While the original Starbuck fun, exciting and likable character. in the new version Starbuck is pretty much a bitch/slut. By the way i believe the word Buck refers to a male. Maybe if the named her Stardoe it would make more sense. As for Adama, Instead of a kind and loving leader. You get the same old stereotype a military man with a family and Apollo is just plain boring. <br/><br/>Some people say that the fight between old fans of BSG and fans the new version is like the fight between Star Trek vs Star Trek TNG. I think this isn't a fair comparison. First off both shows were created by the same man and the theme of the both show where the same. Sure the shows were different. But what star trek was about was the same. The same really cannot be said about the two version of BSG. Beside the main theme of Survival. They are really drastically different. Some say the original version was cheesy and while it was to a curtain extent. Doesn't mean what the show was about was any less veiled. Beside people say the same thing was said about the original Star Trek and beside TNG i think was still one the best Sci-Fi shows ever. Why i think the original was special is because its everything that the new version isn't and the new version of BSG is like everything else on TV today, overrated and pretentious.<br/><br/>Some people might say that I'm looking at the old series through the lens of nostalgia. The truth is i never even bother to watch the old series until the new version came out. So i really don't have an nostalgia for the old show. I just compared the two and found the new version dull in comparison. Some fans of the New show have said the old version is to immature and the fans of the old need to grow up. Since when has growing into a adult means you have to become a dull person who has lost all his sense of fun and watch nothing but boring drama with dull &amp; unlikeable characters. The truth is the state of TV today is sad, dark and depressing. Television was far better in the 50's, 60's, 70's, 80's and mid 90's. So in closing, I think the golden age of television has pretty much ended and all we have left is a sad hollow shell of what it once was.",21 out of 35 found this helpful.,10.0,23 June 2008
3700,Battlestar Galactica, Battlestar Galactica (1978-1979),"The original show is all that matters to me. Ever since I was a kid (when it originally aired), I've watched it throughout my life and is my favorite thing ever created for TV. Somehow, I even managed to see a screening of the Battlestar Galactica movie (the first couple episodes edited together thing) at some walk in theater when I was a kid. I'm a huge supporter of the original cast and story. Though I never made it to any conventions or did much online about the show, the new show was built on bodies and hard work of the original shows supporters. What a terrible thing to do. I watched that happen online. But I'm not judging the new show itself as I have never seen it and have no desire to. The original show is enough for me and the characters and stories, etc., are all that I care about. As a huge fan of the original Battlestar Galactica (1978-1979) series, I have collected the old novels that Glen A.

3701,Battlestar Galactica, We interrupt this broadcast...,"I have to agree with the positive comments. This was a show set apart, playing its part filling the sci-fi vacuum after Star Trek the original series went off the air. As a kid, this was the greatest thing on the tube for me.<br/><br/>The premiere's time slot was problematic, however, since as a third grader it was past my bedtime. Every time I've seen the pilot over the years, I remember exactly where in the sequence the ABC News special report suddenly appeared, no doubt to the widespread cries of ""What the...?"" across television land.<br/><br/>(In retrospect, it's fitting that a world event involving a people who at one time had no land to call home would interrupt a movie with a plot line about a people without a land to call home. Maybe the peace treaty signed in real life was, unlike the peace treaty at the opening of the movie, a genuine peace, or maybe it was just the beginning of a great international betrayal. Was life imitating art or the other way around?) <br/><br/>The Camp David peace treaty came in the middle of the scene where Starbuck, Apollo and company are fighting their way out of the Tylium mines on Carillon (igniting the fire that eventually causes the whole planet to explode). I don't remember how long the treaty took to sign, but that was probably the longest wait I can remember in childhood. This was before the home VCR (or at least before my household had one), and there was a back and forth with the parental units over whether we had to go to bed; I remember that the next day was a school day.<br/><br/>Mom and Pop gracefully allowed us to finish the show, since obviously it would ""never"" be aired again.

3702,Battlestar Galactica," Good, but came out at the wrong time.","The original Galactica was in my opinion, good, but the reason why it only lasted one season in my opinion are as follows:<br/><br/>-The effects did not look original, so it was seen as a Star Wars Ripoff.<br/><br/>-It was seen mostly as something for kids at the time, so adults felt no use in watching it.<br/><br/>-The sociopolitical sitcoms of the time(All in The Family, Sanford and Son, The Jeffesrsons, etc)were winding down and prime-time soap-operas like Dallas and Knots Landing were starting to get big, so it was doomed from the beginning since most people at the time would rather watch a prime-time version of daytime drama like Dallas than a sci-fi epic series on television.  Dallas debuted at the same time period as Galactica.<br/><br/>-No such thing as ""first-run syndication"" existed at the time.  It probably would have gone on longer if it had.

Hope against dispair. Life against death. It's just a shame it only ran for 24 episodes. I bought the box set last month and I haven't regreted it. I still love the show even Sixteen years after first watching it. You may think it's crap. I think it's good.

3704,Battlestar Galactica," ""A Shining Planet Known as Earth!""","Glen A.Larson's 'Battlestar Galactica' premiered on U.S. television in 1978, one year after 'Star Wars' sent shock waves through the entertainment industry. As was to be expected, it had many of the same ingredients - dogfights in space, weird aliens, exotically named planets, beautiful girls, pseudo-mysticism etc. John Dykstra, responsible for the S.F.X. on Lucas' film, was 'B.S.G.'s original producer.<br/><br/>The cast - Richard Hatch, Dirk Benedict, Maren Jensen and Laurette Spang - were mainly unknowns, with Lorne Greene of 'Bonanza' fame taking up the lead as 'Commander Adama'. The late John Colicos made a suitably slimy villain as Count Baltar.<br/><br/>The premise is this; after years of conflict, the Twelve Colonies are preparing to enter into a peace settlement with their adversary, the robotic Cylons. But it turns out to be a trap; the Cylons launch an all-out attack on Humanity and, in the ensuing conflict, the Twelve Colonies are totally wiped out. The last surviving battlestar - the Galactica - embarks on a quest to find a mythical thirteenth colony - Earth.<br/><br/>American sci-fi shows of the '70's always looked good, but 'B.S.G.' outdid them all. The action was super spectacular. Of course a lot of the dogfights were recycled, but given the pressures the production crew were under, this was to be expected. What matters is that the twenty-four episodes were, by and large, entertaining. My favourite was the two-parter 'The Living Legend' in which the late Lloyd Bridges played long-lost war hero 'Commander Cain' whose 'might is right' views bring him into conflict with the more level-headed Adama. Ex-Avenger Patrick Macnee cropped up as 'Count Iblis' in another memorable adventure - 'War Of The Gods'. A few episodes seemed to have been inspired by Westerns and war films. This was not unprecedented. Roddenberry did it first on 'Star Trek'.<br/><br/>Despite massive popularity, the network cancelled the show after one season, replacing it with the noticeably cheaper-looking 'Galactica 1980'. Fans gave it the thumbs-down.<br/><br/>In Britain, the show was not screened until 1980, and then I.T.V. inexplicably denied it a network slot. Since then. however, it has been shown several times on the B.B.C. ( who chose on pass on the new version ). <br/><br/>Classic 'B.S.G.' maintained a loyal fan base down the years. In 1998, Richard Hatch put his name to the first of seven original novels, set twenty years after the events of the series. Hopes for a fully-fledged revival were shattered in 2004 when the Sci-Fi Channel screened a 'reimagining' courtesy of Ronald D.Moore and David Eick. Moore had nothing but contempt for the original and it showed. He gutted the series of its warmth and charm, turning it instead into a cold, sterile allegory on the War On Terror. While it has its supporters, I am not amongst them. To me it is just not 'B.S.G.'. As so often happens with remakes, its fans gloat endlessly over how superior 'their' version is whilst forgetting that, without the original's reputation, a remake would not have been possible. Classic 'B.S.G'. was aimed at a family audience. To dismiss it as 'childish rubbish' is pointless. <br/><br/>Hopefully, one day, we will see a revival that respects the original. Perhaps Larson is the man who can give it to us.",12 out of 20 found this helpful.,9.0,12 December 2006

Commander Adama (Lorne Greene) leads the search for the mythical thirteenth colony Terra. Captain Apollo (Richard Hatch) and Lieutenant Starbuck (Dirk Benedict) are the leading Viper pilots. They struggle to escape the traitor Baltar (John Colicos) and his Cylon cohorts under Lucifer.<br/><br/>This Star Wars inspired franchise stumbles from time to time but at the end of the day, this is good sci-fi TV especially for its day. The biggest stumbles are the various human settlements that the convoy encounters. It puts the central premise under problematic rewriting. The basic premise is that these are the last of humanity looking for salvation. That's the drama. All these other human populations punch holes in that premise. They could stop at these places or gather up these survivors. It doesn't help to have unicorns either.<br/><br/>The best episodes are probably Battlestar Pegasus and Fire in Space. The human settlements episodes are repetitive and degenerative. I'm also not a big fan of Boxey and Muffit. The Ship of Lights is memorable and could be expanded. The idea for Ice Planet Zero is classic but flawed at its core. It's a stationary weapon after all. There are quite a bit of recycling in the action FX sequences but that's to be expected for TV. One does grade on a curve and this is one of the better ones in its era.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,22 July 2017
3706,Battlestar Galactica, Wonderful Story of Civilization in Search for New Beginning,"Watched the Series as a kid, watched it again as an Adult , and the series is Timeless. If they simply reedit the episodes and edit out the computers and enhance graphics a bit the show still holds true. <br/><br/>What this show offers you is , story telling. Apllo &amp; Starbuck's friendship while fighting cylons. Loren Green's amazing performance as Adama , he is really very convincing. The Actor who played Baltar , when you will see him act and them compare his emotions and facial expressions you will understand the quality of his acting. Not to mention the awesome Cylons. <br/><br/>What do I love about the show , sense of Alien Culture they don't make many reference to Earth's culture. They have their own identity and terminology. Amazing special effects similar to Star War's 1 type battle scenes, considering it was a TV show not a movie , the production was superb.<br/><br/>Great performances by Dirk Benidict as Starbucks , a lovable character who told jokes even in the darkest of situations. Unique topics dealing with Technology, Humanity, Government and strategy in space warfare. Can't imagine the show with out STARBUCK played by Dirk Benidict<br/><br/>Maren Jensen , is the best female space girl she is in the show<br/><br/>The best part of show is the feel good factor of the show , and sense of family , and positive role models like Appolo , Boomer and to some extent Starbucks.<br/><br/>The costumes wore by the actors are superb and the sound effects are superb and the Battle Ship sequences are amazing as well <br/><br/>Its enough to say it inspires people to use their imaginations , specially kids to play as space pilots and think of exploring space",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,22 October 2013

3708,Reno 911!, Shots Fired: Comedy Central scores a hit with this hilarious screwball farce,"Network: Comedy Central; Genera: Comedy/Sketch; Content Rating: TV-14 (for strong language and sexual content; Classification: Contemporary (Star range: 1 - 4)<br/><br/>Season Reviewed: 5 seasons<br/><br/>From the outset, a full-length parody of 'Cops' wouldn't sound like any groundbreaking comedy. With it's well known traditions and often copied style, 'Cops' has long been the subject of parody for years before arguably becoming a parody of itself. However, 'Reno 911!' does you one better. From Thomas Lennon, Kerri Kennedy and Ben Garant - the creators of 'The State' and the now forgiven and forgotten 'Viva Variety' - 'Reno' takes that 'Cops' mold (and 'Rescue 911!' title sequence) and populates it with a world of realized original characters. <br/><br/>In 'Reno' this comedy troupe has found a perfect cross between the improvisational sketch comedy series and the episodic televisions series. The show, as you might expect, is largely improved which can be good or bad (as seen in last year's disastrous 'Life with Bonnie'). The show's hit-and-miss laugh ratio is lower than it probably would be if it was scripted, but what we gain in the trade-off is this wonderful naturalistic dialog. The crew have an ear for recreating that often witty but just as often dull, monotonous and uncomfortable naturalistic conversation. If 'Reno' were any funnier it would be in the stratosphere. I love the opening title sequences. <br/><br/>The entire cast is note-perfect. We have straight-laced Jonsey (Cedric Yarbrough), Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui), a racist, lonely, complex shell of a man, Clementine (Wendi McLendon-Covey) is the truck stop waitress turned cop ""with a full dance card"", Junior (Garant) is the incompetent, fully of stories, young cadet and Rainessha Williams (Niecy Nash) is the sassy, booty-licious femme-fetal cop. The show bounces all these characters off each other, matching them up in odd pairs and letting the nuances in them create the sparks. Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kennedy have given themselves the juiciest roles and approach brilliance in them. Kenney's Trudy Weigel is superbly dysfunctional beyond any simple description and Lennon's Jim Dangle is poised to be the breakout character of the show. Like Mr. Garrison in 'South Park' and Stewie Griffen on 'Family Guy', Dangle is a character than can get a laugh from me almost anytime he opens his mouth. It has a knack for creating scenarios where, in an odd way, the set-ups can be funnier than the punch line. Just the idea that Jim Dangle is going to show up to Trudy Weigel's house and ""give her the thrill of her life"" is funnier than ultimately seeing the Asian man she's hiding in her kitchen.<br/><br/>'Reno' knows its way around the 'Cops' traditions, making ample use of streakers with strategically placed edit blurs (also brilliantly hiding the faces of the cast doubling up), belligerent roadside pull-overs, hookers with bad wigs and crazy domestic disturbance calls that reveal fetishes best kept behind closed doors. But it also knows it needs to be more than that. The episode plots are as hilariously strange as it comes and veiled thinly enough to support any number of tangential gags. In one episode the group is put on suicide watch for Trudy Weigel and she flips out because they look disappointed she didn't go through with it. In another, they venture to the Burning Man festival and get lost along the way in full rave gear. In a particularly inspired episode they compete for 2 tickets to an execution with a suspect scavenger hunt.The bumbling officers get visits from the FBI, Homeland Security, British officers and in 2 classic episodes a religious tele-evangelist and Reading Ron (Brian Unger) featuring a show-stoppping bit with a cat on a roof. Watch continuously and you'll see running gags and continuity coming out in what otherwise seems like randomized chaos. These cops view enforcing the law as a happy side effect to the real joy of holding their power over the citizens of the burned-out Nevada suburb, abusing it gleefully and not above pulling guns on themselves. <br/><br/>'Reno 911!' was originally produced as a pilot for Fox and sat on the shelf for 2 years before Comedy Central came calling (and it became an almost instant hit). Sounds like something Fox would do. It's all for the best as 'Reno' on Comedy Central is given free range to do things every week that would have gotten them throw off the air at Fox. Jokes around rape, accidental shootings, cops planting evidence and screwing with the citizens (in a time when the media loves to put a wedge between cops and the people), red-necks &amp; every racial demographic known to man, discussions on when it's appropriate to use the N-word, terrorists in the post-9/11 world (with the greatest of ease I might add, a subject most shows trip over themselves to run from) and everything else you might imagine would give a network suit a conniption fit are peppered well into the show. It enthusiastically leapfrogs from one set piece to the next in an attempt to offend anyone and everyone it can and getting big laughs with it. <br/><br/>I largely consider Comedy Central a dumping ground, but admire their drive to take chances - which is more than you can say for the networks. 'Reno' is a show that isn't crude for the sake of it or the edgy in appearance only. It is a gutsy, frequently hysterical series in which the gags are expertly delivered (and edited together) by a well developed cast of comic talents. A real screwball farce that roams freely around without politically correct borders or boundaries, the likes of which you just don't see much of on TV today. And you want, silly slapstick? 'Reno' proves that even the age-old kick-in-the-groin gag, if done well, can still be funny. An acquired taste, but well worth it.<br/><br/>* * * / 4",61 out of 68 found this helpful.,,6 July 2004

3718,Reno 911!, Glad Comedy Central believes in this,"A feeling of pride wells in me when I think of this show. I recall when this show premiered in the Summer of 2003. I've watched a lot of Comedy Central over the years,and I've sen a lot of shows come and go on that channel,some good,some not-so-good. Outside of Chappelle Show(which imploded under CC's unreasonable production demands after just threes successful seasons),Win Ben Stein's Money(which was quietly shelved)and The Man Show(which disassembled itself after five seasons),the network has retained few shows it has rolled out since 1996,the year the Daily Show was launched. But this show has survived,and the quality of the product bears it out.<br/><br/>A film crew follows the round-the-clock gongs on of seven Reno,Nevada Sheriff's deputies: Lt.Dangle(Thomas Lennon),Deputies Jones(Cedric Yarborough),GArcia(Carlos Alozraqui,spelling?),Johnson(Wendi McLendon-Covey),Junior(Ben Garant),Weigel(Kerri Kinney-Silver) and YAtes(?)(Mary Birdsong),a la the FOX TV institutional hit ""Cops"". Of course,nearly all of these deps have little good sense about them,and all seem to have increasing difficulty conducting their jobs as enforcers of the law with each episode. Naturally,one hopes that the REAL Reno police is not nearly this incompetent. <br/><br/>The improv talents of each actor is SUPERB,and the camera-work and seamless ""documentation"" of the events unfolding make this comedy that one has to stay acutely attuned to. For me,that is the sign of a strong comedy that's willing to allow gags and plot lines to hang back and let the viewer come TO it,rather than vice-versa. And as per my previous favorable critiques of comedies,one of the more favorable qualities of it is this show's lack of a laugh track,which would be absolute poison to it(even more so than some more ""conventional"" sitcoms),anyway.<br/><br/>With this show most recently going to the big screen--and the jury's out on if I want to see Reno 911!:Miami--I feel pretty good about this show's status on CC(perhaps wrongly so).

Each week we get to follow members of the Reno Sheriff department as they investigate every weird kind of crime there is. However, it is the officers themselves that are the most deranged individuals out there. From the obviously gay Dangle to the equally worthless Junior. One of the great things is that each character is given a detailed and unique persona. Some are stupid, some are jerks, all are funny.

The combination of uncanny deadpan comedy, great improv work, and very creative writing makes for a great show. It has great rewatchability as you notice new subtle expressions and hilarious remarks within the improv. I would highly recommend purchasing the DVD's since you can watch the episodes in order and the special features are very good, specifically the ""uncut"" versions of some scenes, which is basically 5 minutes of the characters improvising off each other, then using the best parts in the show.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,8 January 2006

The show cares for the characters, but not so much as to guard them from harm. The perps are also very funny. Michael Ian Black was awesome as the sex offender and the Truckee Strangler was terrifically deadpan. The prostitution man is a delight and Terry can Xanadu it any time.

Essentially this show is about the Reno Police Force and their consistent misadventures.<br/><br/>The show features at least one blurred naked body per episode and uses a few running gags, but for the most part it's totally unpredictable and very, very funny.<br/><br/>The show follows the cops as they go around stopping crimes and helping the public. It's kind of random - like the show ""COPS"" - and will jump from one segment to the next even if they're unrelated to each other.<br/><br/>The cast is great because they never let on that it's a comedy.

It's also written in Sorkinese – Aaron Sorkin's fast-paced, back-and-forth, sing-song dialogue that'll leave you heady on a good day but with a headache on a bad one. <br/><br/>So, like critics have lambasted, is it ""weighted too heavily toward sermonizing diatribes (LA Times)?"" Maybe. Does it ""choke on its own sanctimony (NY Times)?"" Perhaps. Is it ""yet another platform in which to Set the People Straight is a worthwhile purpose (Huffington Post)?"" Most definitely yes. But is this all really so horribly, terribly bad? NO! <br/><br/>The main bone of contention for critics for this show seems to be that it tries too hard to be good, do good and instill good, just like all of Sorkin's earlier work. But when did that become a crime, in times of shows about becoming the next scrawniest supermodel, douchiest reality housemate or Tim Allen's 30th comeback? What's wrong with a show fantasizing about a world upheld by a long-forgotten morality in a time infested with shows that fall over each other to portray stark, grim realities and apocalyptic futures? <br/><br/>The Newsroom's got a fantastic cast with enough charm to last you till the next Woody Allen movie. Emily Mortimer's already got me falling in love with her, Jeff Daniel makes you really root for him, John Gallagher Jr and Alison Pill have an instant chemistry and Sam Waterson's singularly enough to bring you back every week. Yes, it's longer than it needed to be, and yes, it could have done with a little more Noam Chomsky and a little less Don Quixote. But really, as long as it does what so few show can ever claim to together – rouse you, make you think and ENTERTAIN, bloody well at that – who's complaining? <br/><br/>Admittedly, I'm a fan of Aaron Sorkin. I've seen (repeatedly) and LOVED Sports Night and The West Wing, and I think Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip is one of the best shows ever made. His writing has inspired me in the past, and after watching The Newsroom, I have all reasons to believe that it will continue to, well into the future. <br/><br/>Critics be damned, watch this show simply because it's good television. It may not change the world, but at least it's trying to.",398 out of 482 found this helpful.,10.0,26 June 2012
3735,The Newsroom," Over, but not forgotten","Maybe I am just coming into adulthood after my 45 years, but The Newsroom has always been food for thought. The pace, direction and writing has been excellent. I have watched and re-watched every episode over the past 3 seasons and really can't understand why they would cancel this show for the ages. First I was not a person that watched West Wing. I was younger and dumber for the show to stick. this show grabbed me from the get go and I have never been more surprised with it's greatness.<br/><br/>HBO - why oh why are buying into the big network belief that the public is not getting what you bring us. This show is why I subscribe to your network and seeing it leave is a shame. The past episode ""Oh Shenandoah"" was brilliant is so many ways. It left me thinking about my father and how we can challenge ourselves in moments of being tested. I came here to tell everyone I will watch the last episode with sadness and wish I could continue this great program going forward, but it's over. I will save these three seasons and remember every episode with fondness and hope to see these great actors, directors and writers in the future where they can continue to express themselves without worrying about ratings or money driven desires.<br/><br/>Thank you for 3 great seasons!",52 out of 61 found this helpful.,10.0,7 December 2014
3736,The Newsroom, It is great to have him back,"I am watching it for a second time. All of the critics are acting as if Aaron Sorkin kicked dirt in their faces. The critics said nothing of substance- just vitriolic rants. Maybe Sorkin has hit a nerve. In a sea of crap T.V. this is entertaining. Believe me, we all know that the Newsroom characters are no more realistic than President Bartlet or Sam or Toby, Josh,Leo, C.J., Josh, or Donna. I don't think for one minute that the President of the United States has a secretary who doles out cookies, but I desperately need to believe that we are capable of being all of these characters.

3737,The Newsroom, Brilliant and Challenging,"Rarely does a television show come along and sweep you off your feet with brilliant writing, an amazing cast and an actual message that is relevant and inspirational. Aaron Sorkin has done it again with The Newsroom! This show is truly a display of what television can achieve if we have the right people who are willing to break the rules of the mundane drab to make an engaging and intelligent show. <br/><br/>Jeff Daniels plays Will McAvoy, the cautious, veteran news anchor tiptoeing with his career in order to ""play it safe"", concerned more with keeping his ratings than stepping on toes. He has the smarts, the background and the ability to be something more, a challenger of beliefs and a defender of ideals, but lacks the motivation until Mackenzie MacHale (played beautifully by Emily Mortimer), a woman from his past, reenters his life. She is the spark to ignite his flame and gets him burning with an unquenchable passion once again.<br/><br/>Within the first five minutes of the show, Jeff Daniels delivers a speech of Aaron Sorkin's words about the state of America that is extremely touching, stimulating and brutally true for a vast majority of the population. It's reminiscent of his West Wing days, but with even more flare and aggression. I only hope he can keep the pace that he has set with the pilot; the bar is set high.",165 out of 224 found this helpful.,9.0,25 June 2012
3738,The Newsroom," Brilliant, Briskly Intelligent Writing","A new series launched on HBO with a star-spangled episode 'We just decided to'. As conceived and written by Aaron Sorkin it is a timely, incredibly intelligently written show populated with some of our best seasoned actors as well as some very fine actors on the way up. This is the kind of television that reminds us that at one time the news programs informed us about current events and ran a continuing commentary on the development of events in this country and around the world in a manner that kept us alerted of why we as a nation needed to remain alert to both good and bad events, to celebrate when indicated and to fight back when injustices were occurring. This direction is indicated in the background imagery for the titles – running glimpses of the likes of Walter Cronkite, Edward R Murrow, Huntley/Brinkley etc who were responsible news anchors instead of the flippant celebrities more concerned with ratings of their show than the news we see today.<br/><br/>The first episode opens with popular news anchor Will McAvoy (Jeff Daniels who proves his acting chops here) being interviewed on a college campus and responds to a student question 'Why is America the greatest country' by answering 'We're not. We used to be' and then runs us past our history of reportage on television that proves that the country has fallen in world view because we no longer care about our initial basic rites an freedoms and concern for humanity. It is a powerful start with some of the most gut-wrenching insightful history of this country that has been written for television.<br/><br/>From there, McAvoy returns to his station to find a support team missing and a replacement named. But enter an old flame, the war correspondent fatigued Mackenzie MacHale (Emily Mortimer, never more brilliant) who has been assigned Will's new Executive Producer and in the midst of many changes the new arrangement (not a popular one for Will) evolves into a return to actual news reporting of the significant type – all over the 2010 BP oil explosion and spill that threatened the Gulf of Mexico. It is raw, real, factual, and immediate news delivered with veracity and commitment.<br/><br/>Greg Mottola directs with keen precision, allowing moments of comic relief to be present if subtle and keeps the momentum of the show propelling smoothly. The cast of superb actors includes John Gallagher, Jr. (brilliant), Dev Patel, Allison Pill, Sam Waterston (never better), Thomas Sadoski, Chris Chalk, Trieu Tran, Charlie Weirauch, Margaret Judson, Olivia Munn, Adina Porter – and more. A more talented and committed cast would be hard to imagine. THIS is the kind of television series we so very sorely need right now. It is refreshingly free of the usual clatter and gimmicks that clutter the airways, and it s full of information and food for thought delivered in an entertaining manner. And this is only Episode 1! <br/><br/>Grady Harp",134 out of 192 found this helpful.,10.0,25 June 2012
3739,The Newsroom, BEST SHOW I HAVE EVER SEEN,"I can not express how much this show means to me. I cried my eyes out.

3740,The Newsroom, Sensational!,"I've been waiting for what seems like forever for a top notch show to present itself, and I truly feel this is it. To say the first show was riveting is a gross understatement. As a news show, this fictitious newsroom had me planted on the edge of my seat, and when things finally got going, I found myself fidgeting and wide-eyed waiting for what came next. I have to say the leads in this show have amazing chemistry, the sort of chemistry that usually takes several shows to develop, yet here it was, in spades no less. It's easy to believe that I'm overstating this, but I truly believe this show has the potential for greatness, and believe me, I'm normally a fairly harsh critic, but in this case I feel completely justified in touting this as the next great show. There's some great social commentary on offer here, while not exactly new, it's offered up in a far more palatable fashion than the usual polarised and emotional manner. Needless to say, I implore all to watch this first episode, as it was so good, it could have been stretched another 30 minutes to become a great movie. The fact that we get more, is the icing on the cake. I can only hope the writers can keep producing scripts near the same level as this one. 5 stars, or 10 out of 10.

3741,The Newsroom, Fantastic start,"I watch a lot of TV shows and I have to say that The Newroom has impressed. Quick witted, fast paced and dealing with issues that exist in American news coverage and to some extent beyond. The main characters were engaging and their interactions into the future will be interesting to see as well. <br/><br/>What I really enjoyed was the exploration of what news reporting really is and how reporters should act when in the pursuit of a story, as well as what stories are relevant. Though not explicitly stated it brings to mind the image of a reporter who is actually unbiased and unafraid to go after the truth. The first episode covered the events of the BP oil spill in 2010. I look forward to the coverage of other major news events from this inside perspective as well.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend it as a show to see. I hope it continues on in the same vein.",111 out of 165 found this helpful.,10.0,25 June 2012
3742,The Newsroom, Future Emmy Winning Show,"I watched this show after watching True Blood, which I watch out of habit on Sunday nights with my wife. I am SO glad we kept HBO on. I remember hearing about this show from different promos and snippets of interviews on the computer, but wow. Aaron Sorkin leaves his mark all over this show, right from the intro, which was very reminiscent of The West Wing right until the ending. Fantastic creation by him.<br/><br/>Without mentioning any spoilers, the show is about a news anchor (Jeff Daniels) who is beloved by his viewers but not so much by his co-workers and employees due to his aloofness, biting sarcasm, and general malaise. His character has a turning point in the opening scene and it is phenomenal. The writing, acting, cinematography, and tempo of the show are excellent. I fell in love with it right away. And how great is Sam Waterson on this show? I hope that this show has a domino effect and REAL news anchors take note and feel inspired. Hopefully, this show may lead to REAL NEWS STORIES by REAL NEWS ANCHORS. 9/10. Emmy's are DEFINITELY in this show's future.",124 out of 187 found this helpful.,9.0,24 June 2012
3743,The Newsroom, Eh,Firstly overall I think this show is well done. There are a few issues that bug me.<br/><br/>Will is supposedly a Republican yet never really has a view point that would support that stated fact. It is almost as if they have the title there so people can't argue that it is a show about a typical liberal news network. Which is obvious because they grill republicans on the show all the time. Yet to see any liberal points of view being attacked or questioned. <br/><br/>Maggie is a very annoying character seems overacted. Love triangle between her and two other male characters is really really over used.<br/><br/>The show comes off as pretentious and condescending at points.<br/><br/>Jeff Daniels and Sam Waterstons acting are superb and really anchor the show.,45 out of 64 found this helpful.,6.0,26 August 2012
3744,The Newsroom, Hot new show,"THIS IS THE MOST EXCITING SHOW I HAVE SEEN ON T.V. SINCE ""THE WEST WING.""<br/><br/>I used TWW because, yes, this too is an Aaron Sorkin tour-de-force.<br/><br/>Imagine your most idealized concept of how news SHOULD be reported. Now, imagine any news service (network or cable) who would actually report the news. Now, put someone in charge who will clean house and hire people who will actually do their jobs, without regard to ratings or demographics.<br/><br/>Aw, forget it. That only happens on T.V. Usually HBO. Wait!! This IS HBO!! And, when that oil rig in the gulf blows out, only a couple of people see the true potential of the consequences of that explosion. And they just happen to be well-connected enough to get on-the-record statements from people who are in positions to know what they're talking about. Like the people who would become known to all of us soon while the greatest oil spill in history gets out of control, but also gets spun to everyone's benefit.<br/><br/>But this show is NOT about the spill. It's about a group of highly- qualified people coming together to produce a news show that actually dispenses NEWS. I have great hope for future episodes. I even watched this first episode twice.

3745,The Newsroom," Good, but slanted","The general idea of the show is easy to sum up: cable TV ""news"" shows have been doing a poor job educating the American electorate, focusing on ratings (which means focusing on entertainment). Sounds great.<br/><br/>Also understand there is another premise: Liberal arguments are correct and factually based, Conservative arguments are incorrect, and only rely on emotion. Basically, FOX News, turned 180 degrees, and with as nasty attitude towards the opposition as Sean Hannity. Just as ""Fair and Balanced"". Stereotypes abound.<br/><br/>A close examination of the personal stories will show the greatest weakness. Relationships are just too complicated for too long. And instead of getting resolution, you get more complications. And just like previous stated about the lone Republican doing nothing like a Republican, the one ""Christian"" has only gotten mad at other Christians, and never stood up for any ""Christian value"" that could be deemed controversial (between numerous drunken spells and booty calls).",24 out of 34 found this helpful.,7.0,8 July 2013
3746,The Newsroom," Starts great, finishes off mediocre","The reason I starting watching Newsroom is seeing Will's rant from Episode 1 on Youtube. It's quite good, and points out a lot of America's problems.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the show consists of him blaming the Tea Party for these problems. Do I have a problem with Will smacking the Tea Party? No, in my opinion they deserve it ten times over.<br/><br/>What I do have a problem with is the show being JUST Will smacking the Tea Party? Yes. I thought this was supposed to be about the real news, or unbiased political commentary, or at the very least work in the newsroom.<br/><br/>Instead, the show might as well be called ""Aaron Sorkin bitching about the Tea Party (with some teenage drama on the side and a very romantic re-imagining of newsroom work)"".<br/><br/>I love the idea of the show, and I loved the first couple episodes; however, towards the end it became nearly as one-sided and repetitive as the Tea Party rhetoric it seems to hate. No wonder the show got such a high rating - people who agree with the huge bias love it, and the people who disagree don't watch it.",34 out of 52 found this helpful.,5.0,14 November 2012
3747,The Newsroom, Children in big bodies,"First of all I know this is American drama and that emotions are a key component of such products. Second, I expect the characters to be somewhat believable and somewhat likable. While most comments on IMDb that dislike this program are about the perceived left-wing bias, my criticism is that all the characters seem to be on day-release from intense psychotherapy. If they are not, they certainly should be getting therapy. Everybody seems unable to deal with who they are, and what others do around them. Everyone gets upset at the slightest action of another. Everyone is either maudlin, fearful, or angst-ridden. They have the emotional response of emo teenagers. And this does not for good drama make. You have to care about characters in order to be involved and feel for them. Instead, we are subjected to children in big bodies who are eminently unlovable. This is the worst of American drama. While I understand that HBO made this for an American audience, it is so self-absorbed as to make Paris Hilton look positively interesting. The newsroom? Oooh! Television! Wow. And people get upset! Fascinating. And there are real stories as well. I mean real stories! How can you not want to watch it? It's not even boring, it's painfully masturbatory. It is so full of its own self-importance as be an exercise in politics. While some might like it because it is 'socially relevant' the script means that you are constantly being subjected to trauma.

3748,The Newsroom, Why The Newsroom won't survive.,"Several years ago, Aaron Sorkin created a show called ""Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip."" I enjoyed this show a lot. It wasn't as good as ""The West Wing,"" but it wasn't real bad.<br/><br/>But as the series went on, more time was spent on relationships between the characters than time spent on what the show was suppose to be about: producing a weekly ""Saturday Night Live"" type of show. That got old fast, the show got boring, and it was canceled after only one season.<br/><br/>Now along comes ""The Newsroom."" I had great hopes for this series. Great writer, good cast, great setting (a cable network newsroom). The first episode was really enjoyable. That Aaron Sorkin dialog that requires ones undivided attention was there, and I loved it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, too much time is spent on personal relationships, and their stories are really hard to follow. When Will McAvoy is doing a story or interviewing someone, it's great TV. When he's concerned about stories some tabloid is reporting, it gets boring.<br/><br/>Likewise, the love lives of Jim Harper, Don Keefer, et al, are just not very interesting. Sorkin should spend more time on news stories and broadcasts than on these relationships.<br/><br/>If this situation isn't corrected, I predict ""The Newsroom"" has one more season in it, if that.",40 out of 63 found this helpful.,5.0,15 September 2012
3749,The Newsroom, Terrific,I'm just a sucker for anything Sorkin. I thought The Newsroom was terrific and it's a shame there are only 25 episodes.

3750,The Newsroom, Fascinating Examination of Journalistic Ethics Juxtaposed with Witty Writing!,"I had attempted to watch the West Wing, but found it to be too dated. Newsroom was my second attempt to watch an Aaron Sorkin show. I absolutely fell in love with some of the characters, most notably Will McAvoy and Jim Harper.<br/><br/>The writing is absolutely brilliant. The dialogue is very witty and creates some fun situations. There are several comedic moments in the show while balancing massive news stories such as Deepwater Horizon or the assassination of OBL. What I love most is how often Don Quixote comes into play through dialogue.<br/><br/>The premise of the show is to report the news the correct way, not through calling attention to reality TV stars or a celebrity feud. Don Quixote and his mission to civilize is a frequent presence of the show. I identify far too much with Will McAvoy. Will is fiercely loyal, protective and can be a bit of an ass. Will was fine reporting stories that were not necessarily newsworthy until his former flame MacKenzie McHale (Emily Mortimer) arrives as the new EP for his show. Mac forces and encourages him to report the actual news to the public. Will takes it upon himself to educate viewers, but also gossip columnists and others who he deems do not know the actual news. The relationship between Mac and Will is one of the series best.<br/><br/>Romance is a huge part of the show. There is a love between Will and Mac for the entirety of the series. I love Jim Harper (Josh Gallagher Jr.) though. He is kind, dorky and has the greatest bromance with Neal Sampat (Dev Patel). He also has a crush on fellow coworker Maggie Jordan (Alison Pill) and their chemistry is amazing.<br/><br/>Lastly, I was shocked to find the number of terrible reviews from numerous media outlets. The show does hope to change the way Americans view the news. The news does frequently mention the latest celebrity scandal and does not educate. The series hopes to fill that void. I believe that The NY Times, LA Times and others felt threatened by exposing the inner workings of a news station. I loved the show because it shows the idiocy of politicians, governmental mistakes and other key issues. Although, if you are conservative I do advise against watching the show.<br/><br/>I was very sad watching the series finale. I felt very close to some of the characters which is not something that happens to me very often. The series ends beautifully and I feel the series is so important as a whole. I wish the show was still continuing in the age of fake news, but I am thankful it was on for as long as it was. I found myself laughing, deep in thought and learning. I definitely recommend this!!!",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,4 April 2020
3751,The Newsroom," Sorkin Does TV Really Well - He ""Just Decided To""","Aaron Sorkin has owned Television for the past 15 years. He just never misses.<br/><br/>I've been on a Sorkin set ('West Wing'), the recipient of his quick barbed wit, and a witness to his working with actors and directors.<br/><br/>His brilliance is legendary - when Aaron pulls up to the gas pump, there is a Sorkin octane choice...jet fuel. Spend even 5 minutes talking with him and you will be convinced of this. He is also radical, keenly focused, intensely in tuned to the nuances of others (picking up on voice inflection, body language, even physio clues), fiercely loyal, blatantly opinionated and quick barbed (he will call you out without hesitation and you best be on your A Game if you dare to engage), an optimist with a pragmatic foundation, a visionary and dreamer with chutzpah and a get-it-done (and done right) attitude, and as finely tuned no-fear mentality as I have ever witnessed in the entertainment field.<br/><br/>Sorkin clearly has a vision of the world where right has might, intellect is the most valuable asset, one's ethics compass has no ambiguity (save for the complex journey and angst one must sometimes endure in getting to the right decision) - In Sorkin's world, those who care a lot about what they do, and how well they do it, earn the front row seat and get the best view.<br/><br/>When Sorkin arrives on set, his presence is immediately felt...even the most seasoned actors respond to his attention like an adoring offspring. I am certain Sorkin just being on set raises the level of every actor. His ""hardware collection"" (and that of actors and crew) is a testimony to his brilliance in bringing out the best in others.<br/><br/>The Newsroom is a tour de Sorkin. Only a three year run, but that in itself is so Sorkin - do it right or not at all and get out on top. How many TV dramas get past three years without noticeable decay?<br/><br/>This is my favorite of all Sorkin creations. Verbal excess has killed many a TV show. The Newsroom thrives on it. What could have been perceived as sanctimonious, is inspiring. The often frenetic pace (always under pressure and deadlines), gives the perception you've just watched a perfectly paced two-hour movie somehow shrunk to one hour, and you cannot wait to see the next episode.<br/><br/>Watch this series from Episode one on. I've purposely NOT seen the extra behind the scenes bits or trailers. Maybe another time. The show is so good, I don't need reinforcement of it.<br/><br/>This series sucks you in from the first episode and never lets you escape its gravity - HIGHLY recommended viewing.<br/><br/>Bravo to the entire cast and crew, with obvious special acknowledgment to Jeff Daniels for his believable and inspirational portrayal of the ideal prime time news anchor. He brings the Sorkin vision and communication style to life, and his performances are brilliant and inspiring.<br/><br/>HBO's 'The Newsroom' is a must-see TV series.",13 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,30 August 2015
3752,The Newsroom," OK, I started off loving this show","I signed up just to review this show, but not to review it so much as to respond to another review who commented ""THIS IS HOW THE NEWS SHOULD BE DONE!!!"" (Not really a quote, but pretty close.) I felt exactly as this reviewer did after the first episode and a half. The opening scene was outstanding. The seen where Mac is laying out the new format and rules had me cheering.<br/><br/>One of the worker bees responds to a story idea with, ""Jon Stewart had a *some guy* on last night. We could book him."" To which Mac replies, ""Were you listening to what I said just now or were you distracted by a bumble bee?"" And she proceeded to repeat one of her main rules: ""Is this the best form of the argument?"" I almost rose from my seat and cheered I was so ecstatic. Finally, we're going to have a program that doesn't see the news as entertainment, treats opposing views respectfully and only is concerned about getting the facts out to viewers.<br/><br/>I was betrayed. Aaron Sorkin betrayed me. He pretends to portray a newscast that is serious, respectful of opponents and focused only on what is true (""only the facts""), but instead, the newscast he portrays is every bit as malicious and rhetorical as Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Jon Stewart, Al Franken, Keith Olbermann or anyone else. He pretends to be ""fair"" by having the protagonist portrayed as a Republican. Opponents, however, are caricatured. As someone I read said, Sorkin is noted for setting up his opponents in his shows so that his liberal position can win. That is plainly evident here. We get the same inflammatory rhetoric we see all throughout the media. An example: at one point the main character says, ""I only appear liberal because I believe hurricanes are caused by high barometric pressure and not gay marriage."" Great, Aaron. I know of no conservative who thinks hurricanes are caused by gay marriage (and I know many ultra conservatives). What a ridiculous and childish statement. This is exactly the kind of rhetoric the show bemoans in the first episode and a half, and it becomes more and more evident as the show goes on. At least, as far as I watched (3.5 episodes).<br/><br/>I would not be so upset, but I am really sick and tired of the ad hominem, rhetorical attacks both sides of the political spectrum launch against each other, and I thought, I THOUGHT, I had found a show that recognized this travesty within society and was going to address it. But, as noted above, I was betrayed. Aaron Sorkin betrayed me. Instead of recognizing the problem and offering a solution, this shows contributes to the problem.

It's really quite shocking, and not at all what you would expect from HBO.<br/><br/>Ironically the show has gotten more stick on IMDb for being liberally biased, self-righteous and condescending. I am a liberal, and highly enjoy watching someone like Bill Maher, but there is probably something to this critique. In what way the main character is a conservative I have yet to figure out. Just giving him the label of being Republican, doesn't make it believable. <br/><br/>The hands down most annoying character of the show is by the way Maggie. I am sure we as an audience is supposed to love her by now, but I rather find her tiresome and obnoxious. It's certainly not clear to me why she has two suitors fighting over her, and that illustrates the problem of the show. Something always feels off.",40 out of 69 found this helpful.,5.0,28 July 2012
3754,The Newsroom," Could have been, but in the end it isn't","From IMDb: ""A news anchor's life is stirred up when he's forced to work with a new team of colleagues"". My first thoughts were that a show based on the media world, on HBO would be interesting the less. It even started so good that I wanted to rate it with 10 stars without even watching it. And by start, I mean Daniels's ""breakdown"" in the first 5 minutes. From there it went straight downhill... But let me explain what i mean.<br/><br/>First of all we are talking about a multi-billion dollar worth corporation with a network channel. As seen from this point almost not a single character is believable. I mean c'mon... A producer considered ""the best damn producer"" who acts like a drama queen, never stops mixing her personal life with her job, her right hand, a promising young guy who gets bossed around by nearly everyone, even though he is their boss, a super hot and sexy economist who refuses to work as an actual economist for 4 million dollars more because she is loyal to the ""news""... I mean seriously... <br/><br/>The whole show is to me a high school drama parade, with a prime time news show as background. It may be well written, but it is more a romantic comedy to me than it is a drama set in the cruel and hard world of the media. Everyone is in love with everyone else and that gets more screen time than the actual processes involved in a ""newsroom"".<br/><br/>I am not an American so I can't tell if they focus on some political aspects/parties more than others, although I get a strong pro-Obama vibe but I'll leave that to people who know better.<br/><br/>To sum up I would say this is an easy to watch show, fun and entertaining, but not a ""world of the media"" dramatic series.

The writing is well done (Sorkin Ace), but the banter of certain style doesn't play as well in this show as it did in say Social Network.<br/><br/>3. I read here that Marissa Tomei was up for the role of Mackenzie and honestly this show would have gone out of the ball park if she would have taken it on. Not only do I believe she would have lifted the role but I imagine that the show would have been guided differently (possibly better). I'm sad to know that was a swing and a miss.<br/><br/>4. The pilot is amazing and I don't know how out of Sorkins work it didn't manage to get an Emmy.

3757,King of the Hill, An excellent change from everything else,"Although we don't get this show in India, I managed to get a couple of episodes from the net. Let me tell you, this is a fine show. It deals with an upright, honest and sometimes down-on-his-luck propane salesman from Texas, Hank Hill and his quirky family and friends. But what makes this show different is that it does not have a frantic pace at which things take place. Although, I thoroughly enjoy 'The Simpsons' and 'Family Guy', yet these shows have everything happening at a breakneck speed; the gags, the animation, etc. King of the Hill somehow has a certain calmness to it. It deals with real people (5 fingers, not 4) and fairly real situations. It always puts a smile on my face and it's nice to hear Hank's pearls of wisdom. It was a pleasant surprise coming from the creators of Beavis and Butthead. I definitely recommend this show. Two thumbs up.",189 out of 200 found this helpful.,10.0,18 August 2005
3758,King of the Hill, The most underrated show of all time,"King of the Hill is unquestionably different from its rivals in many ways: calmer, more subtle and simple. However, what defines KotH more than anything else is its timelessness: other shows seem to benefit off referencing the news and pop culture (South Park and Family Guy primarily). KotH on the other hand, builds its plot inwards around its own characters and locations. It could be shown to anyone in the next 40 years and they would understand it as much as today. Instead of simply racing towards offending the biggest celebrity or corporation, it keeps conservative and to itself. As well as this, the characters are memorable and brilliantly crafted: Hank, an every day man who sometimes makes stupid decisions. Dale Gribble, an anti-government obsessive. Jeff Boomhauer, the most 'modern' of the 4, but who cant seem to talk properly. And finally Bill Dauterive, a slobby but likable bachelor. The one reason I gave this 8/10 is because sometimes the show doesn't always seem to 'get going' and draw you in to the plot, however this is rare and not something that should put you off the show. To conclude, King of the Hill is a show which never got the attention it deserved, and a great alternative for anyone bored of modern ultra-paced cartoons.",47 out of 48 found this helpful.,8.0,2 August 2011
3759,King of the Hill, A remarkable creation,"After ""Beavis &amp; Butthead"" (which I loved), I was really surprised what an affectionate portrait Mike Judge put together.  I know well how ripe Texas rednecks are for satire (being a native Texan), though the target is SO easy, it would get a bit tiresome to watch it week after week for years. Hank Hill turned out to be a realistic redneck:  worshipful of tradition, fearful of variety and progress, but not really quite as conservative as he thinks he is.  My parents are very much like that, too.  As I've watched the series, I've been tickled by different characters at different times:  first Bobby (almost zen in his bizarre but internally consistent individuality), then Hank's buddies (where the sillier satire comes in), then Hank himself (eternally thwarted by life, but always strong and loving in the end). Lately, Peggy's outrageous ego has me laughing the most.  Since this is more like a regular sitcom than ""The Simpsons"" is, I doubt it will hold up as long, but for now I love it.  ""King of the Hill"" may be the most realistic portrait of Texans ever seen on TV. In response to previous complaints: 1. While Texas does have many citizens who are members of ethnic minorities, the area of the state in which the show is set (NW Texas--best reckoning has Arlen based on Abilene or San Angelo) has very few of them. 2. If one finds the show boring, one need only change the channel.",107 out of 123 found this helpful.,,15 July 2002

3761,King of the Hill, A great show,I really liked this show and I was heart broken when they cancelled it to make room for family guy even though I really like family guy. A lot of people don't like this show and I guess I can see why. It has a very dry humor to it which I persoanlly find very funny. Its not like your typical animated show like simpsons or family guy where crazy stuff is always happening. No its more like a live action show very realistic and it just shows people living their lives.<br/><br/>This show is about a propane salesman named Hank Hill who lives in the fictional town of Arlen Texas. He lives next door to his three best friends as they take on the tasks of live together from raising their kids to drinking beers in the alley.<br/><br/>I know the premise sounds kind of slow and dry and don't get me wrong it is but its still very enjoyable. This show only has two kind of viewers people who really like it or people that absolutely hate it there is no ladder.

3762,King of the Hill, It's alright to be a redneck,"Hank Hill, the hero of ""King of the Hill"", is the last of a dying breed in many ways. He's reasonably honest, reasonably moral, he works hard, he believes in American craftsmanship, and he loves his dysfunctional family. And he's a conservative. He's a bit repressed emotionally though; annoying him or getting him mad is easy, but expressing those tender emotions like love is hard for him, due mostly to his upbringing by his dysfunctional and tyrannical dad Cotton, an obnoxious old man who lost his shins in WWII and somehow had his feet sewn into his knees. Hank's conservative point of view doesn't always make him easily sympathetic in some cases though.<br/><br/>Hank's wife, Peggy, is a warm, loving and caring person at heart, but she's also a megalomaniac. Peggy is an over confident and under educated substitute Spanish teacher, quite rare in this day and age of ""Women power"". Peggy always strives to do her best, which isn't bad in and of itself, but her pride tends to exude control over her decisions which leads to Peggy making a fool of herself.<br/><br/>Hank's son Bobby is a dense, effeminate couch potato who's watched too much TV. Full of under developed desires and longings, Bobby is easily impressionable and easily gets caught up in fads when they shove their message in his face hard enough. As Hank puts it, ""That boy ain't right."" His initial goal is to be a stand up comic, but he later decides to be a magician. His friends are Connie (later a girlfriend) and Joseph.<br/><br/>Hank also has a live in niece, Luanne. She was raised to be trailer trash by her dysfunctional parents (her dad is Peggy's brother) and initially longs to be a Hollywood hair stylist. Like Bobby, Luanne can be easily caught up in fads.<br/><br/>Hanks friends are Dale, Bill and Boomhauer. Boomhauer is a motor mouth Lothario whom no one can really understand. Bill is a faded high school football star turned army barber who's wife has left him and appears to have a thing for Peggy. Dale is an exterminator and conspiracy theorist who's so wrapped up in his conspiracy theories that he would never suspect that his newscaster wife Nancy is having an affair with her Indian therapist John Redcorn and/or that his son Joseph is actually the son of John Redcorn and Nancy. The only other person who doesn't seem to notice this is Joseph himself. Hank's neighbor is an Asian man named Kahn (Connie's dad), the classic feuding neighbor scenario.<br/><br/>Despite the many frustrations Hank endures and the compromises he has to make, he trudges on, clinging to his ideals and doing the best he can.<br/><br/>Part of why this is still better than the Simpsons is that unlike the Simpsons, this show doesn't rely on anyone character to supply all the laughs and it doesn't rely on larger than life animated sight gags for all the laughs either. Hank is also probably the only TV Dad to have the dignity of being right anymore. And unlike Homer, even when Hank's efforts get ridiculous they're never as outlandish and moronic as the former's.",115 out of 149 found this helpful.,,9 April 2004
3763,King of the Hill, Better than most non-animated shows,"Now that Mike Judge has made a fortune off Beavis and Butthead, he gets to do what he wants - thankfully his creativity extends far beyond the crude (though very funny) humor of his previous series.  KOTH has its share of humor, but I think it shines because of the perceptiveness it displays about life.  The series is full of very touching moments between Hank and his son Bobby, which rang very true with me, since I am an only child (Hank has a narrow urethra, so Bobby is his only offspring).  All in all, this is a great show to watch, and I hope it stays on the air for a long time.",45 out of 55 found this helpful.,,19 April 1999
3764,King of the Hill, Getting Life Lessons Across Via the Animated Route.,"Very excellent prime-time animated series from the highly creative and brilliant mind of Mike Judge (""Beavis and Butt-Head"" fame). ""King of the Hill"" deals with a small town Texas family and their wild misadventures. Shades of ""The Flintstones"" and ""The Simpsons"" here as the show has vivid characters galore. Propane salesman Hank Hill and substitute Spanish teacher wife Peggy rear awkward adolescent son Bobby in the fictional town of Arlen. Hank has a wild World War II hero for a dad (Cotton), a niece who lives with him and his family (Luanne), a far from perfect boss (Buck Strickland), a slew of childhood friends (conspiracy theorist/bug exterminator Dale, lonely divorcée/Army barber Bill and often verbally incoherent swinging bachelor Boomhauer) and even Laotian neighbors. These vivid characters create a wholesome landscape of small-town Texas community life that accurately shows how lives intertwine and interweave. The situations in the series are hilarious and yet many times life-affirming as the show's brain trust do their best to have messages that center around family, friends and personal sacrifice. The running gags (Dale's wife having a torrid affair with a Native American new age healer who actually conceived her only son while her husband has no earthly clue) and the constant humanity and vulnerability of the featured characters make ""King of the Hill"" a real sight to behold. The art and science of television production combine to make a truly outstanding and intelligent sitcom for most all age groups. 5 stars out of 5.",53 out of 66 found this helpful.,,21 June 2005
3765,King of the Hill," Subtle, Well-Written Satire","I became addicted to KOTH at age eight. I was sitting on my dad's lap, drinking grapefruit juice and club soda and trying to shake off my migraine. Finally, after a lot of moaning on my part, Dad agreed to stop watching ""Law &amp; Order"". He put in a tape of eight KOTHs and said that we could watch this instead.<br/><br/>I'm thirteen now, and I'm still hooked. The characters are memorable and extremely realistic. Being born and bred in the most ultra-prepster, WASP-ish town possible (with, ironically, liberal, agnostic parents) really made me appreciate Peggy and Bobby, because I interact with them daily, as well as Dale, Bill, and Hank (although I have a huge soft spot for Kahn, Minh, and Connie, as well as Kahn's mother. I have a friend how is the very epitome of Connie and with a Dad whose bigoted, holier-then-thou obnoxiousness makes Kahn look like Saint Pete.) The writing is more subtle then ""The Simpsons"", which was my earlier love and which now takes the back seat. Everything in this show could really happen, and often does. Even the bit-out-there affair of Nancy and John Redcorn isn't that far-fetched (with a husband as wacked an unsexy as Dale, what blonde D-cupped weather girl wouldn't go for a tall-dark-'n'-handsome Native American with sculpted biceps, perfect hair, and a New age healing center who gives massages for a living? Hmmm?) Some people may argue that this show is racist, bigoted, cynical, and Conservative. I was raised in a home where debates about original sin were allowed over vegan dinners and a dart board with Bill O'Reilly's image hangs on our dryer. I come from a mixed-race marriage with a bisexual uncle. And yet I can say that this show in fact tackles such important issues with dry wit and style. Those who act as though they are above Hank's mild ""discomforts"" with, for instance, gays and lesbians, are at least as hypocritical as Kahn. As for the Conservative argument, I think the show makes fun of Republicans as well, if not more, then left-wingers. Who doesn't laugh at Hank's utter devotion to his party? The argument that this show only has Anglo-Saxons in it is the most asinine I have ever heard. Does the beloved ""Family Guy"" in it's main cast list a Native American, several Hispanics, and an entire Laotian family? Sure, ""The Simpsons"" has more black people, but virtually no Asians and not a Hispanic in sight. Besides, Arlen is portrayed as remarkably diverse for a small Northern Texas community. Heck, i'm surprised it isn't pure Caucasian.<br/><br/>10/10. Brilliant writing, subtle but liberal amounts of dry humor, and a dose of humorous reality-blended satire. Curl up on a laid-back armchair, turn up the heat, and immerse yourself in ""King of the Hill.""",29 out of 36 found this helpful.,,14 January 2006
3766,King of the Hill, Funny without pushing things too far,"Most adult cartoons on TV these days are crude, offensive and repetitive (coughFamilyGuycough). Lately the two most popular cartoons for adults on TV are South Park and Family Guy. Since I'm a climate change heretic I found a few scenes in South Park to be funny as it makes fun of environmental extremism, but for the most part South Park is just rude, badly animated and probably upsetting to a lot of people. As for Family Guy, it's funny to the ""lowest common denominator"", the morons of the world who find child molestation, racism, incest and mentally disabled people to be funny. That's why I cancelled my satellite TV service. Reality shows, tasteless animated programming, and just plain stupid sitcoms have filled nearly every space of television and is making today's generation (which believe it or not I'm a part of), into idiots.<br/><br/>King of the Hill was one of the few animated shows out there that was funny without going too far. It had some occasional crude humor but more often than not its humor was based on the scenarios of the show's situations, the facial reactions of the characters and the main characters' personalities. King of the Hill never really makes fun of any race, sexual orientation or disability, and on the brief occasion that a character does this, it is stated aloud that to make fun of these things is wrong.<br/><br/>The characters aren't the generic obese, idiotic couch potatoes with three kids the way most characters in cartoons today are. Instead, the main characters are Hank (a prudish, old-fashioned rednecky propane salesman trying to deal with the changes brought about in the 21st century), Peggy Hill (Hank's annoying, nerdy and narcissistic wife) and Hank's son, Bobby (unlike Hank, who is into sports, country music and his considered manly activities, Bobby is overweight, still sleeps with stuffed animals, dresses up in women's clothing to practice comedy routines and is often very lazy). The secondary characters include Dale (a basement-dwelling exterminator who buys into conspiracy theories), Bill (an obese army barber who is often depressed and lonely), Boomhauer (an eligible bachelor and in the last season implied to be a Texas Ranger), Kahn (a usually crabby guy but can often be nice depending on the episode), Luanne (Hank and Peggy's niece who often falls for controlling or perverted men and came from a trailer trash neighborhood), Mihn (Kahn's wife), Cotton (Hank's loud-mouthed, war-obsessed father), Nancy (Dale's wife and a weathergirl for the town news station), Joseph (Bobby's pervy best friend), John Redcorn (Nancy's secret affair and Joseph's real father)... okay, I could go on and on, but the point is, there is a really crazy cast of characters on this show, all likable in their own way.<br/><br/>KOTH points out all the problems of the ""modern world"", a few examples being violence among teens, computers always being upgraded, unhelpful doctors and psychiatrists, chain stores (Megalo-Mart is a parody of Wal-Mart), forced environmentalism, cellular phones and childhood obesity, among many others. The show points these things out in a comical way, without upsetting anyone or using crude humor or offensive slurs. As the show progresses, Hank has moments where he learns to find the good in all people and where he is shown to be a pretty nice guy overall (for example he saves a former prostitute from being taken back to the streets by her Willy Wonka-like pimp). Hank also works at a propane dealership with a number of hilarious characters.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was rednecky but catchy all the same and the voice acting was amazing. Hank's catchphrase is screaming ""BWAHHHH!!!"" whenever he gets mad, but it isn't in every episode, and it's a little different each time. He often makes various funny facial expressions when he does this.<br/><br/>I don't mean to sound like I'm ranting, but this show was excellent! Sadly it was cancelled and pathetic shows like Family Guy, American Dad and Bob's Burgers quickly filled its space. It's really unfortunate, because KOTH was hilarious but still had good values for the most part. Maybe someday when people aren't so easily amused by sex jokes, racial slurs and fart noises every five seconds, they'll come to their senses and make shows more similar to this one. Reruns of KOTH are apparently frequent on television still, so if you haven't seen it, be sure to check which channels the reruns are on.",11 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,27 January 2015
3767,King of the Hill, Just another great animated show on FOX,"Mike Judge's ""King of the Hill"" was his next great success following ""Beavis and Butthead"" on MTV. ""King of the Hill"" follows Arlen, Texas, native and conservative family man Hank Hill, and his family and their circle of weird but likable friends. The show is also a satire of Texas life, and the sometimes absurd and eccentric attitudes of people who live there.<br/><br/>I remember when this show first premiered 13 years ago in 1997 and I thinking that this is the next great show FOX had to offer after ""The Simpsons."" I always looked forward to watching ""King of the Hill"" after ""The Simpsons"" every Sunday night before bedtime (I was still in elementary school around the time this show first premiered on television).<br/><br/>Mike Judge cannot fail in providing a show with a lot of great laughs and out-sized and unusual characters. That has always been one of his strengths as a show producer. After hearing that this show would be canceled earlier this year, I was quite disappointed. I'm not sure why this move was made (it could have had something to do with the tragic death of actress Brittany Murphy in December of last year), but I guess it just makes more room for Judge to lend his creative juices to another great animated satire.<br/><br/>10/10",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,5 October 2010

It started out as a wonderful addition to a great Sunday evening lineup on Fox, it ended as the saving grace to a boring and vulgar Sunday evening lineup. This show was forgotten by Fox for five years, they cut its marketing down to nothing and then wondered why it didn't deliver the numbers they wanted.<br/><br/>Hank Hill, a responsible husband, son, and father lives his life in a rapidly changing world. He's comforted by his small Texas town, ""Arlen"", and the friends he's made there, although sometimes, they offer more headache than anything else! The satire was biting right to the end. This show successfully balanced many different ideas without crushing them and did so without beating up on one of the other. Hank Hill is a Reagan conservative, or even a LBJ democrat, his aging dog is aptly named Ladybird.<br/><br/>Hank's ideas are often challenged by a growing wave of Liberal viewpoints around Arlen, and simply put, the show never makes fun of any ideology, it makes fun of the behavior intertwined with it, and shows that both ideologies have their problems and their good points. Conservatism is never made fun of and liberalism is never made fun of, except by the main characters.<br/><br/>The show follows the daily life of the Hill family and their neighborhood. Peggy is his loving wife with an inflated ego, Bobby is Hank's son, Hank worries that ""that boy ain't right"" because he's a little different and dreams of being a professional comedian, Hank would prefer he be High School football quarterback and then work at Strickland Propane with Hank.

The supporting players add color to this mix.  You have paranoid, whacko Dale, lonesome Bill and Boomhauer.  Then there's Hank's niece LuAnn, his neighbor Khan, and his father, Cotton.  Throw them all together and you have a show that is worth watching.  One could argue that this show could be done as live action, I think it benefits from being animated.

King of the Hill is actually one of the very few cartoon-comedy shows that I feel comfortable to watch with the kids. Sure, the show does say the words ""*ss"", ""b*tch"", and ""d*mn"" a couple of times, but the kids are mature enough to handle it and know not to repeat those words in front of their elders.

3780,King of the Hill, A great show that doesn't push agendas!!,"This show is a masterpiece. Great storyline and funny throughout. This show has teen\adult humor. Great fun with a couple of rednecks. And most importantly a show that doesn't push any agendas, a great show for any race, religion, politics etc.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,15 August 2018
3781,King of the Hill, Not Another Family Sit-Com,"It took me a while to warm up to even start to watch this show. In the previews? I was aghast. That white t-shirt? The jeans? The horn-rim glasses? The Wolverine work-boots? The ever-present can of beer? The accent? The attitude? THAT'S MY DAD ca 1977! I don't want to watch a show that makes fun of my late Dad! Fortunately, I got over my ""Hits Too Close To Home"" jitters and gave this show a shot... Maybe because I, myself am now a 40-something Southerner in (Shiver) jeans, work boots, t-shirt, and ubiquitous can of beer.<br/><br/>Hank Hill is not your typical family sit-com Dad... Where Dad has been portrayed since the '80's as a likable but clueless, powerless, and disconnected dope. Hank is actually thoughtful, loving, relatively articulate, and USUALLY right in his good-ol'-fashioned common sense. He's not a clowning buffoon like Cliff Huxtable, and he is not blinded by Jason Seaver's weird theoretical constructs, and he shares none of Dan Conner's frustrated bitterness.<br/><br/>His wife, Peggy is not the super-career-woman-Mom, either. She does not have a glamorous career as a Lawyer nor a Journalist, and she doesn't always have the quick, venal, cutting comebacks... Actually? Peggy is a little slow on the uptake, though her inflated opinion of herself drives her to strive ever higher. She actually reminds me very much of some of my social-climbing Aunts.<br/><br/>Their son, Bobby, is The Weird Kid at his Jr High School and a constant disappointment. Fat, slow, and not good at anything involving physical prowess? Bobby takes more after his Mom with his dedication to pop-culture, fads, and so-called artistic endevours like being in school plays. Bobby's ambition is to be a stand-up comic, but unfortunately? His Idea of ""funny"" is the likes of Carrot Top, Yakov Smirnoff, and Gallagher.<br/><br/>It's very much a character driven show... And you come to actually like and care for and about most of these cartoon characters moreso than a lot of live-action sit-coms... ""Sienfeld"" comes to mind. I couldn't stand a single character on that over-lived pile of junk.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,9 April 2009
