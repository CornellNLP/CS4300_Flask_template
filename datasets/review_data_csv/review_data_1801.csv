0,Baki, Worth watching,"It's true, it doesn't have a great storyline, and a lot of stuff that happens doesnt make any sense at all. But it is worth watching. Its violent and crazy maybe even a little bit bizarre at times, but it makes me feel like what I would have imagined when I was younger playing around acting as if I was a super powerful ninja fighter or something, I know it is weird but that's what I like about it.",40 out of 49 found this helpful.,7.0,21 March 2019
1,Baki, Goes downhill real fast,"First 4 or so episodes show promise. However, the plot begins to fall apart soon after. The idea was that all the prisoners were to challenge Baki, yet they end up not even caring about him. The story begins to unnecessarily introduce random characters related to already minor characters to fight the big bad prisoners. The fights constantly switch between a classic 2D style and a wonky 3D animation, making fights a complete mess. Along with this, they decided the characters were required to read a 1000 word essay before they can finish a fight. This was a huge let down and would not recommend.",78 out of 109 found this helpful.,2.0,29 December 2018
2,Baki, Ridiculous and nonsenseical,"I really can't understand people giveing this a good rating. The entire thing is rediculous and doesn't make sense, I suppose some of it could just be lost in translation but I have watched a helluva lot of anime and nothing was as hard to follow as this. I get that it's story isn't really the point but, jeeze, there has to be some premise, the fight scenes are ok for the few seconds that they are actually fighting, but the constant lack of closure on them is annoying, no one ever really wins a fight. Then they have this romance subplot that feels extremely forced so that they can have a conflict at the end. This has got to be one of the worst anime I've watched in my life and the amount of time I rolled my eyes in the 13 episodes hurt my brain.",68 out of 114 found this helpful.,2.0,20 December 2018
3,Baki, This show will you knock you out - with boredom,"Baki is a show that promises you brutal, flashy and violent fights. The premise is excellent: human monsters gathering to fight in true no-holds-barred fights, demolishing and destroying each other in a smorgasbord of violence.<br/><br/>And yes, the show is violent. Characters that hold no meaning to the plot are easily killed off, having their heads crushed and guts blown out their ears, while the main characters, while getting grievously injured somehow always seem to survive.<br/><br/>However, as the ""plot"" advances the fights start to suffer from... talking. Instead of beating each other's guts out, the characters talk to each other. They have flashbacks. They analyze not only their enemies moves, but they also share the secrets of their own moves. The fighters pull aces out of their sleeves one after another, only to stop for a 30 second monologue while their opponent recuperates and has a chance to pull out their next ace in the hole.<br/><br/>If that wasn't enough, the show varies wildly in it's animation. Some fights are partly animated in cell-shaded 3D, only to drop back down to more traditional 2D-style still images while the characters have their useless dialogues. The art style itself isn't necessarily bad, but the wild fluctuations in quality are jarring.<br/><br/>The Japanese voice acting isn't bad, but once again they have Japanese people who can't speak English doing English voice lines.<br/><br/>In closing, if you're a martial arts enthusiast wishing to see amazing fights, you should probably look somewhere else. Or just watch a remix of all the fights from YouTube. You won't miss a thing from the plot if you do that.",53 out of 91 found this helpful.,1.0,22 December 2018
4,Baki, Baki is exactly what it's supposed to be but this season has some issues,"<ul><li>''Baki'' (2018) starts where the previous anime ''Grappler Baki'' left off and it jumps straight to the point. Death penalty prisoners, who are all beasts in their own respective way, escape in impossible manners and are on the hunt for every strong person so they can eventually, maybe, be defeated, which is something they still haven't felt being all-powerful as they think they are.</li><li>Baki and the crew decide to contest them and meet them head-on in series of skirmishes filled with martial arts and weapons because these prisoners aren't very prideful and they'll do anything to win. I would describe the show as if Mortal Kombat had an anime set in the modern age. Brutal fights, bizarre characters, and events, and all-around shlock. The animation is not that good but it really doesn't have to be. The art is pretty good but the sudden shifts between 2d and 3d are kind of jarring. The soundtrack is fine and though not better than the previous show it has the same feel, the opening songs are great, especially the second one. One more thing that was off is the way villains go from terrifying to not in the same league as our heroes, getting beat up by everyone and toyed around.</li><li>The key factor of entertainment in Baki is its ever-growing passion and sporty sense in which it is portrayed. It knows what it is and fully embraces that. Perfect guilty pleasure material for gym-goers and martial arts nerds, *cough* I mean, for manly men!</li></ul>",13 out of 19 found this helpful.,6.0,28 January 2019
5,Baki, A very poor attempt at what could be great.,"Reading the plot and seeing the trailer made me really excited to see the show. However having seen it all I'm really disappointed, of 14 episodes most of the time its nonsense conversation between characters basic repetitive fighting (dust in eyes, kick then and uninteresting twist with loads of conversation and stare downs.. then someone kinda does die but then comes back anyway) Baki never truly has a fight even when I was holding out until the last episode, I was let down... It could have been a show finished WELL in 20 episodes have the 5v5 that the shows starts with rather than get all convaluted and side tracked with other CHARACTERS and backstories. Episodes 1-4 I felt like I was in for a good time, 4-8 one OK fight took a while though 8-12 boring, repetitive, why won't this guy just get killed off 12-14 annoyed. Must be bakis fight finally... End of episode 14. Angry I'd kept going after episode 8. I feel like Netflix needs to change its approach to anime, it seems they're aiming for long drawn out uninteresting shows... I'd rather see a quality short series than have season after season of poor content.",37 out of 64 found this helpful.,4.0,22 December 2018
6,Baki, Nonsensical anime with few fighting contests and lots of staring contests,The animes name is baki who is supposed to be the strongest fighter in the world after winning an underground tournament. 5 fierce death row inmates travel to Tokyo to challenge him but to my surprise baki barely ever fights in the whole series and all the fights are less action/punches and more dialogues stares and loud music.

7,Baki, Crazy mix but addictive,Mild spoilers nothing about the plot. This is a throw back to 90s Manga/Anime Fist of the north star. One touch killer blows (sort of).

10,Baki, Shallow and lackluster bloodfest,"I'll be direct here as I couldn't be bothered to get into details. If you like blood and gore, there's plenty in this anime. If you're looking for a good fighting anime, look elsewhere. The first five episodes consist of the five antagonists waving their power stick around killing a bunch of unnamed random side characters, and a few named side characters that's just there to donate some blood and to proof how powerful the antagonists are. And a lot of the stunt pulled by the character is just downright impossible which shows that the author is just pulling all this nonsense out of his rear-end without any prior research. Not to mention terrible pacing. I'm about halfway through but finishing this anime in one sitting is like going under brain lobotomy. I'll finish the rest later but I doubt it'll get any better.<br/><br/>As I understand it, Kengan Ashura is going anime. I've finished the comics, and if the anime is anything like the comics it'll be that much better compare to Baki.",36 out of 67 found this helpful.,2.0,20 December 2018

25,Nightflyers," Not as bad as some people make it out to be, but not much better either. Requires you to suspend your disbelief significantly","So the year is 2093 and apparently the Earth is dying and humanity is looking at extinction. We've started setting up colonies on the Moon but it's taking too long. An object of alien origin is then detected outside the Solar System and a colony ship departs to meet the aliens with the hopes of saving humanity.<br/><br/>So far so good. It is implied multiple times how important this is and how high the stakes are. But for some reason it seems like the crew of the ship has been randomly picked from some angry mob on the street. They are trapped in a tube floating through space where the only thing standing between them and a cold death is some few inches of steel. But instead of thinking things through and acting accordingly, they start throwing fits and going on witch hunts. Their behavior is entirely unprofessional and just doesn't make sense in the context of things.<br/><br/>Some backstory would have been nice as well. I get that they want to slowly reveal information about the characters in the process. However, the action starts immediately and without knowing anything about anyone, you don't really care what happens to them at all. World-building is non-existent.<br/><br/>I have quite a lot of gripes, like the psychic kid being a jerk to everyone because ""society is bad to me"", or the inconsistent gravity on the ship, which relates to the lack of any world-building, but I'll try to put these behind me for now.<br/><br/>As I said, it's not all bad. The visuals are good, the ship looks cool, and the story does hold an air of mystery and seems interesting enough. There are some redeeming qualities. But it requires you to overlook the flaws of the how and I can see how some people may find this hard to do. It's understandable.<br/><br/>One has to wonder though if SyFy canceled the absolutely stellar ""The Expanse"" in favor of this show. Perhaps they wanted a piece of the George R. R. Martin cake and axed their most successful series in a long time. If that's the case, then I'll tell them it was not worth it. At all.",349 out of 414 found this helpful.,6.0,6 December 2018
26,Nightflyers," In space, no one can hear you be an idiot","Chock full of dumb characters making dumb decisions, NIGHTFLYERS aims to go where no one has gone before...in making us want to pull our hair out.<br/><br/>The mission: an intrepid group of explorers has set out from Europa to rendezvous with an alien craft in space. You'd think a mission of this importance would require a crew of top-notch scientists and seasoned spacefarers. Not here. We get a crew of ding-dongs who wouldn't pass a psych eval. Add in a belligerent tool of a telepath whose sole job--wait for it--is to communicate in a friendly manner with the aliens, and you have a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>Not long after launch, the mission goes sideways with weirdness. The captain knows all along why this is happening. Does he do anything about it? Say anything? Perform any corrective action? Nope. He pretends like he's ignorant instead of heading back to port because reasons. Oh, and the series opens with a murdery death scene far into the story that wipes out any worry for the characters shown because we know how they end up. Yay.",420 out of 543 found this helpful.,3.0,7 December 2018
27,Nightflyers, IQ Must Have Dropped By 2093,"I'll start off by saying the show has a cool concept and despite its glaring flaws it is entertaining. It's weird, suspenseful and the visual effects are really good. If you like sci-fi and horror give it a shot. But I have to rant about some seriously deep flaws about what happens in the show. Flaws that make you want to bang your head against a wall because things that happen in the show would NEVER happen if this mission actually took place in reality. Let me set the scene. The mission is for the crew of the Nightflyer to make first contact with an alien race in hopes they can share technology that could save a dying earth (because what would a futuristic sci-fi show be without the setting of humans destroying the earth...). My point is this is obviously the most important moment in human history if successful. So what do they do? First of all, they bring a homicidal telepath on the ship. What could go wrong there? There is no ground control because who needs that on such an important mission. The ship nearly crashes the moment they try to leave earth due to a malfunction but instead of postponing to see what went wrong while still in reach of earths full technical resources they just ignore it and blast away anyway. I mean why fix the flat tire in the driveway when you can fix it on the highway... which brings me to my next point, maintenance on the ship is horrible! There is literally leaking flammable liquid pouring out all over the place and no one seems to give a flip. In fact it's so ordinary they just stand in it, go about their business and never give it a second thought. That's like having the makers of the Yugo build the space shuttle. Makes total sense to me. The showers on board are actually giant tubes that's completely immerse the person in water while the person in it breaths through a mask. Did I mention Hudini built the showers? That's right, there is no emergency release mechanism because who needs that if something goes wrong. Then there's the crew. Apparently not one of them trained for the mission. In fact I bet all they had to do to join this mission was have a pulse and put the round peg through the round hole. Congrats! You get to go on the most important space endeavor in human history. The sharpest of rusty dull knives in the box. You're telling me these people are earths finest? The elite of the elite out of what I'm sure is 15 billion people by that point? Come on. Oh then the telepath escapes but none of the 10,000 cameras on the ship can find him or sees who let him out. The captain of the ship never leaves his private room by the way. Literally no one on board has ever seen him in person. Standard operating procedure and no cause for concern there. Here's the best part, this is just the episode 1 recap.
So if you're a technical sci-fi viewer that likes a bit of truth and realism in shows then you are going to hate Nightflyers. But if you have the ability to set that aside and just know that really stupid decisions will be made and that most things will not make sense when compared to realistic sci-fi shows then you might enjoy the show and find it entertaining.",162 out of 207 found this helpful.,5.0,15 December 2018
28,Nightflyers, All over the place,"The show starts okay and the general themes are interesting, but as it goes on it gets worse and worse. The crew makes no sense at all. People don't communicate with each other or act logically and of course everything goes wrong because of it.
Later there is a lot of filler. Lots of logical inconsistencies where the show breaks rules it had established before. Sometimes characters tell others what happened wrong. This just seems like scenes were filmed out of order and messed up in editing or something.
The way computers work of course makes no sense either, but I guess this is a minor gripe at this point.<br/><br/>So why still 6 stars? Because I think for all its flaws it was still extremely watchable. If only to get the solutions to the mysteries.

That's what happened with Nightflyers. This show has a great mix of suspense, horror, mystery, and science fiction. The sound design is absolutely wonderful (I'd recommend watching with headphones for something different), and the performances are engaging and on point. I'm not exactly sure what most people were expecting (George R. R. Martin's Game of Thrones in space or Asimov/Asher level hard sci-fi?), but this is a damned decent show. Perfect? Far from it.

On top of that, they have clearly graduated from the School of Having Characters Act Stupidly to Create Conflict.

37,Nightflyers," Viewed in the full season context, it's actually pretty cool . . .","I don't particularly like horror films, and so, watching episode by episode was frustrating to get through, even as the whole premise and the acting and the sences were well done. But the last episode finally broke away from that and delved into a lot of complex and fascinating and awe inspiring events that I wish could have been much more prevalent in the whole season. That final episode really made it for the series.<br/><br/>Good sci fi has depth to it, not just running from one crazy murderous scene to another, and although a lot of the relationships and exploration of the characters was done well, they were all just rushing from bloody scene to bloody scene, and we are stuck with a really likeable character choosing to slice open her own neck over our heads for the whole season.<br/><br/>BUT, ultimately, if a second season could build off of the nice complexity of the final episode, okay. Except, it seems like a done deal that no one is going to invest in another season when the reviews are as bad as they are.

46,Nightflyers, A bad horror tvshow in space with nothing intersting + full of stupidity,"I ""try"" to watch this tv show and have fun
i saying to myself ""at last something new"" but i need to be honest it's terrible!<br/><br/>i will explain this in detail:<br/><br/>---Worst idea ever:
The only real doctors in this tv-show sucide her self at the start of the first 4 minutes. The start of the tv show show us the end of the show (or not) but almost and we know at this moment it is bad because what the point to watch a tv show when you already know his ending at the first 4 minutes.<br/><br/>---The super space ship last hope of human race
---The best and unique hope of the earth is a very big space ship. then:
<ul><li>Why this space ship do not work proprely ?</li><li>Why the rockets crash and 1 second later work like a charm ?</li><li>Why activating the manual control fix the damm engines ? (thx jesus ?)</li><li>Why they do not have a technican who work in a middle of the deck and manage to activate the MANUAL CONTROL ?</li><li>Did you even imagine a space deck where the captain can't even control manualy his own ship and ask someone to start the manual control FAR FAR away of his own post ?</li><li>Why this brand new ship looks like a wretch ?</li><li>Why it have so many malfunctions everywhere. It never -ever- pass any launch test of the 2018 Nasa and we are in 2093 !!!!!!</li><li>Why 80% of the rooms have almost no lights THIS IS NOT A GHOST HOUSE it is a brand new space ship!!!</li><li>Why HAL 9000 is incarnate into this ship with his big red light</li></ul>WHY MISTER ANDERSON WHYYYYYY!<br/><br/>---The crew:
To save the earth we send in space:<br/><br/><ul><li>A psychopath who want to see all the people die and burn and who have pschotic breaktrough with mental ability and can input image in your mind and read it. This man is the best hope to communicate with aliens we are going to reach. Sorry but WtF ????</li></ul>you are asking a serial killer everybody hates to save the human race ?
Are you sure ?<br/><br/><ul><li>A woman who have cybenetic inplants and can communicate with the ship</li></ul>BUT she is depressed, lost, weak and need medical assistance IMMEDIATLY! and by the way she is an addict of connecting herself with the main computer and can have nightmares when connected who can generate horrible things.
That is the most stupid thing i have ever seen in any space tv show in my life and i have seen a lot. You do not put in charge of the main computer a psycho who need medical drugs and who is an addict.<br/><br/>--The military:
do not respect the orders. do not care about the scientifics and hurt them if they are in the way. want to kill the young ""only hope for humanity"" psychic and hunt him.<br/><br/>--The main character:
seen his daughter everywhere, have VR addiction, and is so predictable and honestly ultra boring you can simply erase him of the timeline and no one will even miss him. this one do not do anything useful at all in this tv show<br/><br/>--To be simple
what the hell o_0 in this ship everyone will be
1) in hospital on medcare
2) fired
3) working in fast food industries
WORST CREW EVER!<br/><br/>--Story:
big lines: psychos go to space to save earth into a weird spaceship with mental mutant everybody want to see dead.
it's a mess a big big mess<br/><br/>For example
A spider robot with a big lazer eye start to kill peoples.
Some time later it continue to kill other crew members.
20 minute later, the captain go to a walk, cross the spider, and deactivate it with a voice order. end of story!
why ? do not care
who is dead ? do not care
what happen to the spider after that ? do not care
why do we have spider robots with lazer eye ???<br/><br/>on this example we have the perfect match of this entire tv show the producer do not care of anything. YOU DO NOT KILL a member of a space ship and just pass the scene and don't care EVERYBODY in this spaceship have a purpose it is a spaceship who is going to save the earth but we do not care. Let the spider on his back in a middle of nowhere, not important anybody can pass there and take it we do not care. why this spider start to kill we do not care. AND BY THE GREY SKULL why do we use spider in 2093 when in 2018 we have flying drones!!<br/><br/>Everything looks like this
then you do not care of this tv show and any of the people inside you simply can't care because there is no back story no ideas, nothing. It's just talk and non sens. At episode 3 we get a lot of gore and stuff like that, then the lights are darker and darker and i think the producer forget it's a spaceship and try to save his own show goint on the horror side nut it do not work at all.<br/><br/>One of a big problem of this tv show.
no one do something usefull, they can be all erased of the timeline.
producer miss the point of the travel and give us almost nothing interesting to follow. My advice look this one when you play a game, or when you read a book in the same time or forget this one. It is not good scifi at all. It's good looking but it is so boring and weak.
at best it's a bad horror tvshow in space with nothing intersting.",116 out of 198 found this helpful.,1.0,7 December 2018

48,Nightflyers, Recognizable - but don't trust the reviews,"It's not the most original story. It borrows heavily from Solaris, 2001, Star Trek, Sunshine, Strange Days, The Abyss... But the hate it gets is pretty ROFL worthy. I didn't understand why at first, until i understood that this series replaced the ultimately forgettable (yet seemingly more popular) ""The Expanse"". I love Sci-Fi, but honestly, all the reviews rating this below 5, you can just disregard them. IMDB should stop letting every opiniated crybaby write a review and figure out a way to filter out the petty fanboy drivel. It also seems a lot of these people did not watch the show, like they claimed to have, since they are bringing up issues, which are actually explained in the story. But as it stands, Nightflyers is rated a lot lower than shows many times worse, such as Killjoys, Dark Matter or Continuum and other cheesefests. This show is leagues better than those, yet gets rated a lot worse.<br/><br/>Back to the show. The setting works, eventhough it's not original (as stated above), characters and performances are better than most sci-fi series, there is enough mystery, to keep you interested without dragging it all out (like The Expanse). There are a few things that don't make sense, but ultimately don't detract from the experience, unless you have set your bar to the standard of the absolute best shows of the past few decades. If you let those things bother you, then you can stop watching about 95% of movies and shows all together.<br/><br/>It's a well made show, i enjoyed watching it, but does not break any new ground. If you liked the movies/shows i mentioned earlier, and wouldn't mind a ""light-synthesis"" version of those (content &amp; storywise), then you might very well enjoy this.",73 out of 122 found this helpful.,7.0,5 February 2019
49,Nightflyers, Semi-Watchable Mess...,"You know what they say: if you want to see a book/idea/scenario completely and utterly ruined, just give it to the SyFy channel. Recent shows, among other things, Channel Zero have been proving otherwise, which is why I decided to give Nightflyers a go, but I guess we are back to square one with this one.<br/><br/>The show is, in two words, a mess of baffling casting, character and screenplay choices. Costume design seems to be a missing concept - whatever the actors had on hand is just thrown in and you go with it. The design of the ship itself is flabbergasting, with semi-lit corridors and cameras everywhere so that the captain can watch you even in the loo (???). It reminds me of cheap slasher movies where pretty girls go into dark basements because they have nothing better to do.<br/><br/>Screenplay, casting and acting are a complete trainwreck of nightmarish proportions. You want to make first contact, so what do you do? Send a well-prepared team of scientists, linguists and mathematicians on a dedicated ship? Of course not! You put a mentally unstable leader, a psychotic telepath and a supposedly ""augmented"" human whose only contribution has been to prance around and look ""beautiful"" on a weird colony ship captained by a peeping tom and crewed by bouncers from East End.<br/><br/>Gretchen Mol and Maya Eshet and, to some extent Eoin Macken, are the only who seem to ""belong"". Everyone else is completely miscast, to the extent you get the feeling the producers took whoever they found in the neighbourhood. Jodie Turner-Smith obviously thinks the show is about modelling, while the crew seem to have been told the show is about petty thieving in London's housing districts.",64 out of 106 found this helpful.,4.0,6 December 2018

We have a milquetoast captain that seems to be on happy pills, A horny chief stew who can't even think of work because she's always in the galley trading disgusting sexual barbs with the ""chef"". Yes, Adam Glick is back for the 3rd time. This guy is a good cook when he wants to be but he is one of the most unprofessional cooks they've had on the serious. In his 1st season he added onions to all his dishes because the main charter guests didn't like onions. Why in the world would anyone in their right mind hire this goofball back to do 2 more seasons?<br/><br/>If I were spending $260, 000 for a 3 day stay on a sailboat in Greece, 1. I'd like to sail and 2. I want local Greek food cooked by a real Greek person not some Greek pasta salad thrown together by some crazy American who can't think past the end of his dick.<br/><br/>Tthe chief stew can't be bothered to check on the guests or do anything else outside the galley because she's got the hots for the cute ""chef"" she has no patience or understanding for the stews who are actually doing all the work while she yells at them.<br/><br/>On deck we have the Bickersons, a lovely couple that's been engaged for years and they bicker like they just celebrated their golden anniversary. If you're married or live with married parents you know how wonderful it is to listen to constant bickering and nit picking. Joy Joy I suggest several cocktails or 2 Aspirin 20 minutes before viewing.<br/><br/>There is a married engineer who is a total perv, doesn't seem to work much but is always hanging around the edge of the action throwing in his pervy comments. Yeah, he looks like an old perv as well. Then there's the deck hand who looks to be in his late 20s and apparently still breast feeds, oh my! We have 2 stews, one works, one complains and cried, nothing new about that. ho hum.<br/><br/>All in all the 1 word that sums up this show is, BORING! I was watching the 1st episode and thought it was a 2 hour special because time was dragging on so slowly but no it was just an hour of agony.<br/><br/>I love all the other seasons of Below Deck in all of it's other locations but this season on a sailboat that doesn't hardly ever sail is a total waste of time. Bravo should pull the plug on the show before it completely ruins the whole franchise.<br/><br/>If you still want to watch this show let me suggest recording it so you can scan through the boring parts, you'll finish in 15 minutes easily.",10 out of 17 found this helpful.,3.0,26 February 2020

Captain Glenn also disappointed in his handling of Jenna and Adam's UNPROFESSIONAL display of affection every minute of each sailing, topping it off with their nightly rendezvous in the master cabin while the 2nd and 3rd stew had to tidy up the cabin after the fun night.
Captain should have reprimanded both Jenna and Adam by telling them ""to stop"" the continous episodes of affection in the public areas. There were instances where the captain was sitting in the galley and the two idiots were all over each other.
After his chat with Jenna the affection with adam did not stop.
Madison certainly came on green but by the end of the season she matured and took her job seriously. She is lovely.
Why did Jenna blame her for ratting out on her to the captain? shows Jenna's display of dislike for Madison.
Get rid of jenna and adam please!! Although Adam is a good cook his reputation with women ruins his reputation as a chef. He apparently got involved with another crew member on a previous episode., that too did not end well
Jenna needs to be demoted if any, then she will understand how she treats people.
Paget is not a god; Ciara should grow some balls and dump him.
Georgia is immature to blatantly try get between a couple's relationship. She should have been mature enough to stop teasing Paget who was unkind in his words to her in the final episode.

62,SMILF, Dull as dishwater,"Supposedly inspired by the actual experiences of the lead character who originally created this as a short film. That's where she should have left it. It feels a little like a Shameless character the writers decided to cut, almost like a test for a spin off from Shameless. However it lacks the pace, or the charm or even the ability to shock like Shameless does. An easy one to skip over and wait for something better to come along. It's slow, dull and uninspired, and she's really not a strong enough actress or writer to carry this idea herself.<br/><br/>I tend to worry when you see the lead actor is the creator, writer and exec producer. This usually means they have far too much control and there's not enough quality control and oversight on the production. That's what you get here - her fairly dull and plodding view of the world, and no way to really connect or empathize with her. Tighter direction and scripting might have helped, but clearly this is her passion project and there isn't anyone wrangling this lumbering mess into a coherent half hour.<br/><br/>This will not be something that is around for long, if it isn't cancelled by the time you read this review, it will be soon.",67 out of 113 found this helpful.,3.0,28 December 2017

I am in the right age, demographic, from a similar upbringing, urban environment with a poor, messed up family, I'm not a prude, I even look a bit like the female lead (minus the 50lbs of makeup she wears to go work out). However, I can't watch this show without feeling incredibly annoyed and repulsed. Not by language, sex, or any of the other ""bad"" things that typically get uptight people to turn off a program like this. The characters are simply terrible people. They are rude, compulsive liars and cheaters who are intrusive and self-absorbed for no reason other than to cause shock for the tv show. I would not want to be stuck pumping gas at the same station as any of these people. There isn't any comedy in the show other than laughing at what a mess and how awful these people are - similar to watching MTV reality stars embarrass themselves on TV - which results in more eye rolls, cringing, and me exclaiming out loud to the tv, ""What the f is wrong with you?!"" I thought I was perhaps too rough on the first season and should give season 2 a chance. I was cringing and rolling my eyes 5 min into season 2. Reminds me of how I felt watching Girls. Yet another show about how terrible and messed up young women are, how none have any redeemable qualities or compassion for anyone but themselves. No life lessons. No moral to the story. Little to no entertainment in any of the 30 min episodes. Just more overly sexual young women wearing too much makeup and bad clothes running around causing chaos and misery everywhere they go. Definitely a big part of being a young dumb-dumb, though one I haven't seen many people over the age of 25 partake in, especially not parents.<br/><br/>With representations of young women like this, it's no wonder the world hates them. Hollywood clearly has a thing for green lighting programs that make the world hate women more.<br/><br/>In a show like Shameless, which is the only similar one that comes to mind I enjoy, the terrible, messed up kids grow up and become better people, they actually come off as though they care about people other than themselves.

The equivilant to showing penisies should be showing vulvas, but of course, that won't work, not when men need to be exposed like meat, and the vagina needs to be hiden and protected.<br/><br/>Two wrongs don't make one right. Stop thowing in unecessary shots of nude me to make some sort of weird point. SMILF fhas a good story hiding somewhere, an entertaining one. But this male viewer will not tolerate any more gratuitous shots of penises. Aand NO, I do not want more shots of breasts for compensation. Focus on story and keep your viewers engaged with good acting and competent narrative. What a concept, huh. <br/><br/>3/10, and my viewship of any 2nd season will end on a dime if the male nudity keesp up.",36 out of 67 found this helpful.,3.0,16 January 2018

76,SMILF, Irresponsible &amp; Stereotypical,"Absolutely awful! Why doesn't the lead character practice safer sex?!?!
This is suppose to be an insightful, slightly honest, comedic view of the life of a single mom. Unfortunately, this is the typical stereotypical show and in this current climate of people actually using open dialogue to discuss race, sexual orientation, sex and gender; you would think a show like this would do much better. 
I find this to be tired and offers nothing new to the table and uses almost every stereotype. It's quite saddening that this show is about a single white woman with a biracial child. As well, the black friend is ghetto, overweight, and overly protective of the lead character. 
Perfect example : Her shoes and bag containing a newly bought ipad for her child that were stolen the night before by a group of teenagers. Next day she is with her black friend and the lead character enters the store alone to get food. She believes that she spots the thieves and asks if they were in the park last night. She then goes outside and tells her friend and the friend asks if she wants to beat them up and reminds her that they took her shoes. She declines and holds her friends hand to express that she doesnt want to do that. The black friend is perfectly portrayed as a ghetto violent black woman and this white woman who has had injustices done to her still won't resort to violence. But when the lead character is on her own she acts quite vile but next to a black woman she is a saint.
Simply put, writers do better!",35 out of 66 found this helpful.,2.0,25 January 2018

Only, I feel Emmy Rossum as Fiona Gallagher is much more of an actual character. Frankie Shaw as Bridgette just comes across as desperate and unfunny. <br/><br/>I only watched the first episode of this series, but it's not really anything special, in my opinion. A struggling young mom trying to achieve her dreams while also raising her son (who is played by twin girls, an odd choice)...problem is, we've seen this premise before. Heck, Shameless itself is playing on a version of this storyline...and while it's very much a ""mature"" show, the crass/sexual aspects never quite overshadow the plot. Not so, in the case of SMILF. Maybe I should have clued into this earlier (the title of the show, after all, is Single Mother I'd Like To ...) but nevertheless, it's not working for me. <br/><br/>Lastly, I can't believe this is billed as a comedy show. This is about the least funny show I've seen in awhile; and I don't think it fits the genre at all. <br/><br/>Shameless does this better, and with more heart/charm.

The four judges are obviously enjoying themselves and this is a very well-done professional production that will be interesting to see once the auditions over and we get to the knockout rounds whether it reverts to a more gladiatorial approach.<br/><br/>The show emphasizes that the judges are coaches here to help the contestants rather than simply ""judge"" them.<br/><br/>All in all, we loved the first show; it is a real breath of fresh air, and here's hoping it lives up to this fantastic start!",25 out of 37 found this helpful.,9.0,3 May 2011
92,The Voice," Tired show, losing my interest","When I first started watching The Voice, I really enjoyed the singers and even when they made mistakes or got pitchy, I found things to like. This season, the ""one note"" interplay between Adam and Blake is downright juvenile and what does the three stooges have to do with voice anyway? The singers/ song choices were so bad this time, that the commercials got played in our home, and the show got muted. Let's get rid of 'the block', and Adam and Blake, and go to actually making the singers better not the old tired hacks that couldn't get TV airtime if their singing talent was what they depended on, not their ownership of the show. I'll watch the blind auditions for next season, but if the two imbeciles don't get toned down or removed, and the talent is as limited as this season, I'm done with this pretense of ""The Voice"". Also, since when don't the west coast voters get a say? I don't bother, but If you are going to cut out half of the country to voting, perhaps you should have two shows. one for the west without Adam and Blake and with real singing talent. Maybe I'd be more supportive.",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,2.0,22 May 2018

If you think otherwise, you are just fooling yourself.<br/><br/>The disclaimers alone are intolerable, such as the fact that they can change the outcome however they see fit. Then we have other major issues such as the popularity of the coach greatly influencing voting, and the concept of vote splitting.<br/><br/>The vote split is really damning for the show when combined with the popularity of a coach, since it means a coach with two artists will always lose compared to a coach with one artist.<br/><br/>So when will the producers do the right thing to make the show completely fair to the artists? I suppose when the viewers stop tuning in they will make a big deal about how they are changing things in order to get us back.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we can all skip the commercials and also not buy those junky cars they keep giving away.

94,The Voice, A talent show better than the rest,"In an entertainment industry where looks dominate, The Voice offers a refreshing format which reassures us, that talent alone CAN prevail. Unlike rival programmes such as American Idol and X-Factor, the coaches on this programme are unable to see what the contestants look like when they first hit the stage. The auditions are essentially 'blind' auditions, where the judges sit in a chair with their back to the contestants so that their entire focus is on the voice of the contestant. Only if they like the contestant's voice, do they push a button which enables them to turn around and to see the contestant. In short- beautiful, talentless people don't get a look in here.<br/><br/>Living in a time that is dominated by celebrity, image and 'z-list' culture in which talentless people can make it big for being pretty, The Voice is taking things back to basics- good old fashioned raw talent. This original twist is not alone in making the show a success. The chemistry of the four coaches (Christina Aguilera, Cee-Lo Green, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton) makes the show endearing and entertaining.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, don't miss The Voice on NBC.",21 out of 36 found this helpful.,10.0,1 May 2011

102,The Voice," One of the really amazing things about IMDb,,,","... is that right now as you read these words you could go back in time and review the 1948 edition of Ted Mack and the Original Amateur Hour. Why, you are wondering, would you want to do that??? Because, as the name implies, that show really and truly was the original from which all current hit shows (Voice, Idol, etc) have sprung.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the concept died out for a few decades and then came roaring back into fashion. Which brings us to this show. First, it is not so much a show as a product. Big difference. The brains behind the show is John de Mol, the godfather of reality TV in the US, which means that the show was designed to be a hit before the first episode ever aired. Second, pay attention to the flow of a typical episode (I have seen them all, and I am not proud of that fact) and you will notice they spend more time promoting each other, and the show, than the so-called artists. Think about that. While you are thinking about that, notice that MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE COACHES PICK THE WRONG SONG FOR THE ARTIST. With friends like that... Finally, since this is a formula product not a show (see above) every few years they end up with too much talent (where for example the top 2 contenders are about even and both deserve to win) and, also, seasons where all the contestants are duds -- like the 2014 season, where (trust me) very little actual record sales will result, regardless of who the winner is.<br/><br/>But the show has its moments. Watching Michelle Chammuel perform was a treat. Watch her in web clips and you will notice that a major talent was lost that season. Which is, oddly, what gives the show its panache. Not its carefully rehearsed moments. Its the ones that got away.",10 out of 18 found this helpful.,5.0,7 May 2014
103,The Voice, Much bearable than Idol and X Factor,"So a couple or so years ago, I decided to write off all singing shows; they're just all the same and have become uninteresting to me. I did end up giving X Factor a chance; it was too flashy, loud and dramatic for me. Then I gave Sing-Off a chance; I'm not gonna lie, I actually ended up loving it for its originality and great judge panel (side note: I'm so stoked that it's back for another season this year!!).<br/><br/>So I recently saw an article with some video clips from season 4 of The Voice and one contestant, whose name is Judith, prompted me to go ahead and give the show a chance. I just need to see how far she makes it in the show, because her voice is splendidly amazing. So after watching the premiere episodes, I may actually enjoy it. First off, I have respect for Adam, Shakira and Usher as artists (not so much Blake only because I've never heard of him before this show), and they're a funny group with good chemistry. <br/><br/>I also love the fact that, unlike American Idol, the contestants aren't being judged off their looks or outfits. They're being judged solely off their singing capabilities. I'm also happy that The Voice doesn't waste viewers' time with horrible/stupid performances. They only invite great singers to the stage instead of trying to pull in viewers with outrageously stupid acts. Now I'm not saying all of the contestants on the show are amazing singers; I've definitely heard some not-so-great ones, but it's not silly like Idol. <br/><br/>I feel like The Voice has a good thing going on with the vibe of the show, slight originality and some great judges.

107,The Voice, A reality show with a HUGE problematic Voting system,"I think all of the reality shows that involve voting by the viewers have a huge problem on their voting. Older and matured viewers rarely vote with passion unless when the competitors/participants are from their towns, cities, counties or states. It's so obvious and so predictable that only teenagers or even kids or younger people in their first two years of college, who are always holding smart phones endlessly texting will vote with blind passion. So when a reality show such as 'The Voice' and 'American Idol' require their viewers to vote for the person who like most, these overly enthusiastic texting young generation would vote like there's no tomorrow. They won't give a damn to a charge of every call they placed. <br/><br/>Then again, there's another unrealistic voting problem we have to put into consideration: Female teenagers would vote crazily when there's a handsome young guy with pretty face among the competitors. The would become so crazy, their voting fingers would have their own will and mind to keep voting for that guy, their dream lover, no matter what; even there's another competitor whose singing is much much better than that young dude, the teen-aged young female viewers will not vote for him, worst yet, the other better and more talented singer is a female, a similar gender like them feminine. They will reject her and hate her if she is too good, because she maybe endanger their young dude's ranking. (Watch this 2015 season, you would know what I mean here.) Unless, just unless, there's no likable and lovable young stud in that season, these young voting viewers might become a bit fair, voting a prettier one of the same gender. Usually, older guys or more matured female competitors would not get too many votes from those young viewers. These outcomes, well, even you think with you toes, will be so easily understood.<br/><br/>'The Voice' got another huge problem, i.e., the so-called four 'Coaches/Judges'. Since every coach would have several competitors they choose during the blind pick, whenever the person they coached singing, they would try every way to complement him or her, while the other three opponent coaches will render nothing negative to the other three coaches team members. Why they would have enemies in the same business? Praise other opponents means other opponent coaches will praise your team members. So these 4 guys always doing the 'scratching other three coaches' backs, praising their singers doing a great job'. This you scratch my back and I will scratch you back was an often disgusting and pretentious bullshitting scene that we kept seeing again and again.<br/><br/>Therefore, the 4 coaches/Judges system of 'The Voice' is not as good and fair as 'American Idol'. The latter show got 3 real judges who always comments with their true feeling whenever the competitor finished singing, they really judged and taught some important and usable suggestions to the participants and improve them in the next round. But not these 4 coaches of The Voice, most of the time, they were just bullshitting to each other, complemented among them.<br/><br/>The other big problem of 'The Voice', is coming from one of the coaches, Adam Levine. This guy always tried to say something deep, trying so hard to show his depth in everything, but often and always spoke something that even he himself could not comprehend. We often saw this guy just kept talking, talking and couldn't stop, like a dog chasing its own tail, circling around non-stop, yet most of what he said would be just gibberish beating-about-the-bush crappy nothingness. His other serious problem is his constant abusing insults to the other guy, Blake Shelton, a weird way to show his compadre brotherhood to that poor guy.<br/><br/>But other than the above-mentioned problems of 'The Voice', I have to say that this singing competition is way better than 'American Idol'. If compare these two singing competition reality shows, the talent quality and standard of The Voice is much much better and higher than 'American Idol'. When viewing these two singing programs in a row, you'd easily know American Idol's singers are not good enough, especially this 2015 season, they were just terrible and too untalented.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,,25 June 2015

Just watch it for the neat songs and the competition.It's yet to be seen how the second season will do. The judges reaction's especially the ones between Blake, Adam and Cee-Lo are comical. Christina Aguilera does the usual prima donna act and the pressure on her team feels like it's much higher than the rest. All the guys love their female contestants and it's pretty obvious that the women stand much better chances to qualify and win. Who doesn't love women?

110,The Voice, It's All About The Voice!!!,"The casting for this show couldn't have been better, everyone compliments each other. Cee-Lo and Christina are the most likable and more wittiest of the bunch. The interesting thing about this show is the fact that they have blind auditions and choose contestants based on the voice and only the voice. Each mentor then chooses a contestant to add to their team, and the teams battle it out as America chooses who The Voice will be. It's a million times better than American Idol and obviously more interesting than the new US version of X-Factor (which has a weak judging panel). The former shows focus on finding the next Britney or GaGA (autotuned/image) while The Voice specializes in finding the next Whitney or Christina (the voice). 10 Stars!!!!",6 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,1 May 2011

The only people I have liked are Dia and the black guy (sorry I don't know his name). Everyone else pretty much sings carbon copies of the original songs... And the coaches don't say anything about it, they just say how amazing they thought it was. Its nice that they aren't mean like American idol judges, but they could offer a little bit of criticism. Except for those two, the show is a total snoozefest. Right now, I'm watching the final performances and they each perform an original song..

112,One Foot in the Grave, One of the finest drama/comedies ever made.,"Victor Meldrew, retired security guard and human sponge 'soaking up every misery in the world' will surely be remembered in many years to come as one of comedy's greatest creations.  Not to say that 'One Foot in the Grave' is strictly 2-D comedy.  As with all the best of these kinds of things, it is more of a drama series which just happens to be funny.  There is a good cast of genuine characters, all played with believability.  Among them are Victor's long-suffering wife Margaret, her friend Mrs Warboys (who always seems to end up on the wrong end of disaster), next-door neighbours Patrick and Pippa (the former a Victor-in-the-making), and the enigmatic Mr Swainey who lives with his mysterious never-seen mother.  And the programme certainly manages non-stop hilarity and plenty of genuine belly laughs throughout its six series and various extra-long specials. Well-written,inventive and clever plots involve everything from the everyday to the bizarre.  Especially notable are hundreds of garden gnomes turning up on Victor's doorstep, Victor and Mrs Warboys both getting a foot stuck in a bag of plaster and having to heave it along with them as they attempt to find their way out of 'the set from Apocolypse Now', a caravan which contains the ghost of a devil worshipper, a chimpanzee which has a 'thing' for Victor, a scorpion talisman which brings down a plague of bad luck on its owner, and a guest house which is 'more like a wildlife kingdom'.  Also memorable are the episodes involving one long scene - Victor stuck in a traffic jam, waiting for a telephone call and sitting in a waiting area. The fact that a half-hour episode in which nothing actually happens can be hilarious, entertaining and meaningful demonstrates the skill and depth of writing and the high quality of acting present throughout the series. Victor himself, despite initially coming across as a grumpy old man, is actually one of the most sympathetic characters ever created.  Everybody can relate to the problems he faces on a daily basis, and everyone can cheer him on as he says and does the kinds of things we've all longed to do in certain trying situations.  If you're a fan of any kind of comedy then this is unmissable.",39 out of 42 found this helpful.,,8 April 2001

115,One Foot in the Grave, Best British comedy so far!,"This is just an incredible series. It deals with just about EVERYTHING! Not for the easily offended, though it doesn't go out of its way to offend. It's irreverent and pulls no punches. The series shows what it wants to how it wants to and makes no apologies. Sometimes it can be darkly humorous, but in these cases it usually has a valid point to make and does so quite well.<br/><br/>The best way to describe this series is as follows: Imagine if absolutely everyone and everything on the face of the planet were really as miserable, stupid, loud, obnoxious, belligerent, deceitful, crazy, lazy, greedy, unfair, ironic, annoying, etc., as one sometimes feels them to be. Put a bitter (but not unlikeable) retiree in the middle of this world as the protagonist. Now watch how he interacts with and reacts to the people, places and things in this world. Sometimes he's in the right, sometimes he's in the wrong. Sometimes he gets what he deserves, sometimes he gets what he doesn't deserve. Sometimes he gives others what they deserve, sometimes he gives them what they don't deserve. No matter where a particular episode goes, you will most likely bellow with laughter at some point, usually at many points. There are a few episodes that were created not so much for a laugh as they were for irony; some of that irony being quite bitter or just plain sad. In episodes such as these, one will at least feel something, even if it is not what was expected.<br/><br/>As of this writing, the first season is available in the UK on DVD and the second season will be released there soon. With absolutely every other Britcom available in the United States, it's unfortunate that this series isn't popular enough to be released here. I suppose the fact that public television didn't play it ad nauseum like ""Are You Being Served,"" ""Keeping Up Appearances,"" or ""Red Dwarf"" (not that they're bad shows) is why. Remember, it's not how good something is that makes it popular and available, it's how visible it is.<br/><br/>Actually, it's kind of fitting that ""One Foot in the Grave"" isn't receiving the recognition it deserves and is fading into obscurity while being surrounded by so many more popular yet inferior programs. It's exactly the sort of point that one of its own episodes might have made!",27 out of 31 found this helpful.,,22 April 2005

117,One Foot in the Grave, One of the funniest British comedies of all time,"I happened across this show quite by accident whilst channel surfing on Christmas Eve a couple of years back.  I came across this show featuring a couple in their sixties: him a catankerous old codger who seemed to be a magnet for misfortune and trouble; her, his wife who suffered his constant moanings and groanings.  Through the plot, which involved all manner of mayhem, I simply could not stop laughing.  Unfortunately, it was only a one-off to fill time on the night: I did not hear of more episodes of this show until six months or more later.  However, it again disappeared after only a handful of episodes, until six weeks ago it returned to my television screen.  However, tonight I have just watched the final episode (ever), which leads me to believe its seasons were very short indeed.<br/><br/>Anyone who has not seen this show will do well to find videos of it.  And those who have not seen the finale for the show, watch it.

120,One Foot in the Grave," ""I Don't Believe It!""","With ""One Foot in the Grave"", David Renwick created a British icon, an ubiquitous catchphrase, as well as possibly the greatest situation comedy of its time. All from unlikely beginnings... Victor Meldrew, played by Richard Wilson (Renwick had him in mind when creating the character, and he was reluctant to play the part at first), can best be described as a grumpy old age pensioner, suddenly made redundant by an electronic piece of equipment, whose everyday actions reap disastrous, albeit hilarious, consequences. Of course the other characters add a lot of flavour to the series. The other main characters in ""One Foot in the Grave"" are Victor's wife, Margaret, played by Annette Crosby, who cannot be underrated in her role, as well as the ones with less screen presence who pop up from time to time: their neighbours and counterparts, Patrick &amp; Pippa, played by Angus Deayton and Jane Duvitski, respectively; Margaret's friend, Mrs. Warboys; and the altruistic and left-side neigbour, Nick Swainey, all of whom are integral parts of the series; their idiosyncrasies clashing with Meldrew's. Although at first glance the characters in this series can seem rather one-dimensional, they really have a lot of depth to them. It is the only series which ran for so long I can think of whose episodes remain consistently funny, ranging from the various degrees of mildly amusing to absolutely, side-splittingly funny. It may be argued that a lot of the humour derived from this series comes from the way Victor reacts to other people. He doesn't suffer fools gladly! I believe that this series will stand the test of time, despite all the uniquely British references (especially the all-too-common time-sensitive ones, such as the names of contemporary celebrities). Even the theme song (sung &amp; written by Eric Idle of Monty Python fame) is great. The series was broadcast over a 10-year period, from 1990-2000, spanning 6 seasons (36 episodes) plus seven Christmas specials of lengths ranging from 40 minutes to the one feature-length film, ""One Foot in the Algarve"" (1993). It's a shame the series had to end with both feet in the grave as a result of Victor's demise from a hit-and-run incident, but it certainly didn't overstay its welcome on the BBC.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,,29 August 2001
121,One Foot in the Grave, Risk of both feet in the grave from laughing,"Although not as funny as Fawlty Towers, this is one of the best comedy series to come out of the UK in recent years. I can understand it not appealing at all to non-British people but to a normal Brit, this series embodies everything that is typical of British humour of the latter half of the twentieth century. The crisis of trying to adjust to retirement is a universal one and Victor Meldrew reactions to present day society are in fact those of all or most of us, even if he has the courage to express them vocally and us, not. Certainly the catch phrase from the series ""I don't believe it"" is common in people's mouths today. Just think when you have to call a company and you are no longer put thru to a switchboard but to some kind of robot and to access the department you want you have to press button one, then two etc etc. If you make one cock-up, the whole thing goes wrong. This is the kind of stupidity Meldrew is having to battle with. SOme of the episodes are so funny ( when Meldrew finds a strange old lady in his bed !! ) that you seriously risk of ending up in the grave yourself from too much laughter. Others can be tedious and you feel that the scriptwriters were more inspired some days than others. That said, from the fairly large number of episodes I've seen, I would say that about at least 65 to 70 percent of the episodes are side-splitting. When I watch this programme, I feel I am watching something peculiarly common to BRitish Humour. I could not imagine Amercians laughing at this, not to speak of French, Germans or Spanish ! Some of the humour is indeed fairly ""morbid"" and ""sick"" and would have limited appeal outside the UK. THat doesn't matter at all, but I'm just stating it as a fact. The last episode to end them all has to be seen but is bitter and sad and not funny at all - very strange compared with the others. Obviously, the BBC had decided to number Meldrew's days for once and for all but weren't too sure how to go about it. When I saw the final result, I ""just didn't believe it"" !!!!!!!!!!!!",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,,29 August 2004

It's nigh on 15 years since the last episode was transmitted, and I still know many families that refer to their equivalent as 'Victor.'<br/><br/>David Renwick penned some seminal, hilarious, moving, surreal and down right brilliant episodes, he made us fall in love with Victor, and have huge sympathies for his poor wife Margaret. Lots of fun always provided by friends and neighbours, the rather sad Nick, the long suffering Patrick and Pippa, and the star turn that was Mrs Warboys, she definitely had some of the best lines.<br/><br/>This show could have you screaming laughing, then shedding a tear in sorrow, the balance was incredible. Who will ever forget the tough to watch 'Hearts of Darkness' in which Victor liberates a house full of pensioners from an abusive Nursing home, an episode which drew large numbers of complaints. Who could forget Victor and Margaret's holiday in the Algarve, or UK break with Vince and April.<br/><br/>It took me ages to come to terms with this being finished, and to this day I can't look at Hannah Gordon without thinking 'you killed Victor.'<br/><br/>A brave decision from David Renwick and co to end it when they did, but I wish they'd made a few more.

123,One Foot in the Grave, One Of The Best British Sitcom's Ever,"This show need's no introduction, not only is it the best sitcom ever but it has set the bench mark for other sitcoms but it has also created one of the best characters for us to sympathise with. When i first watched this show i was about 5 so i couldn't understand what a brilliant TV show it was but now i'm older and i understand the show dark undertones and surrealism. Like many great sitcom they have a simple setting so that the writer (in this case David Renwick) can show us that a typical, surburban setting is just waiting to be stripped away and exposed as a dark and disturbing microcosm. My favourite episode is 'The Trial' because it's a very unique episode because it takes place entirely in the house and just has Victor ranting on about his boredom..... and his scab, the reason this is my favourite episode is because i don't think any comedy writers today could write something as perfect as this episode, not Chuck Lorre, Ricky Gervais or the people who wrote 'Friends'. I can also relate to Victor (not the age!) but the fact that he is the only sane person in a world that is completely insane, and through his dry quick wit he is quickly alienated for using this to express his opinion's. the show was not well liked by some but it's their loss because they are missing out on THE greatest show ever. 10/10",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,3 November 2010

125,One Foot in the Grave, Surreal without special effects,"This series is surreal in ways which would be instantly recognizably to Jaques Tati or Laurel and Hardy. In fact, every day situations are stretched just a little bit further and you have something which strays from conventional sit-com. The reality is that unplanned retirement does make people fill in their time with pointless activities and obsessive behaviour. Victor Meldrew's relationship with the world has been fractured and, suddenly, he's out of step with everything. Gadgets defeat him, people and their activities bemuse or disgust him. There is a certain predictability just as there is with the humour of Tony Hancock whom Victor closely resembles. But Victor is more three dimensional than Hancock: he has real disappointments, the fact that he is childless, old-age hasn't brought him respect, even from his wife. Even at his last gasp there is muddle and laughter. In fact, much of the humour is very black and some of our laughter is a way of dealing with shock- Grandpa Meldrew's skull, Margaret's mother's death and the episode where Victor thinks Margaret has died - then the nurse thumps the heart monitor back to life after he has reviewed their very human life in flashback and laughter follows. This is not Terry and June or the Honeymooners, it is a post Monty Python and Fawlty Towers version of the sitcom - it resembles the old type very superficially but, despite some extravagance of plotting it is much closer to reality and, like much sophisticated humour, involves a certain amount of pain and embarrassment for its wit. There are variations on trouser-dropping farce and misunderstood comments overheard - but here it is the character which drives the comedy, not the plot. There is enough in it for the belly laugh but there is also the humour of a Jane Austen, pointing up and dealing with the absurdities of the human condition!",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,,28 February 2005
126,One Foot in the Grave, ''I don't believe it!'',"In 1990, 'One Foot In The Grave' appeared on television and met with little interest from viewers. Who, then, would have thought that by its second series it would grow to become one of the most popular British sitcoms of the '90's? In fact, many years back it was voted 10th place ( out of 50 ) in the BBC2 voting show 'Britain's Best Sitcom'. I must admit that I was not always great lover of the show but I eventually grew to like it after several viewings.<br/><br/>The show begins with Victor Meldrew ( played by Richard Wilson ) being forced to retire at the age of 60 from his job as a security officer. Victor cannot stick life in retirement and with too much time on his hands tries to find new ways of busying himself. Things then become a nightmare for Victor as he frequently finds himself a victim of unlikely circumstances, which usually culminates in him shrieking his catchphrase: ''I don't believe it!''. His poor wife Margaret sometimes becomes unwittingly involved in his misfortunes, much to her chagrin.<br/><br/>The influences of David Renwick's creation are plain for all to see - Richard Fegen &amp; Andrew Norris' 'Chance In A Million' ( which starred Simon Callow' ) and Ronnie Taylor's 'A Sharp Intake Of Breath' ( which Richard Wilson appeared in alongside David Jason ). As Meldrew, Richard Wilson gave a first rate performance, as did Annette Crosbie as his long suffering wife Margaret. Doreen Mantle was hilarious as the Meldrews' friend and neighbour Mrs. Warboys, as was Owen Bremnan as the irritatingly cheerful Nick Swainey, though I could not take to Angus Deayton ( I never liked him! ) or Janine Duvitski as Patrick and Pippa. They offered no comedy value whatsoever.<br/><br/>It was mostly harmless entertainment, though the show did get into trouble on occasions, especially with a scene in which a tortoise is burnt to a crisp after crawling into a brazier. An early episode also provoked controversy with a scene in which Victor found a dead cat in his freezer.<br/><br/>After six series, 'One Foot In The Grave' ended in 2000 after Victor was killed in a hit and run accident ( an episode which was almost trumped in the ratings by the first ever top-prize win on ITV's 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?' ), although a special sketch was made in 2001 for 'Comic Relief'. David Renwick may have buried Victor Meldrew for good but the spirit of the character still lives on strong thanks to repeats on satellite and DVD releases.<br/><br/>The most recent show to appear recently inspired by 'One Foot In The Grave' was 'The Rebel', a three-part comedy show screened by UK Gold and starring Simon Callow as a rebellious pensioner. It was fab.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,24 January 2017
127,One Foot in the Grave, Rubbish? I don't believe it!!!,"Richard Wilson draws an acutely insightful picture of a man struggling (without success) to cope with the thoughtlessness, and callousness of today's grubby-minded and boorish Britain.<br/><br/>In so doing we are treated to the hilarious spectacle of all the misunderstandings and upsets that he experiences and inflicts on others. What underlines and high-lights the humour, is the martyrdom of his long-suffering wife (Annette Crosbie,) and the restrained outrage of his neighbor, underplayed with deliciously restrained, and articulate bafflement by Angus Deayton (ably assisted by Janine Duvitski).<br/><br/>If the plot lines are unlikely, then that is an essential ingredient of farce. If we laugh at Victor Meldrew, it is because he is a caricature, and perhaps we do not appreciate that his outrage is justified as he rails against the injustices and insults heaped upon him by an increasingly indifferent and uncaring society.<br/><br/>Hooray for his all-too-few triumphs and moments of dignified pathos.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,,23 June 2005
128,One Foot in the Grave, Favourite scene in top comedy,"After reading the generally favourable reviews here of this top sit.com I would add nothing to merely repeat the valid points I wholeheartedly agree with about the brilliant portrayals by the actors and superb writing achievement. I could draw attention to an outstanding episode IMO, that in which Victor takes the job of doorman (grandly entitled ""Commisionaire"") at a swanky hotel. To say he finds this job demeaning to himself is putting it mildly with the ridiculous uniform and mauve top hat; apparent pain radiates from every pore I think from the off and things soon come to boiling point. Victor is a bit distracted as a taxi pulls up as he is observing the struggle of a disabled person to negotiate their way out of a car and complete the transfer to a fold-up wheelchair.Accordingly he does not immediately notice the couple of customers arriving at the hotel, an apparent smart gentleman and lady the male barking at him as a result for having to wait his attendance at the vehicle. Victor is duly dressed down for his not holding the taxi door open and getting the case of the gent's companion. Our hero, and I warmed to him almost cheered at this juncture, having not toadied sufficiently in the required manner is threatened with being reported to the management of the hotel. Victor has meanwhile looked again across the road at the single handed efforts of the disabled driver receiving no help from anyone. Gasket blowing time: in a terrific beautifully delivered (of course) by Richard Wilson) magnificently composed speech (Mr Renwick at his socialist best) suffice to say the up themselves pair are put in their place the top hat has been thrown down and Victor Meldrew has resigned.

130,One Foot in the Grave, Consistently good from start to finish,"One Foot In The Grave is my favorite ever sitcom. I can't think of another UK sitcom that ran for as many episodes and remained consistently of a high quality all the way through in the same way OFITG did.Fawlty Towers was consistently great throughout but only ran for 12 episodes, most other sitcoms that stay great from start to finish usually have 2 or 3 series at most.One foot ran for over 40 episodes and 6 series and remained great throughout, that's quite an achievement that no other sitcom has managed with that many episodes, If they do run that long than most begin to decline after Series 2 or 3, or at best become hit and miss.<br/><br/>Only fools and Horses was brilliant at times but imho opinion the quality was inconsistent throughout, there were often a couple of substandard episodes in every series and some of the later Christmas specials were far too long and short on laughs. It was a hit and miss, patchy sitcom. One Foot on the other hand never had a single bad episode and the Specials were all wonderful ( especially the excellent One Foot In The Algarve)While i do enjoy some episodes less than others, even the ones i enjoy less are of high standard and always have something funny in them.<br/><br/>I have seen some people suggest that the quality dipped in Series 6, the final series. I don't really see that, i think it was just as great as all the others. The last episode is very sad but a powerful ending for the series. Series 1 i might say was maybe not as good as the others, but again that doesn't make it bad, its still high quality but i didn't like the house they lived in as much as the one from Series 2 onwards.<br/><br/>Another thing i like is writer David Renwick's ability to keep it fresh and bring different elements and scenarios into it to avoid repetition. Sometimes i get bored watching the same things being repeated over and over in other sitcoms, it gets where the episode is a different episode but its basically the same episode you already saw the other week but they changed the name. This doesn't happen with One Foot In The Grave and while Victor does of course have his famous catchphrase i wouldn't say its overused to the point of tedium like the catchphrases often are in other sitcoms.<br/><br/>Another thing i like is the depth and pathos this show has, its like a comedy-drama at times with some incredibly poignant and moving moments. Its also very surreal often and even brutal on occasion. There are times when David Renwick takes us to places we weren't expecting to go to and places the characters in unnerving or even scary situations where you really do think they are in danger. Other times you are in fits of laughter one minute and the next you feel emotional without warning because what was very funny suddenly turned into something incredibly sad and emotional (like the sublime moment when Victor is buried up to his neck in the ground and Margaret gets a phone call to tell her that her mother has died, you're roaring with laughter one second and the next you're in tears)This darker side is part of the appeal to me, it really makes the show interesting and adds extra layers to it. If i wanted something cosy and safe i'd watch The Good Life.<br/><br/>Rihard Wilson gives a superb performance as Meldrew, a role i feel he was born to play. While he is very much the star and the main focus i would say that Margaret is crucial as well and she appears in all but one of the episodes. Also worth mentioning are the supporting cast, all of whom play their part also and i can't imagine it without them in it either. Doreen Mantle at times steals the show as the well meaning but annoying Mrs Warboys and Owen Brenman gives some moving performances as Victors oddball neighbour Mr Swainey. Angus Deayton and Janine Duvitski were also very good as Victor's other neighbours Patrick and Pippa. I liked the feuds between Victor and Patrick while the two wives shared a friendship and tried hard to keep the peace between the two men. Patrick was like a younger (and much more spiteful) version of Victor.<br/><br/>Victor himself is actually a very likable character, he is a kind hearted person who basically means well but gets mad at the world around him, at the insanity, cruelty and injustice. I often find myself agreeing with him and siding with him to be fair. He is on the side of whats good and decent. Margaret is the one who can be quite mean and insufferable at times (along with Patrick),but you realize she puts up with a lot and the show wouldn't be the same without her there. Annette Crosbie is very natural in the part.<br/><br/>Favourite episode is probably ''Warm Champagne'' but every episode is great so its hard to pick just one, but the moment when Margaret finds Victor in bed with the old woman is just priceless ''Its not every day you arrive home to find that your husband has taken up necrophilia!'' I never tire of watching repeats of this and i have the complete boxset. Even just talking about it now makes me want to watch them all again!",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,3 December 2017

132,One Foot in the Grave, The Funniest Comedy series I have EVER seen,"I suppose the mantra of the main character, Victor Meldrew (a Dickensian name, if ever there was one) would be, What could possibly happen to me next? The comedy arises from the most incredible things that happen to this poor soul in the retirement that he wished would be peaceful and uneventful. How should one react when, on returning from an event-filled vacation in a sunny clime, he can't immediately find his house, only to realize that it isn't there anymore? David Renwick is a master of comedic writing.<br/><br/>Richard Wilson and Annette Crosby play their roles perfectly. Many actors would appear hyper-excited or buffoonish in the situations that character Meldrew finds himself in. That is how it would probably be played in American sit-coms. Thank god a proposed American re-write of the series never got off the ground. And thankfully for all of us who have had the opportunity to see this series, Richard Wilson, who had been appearing in TV for 30 years, finally got the part that made him famous.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,5 January 2007

I was hooked by episode 2 and ended up binge-watching this entire series in 5 days and couldn't stop laughing. Richard Wilson is superb ... he was made for this part. Annette Crosby is great as his long-suffering wife. And Angus Deayton as his neighbor is probably my favorite character. I personally thought the entire cast was outstanding. I'm a big fan of British comedy but I'd be hard-pressed to say I enjoyed any other shows as much as I enjoyed this. I had 3 or 4 good belly laughs with each episode.

134,One Foot in the Grave, Great comedy / drama,I came across this in my 30's when it first aired in Australia and told my parents about it and they like me loved it so much they told all their friends who enjoyed it also. I bought videos for my parents as Xmas presents which they loved as they could watch them again. After my father passed and my mother had to be put into aged care due to dementia I donated her videos to the facility. The manager thought the title would put the residents off but he played one for my mother and her friend and they laughed so much that other residents came out to watch and asked that more episodes could be shown. It became a favourite at the facility and I ended up buying some more videos for them.,1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,23 January 2021

I was about 9 or 10 when I discovered this classic and ive watched them all several times over the past 20 years and they still crack me up now. The other reviewer that had issues with it found the humour ""too sick"" I mean come on! 90% of the episodes are rated PG the remaining episodes are rated 12 how bad can it be?

136,One Foot in the Grave, An All-time Classic. Beliiiiieeeeeeve It!!,"One Foot In The Grave is arguably the most tightly written sitcom of all-time, only Fawlty Towers could really contest that. And whilst John Cleese and Connie Booth could 'only' conjure up twelve immaculate gems, David Renwick managed an entire six series' worth, plus a number of Christmas specials, on his own. The only relatively disposable offerings were the Children in Need/Comic Relief specials, but those were 5-10 minute shorts hastily drafted for a very good cause.<br/><br/>We kid ourselves as the viewer that everything Victor Meldrew finds hilariously irritating about the world - from littering to vandals, car mechanics to madcap neighbours - relates mostly to curmudgeonly pensioners, yet the truth is anybody from their 20s onwards can relate.<br/><br/>It's a dark, occasionally surreal comedy posing as a traditional suburban sitcom, groundbreaking for its' time.<br/><br/>The final episode - NO SPOILERS - polarised opinion, but then finales often do and in my view, fits the tone that One Foot always chased.<br/><br/>Richard Wilson still hears regular ""I DON'T BELIEVE IT""s during stage performances and walks down the street, almost 20 years after he last portrayed Victor. That was the level of impact One Foot had on British culture.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,26 December 2019

This is good straight thriller horror without the way over the top extremism of American Horror Story. I wish Cinemax had the balls to at least run a few episodes of season 3 to wrap up the story.

139,Outcast, whoa,"This show is supposed to do for the ghost/ possessed genre what the walking dead has done for the zombie genre. Bring it out of the ridicule into the books of serious TV. I didn't read much else about this show going into it and I am glad for it. <br/><br/>Like many reviewers have said, it's that first scene that completely has you hooked. I was grimacing and enthralled at the same time. <br/><br/>I didn't think too much of the story-line - it seems to echo the usual haunted by a possession in the past trope, but there are some twists that bring it out of the absolutely ordinary. It remains to be seen how well they build on the out-of-the-ordinary elements in the story. Let's remember that TWD also started out regular - a guy waking up in a world inhabited by zombies was very very familiar. It is what they have done with it in the long run that has made it a gem.<br/><br/>This is just the first episode in what appears to be a very promising ghost series. Go Kirkman!!<br/><br/>------------edit post season 1 finale--------- no spoilers!<br/><br/>This is the slow burn that The VVitch tried so hard to accomplish. Things move slowly and deliberately towards tragedies/ triumphs in the storyline.

141,Outcast, One of my favorite new shows of 2016,"Cinemax presents a new horror series called Outcast from the creator of The Walking Dead, Robert Kirkman. Set in the small town Rome, West Virginia, a demon is afoot possessing small children, or anybody really. At the center of this horror is Kyle Barnes played by Patrick Fugit. He's had a past with this demon that has resulted in him being alone and locked away inside a house hiding from everyone. Only his sister Megan Holter, played by Wren Schmidt, will come to visit and drop off food.<br/><br/>There is plenty of gore in this show as it is on the much less censored pay-for-cable channel and from the mind of the prolific zombie series writer. The boy who is possessed performs all sorts of gruesome acts on himself and those who try to cast the demon out of him. A particular part where he bites his finger is a shocker right at the start. Reverend Anderson, played by Philip Glenister, is called in to help release the boy from his plight but can do little in the face of such evil. The supporting cast looks good too with character actors like Reg E. Cathey of House of Cards playing the police chief.<br/><br/>After season 1 The new horror show on Cinemax comes from Robert Kirkman, the Kentucky native, and creator of The Walking Dead. Outcast expands on classic horror tropes as it follows a depressed man, Kyle Barnes (Patrick Fugit) with a mysterious power and a troubled past, and a preacher, Reverend Anderson (Philip Glenister) who performs exorcisms. The two men stumble upon evil entities spreading through the small Southern town of Rome, West Virginia. At points, the show fell into a ""demon of the week"" episodic nature but provided enough intrigue to push through a solid introductory season.<br/><br/>This horror original based on graphic novel doesn't go for the easy jump scare but draws out the tension with slow, menacing dread that builds through each episode. The most gripping story of the series is the plight of Megan Holter (Wrenn Schmidt), Kyle's sister, whose terrible experiences catch up with her and her husband Officer Mark Holter (Mark Holter). This subplot flips upside down as it collides with the main storyline to make for an awesome and chill- inducing finale. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",30 out of 40 found this helpful.,8.0,4 June 2016
142,Outcast, Episode One Review,"The beginning scene grabbed my attention. It succeeded in properly setting up the episode. I wasn't too sure of what to think about the main character at first. There was a cloud of mystery around him. As the episode continued, and the other characters began to emerge, I started to understand their aspects and how they relate to the situations in the episode. They all served their purpose in helping to develop the story line. There were some conflicts in place to help keep the viewer interested. A lot of answers to beginning questions came at the end. I recommended this series for anyone who has interest in possession or religious type of horror flicks. If the remaining episodes of the season are as enthralling as the first, then this series should be around for a while.",53 out of 78 found this helpful.,9.0,24 May 2016

It is well acted. The actors did a really good job and there is some scary intense scene and some of it is pretty gory. Although , this series is went kinda slow and a bit confusing at first. The plot is also interesting , and seems to be different from any kind of horror series there is ( there is some similarity from Damien , but it's better ). I guess this series is inspired by that Conjuring movie. <br/><br/>Then again, it's only the first episode so there's nothing much I can say about Outcast. It's worth a shot.

147,Outcast, Nice look onto the malady of the otherworldly kind,"Upon looking at Outcast there's an identifiable mix of horror movie and TV show ambiance. It dabbles in possession gig with adequate seriousness, even a gleeful amount of creepy spots, but there's a set up for continuous showing of horror as well. The protagonist is man of little faith and many tribulations, which give a more modest backdrop instead of usual exorcism glamour.<br/><br/>First and foremost, it manages to present terror or at least compelling enough scenes to hook audience. The atmosphere might be quaint and done with nice cinematography, but this actually works as contrast for some of its unsuspecting creepy sequences. Kyle Barnes (Patrick Fugit) is a man who has experienced abuse, be it may physical or paranormal. He's utterly conflicted, although his wish to help can be appealing.<br/><br/>The set-up might work in different case for each episode, with Reverend Anderson(Philip Glenister) as the unusual side kick. Alas, it could be a case of the week shtick,, but Outcast has a very weighty tone to the production that it resembles horror blockbuster than a series, even though the rural setting is not that grand.<br/><br/>For a weekly dive into horror, Outcast is looking appetizing with brilliantly bleak atmosphere and broken character seeking respite.",26 out of 41 found this helpful.,7.0,24 May 2016

I hope that we will get more gory scenes in season two, even though it is not absolutely necessary for this show to survive. The filming and the soundtrack are perfect. It's all very dark and gives you an uncomfortable feeling. Patrick Fugit does a great job playing the outcast Kyle Barnes. Even at the end of the first season you still have a lot of questions unanswered and it can only be good for the next season. Reverend Anderson played by Philip Glenister also fits perfectly in the story. Evil against good, or is it totally different?

Season 1 was Great though Season 2 has a few bumps along the way, but season 2 is still worth watching. I don't know why Season 2 took so long to debut in the U.S. I hope the delay doesn't hurt viewership ratings on Cinemax. Hopefully season 3 can start production in the latter half of 2018 or 2019. I would recommend this show for anyone who likes the horror/graphic novel genre and doesn't want to be bothered by commercials or cut scenes b/c they may be too intense or bloody for the weak at heart.

It is so different from a routine plot. The other thing that makes Outcast great is the excellent acting. Patrick Fugit gives an outstanding performance as the lead character. His laid back attitude and slow charismatic pace makes him so believable as an undeserved outcast. You feel sorry for him and yet often feel like him in everyday life. The reverend who becomes his side kick is also an excellent actor and it is hard not to think he is very weird. I just hope Outcast does well in the ratings, because this series deserves it.

168,How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord, How Not to Summon a Demon Lord,"Sakamoto Takuma spends his days playing a computer game; he has got to such a level that fellow players call him 'Demon Lord'. Then one day he finds himself summoned into a world very similar to the world of the game. In this world he appears as his game avatar and has all the powers from the game. He was summoned by two girls who immediately cast an enslavement spell on him... unfortunately for them he has the skill 'Magic Reflect' so end up his slaves. The girls are Shera, a busty elf, and Rem, a petite pantherian. The trio soon get into a series of adventures and The Demon Lord is soon defeating everybody he faces; of course they gradually face tougher foes until they find the real Demon King and must battle to save the mortal races.<br/><br/>The idea of a character somehow being caught in world that is either an actual video game or just like one is hardly original but that doesn't matter as this series is quite fun. The fact that Sakamoto is ridiculously overpowered compared to most people he fights provides some laughs. The story is simple enough but, thanks to the likeable characters, it is a rather enjoyable. There is quite a lot of fan service which might bother some viewers even though, at least in the broadcast version, we don't see too much. The series comes to a solid conclusion which wraps up most plot details in an enjoyable way.

This is probably also due to my love of overpowered characters.<br/><br/>It's bad in the sense that except for the main character you can only see ecchi lolis throwing themselves at the Demon Lord. This is not creativity, it's very questionable softporn.....so basically what all teenage boys watching it long for.
If I am completely honest, this anime would probably even be better without any nudity at all and adult women.

170,How NOT to Summon a Demon Lord, Great anime for GUYS and women who haven't been indoctrinated by liberal propaganda.,"Love, love, LOVE this anime! Great story, cool characters, and Diablo is a bada**! I've read some criticism that he is overpowered, but it seems they missed the whole point of the story... he's suppose to be overpowered. The protagonist is a shy guy who plays video games to escape the world around him (typical anime story), he is very antisocial and hasn't had a relationship with a woman before. All the sudden he is transported into the game he has mastered and granted all the power of his character. The two beautiful girls who summoned him are in need of his help, and of course you find out why as the story progresses. His two personalities are constantly coming to grips with how to behave in this fantasy world. For instance, at times he's reluctant to be aggressive with his companions, but then his avatar will take over and force him into action. This dynamic works well with the racier parts of the show because his avatar has a ""take what I want"" mindset, yet he is very timid and shy. What's great about this anime (and most Japanese anime in general) is that it's made for an adult audience and they don't shy away from adult themes (the East is more comfortable with sex than the west these days), and best of all they can write a great story without referencing the political climate (looking at you Hollywood). Thankfully, Japan seems to understand viewers watch TV shows, movies, and play games to get away from the real world, not be reminded of it.",15 out of 26 found this helpful.,10.0,6 September 2018

187,"Doogie Howser, M.D.", Interesting and unique show that quickly flat-lined,"When it first came out, ""Doogie Howser M.D."" was one of the more unique shows to grace the airwaves. It centered around a 16-year old child prodigy, Douglas ""Doogie"" Howser, who was a doctor at a Los Angeles area hospital. He lived with his parents and had a girlfriend, Wanda, and an obnoxious best friend who often came into his house via a window. Each episode ended with Doogie typing up an entry in his personal computer diary. The entry was usually a wise proverb from a lesson learned in the episode.<br/><br/>The show was developed by Steven Bochco who created ground-breaking shows like ""L.A. Law"" and ""Hill Street Blues"". Although not nearly as acclaimed as those two shows (the only Emmy awards it was nominated for were for Sound Mixing and Cinematography), it had a satisfying blend of comedy and drama that kept the show interesting but not too serious. Since the two main characters were both teenagers, this lead many people to dismiss it as a kid's show. However, it was much deeper than a kid's show as most of the episodes centered on adult themes such as AIDS, death, and racism. The acting was also very solid. Long before he gained recognition for the show ""How I Met Your Mother"", I always felt that Neil Patrick Harris was a very underrated actor. Very few teenage actors could have pulled off playing a child prodigy the way he did. It would be hard to imagine anyone else playing the Doogie Howser role.<br/><br/>The first and second season were terrific as they focused around Doogie's struggles to be a normal teenager despite the demands of his job. A common theme was discrimination as he was often discriminated based on his age by patients and even other doctors. He was not afraid, though, to express his views, even if it meant clashing with more seasoned and respected doctors. By the third or fourth season, the show had lost some of its novelty as Doogie was no longer a child prodigy but just a very smart adult. This must have really made it hard for the writers to come up with interesting story lines and it showed. The show began to focus more on Doogie's personal life and Vinnie quirky adventures and less on the hospital. By this time, Doogie had moved out of his parent's house to live in an apartment which meant that less time was devoted to his parents who were an integral part of the show. The ratings declined and a show that seemed like it would be on the air for many years was canceled after only four.",20 out of 24 found this helpful.,8.0,23 March 2008
188,"Doogie Howser, M.D.", anyone born in the 70's probably has pretty fond memories of the show.,"Doogie Howser has got to be one of the coolest shows of the 80's. Anyone born in the 70's probably has pretty fond memories of the show. As for me, I grew up watching the show and was a loyal viewer. Doogie was a show about a teenage kid who is a genius and finished school at an early age and became a doctor during his teen years. Most people would expect a guy like Doogie to be a nerd but this guy wasn't. He displayed a true side to himself, and while he had insecurities, his strengths easily outweighed them. In the show, he was a good friend, with a good heart and was in touch with his family who was pretty supportive of him. Basically, Doogie juggles his life as a doctor along with his social life and growing up as a teenager. He has a best friend named Vinnie and a girlfriend named Wanda played by Lisa Dean Ryan. Although Doogie doesn't have a clique like many teenagers, he trades in that part of being a teen for helping people as a doctor. Doogie is often found to go the extra mile in helping his patients or anyone in general. I remember one episode of Doogie, where Doogie is caught up in a convenience store robery; and Doogie ends up befriending the robber while held hostage, and ends up giving the robber a job at the hospital. This is truly a good show and is definitely a part of my childhood. I will always remember it fondly.",23 out of 30 found this helpful.,,15 April 1999

Memorable episodes include his first day, the late night skinny dip (as mentioned by another viewer), the practical joke he played on other hospital staff only to have it ruthlessly reciprocated, and the apartment with his best friend Vinny. There is some risqué humor but it is nothing when compared to today's standards. I always enjoyed seeing the relationship he had with his dad(James Sikking) and mom(Belinda Montgomery). I had the entire series recorded but sacrificed them for NFL games. BIG mistake!! Doogie Houser, MD will long be cherished by this now 40 something dad and his now 20 something daughters.

Plus, this program was one of Steven Bochco's creations, as in Steven Bochco, the man behind Hill Street Blues(which won something like, I don't know, 2,000 awards).  I'm surprised this last fact alone didn't get Doogie Howser more respect.  Oh, well.  If you get a chance,definitely check out the reruns.",25 out of 39 found this helpful.,,9 October 1999
191,"Doogie Howser, M.D."," A Good Show, but the novelty of the Child M.D. wore off quick","Sprung from the typewriter of Emmy award winning Steven Bocho, (Hill Street Blues, L.A. Law, NYPD Blue) ""Doogie Howser, M.D."" is a good show from the very late 80s and early 1990s. As you probably know the series is about 16 year old Douglas ""Doogie"" Howser, the boy genius who is a medical doctor. I just bought the DVD and this is the first time I've watched the series since it went off the air in 1993. I'm watching the 1989 episodes now, and surprisingly it doesn't seem all that dated. I mean sure it's dated in that you can tell it's from 1989, but it's not dated in that cheesy way. It's dated the same way Miami Vice is dated. When viewed through the lens of this show, the fashions and styles of that era seem simply more like something that's time has passed, rather then a horrible campy memory. Make no mistake though, this is no half hour sitcom with a laugh track. Steven Bocho went through great pains to make this an accurate, mature show with humorous elements in it rather then a screwball comedy. In the 1989 episodes Neil Patrick Harris is 16 years old, but he looks and acts like a 12 or 13 year old, 14 tops. Neil wasn't very emotionally mature for 16, and he had his this odd nerdy quality to him----which actually helped the series because it made Doogie seem even younger then he really was. But this was basically only the case for the 1st season.<br/><br/>The series wasn't without it's faults though, the show started going down the toilet when the child physician started sporting a 5 o'clock shadow. If I remember correctly, a big problem with the show was that ""the joke"" of the series, the child prodigy kid doctor who walked around in acid washed blue jeans, Nike high top sneakers and an over-sized lab coat wore off pretty quickly. After the 1st season Doogie was already a typical adult height of 5'6 to 5'8 inches tall. Sure he looked really young because he was a 17 year old teenager, but it wasn't too outrageous to see him in a hospital setting. But Doogie kept on growing unlike his best friend Vinnie Delpino. By 1992 and 1993 Neil Patrick Harris was a 19 and 20 year old grown man who was now standing around an amazing 6'4 inches tall. Doogie was no longer a cute kid trying to be a doctor, he now looked like any medical school student and there was nothing at all weird about him being a physician. By 1991, Doogie had turned into a legal 18 year old adult. He moved out of his parents house and into an apartment with Vinnie. They both started having regular sex. OK, so there goes the concept of the ""child prodigy"". After 2 years we were treated to watching an over 6ft guy and his friend living an apartment and dealing with older teenager/young adult problems. The premise behind Doogie was gone after 2 seasons, and truth be known it was on shaky ground by the 2nd season anyways.<br/><br/>Perhaps if they had started the series in 1987 when Neil was 14 it would have given the series more longevity. Or cast someone who was a little younger, like 14 or better yet 12 or 13 back in 1989. It really was a shame they didn't start Doogie off in the age range of 12-14 instead of 16. But otherwise, this is another well written series from the acclaimed TV writer Steven Bocho. The 1st and 2nd season are well worth checking out.",25 out of 40 found this helpful.,6.0,29 July 2006
192,"Doogie Howser, M.D.", Simply unbelievable.,"I only recently saw this show for the first time when Antenna TV started to show it in reruns. After a few times, I was eventually able to get past the opening theme song, which sounds a lot like a generic ring-tone on a cheap cell phone.<br/><br/>Once past that hurdle, I watched an episode. I thought at first, due to the raving reviews, that maybe it was just a bad episode. So I tried to watch it again.<br/><br/>I guess the problem for me is ""suspension of disbelief"" which is critical for enjoying any play, movie or TV show. I find it impossible to suspend disbelief and enjoy this show. First of all is the premise that some young skinny kid is accepted as a doctor in a hospital. It might be more believable if at least the patients were in disbelief, or at least pretended to be a bit surprised.<br/><br/>But even if that were the case, there's Max Casella playing the role of ""Vinnie Delpino"". I was born and raised in New Jersey. Maybe people that aren't from the area can buy into his extremely fake Italian-American accent, but when if you grew up here, you too would also be a little sickened by how extremely fake he sounds. Turns out, Max Casella is from Washington DC. So it's no wonder his accent sounds almost like a stereotyped mockery of New Jersey Italians.<br/><br/>For this reason alone, his ""Vinnie"" character is extremely annoying. And ""Vinnie""? Really? Why not go for the gold and use the name ""Antney""? I can see how the people who wrote and directed this abomination would completely miss the fact that ""Vinnie"" is like nails on a chalkboard every time he appears. They live in California and most likely think people from New Jersey actually say ""New Joisey"". Truth is, they don't. In fact, I've yet to meet somebody who says ""Fah get abowt it"". And so far the only person from New Jersey I know of that says ""How ya doin?"" is Wendy Williams.<br/><br/>Sorry to go against all the positive accolades of the other reviews, but this show is not unlike smelling fresh vomit in that it makes you want to vomit too.",13 out of 37 found this helpful.,1.0,25 March 2015

Parents always try and hold their kids back based on their own generational and society expectations from 30 years ago when they were kids. Parents have no damn clue how to raise kids in the current time period. Doogie would have better off on his own, but they just had to find a way to restrain him and make him some society expected kid who obeyed his parents and restrained his lifestyle even though he was wealthy and extremely capable of handling his own life.

206,The Secret Circle, The Secret Circle is a must-see!,"The Secret Circle is definitely a show that is worth your time. Don't judge it just because the central characters are teenagers, it doesn't only focus on them. Any adult who is into genre shows such as this, will find just as much enjoyment out of this show as anyone else. It has a promising Pilot that offers massive potential for the show, and trust me when I say this, the show does take advantage of that potential and is developing into quite an addictive and fun new TV series. The farther you get into it, the better it gets and the more compelling the characters and story become. Once you get passed the first three episodes, the fourth episode, ""Heather"" is really when the show catches its footing. It becomes darker, more mysterious, the pacing becomes faster and the show itself begins to develop into a really great series of its own.<br/><br/>The Secret Circle is a show where you can't make assumptions and think you're right, because the writers will end up spinning that assumption and giving you the unexpected. The show is compelling, it has a dark theme, plot-twists, there is mystery, romance, action, drama, horror, and of course the paranormal/supernatural elements of witches and magic.<br/><br/>Like I said, The Secret Circle is a must-see! After all, it isn't an official People's Choice Award nominee for nothing.",62 out of 87 found this helpful.,10.0,23 December 2011
207,The Secret Circle, Surprisingly Good!,"Not my normal television genre, my sister raved about Vampire Diaries and mentioned this show was from the same showrunner and from the same author's works, so I gave it a shot. Initially, I only knew about Britt Robertson, but I was delighted to see some stellar newcomers and veterans.<br/><br/>The show looks promising. It doesn't seem afraid to go dark when necessary, nor does it appear to rush into anything. The stars are agreeably pretty, but Thomas Dekker and Robertson seem able to anchor the youngsters. Thrilled to see Natasha Henstridge and can't wait to see what's in store for her.<br/><br/>If the show doesn't embrace the camp, if it goes for a fairly realistic portrayal of teenagers (unlike, say, Twilight), this could be a lot of fun to watch.

208,The Secret Circle, Definitely one to check out,"Great show - It keeps you interested, has a great story so far and definitely looks like it will be around for a while. I used to be a Smallville fan and I've just been searching for something that had some of that superpower supernatural stuff in it. This has delivered so far - I'm diggin it.<br/><br/>It's not dramatic just to be dramatic.. like some other CW shows - but this actually has meaning behind it since it's an interesting plot. The only potential downfall would be that they screw up the story, right now I say they have the right cast, they have the right crew, and they have the right writers.. but I've definitely seen it happen before.. the writing eventually takes a downfall..<br/><br/>For now.

210,The Secret Circle, The Secret Circle: Did Somebody Say WITCH?,"The Secret Circle follows Cassie Blake (Britt Robertson), the new girl in the town of Chance Harbor. Now living with her grandmother (Ashley Crow) due to the sudden death of her mom, she wonders why there are a lot of strange things happening around her. When 5 school kids take her to an isolated place in the woods, they explain that she is a witch, a revelation that leads to more questions than answers.<br/><br/>While watching the pilot episode, I understood why the show was able to break opening records in the CW network. The Secret Circle is a nice blend of supernatural drama and suspense, a formula that works given the Vampire Diaries' immense success. The characters are interesting enough to care about; the kids are central to the plot but the activities of the grown-ups get your attention as well.<br/><br/>When you have a new show, the one thing you absolutely need to do is get your audience hooked. The Secret Circle is able to do this well. Although nothing that will change your life happens in the premiere (a burning vehicle, magic-induced rain and a person drowning without even swimming) and at times it becomes slow in pace, the events put in place are exciting incentives for you to catch the next episode. Like Cassie, you would like to know what is really going on.<br/><br/>The show's presentation of magical powers is also refreshing. From my understanding, a witch needs to channel the energy inside her and concentrate so that she can alter the environment. Like in most things, there is strength in numbers. It's not as simple as a point-and-shoot type of ability but not as complicated as bloodletting (well, at least not yet). Even with a fantasy show, things have to remain grounded in reality to make it more believable. In terms of special effects, I am not yet completely sold. The forest scene was beautiful to look at but I think the storm could have been handled much better.<br/><br/>Britt Robertson is no stranger to this type of role, having starred in the CW's short-lived show Life Unexpected. She has this quality about her that makes her a strong female lead. Delicate and fierce at the same time, Cassie Blake is one girl you should not mess with. Thomas Dekker will be bringing fans from his previous shows Heroes and Terminator: the Sarah Connor Chronicles. Given his experience in playing various teen characters, his portrayal of Adam won't be a problem. Among all the kids, I like Faye (Phoebe Tonkin) the most. She's the type of bad girl you can't help but root for. I hope she is given more story and background in the succeeding episodes. With veteran actress Natasha Henstridge rounding up the cast, The Secret Circle is looking pretty solid acting-wise.<br/><br/>I realize now that the Secret Circle reminds me of Marvel Comics' The Runaways. The kids are on a path of self-discovery through their little group while the adults have their own plans for them. At the core, this show tackles being independent, growing up with these gifts, learning to control them, and dealing with the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>The Secret Circle is obviously targeted towards a young audience so it is almost certain that usual elements of teen romance and anxiety will be present. However, with witchcraft being at the center of it all, it will be enough to keep older viewers interested. Besides, I don't think there's enough of a cheese atmosphere here to repel a wider audience. If magic is your cup of tea, look no further. If not, then I advise you to still stick around. After all, the pilot gives enough to wet the appetite. When witches are involved, you just don't know what's going to happen next.",18 out of 25 found this helpful.,,18 September 2011

212,The Secret Circle, Pretty good and has potential,"The show started off quite simple and the story line was obviously just getting started, but after the first few episodes it's developed and now i can see that the show is going to get a lot better in time. I haven't read the books, but i know some things have changed (kind of like they did with The Vampire Diaries, making elena's character the opposite of who she is, bringing in new- non-existent character's and getting rid of some and changing loads of aspects of the story), but i can't help thinking they do this to make it more TV friendly. They do it to stretch it out and make it last longer, put their own twists and spins, making you're more eager to see the next episode to see if what you know should happen, does. I can say that The Secret Circle is a good show, it needs work, some of the actors aren't that great and are obviously just starting out. The thing that drew me to TSC was Phoebe Tonkins, the Australian actor from H2O: Just add water, and she is a brilliant part of the show. I love her character, she's full of surprises and she's a brilliant actor too. Cassie also shines a light on the show as well, i had seen her in 'life unexpected' and thought she was great in that. But anyway, the story line is developing so their's no point in shunning it until it's a good way into the series, and i just overall think it's pretty good.",22 out of 34 found this helpful.,,16 October 2011
213,The Secret Circle," Great start, but drags on","I liked this series when it started airing this fall, the story was good, and the actors did a good job. But as the show went on it got boring and just over complicated. I watched the first half of the series when it was airing on TV, but after the short winter break, I really had to put myself to watching it again, and after a few weeks I stopped watching it entirely. Still I wanted to find out how it was going to end and I put myself to watching the last ten episodes or so in more or less one sitting. The problems started rising just before the short winter break, when it began it was a show about witches, but like True Blood they made the mistake of throwing more mythical beings in the mix. And it somehow felt like they forgot certain plot lines, for a few episodes and then picking them back up later, making the continuity feel weird. So all things considered it was good at the start, but it lost momentum later on.",19 out of 29 found this helpful.,5.0,25 July 2012

It doesn't go full horror and dark when it's supposed to and Brittany seems to portray Cassie really good, I mean, she screams like she mean it and she makes it all believable. Along with the other cast of the circle, Phoebe seems to surprise among the audiences of her acting and Dekker and the other gang are awesome in the series.<br/><br/>It's definitely a great (witch) show, I'd recommend it and the plot's really appealing to the show and so as the cast.<br/><br/>So go ahead.

Whole concept of witchcraft is messed up and pretty much old story<br/><br/>Show has potential but it really needs to work up if it wants to achieve anything. They need to create something new, to write better lines, to actually create better chemistry between characters, to remove stupid 10s looks and a lots of other small things.

217,The Secret Circle, Mediocrity and plastic surgery,"Boring and mediocre. The only reason I keep watching this show is the lack of better programming (The Secret Circle may be so-so but is Ivy League compared to, say, Terra Nova).<br/><br/>First of all, the casting and acting are terrible. Britt Robertson (Cassie) seems to have had a lip job which has frozen her expression into a state of permanent puzzlement. She looks as if she says ""Oh!"" all the time. She is supposed to play an emotionally vulnerable teenager who has just lost her mother and is a loner (haha) but the only thing she does is pout and look puzzled.<br/><br/>Then we come to Thomas Dekker who looks... screamingly gay. Nothing bad about it, but for a guy who is supposed to be torn between two girls, this is not exactly the vibe you wanna give out. The worst thing is that he is actually much more suitable for Cassie's role than the lead actress.<br/><br/>And here I should praise Phoebe Tonkin (Faye) who is the only one who actually GETS her role right. She and Adam's Dad (can't remember the name of the actor) are the only ones who deserve distinction, the rest of the actors are just filler (sorry, guys).<br/><br/>Then, the plot. The only thing I remember from the first three episodes can be summarised in two short lines: Eager witches: ""Come on, let's bond the circle"". Model pretending to be a shy witch: ""Oh, I am too little for this, I have to pout with my new lips"".<br/><br/>So Cassie pouts and looks puzzled. Adam pouts and looks gay. There is a lip job and a couple of good-looking teens. There is a mystery. The good-looking teens get some new abilities. <br/><br/>Damn, teenagers will love the show;-)",29 out of 53 found this helpful.,4.0,7 October 2011
218,The Secret Circle, Not exactly what I expected...but not bad.,"I had high hopes for this series. I read the books when they were first published and I was in high school. They became some of my favorites and I read and re-read them many times. That being said, this show bares a very small resemblance to the books.<br/><br/>I expected the updating (cell phones, music, etc.), but much of the story has been changed. The premise (young girl moves to a new town and discovers that she is a witch and part of a coven of teenage witches whose power is growing and vulnerable) is the same. However, there is a lot more that is different than I expected. If you want to avoid spoilers, read no further, and know that if you have read the books, this show is very different.<br/><br/>Instead of New England, it is set in western Washington. Not that I have anything against this, I happen to live in a small WA island town myself, but much of the original story hinges around the historical treatment of witches (especially the ancestors of the main characters) and how it impacts the secrecy they live with.<br/><br/>Also, many of the characters are not in the show. This may be done in order to keep the mystery, but those who are fans of the Vampire Diaries (show and books), the Secret Circle doesn't seem to follow the books as closely in characters as the Vampire Diaries does. In the books, the coven is 12 young witches. In fact, Cassie's spot originally belonged to the younger sibling of two of the other members of the coven, but she is murdered to make room for Cassie (not by Cassie BTW). Much of this story line is left out of the show.<br/><br/>All of this aside, it is a fun teenage drama. I am a little leery of the Twilight-esque genre, but this one didn't quite seem as bad. Cassie is a much more sympathetic character (in my mind) than Bella is. Brit does a good job of portraying a young girl with power who has been thrown in the deep end of the pool and is doing her best to swim with the sharks.<br/><br/>I will keep watching to see where it goes. My advice is to watch the show with fresh eyes and pretend that you don't have any preconceptions about what the story is about or where it will go. Like I said, I loved these books as a teen and I hope that others will like the books and show as well.",10 out of 16 found this helpful.,,21 September 2011

I'm sure if the show aired a year later, it would've lasted at least three or four more seasons. Considering how awful ratings standards got afterwards, it's not such a stretch to imagine that. It's crazy how the 2009-2012 era of the CW network is filled with rushed decisions or good projects nipped in the bud. To think they decided to renew Hart of Dixie over this, is beyond me.

226,The Secret Circle, Bland and Unimaginative,"I grew up watching Teen dramas and I have always favored the supernatural/fantasy genre for its cinematography but more so for its character development. I like a performance that builds on a good plot, has engaging characters (comprehensible or not) and offers a good dish of intrigue.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Secret circle lacks a depth in its character development, plot delivery and sustaining the mystery. Most of the characters with exception of Adam (Thomas Dekker) and Faye (Phoebe Tonkin) who rise to the occasion with some believable performances, majority of the actors tend to be bland, not in tune with their characters and incredibly plastic. However, the adults do a phenomenal role in in-testifying the intrigue with such some strong performances by Faye's mother (Dawn) and Diana's Father (Charles) who play good quintessential antiheroes with a good mixture of villainy and concern for their children.<br/><br/>The main character Cassie (Britt Robertson) is seemingly casted for her looks than her ability to connect with her role (a vulnerable 16 year old who has discovered she is a witch and who recently lost a loving mother) and often comes on as a hang on just going through the motions.<br/><br/>As for the plot, the show is invariably unpaced with fast moving action on the first episode (lose, love triangles, coming into one's power,conspiracy) that leaves no room for a good build up and makes the rest of the episodes predictable. <br/><br/>Although deviating from the original book setting for the mystery, Chance harbor is beautiful, with a breathtaking waterline which offers a better contrast between a dreamlike place and the centerpiece of dark beginnings.<br/><br/>So I would definitely recommend that the writers work on building the characters and pacing the plot.",8 out of 15 found this helpful.,3.0,16 February 2012

229,Maverick, The Prime Directive,"I've heard Bret Maverick described as a ""coward"" and the show described as a western spoof that gets its humor from the cowardice of the hero. I think this is totally wrong.<br/><br/>A decade before Star Trek introduced its ""Prime Directive""- that they shouldn't interfere with the development of the civilizations they encounter, a rule they had to repeatedly break if there was to be any story, Bret Maverick was exercising his own ""Prime Directive"". All that advice from his ""Pappy"" adds up to one thing: mind your own business and if everyone else minds their own business, you'll be fine. When Maverick is at a gaming table, he's fine. He knows what's going on and can manipulate things to his advantage. When he gets involved in other things, he has the tread water just to keep up.<br/><br/>He's no coward. He can get angry and be aggressive, (especially in the early episodes, when Roy Huggins was still doing much of the writing). He just doesn't want his life to get too messy and would rather use his wits to resolve his problems rather than tactics that are likely to get somebody hurt. He saw too many people get hurt in the war and wasn't impressed.<br/><br/>But, as with ""The Prime Directive"", if Bret, (or Bart), was allowed to stick to this, there would be no story. So the writers had to come up with something to him involved in other people's business- or them in his.<br/><br/>The first option was to invoke rule #2: Bret doesn't let anybody cross him. If he gets cheated or conned, he will go far out of his way and bend all other rules, if necessary, to get what's coming to him and make sure the cheaters get what's coming to them. The second option was to introduce an attractive female- who may or may not be trustworthy and have her, intentionally or not, seduce Maverick into helping her solve her problems. Then, there's always money. Everybody has to bend rules when they are broke and a gambler frequently finds his luck running against him and will be willing to take a job- even a dangerous- one in such circumstances. Finally, there are occasions when, against his-and Pappy's better judgment, Maverick just has to do the right thing. These weaknesses and inconvenient strengths endear the character to the audience.<br/><br/>So does Maverick's generally sunny disposition. When he's minding his own business, he figures things will work out. Even when he's in trouble, he somehow always seems to figure he will get out of it somehow and takes temporary defeats in stride. Someone said that ""Maverick"" is ""The Rockford Files"" out west. Of course, ""Maverick"" came first. There are similarities. But Rockford is more world-weary, lest trustful of what the future may bring. A stretch in jail will do that do you. With him, avoiding complications is even more important. He does detective work because it's what he knows but he really just wants to make enough money to go fishing with his Pappy. Maverick stills see the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.",24 out of 24 found this helpful.,,7 August 2005

Garner definitely was NOT the whole show although he was obviously a world-class actor who was superior in his reaction to situations. The strength of the show was not with any particular actor- -it was in the writing. The writing was top-notch and clearly tongue- in-cheek. You don't see this type of writing in modern television programs. ""Maverick"" was the jewel of the crown of the great Warner Brothers westerns of the late 1950s.<br/><br/>Garner left in a contract dispute after the third season, but I have found the Kelly shows during the first three seasons and thereafter were just as good as any of the Garner episodes. I also enjoyed watching the Roger Moore episodes of the fourth season. When I was younger, I, like most of the reviewers, tended not to watch the episodes with Kelly and Moore and focused only on Garner. That was my loss, for these shows were consistently good no matter who the lead actor was.<br/><br/>I believe if you are going to review a television series that had rotating lead actors as this one had, you should watch the entire series, not pick out episodes because a particular actor is in it.",14 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,2 June 2014
232,Maverick," Classic Western, Intelligent Individualism; Roy Huggins' Masterwork","""Maverick"" ran for only five seasons. Early on, it was decided that the series would be best served by having two Mavericks, Bart, played by James Garner and Bret, played by Jack Kelly. By alternating the two leads, the productions for each's scripts could be shot at the same time. This led to the show's technical peculiarity. It had only one supervising producer and script supervisor, Roy Huggins, who was its creator; and he used four female assistants as script supervisors. Also, he employed 36 directors, 39 different writers, 17 cinematographers, 40 film editors, 8 art directors and 7 property masters all under Perry Ferguson as chief art director, 20 set decorators, 10 makeup personnel and 31 second-unit directors. This classic B/W show featured satires, dramas, adventures and comedies. It was inexpensively made sometimes, but offered attractive costumes and good actors, utilizing narration by the leads and clips from the Warner Brothers film library to avoid having to stage elaborate scenes. The Maverick brothers were designed by Roy Huggins to violate the Code of the West. While they could fight, and shoot, very bravely and effectively, they preferred not to fight, not to save people at great risk, not to do foolish things on a dare and not to keep up appearances. The show's creator also innovatively employed sidekicks for his leads, unusually frequently, and hired talented lead guest actors plus developing a stock company of continuing characters including Diane Brewster as larcenous and lovely Samantha Crawford, Kathleen Crowley as Melanie Blaine, Mike Road as Pearly Gates, Leo Gordon as Big Mike, and Gerald Mohr as Johnny Balero. Later, in 1960, Roger Moore played Beau Maverick, and Robert Colbert was added as cousin Brent in 1961, when Garner left the series. The leads played Texas men, a maverick being a name given to unbranded cattle in that part of the country. They gambled professionally, and continually sought after a large-enough prize to satisfy their hopes--which always eluded them somehow. Because of budgetary constraint, the writing and directing for the show were its hallmarks of quality, plus its fine guest stars. Memorable among these to me, who saw the original series, were Julie Adams, Mona Freeman, Buddy Ebsen, Abby Dalton, Ben Gage, Ruta Lee, Arthur Shields, Tol Avery, Gage Clark and many others. The ranks of the series' writers included TV stalwarts Ron Bishop, Carey Wilber, George Slavin, Gerald Drayson Adams, Wells Root, James O'Hanlon, Irene Winston, Marion Hargrove and Leo Townsend. The episode each week might be light-hearted or a dangerous mystery; frequently one Maverick or another sought a monetary prize at some risk or was cheated, kidnapped or involved in a hazardous business. Garner, with his touch for comedy, was usually given more laughs per hour. In his scripts; he fought, romanced, played cards, observed, commented and was misused. But the narrative lines of Jack Kelly's scripts were every bit as good or better, although he avoided the physical with more dexterity. The hallmark of the series I suggest was that it was about objectivists--purposive men who dealt with reality as they found it, without employing denial, wishful thinking or conventional or religious self-delusions. ""My 'ol Pappy used to say,"" one of the brothers would drawl, and then he would proceed to state the truth, setting wisdom against the usual way men looked at things. The show is was pure Roy Huggins; he employed noted directors and talented producers such as Coles Trapnell, William P. D'Angelo, Howie Horwitz, Arthur W. Silver, William L. Stuart plus fine actors to get the result he wanted. Without him, ""Maverick"" would not be the ""legend of the West"" it has become; along with ""Cheyenne"", ""Bonanza"" and ""Gunsmoke"", the program was a towering hit and a trend-setting show at a time when the character-based western was deservedly eclipsing all other genres. The series was adult,American and a delight, at a time when individualism was still a desirable philosophical goal to U.S. citizens and not a buzzword for its opponents to misuse while they attacked the concept. The man who lives by his own standards is only dangerous to the bad guys; the Maverick outsmarted the honest and cheated only criminals. They went ""riding the trail to who knows where"" as their theme song said, with luck as a companion and an intelligent gamble as their way of life. We loved them in 1957; we who enjoyed their adventures then miss them today. They and their self-assertive sort.",49 out of 58 found this helpful.,8.0,29 September 2005
233,Maverick, James Garner As 'Maverick' - Another Cool Guy In The Genre,"It's amazing how many ""cool"""" guys there were in the late '50s playing the heroes in television westerns. There was the ""king of cool"" Steve McQueen as ""Josh Randall"" in ""Wanted: Dead Or Alive,"" Richard Boone as ""Paladin"" in ""Have Gun, Will Travel,"" and more.<br/><br/>That more included James Garner as ""Maverick."" He was one of those guys the ladies thought was attractive and the men liked, too, a man's man and a ladies' man at the same, time. ""Brett Maverick"" was hip, cool under pressure, a fast-talker with quick wit, a great poker player, suave and sophisticated but physically tough if all else failed. However, he preferred to use his brains over his brawn. <br/><br/>Maverick's humor, I think, endeared him to the public the most of all his attributes. You can thank James Garner for that, because he was always funny in any movie role that asked for humor. He downgraded his acting ability, but we all know better. Garner made this a very, very popular show.<br/><br/>Eventually, brothers Bart and Beau were introduced in the series but I was disappointed if I saw Garner wasn't going to star that week.<br/><br/>It was appropriate he had a role in the 1990s movie starring Mel Gibson, who did Garner's character proud.<br/><br/>My hope is that some day individual Mavrick seasons will come out on DVD.",25 out of 29 found this helpful.,9.0,10 April 2007
234,Maverick, Launching a great career,"I still remember as a lad when Maverick made its debut on the ABC network. It was on Sunday nights at 7:30 and with that early half an hour start, it knocked the stuffings out of Ed Sullivan and Steve Allen who had their shows begin at 8:00 in the Nielsen ratings.<br/><br/>Maverick was unlike any western that had been on television before. Previously you had heroes stand tall and tangle with villainy head on. Maverick was no coward, but he never went looking for trouble and he never would look for a face to face confrontation if a little back channel maneuvering would work as well. <br/><br/>The show started the precedent that Law and Order, Criminal Intent is using now to give star Vincent Donofrio some rest with having Chris Noth and another female partner solve crimes on alternate weekends. James Garner was the original Bret Maverick and later Jack Kelly was brought in as brother Bart. Later on we had cousin Beau and another brother Brent played by Roger Moore and Robert Colbert. <br/><br/>Those last two we never even see the episodes with them. James Garner wanted a feature film career and Maverick helped launch him in one. His best efforts have always been when he's played a variation on Maverick and that would include his later hit series, The Rockford Files. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Jack Kelly never got the same break as Garner. But Bart was also pretty good at thinking on his feet as well. Still he was good performer and the Bart episodes do hold their own. And the shows they did together, pure magic.",11 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,17 January 2006
235,Maverick, One of the best westerns ever,"Maverick was not only one of the greatest westerns ever, it was one of the greatest TV shows ever. It had just the right combination of action, adventure, comedy, and drama. It is a series that would do well in any generation. You could make a case for Bret being TV's first anti-hero. He admits to being a coward, he pulls scams, he gambles, and he loves money. However, when the situation calls for it, he will step up and do the right thing. Plus, most of the people he scams are people who are scam artists themselves. This is James Garner's signature role, and it is just amazing to watch how good his performances are. He is just so charismatic that you can't help, but root for him. Contrary to what some might have you believe, the series was not just about Bret. Along the way he is joined by his brother Bart, played by the very talented and under-appreciated Jack Kelly. It is amazing, because Kelly's appearance was only supposed to be a one-shot deal, but he and Garner had so much chemistry that they decided to keep him on as a regular. My favorite episodes are the ones that feature both Bret and Bart. After Garner left the series in 1960, Kelly did a great job of keeping the Maverick brand going for two more years. While Bret had his fair share of female companions, Bart was more of the ladies' man. It was actually kind of funny just to see how easily he would fall in love. After Bret left, then came cousin Beau, played by future 007, Roger Moore. This must of been one of his first big roles in America. Although, he was only there for one season (15 episodes), Beau proved himself to be worthy of carrying on the Maverick tradition. There ended up being a third Maverick brother, Brent, played by Robert Colbert. However, he only lasted two episodes, and I truthfully didn't think much of him. To me, he just did not have the charm and charisma that Bret, Bart, and Beau displayed. If you have Encore Westerns, it is something definitely worth checking out.",10 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,23 May 2009
236,Maverick, Winning the West with a Grin and a Pair of Aces,"My old pappy says this is a signature series of the 50's that lives up to its name. It took the producers time to figure out that gold lay not in the direction other Westerns were taking, but in an untraveled direction. In 1958, a Western with a comedic format was still a foreign concept since it was hard to build up to a gunfight with belly laughs. Of course, the matinée cowboys (Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, et al.) included a side-kick for comic relief, but the lead cowboy was always the truest and the fastest on the block. Probably no movie genre stuck more closely to formula than the American Western. That is, until Maverick. Nonetheless, the signature tongue-in-cheek took time to evolve; like a strong friendship, it didn't suddenly spring forth with the first installment. <br/><br/>By my reckoning, the first 30 or so entries had parts that looked like any other Western of the day, ie. gunplay, fist-fights, etc, and it wasn't until episode # 37 ""Shady Deal at Sunny Acres"" that we got 60 minutes of pure Maverick. Here it was a battle of wits from beginning to end with sly running gags, colorful characters, and nary a drop of blood in sight. It's at this point that the series discovered itself, and likely the audience discovered a very different kind of Western.<br/><br/>The biggest problem the series had was keeping lead actor James Garner from jumping ship into the better-paying world of movies. Likely, it was Garner's exceptional comedic skills that moved the series in a humorous direction in the first place. He had such an obvious flair that I think the format came to fit him rather than vice-versa. But TV had a reputation of ""using up"" actors before casting them aside. So, it's understandable that Garner would use his new leverage to negotiate into the more stable environment of film. But that created cast problems for the producers. The series was pretty much identified with Garner's Bret character. Jack Kelly was an able second banana, but lacked the skills to carry the show. Thus the lead casting bounced around some, depending on Garner's availability. As a result, we came to find that the Maverick family has a number of off-shoots, including Beau (a smooth Roger Moore) and Brent (a rather inept Robert Colbert). <br/><br/>Often overlooked is how well the series tapped into a neglected aspect of Americana. During the Cold War Americans were told the Soviets had a popular advantage, because their national game was chess, a highly cerebral contest of move and counter-move that requires great concentration and sometimes hours to complete. Aside from prodigy Bobby Fischer, the US produced few chess players of note. No, our national game is not the prestigious pursuit of chess, but a case can be made for America's love for good old plain-faced poker. Thousands of neighborhoods enjoy a low-stakes version, as well as the high-stakes casino variety. Surprisingly poker turns up rarely on the screen, perhaps because it's a game of chance associated with gambling, an activity condemned by many. Now chance does play a role in poker, otherwise known as ""the luck of the draw"". But knowing how to play your cards requires real skill, and just as importantly, being able to ""read"" your opponent.<br/><br/>Note in Maverick how many pearls of wisdom are drawn not only from dear old Pappy, but from how to play a good hand of poker. I think people enjoyed hearing pearls like ""never draw to an inside straight, except..."", especially when combined with the usual Maverick dose of wry good humor. So how surprising is it that millions of amateur players tuned in weekly to see their game legitimized on the screen and maybe pick up a few pointers at the same time. <br/><br/>It wasn't all aces, of course, especially in regard to production values. After all, the show was, like most of the day, modestly budgeted. Going into the wide open spaces usually meant crossing the tree line from the Warner Bros. sound stages to the backlot and moving around some of the many fake boulders. But that was okay since the show's appeal wasn't authenticity or scenery. What wasn't okay, in my book at least, was the sloppy matching of stock shots with the backlot footage. Thus, we'd get a shot of someone riding across backlot trees and foliage and the next progression shot of him riding across the barren red rock country of Arizona! Maybe that happens on Mars, but not on planet Earth. I could understand this lack of continuity from an independent production, but not from a big-time studio like Warner Bros.<br/><br/>The show never relied on big-name stars or celebrities to boost its appeal, unlike, say, the popular Wagon Train or Bonanza. That meant, for one, that the scripts had to be unusually good. The writers could not rely on stock situations to drive the plot once the format shifted from melodrama to sly tongue-in-cheek. But now, the screenplays had to come up with contests where the Maverick boys could outwit opponents and generate some laughs at the same time. Scriptwriters didn't always succeed, but when they did, the result was unlike anything else at the time. In fact, if memory serves, ABC even scheduled the show opposite CBS's perennial Sunday evening blockbuster, The Ed Sullivan Show. Pretty fast company for an hour that started off as just another Western.<br/><br/>All in all, however, I think the best measure is that over the years, ""Maverick"" managed to dig not only a small niche into popular consciousness, but also into the traditional fund of American folklore. Even people who've never seen the show think ""sly poker player"" when they hear the name. I guess the producers knew how to play the game, after all.<br/><br/>(See my review of ""A Fellow's Brother"", episode 11, season 3, for discussion of the series' slyly subversive content.)",15 out of 19 found this helpful.,,31 August 2008
237,Maverick, James Garner and Jack Kelly had a sensational chemistry and Garner's performance is quite different than most think.,"James Garner's acting on 1957's TV series ""Maverick"" is superbly inspired but usually underrated because he memorably told the press at the time that he ""can't act. I'll learn if I have to, but so far I haven't had to."" This modest refusal to champion himself publicly resulted in his performances being taken much more for granted, but viewed today, it's apparent that here was a world-class talent throwing himself into every scene, registering a virtual three-ring circus of facial expressions; there is always something going on to look at, in severe contrast to most of the other TV western leads of the era.  Jack Kelly, normally a more pedestrian performer, lights up to incandescence in his scenes with Garner and their astonishing chemistry vaults the series' fantastic entertainment value phenomenally, although Kelly's solo outings aren't in the same league and his acting seemed to deteriorate along with the quality of some of the scripts in the wake of Garner's departure.  Kelly was completely and utterly lacking Garner's genius for comedy, except when working directly with Garner.<br/><br/>I always thought of Garner's character's warmth as being his hallmark trait, perhaps as a result of years of seeing ""The Rockford Files,"" but upon recently studying the ""Maverick"" tapes it became apparent that his character was basically cool and chilly, almost businesslike with an Indiana Jones-like seriousness in his routine comportment, but quite warm with friends.  This surprised me.  When people refer to Bret Maverick as ""cool,"" they're actually much more correct than I ever would've assumed.",17 out of 23 found this helpful.,,23 June 1999
238,Maverick, The Western Version Of The Rockford Files.......,"This was one of the best TV Westerns to come out of the golden age of the 1950's television. For the five seasons that it ran on the ABC-TV network from 1957 to the final episode in early 1962,""Maverick"" was in a class by itself especially with the performance given by James Garner as the suave and sophisticated man of the West-Bret Maverick,a gambler,all-around gentlemen with the ladies,and a man who was quick with a gun when it came to handling difficult situations. In some of the episodes,some of the situation that Maverick would get into and sometimes he would get out of them as well would be set toward his facial expressions;a virtual three-ring circus of sorts was something to look at,even though that was a Western,but a TV western that was aimed at adult audiences,but kids were watching it too. But ""Maverick"" had something that the other Westerns lacked-a flair for comedy,and during James Garner's tenture,his genius for comedy was inspirational not to mention having his character become a rather ""cool"" for taking care of business situations while at the same time,having a serious like businessman approach. This would work well during James Garner's second TV series-""The Rockford Files"",years later. After Garner's departure,the solo outings from various actors,would prove that when watching them,you can see just how good ""Maverick"" really was. However,the other actors,including Jack Kelly as Bret's brother Bart along with Robert Colbert(as Brent Maverick),and their British cousin Beau Maverick(played by Roger Moore)including others that would make their stride including Richard Long and Efrem Zimbalist,Jr. during the show's five year-run. This was a string of TV Westerns that ABC-TV and Warner Bors. cranked out including ""Cheyenne"",""Sugarfoot"",and the Western adventure,""The Alaskans"" during the early years of television.<br/><br/>During the 1950's and part of the early 1960's,there were mainly several types of shows;you had the regular quiz show/game show concept, family oriented comedies,crime dramas,action-adventure fare,and westerns. During its run,Maverick brutally satirized two of the most popular Westerns of their day;Gunsmoke and Bonanza,in different episodes,not to mention it also satirized another show too;Wagon Train, which was in another episode.

240,Maverick, A Great Series Because of both Garner AND Kelly,"Although I grew up watching classic television I somehow completely missed Maverick until 2015. Thus while Maverick is an older series it was very new to me. I suppose that is the wonderful thing to realize that there are still great series out there to discover.<br/><br/>I started to watch Maverick specifically because of James Garner. I had recently re-watched the Great Escape (a favorite film of mine) and wanted to see more from Garner. Garner is absolutely wonderful here in his first starring role and it's no surprise that he had a long and very rich career.<br/><br/>However a real surprise for me was Jack Kelly. Before Maverick I had absolutely no idea who Jack Kelly was which is not surprising because while he did a lot of small roles and guest spots, Maverick was definitely the highlight of his career. I am also happy I went into Maverick blind and did not read the many grossly inaccurate reviews that Garner was all there was to Maverick. You will notice that most people who say Kelly did not measure up to Garner admit they ""skip the Kelly episodes"". Another trend I notice that those who do give Kelly the most credit say they have reevaluated Kelly as an adult and realize they underrated him.<br/><br/>Pretty much with the first 3 seasons whether you watch a Kelly or Garner episode you can't lose. Garner tended to have the best comedy and Western parody scripts while Kelly got the better dramatic and drawing room comedy scripts. It was the contrast between Kelly &amp; Garner that made the series so great along with well written scripts that still stand up as classics today. However the very best episodes had Garner and Kelly together, their chemistry was pure magic and one of the shows biggest mistakes was not giving us more episodes with them together.<br/><br/>Seasons 4 and 5 aren't bad but they definitely don't measure up to the previous 3 seasons (the best of which is season 2). Not only because you have lost Garner at that point but Roy Huggins the producer and creator of the series left at the end of season 2. Most of the best writers also left with him.<br/><br/>For a short time Roger Moore joined the series as cousin Beau. Moore put up a good effort despite weaker scripts but the series would never be the same without Garner. Although if my previous paragraphs were not clear I feel if Kelly had been the one to leave the show he also would have left an irreplaceable hole. Garner of course started the series without Kelly but in those very early episodes the show was still finding itself and is also not the best Maverick has to offer.<br/><br/>However even at its worst, Maverick is still pretty entertaining if not as clever and witty as it once was. You only notice the decline in the later seasons when you have just finished watching the superior earlier seasons.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,6 April 2015
241,Maverick," Wandering the Old West, Livin' on Jacks &amp; Queens and on Nielsen Ratings that were beating both ED SULLIVAN (CBS) and STEVE ALLEN (NBC), for a while, anyway!","When Commercial Television raised its head on the scene following the successful conclusion of WORLD WAR II, the Hollywood Studio Moguls seemed to be Hell Bent on the notion of steering clear of the small screen. And, why if we didn't know better, you'd think that there was some sort of conspiracy in force, attempting to stunt the growth, if not kill the hatch-ling Networks.<br/><br/>Well we all know that this could not be. Afterr all, that would be an unlawful business practice, a violation of Anti-Trust Laws. No one here would enter into a pact with those like minded in the ""Business' to manipulate the market place so as to give it an unfavourable climate for another entry's conduct of business. This would be a sort of Cartel of Motion Picture Studios.<br/><br/>They did not want their ""Stars"" to be appearing even as Guest Stars on the small Screened Picture Tube, either* It was an appearance by Humphrey Bogart (Old ""Bogey"", Himself!) as Guest on ""THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM"" that seemed to break down the opposition and start the little flow, which would soon be a deluge of Prominent and Currently Popular Film Stars to appear on various Variety and Anthology Comedy and Dramatic shows on the ""Tube"".<br/><br/>So then came the changes, slowly at first, but decisively and for keeps. At first there the ""Big Studio"" Weekly Anthology Series. The key here was to present an hour long drama/comedy, often a shorter adaption of a successful Feasture Film. Much like Radio's Lux Hollywood THEATRE, the presentation of the story was newly filmed, but shorter, abridged version, often having changes initiated out of pure necessity.<br/><br/>This 'Anthology' business had worked quite well for Mr. Walt Disney with his ""DISNEYLAND"" being shown weekly on ABC TV. It was used to show original programming as well as older Theatrical Releases. Walt also used any opportunity to present ""behind the scenes"" that, also, served as an excellent promotional instrument.<br/><br/>Before long we had ""WARNER BROTHERS PRESENTS""' THE 20th CENTURY-FOX HOUR"" and ""THE MGM PARADE"". All three functioned just the same way, and did so well.<br/><br/>The next step was to series TV, and Westerns were tops! Warners gave us ""CHEYENNE"", ""COLT .45"", ""LAWMAN"", ""BRONCO"", ""SUGARFOOT"", ""THE ALASKANS"" and of course, ""MAVERICK"".<br/><br/>Of them all, ""MAVERICK"" proved to be the most entertainingly fresh and the most beloved to the viewers, right down to the present. It really had a simple formula at its foundation. It followed the exploits of two brothers, Bret Maverick (James Garner) and Bart Maverick (Jack Kelly). They were not Cowboys or Gun Fighters and certainly not Pioneers, by any stretch of the imagination. They were soft-handed, manicured with clean finger nailed, GAMBLERS! You know, Card Sharks, Tin Horns! <br/><br/>As their Surname would imply and the great Series Theme Song states, they were out there in the West, playing Poker for a living and thus getting themselves into all sorts of situations, Each week it would a different story,with Bret one week the next being Bart's turn. Occasionally a show would team-up the two brothers, then a more complex Story would be the order of the day. There were even some two parters, that were continued to the next week, but not often.<br/><br/>""MAVERICK"" enjoyed a lot of Humor, Parody and even some Satire on their weekly play book. And that probably explains why the programs seem much better to this writer when viewed again today, nearly a half a century after their original run.<br/><br/>After several seasons, James Garner walked away from the series, but the the Brfain Trust at Warners TV had an answer. They ""imported"" an English Couisin. Roger Moore came on board as Cousin Beau Maverick.<br/><br/>Finally in its last season, Robert Colbert was introduced as Brent Maverick, yet another brother.<br/><br/>The series made good use of recurring little bits, that they would go back to every once in a while. For one, James Garner would portray their ""Pappy"", Beau Maverick. He did an excellent job at it, much like Hal Holbrook's MARK TWAIN one man show, albeit in a more comical impersonation.<br/><br/>Also they used recurring characters like ""Dandy Jim"" Buckley (Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.) and ""Gentleman Jack"" Darby (Richard Long)were a couple of grifters who the Maverick boys tried to avoid, to no success. One of their best shows had both con-men, as well as some others from previous stories in an episode that involved a'Big Con', which was very much like Universal Pictures' THE STING(1973), the Theatrical Film with Paul Newman &amp; Robert Redford.<br/><br/>NOTE * Quite to the contrary, the Big Studio Brass never seemed to feel the same way the use of Network Radio Shows in helping promote their Pictures by allowing (or even requiring)their Contract Players to appear there. Which means that there would always be an announcement something like ""....Be sure to see (STAR's NAME ) in the current (STUDIO's NAME)production of (MOVIE's TITLE), now at your Local theatre!""",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,7 October 2007

It took charisma and a smile and a wink to make this work. All the series stars fit the bill.<br/><br/>The scripts for this were well written and allowed the cast to hone their acting for later efforts. Sometimes the show was too good. This show is a logical prelude to The Wild Wild West too though the stunt work on this series and the action stuff was quite a bit tamer here.<br/><br/>The theme song and the animation figures in the opening credits drew in viewers for over 5 years.

True, the series went into decline, once Garner departed, and yes, the early Garner-free episodes weren't necessarily as good, but production values and an emphasis on comedy and mystery kept the show fresh, for much of its run. <br/><br/>One of the more interesting aspects of the show was its willingness to avoid violence when it could rely on wit, humor and deception to move a story along. Maverick's ability to satirize and poke fun at such iconic shows as Bonanza and Gun smoke is a testament to the creative juices flowing through its production and writing staff. <br/><br/>In short, to miss out on the early season is to deprive oneself of one of the great Western comedies of all time.

Sad to say, but I have gotten older and depend on the closed captions for watching the show since my hearing has long ago mostly left me. I was wondering why some of the shows have closed captions and some do not. Maverick is one of the very few shows left that is not filled with smut. Children can watch this show and not be exposed to the filth that is so common, even in cartoons, these days. I hope more old shows will be rerun. Parents would't have to block so much TV if the old ones came back. I would certainly watch them all, (that is if they have closed caption). I am hoping this will be on all the episodes of Maverick soon. Thank you, Lowell Garland",1 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,9 October 2008

Anytime Martin goes nuts over something he starts making all these weird faces and starts jumping and running around, and it's incredibly, ridiculously funny, and it seems to happen nearly every episode.

250,Martin, Quite simply the funniest show on TV,"""Martin"" was my favorite show in the '90s and it still is my favorite show today. I set my VCR everyday to record the episodes that are rerun on USA network. Bill Cosby once called this show a ""modern day minstrel"" and yet I'm still waiting to see ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" reruns on Cartoon Network, maybe Mr. Cosby won't allow them to be shown because it would eat at his own guilty conscience. Martin is a comedic genius and the other characters, Gina, Pam, Tommy and Cole contrasted well with his over-the-top style, usually ending up the butts of his jokes. Although at some times Martin would come across as crass and surly, by the end of the show his generosity and warm heart would shine through. Long before Eddie Murphy in ""The Nutty Professor"", Martin mastered playing multiple characters. From Sheneneh to Mama Payne, Roscoe the snot nosed kid, Otis the security guard, Dragonfly Jones, Elroy the mechanic, white boy Bob and who could forget Jerome ""the playa from the Himalayas"", Martin amazingly portrayed every different character with their own unique personalities. Some of the funniest moments ever in my opinion came during Martin's interaction with the old lady, Miss Jerri, or Hustle Man (Tracy Morgan at his funniest) and of course you can't forget his occasional visit from Bruh Man from the ""fiff flo"". If loving this show is wrong, then I don't wanna be right. So, to Bill Cosby and all the other bougie black folks that dissed this show, I'll tell you like Eddie Murphy said in ""Raw"", shut the f*** up and have a Coke and a smile!",37 out of 46 found this helpful.,,20 December 2002

253,Martin, One of the best sitcoms ever,"""Martin"" is one of the best television shows of all time.  It is by far the funniest black sitcom ever created, far surpassing breakthrough shows like ""The Jeffersons"" and ""Good Times"".  The 70's sitcom ""What's Happening!!"" is the only other show that comes close.  When you watch a comedy show, it is common to smile, chuckle or laugh - but when you watch ""Martin"", particularly the first two to three seasons, you find yourself laughing so hard it hurts.  This is a laugh out loud and stomp your feet show thanks to a brilliant comic talent - Martin Lawrence.  Many people who I have talked to about this show have said they ""don't get it"" and that the rapid fire urban cultural references fly over their heads.  I say, exactly.  This show is clever and sharp and if you actually laugh at crap like ""Will &amp; Grace"", you won't ""get"" this show either. Unlike every other pale, bland humored show out there, ""Martin"" is full flavored, knock you on your ass funny.

257,Martin, Better than 'Friends' and 'Seinfeld'!,"My oh my, where do I begin? It's just a real shame that this show never won any kind of Golden Globe or for that matter any kind of acknowledgment from mainstream Hollywood for the work that Martin did on this show. In case you've never seen Martin its about a rude, comical radio disk jokey (Martin Payne) who lives in a modest apartment in Detroit. He has his boys of course: the misogynist dingbat (Cole Brown) and the sensible (Tommy Strawn). Then there's the light of his life (Gina Waters) whose a boogie business woman who somehow finds Martin as irresistible as he does her. And then there's her partner in crime (Pamela James) whose a tough as nails sort of man-hater (especially when it comes to Martin). But the best thing about 'Martin' I would have to say is the all the multiple characters that he played, which I don't think has ever been done consistently by anybody on TV except Flip Wilson. Everybody gave great comedic performances though on here, and yes even apple head, I mean Tisha Campbell was good too. And the writing for each episode was also on point. '92-'95 I'd have to say were probably the golden years of 'Martin', but then between the forth and the final fifth season the show was clearly in trouble. Martin's personal life was attracting more attention than the show, and then came the rumors that he was sexually harassing Campbell. She left the show towards the last season and as a viewer you could see that there was definitely something lacking. I know I lost interest but tuned in for the final episode which was ridiculous because Gina and Martin were never in any scenes together. Like every series finale the Paynes moved to California and left 42 (that's the apt. #). But still 'Martin' has remained on the tube thanks to reruns and we can understand once again why this show had it all. **** all the way.

258,Martin, I don't care what they say....Martin was the M-A-N!!!!,"Despite of what some people may say about this series,let me say that this was show was in fact the most watched show on Thursday nights when it ran for five astounding seasons on FOX(from 1992-97). This sitcom was at the height of its time,going up against the grain with other shows of the 90's that including ""Living Single"",""In Living Color"",""Roc"" and the urban crime drama ""New York Undercover"" as well as the medical show,""ER""(which was on a rival network). Martin in the first two seasons was a radio personality who had his own talk show and was living with his girlfriend Gina(whom later on in the series would get married played by Tisha Campbell),and sometimes hang out with his boys Tommy and Cole and ALWAYS would make sly remarks and putdowns on everybody who stepped up to him in the wrong way and most of the time would insult Gina's best friend Pam. What made that show stand out was the comedical timing and hilarious hijinks between Pam and Martin in which he would put her down and she would get right back at him;in other words Martin Lawrence and Techina Arnold made the show what it was and sometimes it would have me laughing hard and crying at the same time,but there were times when Martin would be some very sticky situations but he always manages to get himself out of them. From the characters that Martin played which included Jerome,Snotty nose kid, Mama Payne,and Sheneaah you never know what to expect. One very hilarious show. Thank God that USA Network shows it in repeats twice a day(and in some markets three to four times a day including weekends on some stations)and to me it was one funny laugh out loud riot.

On top of that, she had to give this big presentation at work so she tried to camouflage it with a big scarf and a big Diana Ross wig. It was so funny. The second is when they got married on the tropical beach. That was a dream wedding that included some of the ups and downs that would pop up before the actual wedding takes place.

278,Storage Wars, They literally do what they want whenever...,"... a core group of show bidders seemingly win 98% of all lockers. The tallying up of what is found is ludicrous! Whatever these people feel like saying stuff is worth. Rolls of T-paper I get $500 for those. Lately they stop adding up a locker as soon as something interesting pops out, with upwards of 90% of the rest of the unit not even looked at. This makes a lot of people suspect all the other stuff in the unit was a false front(200 boxes filled with air) However, I can remember when con man Barry allegedly bought a unit full of antiques and didn't go very far into the unit before he stopped appraising the value of stuff. But you could see a bunch of high end things he never bothered to mention.<br/><br/>It just happened again in the most recent episode with Daryl Sheets winning a locker full of gun stuff. They appraised about 4 boxes of stuff and you could see there was another 75 boxes! and then they acted like nothing was in the unit at the end of the show in the final tally except for a trap.<br/><br/>Is it faked? Most certainly. Are the appraisals legit? Most certainly not! They keep finding all this non antique stuff in used condition and then they go to some place that sort of deals with that item and they keep getting appraisals near the retail new price. It's ridiculous! On the same show a Re-pro coffee roaster was appraised for $500 that's literally hard to sell for $50. I thoroughly believe all these finds are ""product placements"" giving the show an excuse to go to showcase businesses that pay to be on the show! I'd like to point out something to viewers. There aren't big surprises in these storage auctions. Nobodies secretly driving a Maserati into one and the facility doesn't know its there! They have security cameras that they simply roll back when people default and then fast forward that particular camera.

279,Storage Wars," It's fake, we get it","Guys, calm down. It's a reality show, of course it's fake. Even though it's fake, it's extremely entertaining. You always want to see what they find, even though the producers planted it. How fun would it be if they didn't find anything in the lockers? It would be a bad show, like every other reality program that isn't fake. If you can even name one. Overall it's an enjoyable show, nothing too special, but i'd say it's worth your time. The producers did a great job of finding characters to appear in the show, for example: Barry, Jarod and Dave. It's always fun watching them bid, or even cheering a bit yourself in your living room.

Only entertainment is watching this guy Dave be a jackass. I would have love to have seen them stick it too him by letting the units go to him after he bids it up instead of overpaying for junk units. i gave up after 6 episodes.<br/><br/>I would advise anyone to watch Auction Hunters.

285,Storage Wars, Fallen Giant,"Two years ago I would say Storage Wars was my favourite TV show. The people in it- the junk- the unique items- Dan's distinctive auction style- everyone hated Dave- it was great. Yes its staged and scripted in parts but no-one cared. It was such a winning formula there have been numerous spin-offs and millionaires made in the process. However there is one key question- one big element to the show that can make or break it....are the lockers genuine or have they been tampered with pre-auction? Surely if items were placed in lockers for the show the show would be totally pointless, right? Well after Dave suggested that's how the show worked for me it was the final nail in the coffin. My thoughts before that were that they would film tons of auctions and only show the ones which had an interesting appraisable item in them. If it were to be the case where the appraisable item was actually planted in there- the show would have committed the cardinal sin- lying to the viewers about the whole point of the show. Dave is now back in Storage Wars- I assume to save it- and must have been given serious cash to do so, which he has said yuuup to. Its too late though. Even the biggest star and much copied format can't save it. My prediction: Storage Wars final show to be made in 2014. Watch this space",7 out of 13 found this helpful.,3.0,8 August 2014
286,Storage Wars," Don't go inside, don't open any boxes, don't bathe or use common sense.","Take several uneducated and uncivilised misfits and scripted drama mixed together with the lure of fast cash on what would be largely considered as junk that even the owners couldn't be bothered paying for and you get Storage Wars.<br/><br/>Set primarily in California, we follow these socially inept malcontents from storage locker to storage locker at various Californian facilities. Before they ""go inside you need to know the rules"", yells the auctioneer - ""We'll give you five minutes to look. You can't go inside, you can't open any boxes and whoever has the most money in their pocket can win it. Are you ready??"" and of course everyone there, from our eclectic cast to the studio extras making up the remainder of the crowd all yells, ""YEEAAAAHHH!!"" and we're off.<br/><br/>Our cast try to either feign interest or disinterest to throw off other buyers and it's then a game of trying to ""run up"" an opposing bidder so they spend more money than necessary. Some buyers have deliberately annoying habits such as Dave Hester and his ""Yuuuup"" catch-cry everytime he places a bid and he runs down everybody around him. Winners then give us this running tally of what they think this stuff is all worth with comments like ""that's a $20 bill there, that's a $75 bill there"" and so on. There always seems to be this one unique item located in a hidden area that they have no idea of what it is or what it does yet there's always some nearby expert where they can take this item to give them the low-down on it's history, usage and value.<br/><br/>So yes, it's all fake. It's also dumb and quite irritating once these idiots start bickering over who is the more intelligent at picking which locker to bid on and how much they should logically part with to own it and still try to make a profit on what potentially is inside. There's no science to any of this, neither is it a form of art. It's a gamble pure and simple. Yes you may be able to make assumptions based on what you can see that's not boxed but it's still only a guess. Some of the cast own shops so they buy in order to resell, others are collectors, but few of them seem to have much of an idea on what anything is. I've watched enough episodes to realise that almost none of these neanderthals have any idea on what movie or pop culture stuff or ""nerd-stuff"" as they call it, can actually be worth. Why is it always a shock to find signed comic books or still packaged action figures worth hundreds or even thousands?<br/><br/>I used to tune in to see what they would find, but the staged antics and moronic behaviour only results in a decreased brain function. I believe that the whole show is a vehicle for showcase the various ""expert"" professions around California as half of every episode is dedicated to the explanation and subsequent valuing of these surprise finds.

287,Storage Wars, The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com,"Two years ago, A&amp;E's Storage Wars came out of nowhere and quickly became one of the highest rated shows on cable. The show is extremely addictive and I watch it religiously, but why? Most people think it has something to with the mystery about what's behind the door or the hunt for buried treasure, as usual; I have a different take on things. The reason this show is as popular as is it, is the buyers themselves. Reality TV is about watching real people in real situations. We like to see people who are just like us, struggling to survive, fighting with people at work, etc. The cast of Storage Wars are people that we can relate to and more than that, they are interesting as hell. Every week I can't wait to see what Barry does, who Dave's gonna make mad, and what inappropriate thing Jarrod is going to say to his wife. I believe the show's popularity has little to do with what's behind the door. It's the unique and interesting cast that keeps us coming back for more. The truth is that doesn't matter if it's storage auction buyers, meter maids, or hand fisherman, what we want is people we like and can easily relate to in different situation both inside and out of the office, and Storage Wars provides that and then some.",9 out of 21 found this helpful.,8.0,27 June 2012

Even more niche specific than the original (see law&amp;order SVU)? Check! Is half the cast made out of already established and recognizable actors? Check! This is the formula, this is not the first show that uses it, and to some degree it works decent enough. So why is it failing here? Because the script is non existent. They did not even try to make it somewhat lifelike. It is 1 degrees of separation from a script used in porn. The show starts early on with an ""argument"" over jurisdiction of a kidnapping case. The argument is that since electronics were used during the kidnapping it would be a cyber crime and it should be reassigned to the cyber unit from the detectives already assigned to the case. This argument is accepted without 2 second of protest. First things first. Kidnapping in the US is a federal crime and it is handled by the FBI by default, not by some detectives. Even I know that and I am from Europe. Never lived in the states, by the way. Number two, considering the extensive level of use of electronics in the day to day life, at least 80% of crime would fall under the provided cyber crime definition. Now a lot of you will come back at me that it was meant to be malicious use of electronics, but that was not proved until way after the argument over jurisdiction was made. And number 3, that argument went way to easy, as it was there just because it had to be there.<br/><br/>Look, I am not even going to bother with all the other sink holes with this show.

I was a fan of Medium and Rosanna Arquette was a firecracker before that show, but there is a through-line with her from firecracker, through mom rolls to this. <br/><br/>James Van Der Beek has been impressive since he played a crazy version of himself on Don't Trust The B In 23. He was also good in Friends With Better lives and the lame Power/Ranger Bootleg. CSI Cybers shows a hint of the Beek being able to pull off action and when he is done with this show I would love to see him in action rolls as a detective or fighting aliens or something. <br/><br/>And it is great to see Peter MacNicol back on TV too. He was great on Numb3rs, Ally McBeal and Ghost Busters 2. <br/><br/>I am going to blame the writers, producers, editors and directors because no one is giving a good performance in this episode. <br/><br/>First, their opening case is a baby abduction. What kind of amber alert sentimental bull-crap story is that? It is like the annual obligatory kid episode on NCIS only worse. <br/><br/>Arquette is unconvincing in her stating that her unit is taking this case. It is a flimsy set-up and she was not able to connect with it. <br/><br/>Then at the crime scene, hacker #1 squabbles with hacker #2 over who has the most cooties or something equally lame. <br/><br/>Arquette never is convincing as any type of cop in this, she only ever comes across as a mom. <br/><br/>And the Beek is also given nothing to work with and comes across as hollow. <br/><br/>***Possible Spoilers*** There is a scene where the Beek jumps in water (in slow motion) and it feels almost John Woo or something, but they don't cut soon enough and it ends with a almost splashing-in-a-wading-pool bit. <br/><br/>***Possible Spoilers*** There are some people who get shot in this episode and they are unconvincing as dying people. That could be editing. Maybe don't let the second victim ask a stupid question about the first victim before he dies.<br/><br/>The episode is chock full of really bad decisions from the creators. The episode never gets anywhere near immersive because every minute or so something happens that pulls the viewer out of the story. <br/><br/>My hope is that this show gets cancelled so the original CSI can get another season. I never liked the show under Peterson, but it has been great since Ted Danson took over. <br/><br/>I give this 2 stars instead of 1 because Peter MacNicol was flawless with his five or less lines, and The Beek did eek out some charm no matter how badly the creators tried to kill it.",42 out of 56 found this helpful.,2.0,5 March 2015

For one thing there are many unwanted babies that would be easier to get than the ones these baby geniuses go after. On the show when you finally see these cyber masterminds that had the modest skills to take advantage of a vulnerability in the firmware of a baby monitor yet are easily traced by an unobfuscated IP address. Please, hacker 101, cover your tracks. <br/><br/>Then lets talk about the car evading police carrying a kidnapped baby in the back seat that drives into a lake as it's chased by two police cars and the police officers just stand around while the two main characters rush in and one dives in the water to retrieve the baby. I would be protesting if I was in law enforcement.<br/><br/>Let me also mention the unforgettable, for being so asinine, quote from agent Ryan ( Patricia Arquette ), ""Evolutionary survival skills will instinctively take them to higher ground"", this said when trying to figure out where two of the baby traffickers are going after getting paid. They are in a car, in a city looking for a bar and that will narrow the search area considerably since bars on higher ground are much more instinctively pleasing. I wont even mention that they wont be making any left turns so as not to attract attention to themselves. With logic like that it's a wonder anyone gets away from law enforcement ever.<br/><br/>The acting by the two main characters is wooden and ill timed at best. I understand the material was not very good to start with but at least put some effort into it guys, if for no other reason than to justify your hideously bloated paychecks.<br/><br/>I was determined to give this show a chance and managed to watch the first episode to it's conclusion and thank goodness, otherwise I may not have caught the 10 words that describe what motivates agent Ryan to catch these cyber meanies. If I was a betting man I would not give this show very good odds at making the cut when it's time to trim the fat at the network but then I have been surprised at the longevity of some amazingly bad shows. I hope this will not be one of those.",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,1.0,12 March 2015
309,CSI: Cyber, Not Impressed,"I was very excited to watch the show, but after having had the chance to watch the first episode I can say that I am not impressed. I felt as though the plot was not well formulated. A few of the actors that they had for the small bits were just awful, I mean I couldn't tell if they were pretending to be under the influence or were actually under the influence during filming. The way the whole show is captured in regards to video quality and such is also not done well. It made me feel as though I was watching a mini episode prepared by high school students without experience in film and video. It was filled with unnecessary CGI in between every scene that made it look just horrible. It looks super cheap and a waist of time, and does not come even close to other shows within the same genre. I would be surprised if it lasts for more than a season.",44 out of 62 found this helpful.,1.0,3 March 2015
310,CSI: Cyber, I can't get past the flashy graphics,"We have really enjoyed some of the CSI series. We still watch the Las Vegas episodes and look forward to them each week (when we can guess what night they are on). We also really enjoyed CSI NY and were sad when that series ended. CSI Miami was great, except we just couldn't deal with the mannerisms of David Caruso's character so we didn't watch it. Caruso was great in the first season of NYPD Blue. It looks like CSI Cyber might be another one we will take a pass on.<br/><br/>Seven minutes into the show when the first commercial hit I didn't like CSI Cyber. The basic concept is fine. I didn't get to know the characters but that could come with time. We know that most shows don't settle down into their stride for a few episodes, or for some even half a season. But it is the music and flashy graphic jumps that first turned us off. Frankly it was difficult to judge the acting quality because the episode was so chopped up none of them were on screen long enough. But what I could discern was mostly poor acting. I blame that on the director rather than the actors.<br/><br/>CSI Cyber isn't a serious crime scene investigation series. It's more like the fast action glitzy type of show. MY feeling is CBS gave it the CSI name to give it a boost but it is more likely to tarnish the name. The pace seems more like the recent Scorpion show which we are still giving a chance. I'm not sure we'll give CSI Cyber a chance.<br/><br/>If you like fast paced shows with lots of action and don't mind questionable crime investigation methods you may like this show. It makes wide use of hand held cameras, nothing is stationary, camera angles last about 4 to 5 seconds and even then the camera is moving. It's like the director gave instructions to the editing crew that if the camera view didn't change in 5 seconds or less they'd be fired. If you're not already schizophrenic you may be after watching this show. <br/><br/>Overall I blame the director for this mess. but I'm sure the style is already burned into the series. They are shooting for a much different audience than those who enjoy CSI Las Vegas.",57 out of 83 found this helpful.,2.0,4 March 2015
311,CSI: Cyber, Why? Why did CBS do this to us?,"I was the opposite of excited when I saw that they were making a new CSI. However, I decided to give it a try mainly because James Van Der Beek is in it. He's the only reason this show got a 2 instead of 1. This was pretty bad. Patricia Arquette's acting was beyond awful. I'm not really a fan of hers but she played a better hooker in Law &amp; Order SVU than she acted in this show. <br/><br/>The techs (Charley Koontz, Hayley Kiyoko, and Shad Moss) were just blah. Their characters were meant to be unique but they fell flat. Also, way too much hi-tech BS such as the autopsy hologram. It's so unrealistic and just makes the show seem like it's trying too hard to be cool. <br/><br/>Spoiler: The ""climax"" scene of the pilot was so dumb and unrealistic. Why didn't the cops go into the water to save the baby? They waited for the Beek and Patricia Arquette? That scene was just bad. Bad writing. And just dumb. Like really? You're gonna write that the car goes flying into a body of water and the car is going to fill up with water and someone is going to be able to dive into the water, break open the window, pull the baby, the baby's going to get CPR and live? I suppose they were striving for a tense situation but it was just dumb.<br/><br/>This pilot should seriously be the only episode of this show to air.",19 out of 25 found this helpful.,2.0,5 March 2015

From the stilted dialogue to the wooden acting; from the predictable storyline to the plot that has holes you can drive a bus through.

You have your over-compensating female boss, your overweight but brilliant hacker, your proby hacker from the hood on probation (literally), your action man with a gun and your enigmatic oriental female.

313,CSI: Cyber, Not even an ethically gray area,"Not considering anything else, near the end of the first episode, the police run two adults and a baby into the water. An agent then dives in to save the baby, and basically lets the adults drown.<br/><br/>And they look quite happy about it.<br/><br/>Even if these people were in fact criminals, they certainly do not deserve to be murdered by the police. They also almost kill the baby through their actions. Especially if they have the GPS to the allegedly abducted baby (and they do not even know whether these adults were in this mess in any way), they could have just driven them down later, or just stopped them at the airport or whatever.<br/><br/>Highly objectionable. I can only hope no law enforcement agency will ever operate in such a way.<br/><br/>The writing for the series seems very poor so far. I also really didn't care of the special effects between the scenes, but perhaps I just don't find them very 'CSI-ey'.<br/><br/>I will probably revise this review when the next episode airs.",14 out of 19 found this helpful.,1.0,8 March 2015

However here she is less than credible as the leader of a cyber crime unit than as a psychic. <br/><br/>James Van Der Beek as a police officer? I tried and tried but couldn't get over his Dawson days. The worst offender here is Lil Bow Wow. Yes the teenage rapper Bow Wow as a ""geek"".<br/><br/>The other two actors portraying the geeks are even worse because of how laughably bad they look. An overweight neckbeard and the bleach-blonde latina, who both parrot the most ridiculous lines.<br/><br/>""Setting a fire through the internet""?! Seriously?<br/><br/>Not only are the writers technologically deficient, they also insult the regular audience intelligence with over the top flashy graphics that do NOT serve the story telling. Instead they're annoying and unfunny.<br/><br/>At some point, you see Bow Wow and the words on screen give his internet username and ""ex black hacker"".

And then the security bug he found right away by hooking up his laptop in the server room. The programmer (just 1?) wasn't allowed to patch it? Then they found the location within seconds and traveled there after they only had 30 minutes to do that? This guy can hack a gaming platform but doesn't use proxy's? Cops driving a car with a baby in the water on purpose? Then they left the kidnappers in the car? They are law enforcement, they let them die.

318,CSI: Cyber," Totally UNREALISTIC depiction of computers, cellphones and technology in general.","This a deeply flawed TV show.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Bruckheimer's CSI franchise but I watched some episodes of NY, Miami, Vegas etc. for purely ""informational"" reasons. I mean to see what the forensic science can do nowadays. Many of these stuff seem highly unlikely to be true but you can swallow them with a pinch of salt.<br/><br/>In the latest member of the series CSI Cyber however, the lack of realism reached unbelievable heights and the show is a joke to follow even for mere entertainment.<br/><br/>Who ever writes this has absolutely no clue about how technology works and what is possible and what is not. Surprisingly enough that goes the other way too! Not only you see a constant overestimation of what technology or a hacker can do BUT you often get the exact opposite where the computers ""geniuses"" of FBI seem to ignore the simplest truths and possibilities that any kid with a mobile phone knows. I'm now watching episode 6 and the computer ""experts"" of FBI are amazed by the fact that it's possible to create ...fake SMS into your phones, something that a gazillion apps out there are doing in a split second.<br/><br/>The direction, effects, editing and music of the show is also an over-the-top version of the CSI series. Either you like it or not. The fact is that is difficult to have any emotions with such a fast-paced pseudo-modern presentation. You are not going to feel sorry for the victim, or pity, or sadness or joy. The acting is wooden. Even the most sentimental line is been delivered like from robots.<br/><br/>And there are more flaws. A long uninspired intro, a lame song and credits, a couple of background stories that no one seems to care about and of course the ...terrifying message in every episode "" It can happen to you ""!! As I wrote I'm now watching the 6th episode. If you hate it why you watch it? you might ask. Well...I'don't...not really.

(Oh look, there's a clue) CSI Cyber however is Bad, contrived, stupid, poorly directed, badly acted, unrealistic and so not entertaining. Let us count the ways that this show is bad.

Constant, and I do mean constant, use of computer parts to mark scene changes needs to be more thought out. Good T.V in CSI teaches something about the subject matter.

She's the glue that keeps the family together, and she does so with elegance, humor, compassion and a whole lotta mischief.

Things have changed for Charlie though; he's divorced, his mother is dead, his dad is remarrying, and he's loaded. His settlement for the false imprisonment has made him rich, famous and a detective. Everyone thinks he's just in the position because of the settlement, but the truth is, he's actually pretty good, which we find out in the first five minutes.<br/><br/>Crews is even more interesting because he's spent the last twelve years in prison reading ""The Path to Zen"" and instead of raising his voice when he's angry, like normal people, he spouts off about how the universe is making fun of us. And Crews, unlike House, has a bona fide soft side. (Spoiler) After he fatally wounds a crack head, he tells him, ""It's okay, it was just a bad dream. Go back to sleep,"" as the man dies in his arms, which was a slow and truly touching moment that was actually, you know, sweet for a network television pilot. Damian Lewis plays Crews with such subtlety and sincerity, that the character is completely believable.<br/><br/>Also, unlike ""House"", Life has a whole cast of complicated and interesting characters. Sarah Shahi's Dani Reese is Crews' partner and a recovered drug addict. She's under pressure from the department both to prove that she's fit for duty and to find a way to get rid of Crews. It's a difficult line to walk for her because, like I said, Crews is good at his job, and Reese respects that.<br/><br/>Reese is also smart. She doesn't believe Crews is Zen enough to have completely let go of his own case, which, as we discover at the very end of the show (Spoiler) he has not. He's devoted a whole room in his ridiculously large house to laying out the case. We see that his old partner and current boss, the person putting pressure on Reese, were involved in setting Crews up, if not the original murder all together. Crews' case is going to be an ongoing plot line, probably throughout the entire series, and it's something I'm looking forward to seeing fleshed out.<br/><br/>My favorite supporting character thus far has got to be Adam Arkin's Ted Early, who was in prison with Crews for insider trading. Now that they're both out and Crews is loaded, Early is his financial adviser and lives above Crews' garage.<br/><br/>The show also makes fun references to how much technology has changed in such a short time span. Crews, having been in prison for twelve years, has no clue that there are such things as camera phones and instant messages. It's interesting to have a character who is very smart, but a little hapless in the modern era.<br/><br/>I'm very interested in both the ongoing story of the series and in the interactions Reese and Crews will have in the future with each other and with the rest of the force. It's a great show, so tune in and watch and keep great TV on the air.",37 out of 37 found this helpful.,8.0,27 September 2007
351,Life, I Love It!,"Main character is great, I love the guy! His zen-philosophy is understandable to everyone, zen-or-not, even like some usual wisdom; and his not-so-zen seek for revenge is so Western... This is just the thing that crime series needed: fresh new character, interesting and funny. I also like his partner (she's beautiful, reminds me of Jo in Eureka), but I hope she will develop in a more interesting way soon - not just because of her past and drug abuse, but also like a character itself, with characteristic language and everything that a full character needs. Story is very promising, it could lead to many different ways; also the crimes that Charlie and Reese have to work on are interesting. Life is great, I hope it will continue for many seasons.",83 out of 86 found this helpful.,10.0,22 October 2007
352,Life, 12 years in prison for a crime you didn't commit...what does that do to a man?,"Charlie Crews is a former cop turned inmate who has just gotten out of jail after 12 years for a crime he didn't commit. He becomes a detective again upon his release as part of a settlement with the city. I just watched the pilot, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not some dumb action piece with big car chases and naked women. It also has a great relationship between the two lead characters, a man and a woman. They're detective partners, but there isn't any forced chemistry tacked on. You know, the whole they hate each other, but you can't deny the attraction...uggh. This avoids that perfectly. It also has some great actors, Damian Lewis is always great, since ""Band of Brothers"" he's displayed a remarkable talent for character roles. And this is most certainly a character drama. But unlike Shark or Monk or something where the character is the whole plot, there's also a great deal of other fantastic elements. The man was in jail from 1995-2007, so there's cute scenes about a sort of culture shock, mostly pertaining to technological advances. But there's also a darker side, as Crews was brutalized in prison (as a former cop) and has a vendetta against those who conspired to put him in jail. This is the overarching arc of the series, but smaller cases worked with his partner form the bulk of the story lines. I was really impressed and look forward to further episodes. I just hope that NBC manages to get this show enough ratings to keep it on the air. Kudos on a job well done. J.",179 out of 194 found this helpful.,10.0,15 September 2007
353,Life, Old School Meets New School,"Life is one of the best shows on television because it revives the old Detective shows where there was no ""CSI"" made-up procedures to catch people. Instead, it is straight detective work that keeps you on edge.<br/><br/>This show is great because it doesn't have the flashy-ness or unbelievable murders/events as Police shows on TV now. It could be about murders for the simplest and believable reasons. Jealous spouses, simple rapes and other, everyday events. The shows characters are down-to-earth and cast perfectly with the recovering-addict Detective and Damian Lewis' enthralling ""Zen-Like"" Detectiveness. The way the writers have him interviewing and connecting with people is unlike any other police show or movie I have ever seen. <br/><br/>To make things better, is the side story of how Damian Lewis is spending his money from his settlement. What at first seems like a series like ""Bad Boys"" is quickly proved incorrect with the lines ""I am not attached to this car..."" and you can see that he is.<br/><br/>But the best, very best part of this show is how Dt Crews is investigating his own case to find out who framed him during a triple homicide. Again, using basic, detective work.<br/><br/>I was starting to find CSI-style shows becoming boring, and lacking in depth and was excited to finally find a show that uses its characters to bring it to life, not scantly-clothed girls with almost no acting skill.<br/><br/>So if you want a believable show, with great characters and a great story line every week, watch Life and you'll become attached to the show!",104 out of 111 found this helpful.,9.0,10 November 2007

357,Life, Quirky and fun,"Quirky leads have been very big lately. In the aftermath of the success of Gil Grissom, Monk, and House, quirky leads are seen as a guaranteed hit. We love when the lead is sarcastic, or does odd things that turn out to be completely logical. And that is what pulled me to Charlie Crews, played by the under-rated Damian Lewis.<br/><br/>The writers did a great job with the pilot. It is clean, and clear what the storyline is. Charlie Crews is an ex-cop who was set to prison for murder. 12 years later, he is released, compensated, and reinstated. His wife is remarried (presumably an amicable break-up), and he still doesn't know who framed him, but he has an anally set up system to try and figure it out.<br/><br/>Adam Arkin is in the cast playing his friend and financial adviser. He was in the same prison as Charlie for a white-collar crime, and Charlie saved his life. Now, he lives above Charlie's garage, and sometimes destroys his car with a tractor... Adam Arkin is fantastic.<br/><br/>Sarah Shahi plays Charlie's new partner, Dani Reese. The two actors have great chemistry and it shows on-screen. She is the typical straight laced cop, whereas he is the goofy, brooding, Sherlock. She's also got her own demons. It is clear that she has made a mistake that got her the ""honor"" of getting Charlie as a partner, and she is seen having a one night stand.<br/><br/>The storyline is clean, and not just focused on Charlie. The writers manage to do a good job juggling his character storyline, and the story of a murdered little boy. Good luck, ""Life"". I'll be watching.<br/><br/>And if you like Damian Lewis, check him out in Colditz. Excellent movie.",22 out of 23 found this helpful.,10.0,27 September 2007
358,Life, Hopefully this series will have a long 'Life',"The new fall season is just starting and a dozen or more different TV shows are invading our living rooms. Naturally, there'll be a few series that will fall under the ax while there are others who will prevail and return for the next season and for seasons to come.<br/><br/>I'm hoping that one of those shows that survive is 'Life'. It's a fresh and vibrant take on the cop drama that has a great mix of comedy, drama, some action, a hint of sexual tension, and a great mystery. And that's only what I saw in the first episode.<br/><br/>Detective Charlie Crews is played in a wonderfully quirky but understated way by actor Damian Lewis. Viewers are most likely to remember him from the WWII miniseries, 'Band of Brothers', where he also shined. His Crews is truly an original character with quirks such as his love of fresh fruits and his zen-like outlook on life. Despite his zen outlook, he can't help but feel attached to his newly bought Bentley or the sexy women his money attracts. Crews is not a total oddball though. He's actually a brilliant detective since his zen outlook actually helps him in solving cases. Hopefully, if this series continues, Charlie may be able to develop into one of those great cop characters...like Andy Sipowicz or Lennie Briscoe.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also does a great job in their roles. Sarah Shai plays Dani Reese with just the right balance of toughness and vulnerability. Crews' financial adviser, Ted Earley (Adam Arkin), boss, Lieutenant Karen Davis, and attorney, Constance Griffiths (Brooke Langton), provide solid if short performances. Lewis, however, is the anchor of the show and truly holds this show together. The show is also interspersed with documentary-like scenes about Charlie's time in prison, with interviews from his former partner, his ex-wife (who divorced him while he was in jail), and various others. <br/><br/>If there were any flaws, it would be the pacing. There were times when the show kind of slowed in its pace but otherwise it was a great show to see.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend you to save some time Wednesdays at 10:00 PM for a little slice of 'Life'.",17 out of 18 found this helpful.,9.0,27 September 2007

367,Life," Dark mystery/cop drama,set in the sunshine of L.A.","Detective Charles ""Charlie"" Crews(Damien Lewis,in competition with Hugh Laurie for most convincing TV American as done by a Brit)has returned to the Los Angeles Police force. His return is from a twelve year hiatus,brought about by a life sentence(hence the title)for his(wrongful)implication in a multiple homicide. Of course,once vindicated of said crime,Charlie sets about finding out how he was framed,who did it,and who--if anybody--should he trust around him,in the force and elsewheres. He's conducting a lonely search,as he tries to put on the guise of resuming life as normal,back on duty investigating cases alongside a partner(Sarah Shahi)who is as damaged as they come,and VERY suspicious of her partner's ways,among other things.<br/><br/>While the plausibility of some of the show's situations(examples:Crews is the beneficiary of a $50 MIllion settlement with the force,yet somehow shows little sign of having any money,save occasionally cruising around in a different souped-up auto each show;how the force would be penalized or settle with giving up a sum of money THAT steep without appeal;the willfulness of the force to let Crews back on to active duty)seems a shade hard to swallow,this show's edgy,nervous and reflective mood--mostly spurred on by the inspired performance of Lewis--helps the medicine go down a lot easier. Arguably one of the more inspired shows on the new fall season(along with ""Pushing Daisies"",""Chuck"" and ""Aliens in America""),here's hoping that this show doesn't fall under the wheels of the current writer's strike.

369,Life," A darker Monk, with touches of Veronica Mars and Boomtown","I hope this becomes a sleeper hit, because it's a fantastic show. Both main characters (Charlie Crews and his partner Dani Reese) have rich back stories and are well cast. The always-excellent Adam Arkin (Northern Exposure, anyone?) is entertaining as Crews's friend and house guest. I even like Crews's Zen philosophizing (and, as someone who has practiced Zen Buddhism semi-seriously, in affiliation with a legitimate Zen temple, I was prepared to hate it).<br/><br/>This show is an unusual mix of elements. Crews the eccentric detective is a lot like Monk; the cinematography and pacing remind me of Boomtown; and the soundtrack is so prominent at times that brief segments are like a music video. The show also reminds me of Veronica Mars in combining a central mystery (who set up Charlie Crews for a crime he didn't commit?) that runs through all episodes with, in each episode, one or two crimes that are solved by the end of that episode. (There may be other shows with the same type of setup, but they don't leap to my mind.) It's unclear how long they'll be able to string out the central mystery. On the one hand, if they wrap it up too soon, it's hard to see how they will replace it. (Though Veronica Mars managed to do so a few times.) On the other hand, if they drag it out too long, it might become tedious.<br/><br/>For now, though, this is one of my and my wife's favorite shows (and our tastes often don't overlap; when they do, it's a sign of a quality show that should have broad appeal).",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,29 November 2007

The rest of the cast is great also. The real interesting parts are the reactions of those around him. You would think that a friend wrongly convicted would be welcomed back with open arms by his friends. Yet here they seem more angry and annoyed that he was set free.

372,Life," One of the Best Shows on TV (and, no its not House with Cops)","Despite a slightly choppy pilot episode, Life paced itself through a very impressive first season. Even those who outright disliked the pilot and subsequent first few episodes were pleasantly surprised at just how GOOD this show became with each episode. The season, unfortunately shortened a good deal by the fallout from the writer's strike, reached a fever pitch at the fourth episode and hit every note perfectly from that episode until the truly classic and excellent last two episodes of the season. I can't remember a season finale as tense and truly interesting in a long, long time.<br/><br/>MILD SPOILERS Much of the show is carried by Damian Lewis, as Det. Charlie Crews. Crews, wrongfully sent down via conspiracy for the murder of his best friend's family, emerges from 12 years (most of which is spent in solitary) in the super-max Pelican Bay Prison. Nearly killed several times inside, the only thing that kept Crews going is a small, tattered book of Zen teachings that he seems to have read over and over again in an attempt to keep himself from losing his mind.<br/><br/>Constance Griffiths, a kind-hearted and tenacious lawyer manages to get Crews's conviction overturned. She also gets him his job back at the LAPD, and at the Detective rank he'd have been if he'd not been sent down for 12 years. She also managed to secure him a nice settlement...anywhere from 5 to 50 million dollars, depending on which beat cop you ask.<br/><br/>Crews settles in to his Home Sweet McMansion with Ted Early (Adam Arkin) a smart but crooked inside trader whom he met and protected in prison.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dani Reese (Sarah Shai), an attractive, smart but troubled young detective is also emerging from serious troubles in her past. Demoted, she ends up with Crews as her partner as a punishment, but also quickly picks up on the fact that her commanding officer may have more sinister reasons for pairing the duo up; she wants to keep an eye on Crews, who she feels is back for one thing only....revenge on those who may have set him up. A second generation cop (her father was with the LAPD, too), she seems to exist for work, which props her up when her battles with addiction and self-loathing kick in the worst.<br/><br/>The show revolves around Crews's search for the family's real killer and those who set him up, but in the meantime, he's got work to do. LA is a big city, crimes happen and he and Reese have to solve them. This is where the procedural element, and possibly the show's weakest element, come into play. Each weekly mystery, especially in the first few episodes, has been done to death (no pun intended) and solving the murder mysteries can seem tedious and a distraction from the sub-plot of the conspiracy. However, by the episode Farthingale, even these procedural plots become much more interesting and original.<br/><br/>Comparisons have been made, especially in the beginning, between this show and House. While I understand that both lead characters are quirky (Crews with the Zen and House with the.....well, House) and the procedural element of both shows lend similarities, they really are nothing alike. I find the endless comparisons not only inaccurate, but lacking in imagination.<br/><br/>Season 1 sets up the conspiracy story arc well, and despite the shortened season, we DO get some answers towards the end of the season, so there is some satisfaction.<br/><br/>The season finale, which is really kind of a two parter, if you include the second to last episode as part of the finale, is tense and pitch perfect. When was the last time you saw a film, let alone a television show, where you TRULY did not know what was going to happen, which path a borderline character would choose? The writing in this series is commendable, but the entire show belongs to Lewis, and to an only slightly lesser extent, Shahi.<br/><br/>Best known from the mini-series Band of Brothers and films like Keane and Dreamcatcher, Lewis is a British actor who employs possibly the single best American accent on US television. His mannerisms and intensity are not only completely three dimensional, his repressed anger and depth are palpable. Lewis makes Crews a brilliant combination between a sixth grader and a serious, old school bad ass. The character is cool, smart, sexy and humorous.<br/><br/>For her part, Shahi is nobody's fiddle or banana in this show. Stoic and, at the same time, brimming with quiet and serious charm, Shahi's Reese is instantly likable.<br/><br/>Together, Crews and Reese make one of the best on screen partnerships in recent history.<br/><br/>One can't help feel Adam Arkin is slightly under-utilized and the second season should feature more of his character.<br/><br/>Overall, this show is not only original, smart and funny, it has the layers of depth that set it apart from similar shows. Definitely worth watching, check it out on NBC.com or Hulu.com (or order the Season 1 DVD on Amazon) before the second season begins in October.

Barry and his evil brother have a dynamic that leaves you constantly intrigued. The influence of the wife and children are another force waiting to be explored. I even had some hope the homosexual son sub-plot would take a powerful turn. I could hardly wait for another episode as each one was so promising. <br/><br/>Season two was still satisfying but took some turns that I found unconvincing. When I saw the advertising where Barry is walking in the desert and holding the sand, I did not expect them to take such a literal turn. Daliyah's character was actually another win for the show. I held on with the expectation that season 3 would knock some exciting developments out of the park. <br/><br/>Season three feels like it was written by high school students filling in where previous writers abandoned ship. I'm assuming that's what happened anyway. Granted, I have only watched snippets of each episode because it got too soapy for me to continue. There were so many missed opportunities, and the direction it has taken is nonsensical. The death of Jamal was probably the point where the show ended being relevant. There is never any real drama here anymore. It just became another show that adds unnecessary grenades because the real story has been bulldozed.",18 out of 18 found this helpful.,6.0,14 October 2016
375,Tyrant, Blown away by the first episode.,"Forewarning only the pilot has been seen so far, but based on that I was thoroughly impressed.<br/><br/>Tyrant is the story of the second son of a powerful middle eastern tyrant who has escaped the corruption and despair of his native land and spent two decades Americanising himself and building an unassuming life with his wife and two kids. Reluctantly he is brought back to his country of birth for the wedding of his nephew.<br/><br/>Its not immediately a genre I would find myself drawn to, but I was enthralled. Barry (the second son) Is a wounded character, wary of his father and everything he represents, and they depict him brilliantly. His interactions with his brother and father are complex and deep.<br/><br/>The setting for the show is very beautiful, right in the opening portion of the episode you get a great sequence of shots where the American family is being driven in a cavalcade to the palace, and you can really see the juxtaposition of the opulence of their cars, the palace with its gardens and forest, with the impoverished masses being kept at bay so the streets are clear for the motorcade. <br/><br/>Watching both Barry's reaction to this contrasting culture and his American families reaction is very interesting and adds a different element to the story. His wife's ""Dr. Phil"" moments trying to get him to open up about the atrocities he witnessed when Barry (and the audience) know she could never really understand, his sons oblivious superficiality and obnoxious self absorption help make the story relatable to me coming from a western culture, and also highlight how ignorant they (and we) are. <br/><br/>I've only seen the pilot, as mentioned above, but I loved this first glimpse of a, for me, unique new story. I cant wait to see how it unfolds, and I recommend the first episode highly.",87 out of 105 found this helpful.,,25 June 2014
376,Tyrant," Started out interesting in Season 1, Season 2 less believable, Season 3 Tyrant Jumped the Shark","Can't discuss this series without discussing ""spoilers"", so hang on, here goes.<br/><br/>Interesting concept in Season 1 - can an Americanized expatriate son of a bloody Middle Eastern dictator manage to bring some western- values based humanity to a forlorn country long used to abuse by its autocratic rulers - first his father, and now his own brother?<br/><br/>In Season 1 the answer was ""maybe?"".<br/><br/>In Season 2, all of a sudden this Americanized son and brother of a brute was leading a ""revolution"" and a hero to his downtrodden countrymen and women? Uhhh, no, that's simply not very plausible.<br/><br/>And by Season 3 the series arc suddenly became the Americanized protagonist now fully Tyrant-ized, brutalizing his own people and fanatically pursuing tribal vengeance at the shrewish urging of his own Tyrant-ized wife, now focused solely on killing the killer of their daughter, no matter the cost to any other person on earth.<br/><br/>Sorry, I didn't much believe the noble American revolutionary leader and I sure don't buy the full circle transformation into bloody Middle Eastern tyrant - either of Barry or his seriously demented American born wife<br/><br/>Through the second half of Season 3 I found myself wishing someone would just take out Barry's evil you-know-what wife ... to save Barry, his son, and his entire nation the bloody outcome sure to result from the path of never-ending vengeance.<br/><br/>And I also found myself wishing that the producers and writers could have come up with a more nuanced Barry character and not the complete submissive idiot that he turned out to be, fully whipsawed by a combination of his wife, his terrorist nemesis Ihab, and, well, his entire situation. Not that I wished instead that Barry would somehow become a Middle Eastern Super Hero and teach all those Middle Easterners how to live like a good American ... but rather, I wanted Barry to have some sense of humility, to recognize his own limits, and to understand that absolute power corrupts absolutely (after all he had his family history to prove that), and to realize when he was in far over his head.<br/><br/>I sympathize with the desire to exact revenge after a senseless bloody killing of a dear family member, but stupid is as stupid does. Pretty much every single decision that Barry made in Season 3 was worthy only of someone dumber'n a box of rocks.<br/><br/>After Season 2's semi-ridiculous story line, in Season 3 I was hanging on in hopes of a turnaround that would get it all back to something resembling a thoughtful treatment of Middle Eastern culture clashing with western values ... instead, I'm done.",16 out of 17 found this helpful.,3.0,14 September 2016

The cast is variable, except for Ashraf Barhom, playing Jamal, who just blows me away with his fierce energy. Every moment he is on he completely dominates the drama. Everyone looks pale beside him -- his energy seems to come like a fire from within and burns up the screen. I think this is a new star... I'll be watching to see him in more! FX really does an amazing job bringing us really interesting series instead of the usual pulp on network TV. Just when you think you've seen it all, they come up with something new.

378,Tyrant, An Excellent Show About the Tightrope of Power,"With a stunning and fascinating portrayal of a middle-eastern power structure, FX has outdone themselves yet again.<br/><br/>What does it mean to have true power, and can you ignore power when you are born into it? The central conflict of this show thrusts it's main characters back into the fray of just such a situation. It portrays power as both freedom and a prison. The Al-Fayeed family, rulers of a fictional middle-eastern country are no different from any other modern Monarchy except that it is still in defacto power and uses brutal tactics to stay there.<br/><br/>Assad, Khadaffi, Saddam, Bush...<br/><br/>These names conjure Dynasty's and dictatorships, and for thousands of years the power struggles within their individual kingdoms were largely ignored by western powers, or swept quietly under a convenient media rug. But for Barry Al-Fayeed, the violence and politics of his family have been left behind. He has no desire to rule anything then his pediatric practice.<br/><br/>As the younger son of a brutal dictator, Barry took advantage of his families wealth to leave the country behind, and hasn't seen home in twenty years. His wife and children are somewhat ignorant of their husbands and fathers old world, knowing only that they are 'sort of' royalty and that grandad is rich. Their ignorance is typical of the average American family, not stupid, but simply devoid of the truth of the day to day in tyrannical regimes in many parts of the world. When his brothers son is due to be married, Barry is called home, and the cycle begins again.<br/><br/>But the truth is, Barry's legacy is one of bullets and blood, of violence and ruthlessness, of intimidation and manipulation. What makes a tyrant? This show promises to show just how far one man will go to secure his family, his country, and his power.",68 out of 89 found this helpful.,9.0,25 June 2014

The people who put this on have guts and I'm impressed. I will continue to watch for as long as the producers, directors and actors are willing to avoid shallowness or cave to ""political correctness."" <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of sex, nudity, or brutality on TV but this story could not be properly told without representing the characters as they really are.<br/><br/>Congratulations!

380,Tyrant, A summer program worth watching?,"I will go through a few points about various elements of the show.<br/><br/>Casting - It doesn't seem like anyone is out of place, but there were a few confusions about child versions of a few characters. One of the children looks nothing like the adult version of the character, I was confused and had to look up the cast. Other than that the cast is solid.<br/><br/>Writing - Generally well written with a few odd circumstances but nothing that cannot be explained later in the show. I am glad the writers were up to the task because the show is very dialogue based there isn't a lot of action but I was still pulled in episode after episode. <br/><br/>Acting - Adam Rayner is the main character is this show and as far as I know it's his first lead he has had for a major network. All I can say is that he is playing his role right. This can be said for the rest of the cast with a few exceptions. I cannot say too much without giving away spoilers but I have no complaints about the acting. <br/><br/>Set - Most of the show was filmed in Morocco, the show is not set in Morocco but it had me convinced it was a middle eastern country.",21 out of 26 found this helpful.,8.0,15 July 2014
381,Tyrant," The new ""must see TV"" show for the summer has arrived.","I watch a unhealthy amount of television. Thus the summer is a time of incredible pain. This show can finally help ease this. After diving into the first 3 episodes I can safely say that this show is on the right track. Some plots, and characters can be somewhat 2 dimensional (Barry's son, wife and daughter come to mind) BUT can every character involved in every figment of a story be dynamic as the leads ? The plot is original for once, and the acting has thus far been superb. The sets are gorgeous and very true to the geographical locations as well. The realism and barbarity of a dictatorship/police state is also well portrayed. Give this show a full season and watch where it goes.

382,Tyrant, The Whole Package,"Most of the characters were somewhat stereotypical at first impression. However, the development of the characters has been executed nicely at a very gradual pace but accelerated to match the tempo of the development of the story.<br/><br/>I have found myself drawn into the characters and their psyche and I believe that most viewers can identify with most of them. The cast executes quite well in general. However, the ""Big Brother"" controlling Jamal is overdone and slows the development of his disposition. He is intelligent enough to make tough decisions. However, due to his father's influence coupled with the absence of his brother during his formative years, he sometimes needs to be pointed in the right direction yet maintains a cynical sense of humor and pretends to be dumb. This seems to invite the continual advice from his big brother. But the overbearing continual advice from the brother is still overdone.<br/><br/>Most viewers will find ""Tyrant"" to be a very distinct and unique series and very interesting to watch. It has very good content and nearly all ages can watch this for the sex scenes display more class than most shows on the air. These scenes are shown less and less as the show goes on and when they are shown they are done without unnecessary nudity and tasteless displays of the act. The violence has mellowed as well.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that the writers keep up the good work, for so far they have shown great vision and originality!",28 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,30 July 2014

385,Tyrant, Best New Series in a Long Time,"I decided to DVR ""Tyrant"" after seeing a few promos. I'm happy to report that the promos didn't do justice to the series. I was hooked in the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>The adult cast is excellent. I expect that the children will be as well, but I haven't seen enough of them to be sure. The writing is mostly top-notch, and the relationship dynamics seem altogether plausible, with one exception (more on that below). The visuals are beautiful.<br/><br/>I wondered whether the depiction of an Arabic middle eastern country was accurate, but I've not visited there and have no frame of reference (other than news reports, which I take with a large grain of salt). I recommend that you read qusai-tamimi2000@hotmail.com's review, which I found very helpful.<br/><br/>My only real issue with the writing is with some of the interaction between Bassam and Molly. I get that the show needs to show us the dynamics of their relationship and tell us the back story. But I would expect these two characters to have a higher level of emotional maturity than the writers seem to give them credit for. Molly keeps trying to have serious conversations in public places where they're not appropriate, and Bassam doesn't seem mature enough to say more than ""I can't talk (or won't) about this now."" It's a common plot device, but I think this series deserves something less common.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next episode.",30 out of 42 found this helpful.,9.0,4 July 2014
386,Tyrant, Really Enjoyed The Pilot.,"As a Middle-Eastern, I pretty much comprehend the concept of this series. I am a Jew born in Israel, a grandson to Jewish grandparents who immigrated from Iraq, I have heard plenty of stories from my grandfather about the life in an Arab country, about its glory days and its very elegant lifestyle but also heard about the brutality and mercilessness which often characterizes the Arab leaders in certain Arab countries.<br/><br/>In addition, as an Israeli, I am updated in all of the scenarios in the Arab world, and how unstable the Arab world is.<br/><br/>You can sense the extravagant Arab lifestyle in the first episode of the series, this exaggerated lifestyle traits the way most of the Arab leaders used to live and are still living nowadays, you can sense the frustration and the torment of the lower population strata, it makes the series very realistic because it brings back the memories of the ""Arab Spring"".<br/><br/>As other people have already written, the plot of the story unfolds the story of Bassam Al-Fayeed which was the second son of Khaled Al-Fayeed, Bassam suffers from childhood traumas which had a vast reflection on his life as a person and as a family man. His brother Jamal can be compared to Saddam Hussein's first child, a ""hothead"", truculent and sort of a psychotic pervert.<br/><br/>As for now, basing on the pilot, I find this series very interesting and very realistic, reflects the life in the Arab countries of the Middle- East, Gideon Raff did a fantastic job with the script and I hope this series will not disappoint us.",44 out of 68 found this helpful.,9.0,30 June 2014
387,Tyrant, How is this show still flying under the radar?,"I was skeptical about starting this show at first. I'm not a fan of ""middle east conflict"" stories and the premise just seemed boring, but I have to admit, this show has me hooked now. Me and my girlfriend are Hulu and Netflix junkies. We'll typically find a show and binge watch seasons throughout our workweek. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad and Orange is the New Black were a few of my favorites and Tyrant ranks right up there with the best of them.<br/><br/>At it's heart, Tyrant is a story of two royal siblings with different views on how the kingdom should be run, set in a modern world. The show does a great job of portraying the struggles that people face in the middle east and gives some insight as to why the people there sometimes turn radical. I think it's a bold move for the producers to humanize many of the extremist ideologies for American TV in an age where we still think of fanatical Muslims as puppets unable to think for themselves. <br/><br/>Don't listen to the negative reviews without watching it yourself. Tyrant is packed with plot twists, shocking moments, and great characters. Honestly, I think Adam Rayner's acting is a bit on the weaker side to be cast as the main protagonist, but Basam Al Fayeed is a great character nonetheless, a ""good guy"" who can make tough, sometimes very violent, decisions on the fly. Basam's brother Jamal is probably the most entertaining ""villain"" I've watched in a long time (just as fun to watch as Walter White or Jeoffrey Lannister for me). The rest of the cast do a great job also.<br/><br/>10/10 for me. I can't wait for the next episode.",16 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,1 August 2015

389,Tyrant," Cartoony Psychopath vs Martyr Family Drama, Objectified Exotics on the side","This show could have been good edutainment. It could potentially bring deeper understandings to the struggles of everyday Arab people, give them names and human faces, and shine a torch on the ills of stubborn feudal system, and how the rulers - even those with good intentions - continue to self-sabotage and cause blood shed every power transition or at the slightest foreign meddling. Yes it did all that. But an honest and balanced presentation, this story is not.<br/><br/>Art direction is superb. I particularly like the theme song: epic, somber, deep, emotive, beautiful and austere. But the ""key story voice"" is anything but. Overall the producing, writing, directing are disappointingly SHALLOW given the available ingredients and excellent human resource they have at their disposal.<br/><br/>The actors do try their best, but there're just too many 'pander to mainstream American sentimental clichés' and cringe-worthy moments. Cringe-worthy, because the writer/director think their viewers are idiots, and the producer think ""audience are lured in by either bloody visual violence or crying/seductive female baits"". They must hit every VERY HARD on every points like we still haven't exited PATRONizing 60's.<br/><br/>It is not enough that the bad king acts like a testosterone ape, he must choose to CALCULATEDLY act out the most psychotic and ""CREATIVELY SADISTIC"" evil stunts, even when he is celebrating a moment of psychological triumph, or sneaking around his palace betraying his own less powerful family members with petty sinful acts many powerful American family males do regularly without blinking. Yawn.<br/><br/>Women, the damsel/virgin and the bitch/whore. Captain Obvious writer and director only know these two types of female species... Yawn...<br/><br/>The exotic queen is a real bitch - she just want the man she STILL loves to DIE. Oh, and she uses her sexuality (on her own husband!!!)to get her ways. So un-American and evil whore of her. Wow really. LOL. <br/><br/>On that note, the exotic/bad queen Leila is tall enough as is but insists on catwalking all the time in 5inch high heels just so that her mid-build hubby Jamal the bad king looks like a short angry-teen and her adult son looks like telly-tubby next to her. Telly tubby prince also has a tall fashion-model-frame wife, another one-dimensional damsel/virgin object with (unmatching)British boarding school accent. <br/><br/>Imagine the two VIP couples standing in a line. The cartoon visual is NOT intended, however, and that is the core problem with the production: the casting decision is 300% TESTOSTERONE-driven. <br/><br/>Testosterone excess always seek estrogen excess. Thus...the ""good"" wife of our leading hero is too whiny and fluffy and lacking in ""first lady in line"" qualities. <br/><br/>As an actress Finnigan just pouts and botox-widen-eyed innocence-posturing and camera-poses to much - ANNOYING even when she's supposed to elicit audience sympathy. Her self-absorbed acting made more jarring by her excessively groomed hair and over-stretched-face and ""dreamy white angel in Moroccon resort settings"" Vogue fashion shot parades. A 30-something actress who BEHAVES like a flighty 30yr old department store executive would of course FAIL to convince as a 40+ DOCTOR wife OF A DYNASTIC FAMILY with 18 year old children! What? She's a child bride of Bassam at 14?<br/><br/>Finnigan as Molly = most distracting and anti-immersion and cringe-inducing element in the entire show.<br/><br/>Bassam's American family are shallow, banal, run-of-the-mill stereotype Californian upper middle class private school bred, doesn't act like they've grown up with a serious conscientious intellectual ""Persian prince"" as a father, or a doctor as a mother, even as the kids apparently hung out with their cartoon-psychopath-playboy-millionaire uncle during school holidays in the exotic land of complications. The father's focus is on the lives of millions, his shallow family just want to drink French wines in resort palace and whine about daddy/hubby not caring abt his poor little angelic family? Huh? Seriously? <br/><br/>Overall, it's just bad use of good talents. The daughter is a post-porn era wannabe Lisa Simpson who talks social justice but walks ubercool fashion cafe streets. The son, a caricature of a self-pitying super-brat, another captain obvious ""bad seed"" Al Fayeed.<br/><br/>But still, Bassam the hero is THE ONLY good AND strong one - so stereotypical Jesus earnestly seeking martyrdom he even looks like Jesus in some scenes. Jamal is just cartoon in his inconsistent evil-type: one minuet he's one super-EFFECTIVE Machiavellian schemer, next minute he pulls another psychotic idiotic stunt sneakily behind his wife/son's back. Huh? <br/><br/>The white/good couple against the exotic/bad couple. So neat. So politically correct. So obvious. Even the attempt to be ""edgy"" and controversial (cross-cultural male homosexuality) is also neat and captain obvious.<br/><br/>After all that logic holes and glaring flaws, the show has redeeming qualities. There is actually a main story arc still held together by the good dedicated actors and art directors. I'm in the second season start, bracing myself for the tedium of filtering out Finnigan's distracting Botoxed face with bad queen's inappropriate catwalk parades in between more desert sand and beardy males with captain obvious black or white morality.<br/><br/>Those who think Homeland and Zero Dark Thirty are morally just and unbiased will really like this show.<br/><br/>Most educated and rational people will find the gratuitous Arab/ female objectification excessive. I wouldn't say the show adds to the suffering and misunderstanding of those who have to live in that reality, but it certainly isn't as high-minded as it presents itself.<br/><br/>Recommended as a high budget cartoon that pretends to be serious drama. Brace oneself for unnecessary visual and psychological violence.",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,5.0,9 July 2015
390,Tyrant," Stereotypes, Hateful, and inaccurate","While watching the first episode I was shocked, I laughed and then just shook my head in disgust. First, this show is not accurate in regards to culture. If viewers knew anything about Arabs and their very disparate cultures then many things would have been glaringly obvious. Example, the dance at the wedding celebration was a Syrian dance, yet many of the extras up to that point were wearing traditional Moroccan clothing. Syria and Morocco are vastly different in many ways. So, which culture is the show trying to depict? Is the show lumping all Arabs and Muslims into one mold? That would be like saying Chinese and Japanese culture are the same. Sorry, but it doesn't work that way in reality. Another example is when the character of Jamal is raping the woman in front of her husband and kids. Again, sorry, that may be a fantasy of many an American male (or the fantasy of Gideon Raff, the Jewish writer and creator of the show), but I can guarantee that no Arab male from the middle east or north Africa would sit by and allow his wife to be raped. Not by a long shot. The woman showing her body to her kidnappers was lame and again, not reality based. This show objectifies arab women,the hero is a blued eyed arab (hahahahaaha)while demonizing arab men and subtley throws in people praying at a mosque. This show is propaganda plain and simple. It is filled with stereotypes and it is deeply hateful and very very inaccurate. I've lived in Morocco, Saudi Arabia and have visited Tunisia and UAE. I can tell you that the majority of people I saw were poor, hard working and just wanted to put food on the table for their families. Many prayed in the streets on cardboard boxes as in Morocco. Anyone who thinks this show accurately depicts culture and religion needs their head examined.

392,Tyrant," Unbelievable plot with degrading stereotypes, terrible acting and cheap direction","I initially felt attracted because of the producers involved, but the outcome was very disappointing.<br/><br/>Firstly, the writing is shameful. The series is laden with gross cultural stereotypes about Middle East, which is in itself a cheap way of setting the theme for a series. Also, the actions so far are too predictable, while the plot itself is unconvincing and underestimating viewers' critical abilities. The treatment in general is regrettably childish. I did expect a deeper, more balanced treatment of the issue at hand.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting is terribly bland throughout the whole cast (particularly the actress playing the American young wife, one of the worst interpretations I have seen lately). There is no genuine resources, no true rendering of nuances, all the characters are flat, linear, unbelievable. An elementary school play would be better in quality and authenticity, even if played by amateur children.<br/><br/>And the direction, well, take the previous remarks and transfer the essence to the way the scenes are proposed, directed and shot.<br/><br/>If you like being treated as an intelligent adult, run away from this lame attempt.

""Barry"", the conflicted man-vs-self character, speaks  in hackneyed American-ese. To accept his character's action requires a  suspension of belief that I cannot attain. The wife Molly's tired  whining ""You never tell me anything..."" dialog is what fast forward is  made for. The son is an obnoxious brat who you can bet money will  follow in Jamal's evil footsteps, while the daughter is daddy's alter  ego and predictable conscience.  The violence and brutality of Jamal is over the top. Yes, I am sure  those things happen, but ""realism"" here is simply an excuse to show  blow jobs and anal rape in the name of drama.   The scripted dialog is awful, especially ""Barry"" and ""Molly"".  The best part of the pilot? When ""Barry"" belts his beligerent,  disobedient son across the face. Twice. If only he would do that to his  wife when she starts that ""You never open up, you never tell me  anything"" drivel.

394,Tyrant, An Awful Disappointment,"Like some others, I'm mystified how this show garnered such a high rating.<br/><br/>What could have been a thought-provoking drama has been butchered and stuffed into a straitjacket of misconceptions and stereotypes about Middle Eastern culture. The first two episodes felt like a high-budget news broadcast (ahem- looking at you, Fox News). Plenty of brutal violence, sprinkled with scenes of a dictator's opulent lifestyle; Very little else, and none of it palatable.<br/><br/>If that weren't bad enough, the writing is just painfully wretched. The plot is predictably flat and lacks in any genuine inspiration. The few ""plot-twists"" revealed so far produced eye-rolling boredom rather than suspense or excitement.<br/><br/>And then there's the dialog and acting. Beyond the ubiquitous presence of bland, one-dimensional characters in the show, no one in Bassam's (AKA Barry) American family show signs of any life- intelligent or otherwise. The writing / acting for his wife is especially bad. She does little more than whine that she doesn't understand what is going on throughout the first two episodes. The writers may have been shooting for the ""concerned spouse trying to get her husband to open up to her"" angle, but it comes across as ""ignorant, weak-minded ninny whose naiveté serves only to irritate and alienate him (not to mention the audience)"" instead.<br/><br/>There's no need suffer through another episode of this show, and hopefully it will fade into non-existence soon.

396,Tyrant, Doesn't Deserve the High Rating,"Aside from the attempt at the politics, power, and violence angle the main character is so flat. The American family so stereotypical, even obnoxious to watch. But what gets me the most is Gideon Raff's portrayal of American house wives? Similar to the Mrs. Brody from Homeland. every time ""Molly"" speaks I feel as though I am transported into a day time television soap drama. What is his weakness for writing American wives as whining, completely unaware, nag bags? <br/><br/>I doubt I will make it to episode 3.

397,Tyrant, Bad. Really bad.,"The acting is bad, the story is bad and the dialogues are the worst ever. It looks like they have spend a lot on the looks and setting of this show. That's a plus. But they should've spend it on script writers and actors.<br/><br/>I watched the entire season and I really don't know why. It was like looking at an accident, I couldn't look away. I have made an IMDb-account just to warn you guys about this show. It feels like a good deed.<br/><br/>Please, don't watch it.<br/><br/>The acting in this show mainly consists of looking very surprised or tormented in the camera. For someone who comes from a middle eastern country the main character is pretty naive about how things go there. His wife is even worse (though not middle eastern but educated) when it comes to this. They look extremely surprised every time something is told about the country you could easily have known if you watch a news segment now and then. Especially someone who is from the country like the main character (and who said he followed the news about that country from the US) should have known for example that people in the country can't talk about the gas attack in the past.<br/><br/>It's just one example of how bad it was. Believe me, it's really bad.<br/><br/>Netflix is almost always right when it recommends something to me. This time it really screwed up.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,2.0,16 July 2016
398,Looking, Perfectly Paced!,"Some folks are complaining that the show seems ""too slow"" or ""is boring"". I disagree completely. I'm much more invested in the characters precisely BECAUSE it's not ""Hollywood slick"". The lines are utterly natural and real to me. Nothing seems ""forced"" or ""acted"". The sex-scenes are frank, but very tasteful and more is implied than ever shown, anyway. The humor is genuine and seems completely spontaneous. I really appreciate this more methodical approach. No, it doesn't represent every single facet of the gay community, but it isn't trying to either. Just the lives and loves of a few guys in San Francisco...that's all. It can't be everything to everyone...and shouldn't try. I love it so far. Hoping it's renewed!!!",105 out of 114 found this helpful.,10.0,20 February 2014
399,Looking, It grows on you,"Three quarters of the reviews here are based on the pilot alone. Every TV lover knows pilots are not the way to judge the overall quality of a series. This is a series that grows on you slowly and by episode 6 (the best of the season) you will be rewarded! Everyone who's seen Weekend (2011) by the same Andrew Haigh knows what to expect in terms of plot and pacing. <br/><br/>Someone commented how the amount of (alluded) sex annoyed them, how yet another series about gay men portrays them as nothing more than nymphomaniacs. While I can understand why one would form such an opinion when the very first scene in the pilot starts with a handjob in a park, that scene was chosen not (just) for the shock value but more to immediately present the character of Patrick as this boyish man too prude for his looks. After all, his first thoughts in those moments send him to his mother, a theme that is revisited in later episodes. Furthermore, the sex scenes are cooled down from episode 2 onwards.<br/><br/>Someone commented how the banality of the plot makes this series pale in comparison to the mighty Queer as Folk, often regarded as the magnum opus of all TV series about gays. While that series was groundbreaking in more ways than one, it hatched caricatures and does not stand the test of time. It was a show that allowed the creators and the viewers to unleash all of their fantasies and play out their frustrations. That is therapeutic but it does not make for quality TV.<br/><br/>I won't even start comparing Looking to Girls or Sex and the City. If you want to relive the glory of the latter look elsewhere; if you are afraid it stretches out the former by being shown right after it, have no fear!<br/><br/>Bottom line: this is a slow paced show that requires multiple episodes to fully get it but looking at only 8 episodes of 22 minutes each, the creators are not asking for much. Give it a chance!<br/><br/>Your gay friend.",42 out of 44 found this helpful.,9.0,7 March 2014
400,Looking," Straight or gay, Looking is worth a look","Lighten up: Looking is not a documentary and its characters may not be instantly relatable (or even terribly likable). But those are not necessarily shortcomings. <br/><br/>Viewers who relax and just let the show unfold will find they'll enjoy it more than if they spend every moment trying to find themselves on screen or divine some higher purpose from watching it. <br/><br/>It's well known that in gay online culture, ""looking"" means ""I'm available for sex - now."" Here, however, it means so much more.<br/><br/>These characters are really looking for fulfillment: through relationships, careers, self-expression, entrepreneurship, family and friendship. (Oh, yeah -- if that hot guy over there is down to play, so are they). But hooking up is not the central theme of this show despite the sexy come-on of the title.<br/><br/>This show is not Queer as Folk, Part II. While QaF's characters spent a lot of time wringing their hands over equality, acceptance and pride, Looking's whole approach to being gay has matured along with society and the audience. These characters are fully realized, assimilated and don't dwell on whether society accepts them. <br/><br/>The men of Looking are just too busy fiddling with their smart phones (cruising Grindr or Scruff, perhaps?) to waste any time navel-gazing over their sexual orientation. There's a post-gay sensibility about these characters (Yup; I'm a homo - so, what?) that is very refreshing. QaF often just waved a rainbow flag when its stories ran out of steam. Don't expect that to happen here. <br/><br/>Looking also avoids a pitfall about which gays have long griped: the over-use of stereotypical, ""fem-acting"" gay characters. Looking's guys range from pretty masculine to downright butch. Finally, here's a show that celebrates the fact that intimacy between men can be a hyper-masculine experience and deserves to be showcased as such. These dudes just enjoy getting frisky with other dudes. There's nothing sissy 'bout that.<br/><br/>It's also refreshing to see characters of different ages relating socially even though some might say this happens infrequently in the real world. Older characters may sheepishly refer to the ""old days"" while the younger characters pretend not to notice that their friends are, well, older.<br/><br/>As the series unfolds, I hope the show will explore inter-generational dating, open relationships, monogamy, celibacy, and also how many of these things can also take place within a marriage. <br/><br/>I also hope it will delve into the still-surprising ""ordinariness"" of what it is to be gay today, especially in a major city. Despite the good word of mouth, leading a gay life can often be less than fabulous. There's a fair amount of slogging away at work, paying taxes, taking out the trash, tending to family and mowing the lawn. Just ask around.<br/><br/>It would be easy to pigeonhole this as a ""gay"" show, but I hope heterosexual viewers will fall in love with its quirky characters and insights. <br/><br/>They'll discover that whether gay or straight, we're all more alike than many of us realize: People are generally horny, driven to succeed and need to feel loved. In short, we're all Looking.",120 out of 136 found this helpful.,9.0,5 February 2014
401,Looking, Fantastic series,"Interesting to read some of the reviews of this show.Personally I find it a very entertaining,very watchable show, certainly not slow, and as one reviewer commented its nothing but sex,sex, sex! I think he completely misses the point of what the the writers and producers of this show have given us. I find the show has a wonderful sense of time and place, like Maupins Tales of the City which was so evocative of San Francisco in the seventies, the TV shows from those books were also great,this new show is expressive not just of present day gay life San Francisco,but of many cities in North America. Its a funny,heartwarming and very real series,reflective of many sides of peoples lives, and insightful as to how many of us think and behave.

Also, the stories in every episode are incredibly compelling and don't make me feel ashamed of the ""gay world"" as it usually happened when I watched Queer as Folk or many other shows where characters only preocupation is to have sex. The three main actors certainly are doing a great job and I couldn't have chosen better ones to impersonate each character. Thirty minutes episodes are way too short.

I know many did not and were hoping to see another campy gay soap opera filmed in Canada with guys who looked like Andrew Christian models that spent 8 hours a day at the gym. This was the first gay series that I ever watched that didn't feel the need to dumb itself down so the airhead club queens would get it. Nor did it feel as if it had to be political to the point of coming across like an ABC After-School Special. It just wants to tell a story about 3 (now 6) people living and loving in the magical city by the bay.,36 out of 42 found this helpful.,10.0,6 July 2014
405,Looking, Good job HBO!,"Even though many say that this show isn't good, i must disagree. For the first time I'm able to see a show that is presenting the normal life of the gay people without many erotic scenes (I mean if you are looking for porn, then go watch porn..). So I think that this show is even better than QaF because it is much lighter, the characters are much more real (I mean Brian.. really? -.-)and grounded, also they are not feminine and finally, Looking is a show that presents us in a not stereotypical manner. I loved the thing that i didn't notice how the time flied while i watched the show, and at the end i felt like aw.. it ended.. :(. So I still can't understand why is there that much hate for this show. I have been looking for a show with gay main characters for a while now and i didn't like any of them as much as i liked the first episode of this show. Everything about this show is satisfying: The acting is very well, the plot is quite good (for a pilot at least), the characters are pretty likable, they are not like extremely hot nor ugly but quite normal looking and it makes you to connect with them so easily. I will definitely continue to watch this show and I sure hope that it will last long.",86 out of 109 found this helpful.,10.0,25 January 2014
406,Looking, Watch out for the must-see Looking! (See what I did there?),"Looking follows a trio of friends in San Francisco as they deal with various dating conundrums and relationship drama. The first season consists of just eight, 30-minute episodes – which sucks, because this series is great and addictive.<br/><br/>Some people have called Looking the gay(er) version of Sex and the City, although that doesn't do the newcomer justice. There are funny bits, sure, but these flow naturally from everyday, believable situations. The tone is more documentary, far less exaggerated, and there isn't a new hook or theme each week. It's just a continuing story that is soap-like without getting soapy. The series doesn't rush, giving intimate scenes – with engaging, natural dialogue – room to breathe. Andrew Haigh's influence as a director is clear. He previously made the well-received movie Weekend, which has the same style. (Though not he but Michael Lannan is the main writer and creator of Looking.)<br/><br/>The cast is charming and convincing. And fairly hot, which doesn't hurt, as there is some not-too-crude nudeness. The three main players are Patrick Murray (Jonathan Groff) a twinky game designer who has awkward sexual tension with his boss, Agustín (Frankie J. Alvarez) a scruffy artist who has trouble finding his inspiration and Dom (Murray Bartlett) a mustached, beefcake waiter with ambitions of opening his own restaurant. Supporting are the scruffy artist's boyfriend (O.T. Fagbenle), Dom's business partner and potential love interest Lynn (Quantum Leap and Enterprise's Scott Bakula), Patrick's aforementioned boss (Russell Tovey of Being Human), Dom's best girl-friend Doris (Lauren Weedman) and last but not least; Richie (Raúl Castillo), Patrick's hot and sincere love interest. An entire, sweet and sexy episode simply follows Richie and Patrick on their first date.<br/><br/>It's great to see a group of characters who are representative of gay life without trying too hard. They aren't caricatures and the series doesn't strain something trying to check all the boxes of all the sub-scenes within the gay scene. It doesn't run screaming from gay stereotypes but also doesn't overly sashay towards them. The Big Gay Issues have yet to take center stage – marriage, adoption, discrimination – the show being less militant than something like Queer as Folk. (Opinions may differ on that being good or bad for the gay cause.) Though there is barely a straight person in sight, and only one recurring woman in the cast, anybody watching the series could easily relate to the emotional turmoil these characters go through, regardless of their own orientation.<br/><br/>I generally prefer quality over quantity, but Looking is too high- quality for me to not want more quantity. So it's good that a second season is in the works, due late 2014 / early 2015. I guess that it will feature a love-triangle (or two) and I hope that it will show a bit more of the origin of the 'main three'. You don't see them together a lot and their dynamic with each other hasn't really been explored. As long as it stays this good, I will certainly keep Looking.<br/><br/>More reviews at: www.popcultjunk.com / Twitter: @PopCultJunk",20 out of 24 found this helpful.,8.0,30 June 2014
407,Looking, Wow 10/10,"Wow. I never give things 10/10 but Looking has to be an exception.<br/><br/>The writing, acting and directing are first class, and it's very funny. The characters are rounded and flawed - you care about them, but they aren't perfect - just like real human beings! They are forced to confront themselves at various points, and find out who they are, which isn't always what they thought they were. Uncomfortable though that is, these are experiences we all have in our lives, and are rendered with integrity and humour here.<br/><br/>All three of the (very different) main characters were beautifully cast. Jonathan Groff was immediately relatable as the anxious, rather naive, nice-looking white boy Patrick. Dom played by Murray Bartlett looked (presumably intentionally) like something straight out of Tales of the City with his tache, a guy on the cusp of early middle age, realising that he needs to take a leap into doing something more solid with his life (workwise as well as sex/relationship wise). And Frankie Alvarez - diminutive in stature but not charisma - was stunning as Agustin, a seemingly confident guy sliding down the path into self-negating oblivion, before trying to rebuild himself.<br/><br/>I really liked that the main parts weren't too Hollywoody. They didn't look like Instagram models. OK, so none of them are exactly ugly, but there wasn't any of that Tom Daley abs stuff that is (at least to me as a straight woman) really off-putting and unrealistic. They had soft bits and hairy bits just like real dudes!<br/><br/>The sex scenes were not overly graphic, but they seemed fairly realistic, and were often romantic and tender as well as funny (just like real-life sex). There were also lots of nice views of the male body and attractive boys making out. (Despite being half the population, women don't often get the chance to view storytelling through eyes other than the ""straight male gaze"" and it's always a breath of fresh air to have men/male beauty objectified on film. That women can often only find this approach in gay male-themed films is telling, but another story.)<br/><br/>The other characters were also well cast and, as a Brit, it was nice to see British actors such as O-T Fagbenle and Russell Tovey in there (as well as British director Andrew Haigh). I've never been a huge fan of Russell Tovey (didn't like him at all in recent BBC drama Years and Years) but the part of Kevin works for him. Is it because the role he plays is similar to his own character, a working-class gay bloke with a bit of an attitude problem? Not sure.<br/><br/>As a female viewer, I would've personally liked to see a few more fully fledged female characters. However Lauren Weedman was very funny and relatable as Doris, the ballsy and acerbic kind of woman gay men tend to love, and had an amazing chemistry with Dom. You really believed they'd known each other for years.<br/><br/>Otherwise, perfection. Even with Russell Tovey in the mix ;)",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,4 December 2019

411,Looking, A flip look at a topic that some people think you should only approach seriously...,"The show is called ""Looking"", therefore, they are 'looking' for encounters. It's not pretending to be any different than what it is.<br/><br/>People may say that it's an unflattering representation - but it's still a highly pushed gay show... When the market is flooded with examples of such, then you can choose the one that's the most ennobling, but for now, it's still a small step in the right direction... We've had serious programs like ""Queer as Folk"" before, but never something so conventional and light hearted, whose only difference from similar shows with straight leads is that it's told from an alternative point of view. It may focus on a minority of a minority, but so what? I think that's only because it's trying to be less 'pro-advancement', and more casual. <br/><br/>It's getting so much attention because programs that are perceived to be 'flagship' in some way often have the most difficulty bedding in. They're expected to carry the can for everything, and you can't please all of the people, all of the time. That's why it's getting a fair amount of criticism, I think, because it's not weightier, given the subject it takes on.",24 out of 36 found this helpful.,7.0,29 January 2014

Probably they only watched the first episodes. I suggest watch it in full. It is moderately paced. It takes time to get to know the characters but you will get involved in the end. That's how I experienced it.<br/><br/>The acting is quite natural and their conversations feel like ad-libs. Kudos to Jonathan Groff as Patrick, who seems not to be acting at all. Get perked with Kevin with his British sways and accent. Sympathize with romantic Richie or feel the nervousness of Dom as he prepares for the pop-up.

414,Looking, Looking forward to it,"There's not much gay drama after Queer as Folk,and many starts to compare Looking with QAF,which i think is no suitable. Even though they both focus on the topic homosexuality, but QAF is more of a fantasy, how many Brian are there in the whole world? For Looking, it is much more realistic, it can really shows that the gay people's lives is no difference with straight people, simple and pale. For the characters, i have to admit that Brian and Justin are better couple,because they look they should be together anyway. Actually, I really like Patrick, easygoing and thoughtful, most important of all is that he is a good friend, no good suggestion but is always there. For his relationship with Richie, I really don't feel they can make a good pair! Richie is cool but it's just a little too bossy, I think. I definitely in love with Patrick's boss, Kevin. First, his name is hot. Second, he really seems to care his boyfriend. Third, he is hot. The way he behaves like joking with Patrick really makes me think that he has a crush on him. Remember the scene that Patrick turns him down on the food and leaving for the bar, and meeting Richie later then, I think Patrick is so manly. Even though he has a feeling for Kelvin, but he knows what he wants and will not interrupt other people's relationship. I hope that Patrick will be together with Kelvin as soon as possible, I can't wait to see the hot scene of them both! Back to the show, I really love this kind of simple life of Patrick and his friends, finding true love and making money at the same time. The part that I don't really like about is that, Patrick's friends appear too few, I think the show should work harder on the friendship and really build a strong bond between them. And the relationships of his friends is extremely important too. Because friendship is as important as love, right? And sometimes i do feel that there is too much unnecessary scenes, and actually i still can't figure out the theme of the show. Is it about finding true love or what? Or just simply describing their lives? It should learn from QAF to have a main plot, which is Brian&amp;Justin's relationship, and this plot is going to connect every scene and every episode, every season. Last thing really matter me is that, please let Kelvin appears more!! He is the spot of the show, I'm looking forward to his appearance every episodes.

415,Looking, The best so far,"This is by far the best gay television ever produced, and far better than all but one or two gay movies. Its greatness is owed to only two of the many talented people involved, without whom it would be merely good: Andrew Haigh, the creative genius behind it, and Jonathan Groff, its spectacularly versatile, gifted and delightful star.<br/><br/>The episodes written and directed by Haigh are so perfect they make me want to sing (I can't sing); the episodes written and directed by others are all right, but more tedious than fascinating.<br/><br/>The very, very best episodes are the ones featuring Groff (Patrick) and Raúl Castillo, who plays Patrick's boyfriend Richie. They're the sweetest, sexiest, and yet most thoroughly believable romantic scenes I've ever seen anywhere. No melodrama, lots and lots of truth and intelligence. An American never could have created such a program as Looking; very few from anywhere could have either, which is why I call Haigh a genius.<br/><br/>The first season follows an arc, but a quality arc, not a story arc. They get consistently better through Episode Five, then gradually fall off after that. But even at its worst, Looking is the very best there is.<br/><br/>Two of the lead actors (Groff and Murray Bartlett) are openly gay, which helps A LOT. Not only does it increase Looking's credibility, but it minimizes the number of stupid, insulting but evidently obligatory ""How was it kissing a man?"" interviews with straight actors.",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,,16 January 2015
416,Looking, Interesting - But a little like cotton candy,"While ""Looking"" does attempt to address some of the many situations of the average gay, it falls a little short on the reality. A bit fluffy and with so many stereotypes in the line up of characters, it comes across as a bit too Hollywood. I suppose that this is necessary in order to catch the attentions of the ""Non gay"" audience after all most of the straight people out there who turn on the t.v. to watch this series on a regular basis, must have quite a bit of curiosity about us. It's almost like a bad accident: You simply can't turn away, you have to look just one more time and see what's going on. Well, ""Looking"" is much the same way. I remember when watching ""Brokeback Mountain"" for the first time. I was more interested in the audience's reaction to the first deep mouth to mouth kiss and also when the belt came off and the action started in the tent. The audience gasped and then went silent. I watched as the people in the theater began to squirm in their seats and turn away - it was uncomfortable for them. The little whispers in the theater were of disgust and revulsion. Oh well life goes on and this scene gave a hint of it - like it or not! This series has some really great potential, if the producers and writers decide to get down to some serious creativity. I hope that by the time the story gets started, the public can see that we gay people have a lot more in common with the straights than simply ""Looking!"" We are real people who live our lives in a heterosexual world all the while fitting into society in our own way. I'm going to continue following this story just because there is so little on the tele. anymore to keep a person from falling asleep with the remote. Hopefully, there will be some really memorable moments before the series ends and it will provide some insight for the curious out there in t.v. land.

418,Looking," Traditional soap opera conventions are strengthened by great writing, acting","""Looking"" is sort of this generation's ""Boys in the Band"", the 1968 play (and 1970 film) that centered on gay men living in New York. We follow three men living in San Francisco, each at different stages in their romantic lives. One, Agustin, is moving in with his long time boyfriend, leaving behind perpetually single, and possibly commitment phobic Patrick, while their friend Dom is weary of growing older and hooking up with younger men. As the season progresses, these story lines get more complicated, as Agustin's carelessness jeopardizes his relationship, Patrick finds himself in a love triangle, and Dom finds himself falling for his older business partner. The show really just employs traditional soap opera conventions to it story lines, but what strengthens it are the actors and the writing. Jonathan Groff is likable and believable as Patrick, as is Murray Bartlett as Dom, and Frankie J Alvaraz, who plays Agustin is good in his role, but his character is unlikeable (and maybe deliberately so). The supporting cast is fantastic too and the scripts are both witty and engaging, Russell Tovey is fantastic as Patrick's new boss. The show's story lines are fairly realistic, and the characters are three dimensional and develop as the season goes along. They are selfish, they seem like real people.

The show touches on youth obsession, std paranoia, the Dom/Sub complex, subtle racism/elitism, infidelity, etc.<br/><br/>Patrick, as a character is surprisingly complex. He is from an upper middle class upbringing but doesn't seem to be living a Sex in the City like lifestyle that happens far to often in these types of dramas. Hes got a normal job as a geekchic video game designer. He is a bit bashful and verbally clumsy but adventurous in the same breath. The fact that he was an unattractive nerd growing up and is now a decent looking adult in good ol SF, he is exploring his ""options"". I think many can relate. I would say hats off to Jonathan Goff for his performance as the character but I feel like he is honestly just being himself in the role, which works out great.<br/><br/>I love how most of the cast is attractive but not like they shopped out of a model catalog when choosing cast members(ala Grey's Anatomy). They all feel more natural.....even if there is a strange beard fetish emanating from the show. One character sports a pornstach but still able to look good with it. This all adds to the believability of the show for me.<br/><br/>Yes, some of the characters can be a bit promiscuous, but is this wrong? I think not. Its no secret that many gay men enjoy anon encounters. That is not news. I personally find it belittling to think that only the most noble envisioned gay characters should be allowed to grace TV. Gays have flaws, just like any other when it comes to looking for the one or coping with loneliness.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,14 March 2014
420,Looking, Authentic and entertaining,"I absolutely love the episode where Patrick and Richie get to know each other, it is so authentic and as a woman made me think differently about men in general. Richie is a keeper! Too bad they don't show nudity. The series is emotionally raw, culturally educational, not over dramatized, and keeps the viewer interested even if they don't connect with one of the characters due to the engaging interactions within the cast. The addition of a female friend who is straight, edgy, sassy, bs detector, and cute makes me want a gay male bff. The character development is well written and acted. Really glad I happened upon this series, it's been a pleasant surprise.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,24 July 2016
421,Looking, Pleasantly surprised,"As someone who used to love Queer as Folk, I can say that this show is nothing like it. And that's a good thing. In Looking not everything is about being gay. It's sort of accepted, unsaid, but obviously there. It's about the characters' development - characters who happen to be gay - every day problems, joys and disappointments. Life. What I loved most about this first season of Looking was how much I came to care about the 3 main characters. And that shows me that they are well thought-out characters, not some superficial gay stereotypes, whatever their age might be. I think the only minus for me was Richie. I didn't really get him, I wasn't really feeling the chemistry between him and Patrick. He went from super-being into Patrick to I don't even know, at one point I wasn't even sure he was gay and out. Some of his scenes were painful to watch honestly. Dom's character grew on me, and I became really invested in his relationship with flower-guy (hope to see more of them!!!). And the whole Patrick/Kevin thread was so subtly done, always giving us just a little more and then withdrawing that connection. So many possibilities for the characters storyline-wise to go to. I just want more of them, know more about them. Really impressed by the whole thing so far!",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,17 March 2014
422,Looking, Brilliant and Engrossing Gay Soap,"Made by HBO this has quality written all over it. Based in San Francisco we meet three gay friends Patrick, Augustin and Dom. They are all at the ages when life becomes more serious which normally coincides with your options getting ever limited. Dom is a waiter about to turn forty and he really wants to be his own boss and meet that certain someone. Patrick makes video games and is single but sometimes lacking belief in his own talent. He also has a new boss and he is not only young, good looking but English.<br/><br/>Then Augustin has met that special someone and set up home but seems to be pressing the self destruct button in everything he does almost as if he can't bear the thought of having it all. The three of them have their separate hills to climb and each other for support. This is the beginning of their stories.<br/><br/>This is just brilliant a rival to the original 'Queer as folk' and it does have some sex based scenes but this is not a porn fest at all. It is all about relationships, life, dreams and the harsh realities of life. There are some great performances here – actually there is not one bad one. I loved seeing Scott Bakula as a special guest and also Russell Tovy keeping the Brit end up – if you will forgive the pun. They have made a second series too so hopefully this is one that is here to stay – at least for a while.",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,2 May 2015
423,Renegade, Great light-weight escapist entertainment!,"OK, it seems everybody here is blasting this show for it's cheesy tissue-thin plots, mediocre acting and repetitive stunts.<br/><br/>So what? You have to recognize this for what it is: A clear modern-day retelling of that most famous of all western TV series...the 'Lone Ranger'!<br/><br/>That's right, in case you are one of the few to have watched this show and not figured that out right away, its the 'Lone Ranger' all over again.<br/><br/>Star Lorenzo Lamas as the title-character 'Reno Raines' is even an ex Army Ranger!<br/><br/>Instead of being ambushed by Butch Cavendish and being the 'lone' survivor of his Texas Ranger team, forever hunted by Cavendish as he goes about his business looking to bring the nasty Cavendish to justice, good-guy cop Reno Raines' wife (girlfriend?) is murdered by Dutch Dixon, and evil cop who was not successful in trying to kill Reno and everyone he loved.<br/><br/>And just as the 'Lone Ranger' had his trusty Indian side-kick 'Tonto', Reno also pals around with his trusty Indian side-kick 'Bobby Sixkiller'.<br/><br/>Whereas John Ried (The Lone Ranger) had as his faithful steed 'Silver', his powerful huge white horse, Reno too travels through the 'Badlands' on his trusted 'Steel Horse', an '89 Harley Davidson 'Soft Tail', mildly customized with a classic and typical flamed paint job on the tank, and a weathered,well used look about it. No shiny, pristine 'boulevard cruiser' this bike!<br/><br/>In fact, not only was the Bon Jovi mega-hit 'Wanted: Dead or Alive' the inspiration for this show, the original 3-minute film used to sell the series to prospective syndication customers across the nation was accompanied by the complete song as it's soundtrack. Clearly, it worked well, and captured the spirit of the intended series perfectly, for the resultant series is remarkably unchanged from the 'short' that sold it.<br/><br/>Lamas' wife (at the time) Kathleen Kinmont was added to the cast as Sixkillers Caucasian half-sister, not a bad eye-candy diversion for those who appreciate such things.<br/><br/>As corny and simplistic as the show was, it is clear everyone involved had a true affection for the project and turned in serious performances of clearly light-weight and silly material. This only tends to add to its already somewhat charming appeal.<br/><br/>Lamas so closely fit the role of 'Reno', that if he truly was not exactly that character in his real life, he obviously had some real fantasies of being that character. He fit the role like a glove.<br/><br/>Remember, its not a documentary. Just enjoy it for what it is: An hour-long diversion with a cool bike, a couple other cool cars, some good-looking heroic people doing heroic things, and a clear 'good vs evil' plot line.<br/><br/>Enjoy!",28 out of 35 found this helpful.,,27 April 2005

426,Renegade, Good action show!,"From Stephan J Cannell, creator of shows like The A Team and Greatest American Hero, comes Renegade. Cannell is widely experienced in TV, with countless production credits and many creative credits too. Renegade is a good standard action series, with decent production values and has a simple premise, and is easy to get into. It's not too fantastical for those who never got into shows like Buffy or Xena, it's just good repetitious fun like A-Team, Incredible Hulk and Knight Rider. You have a scenario that is always repeated. In Renegade, Lorenzo Lamas is a bounty hunter and ex-cop on the run from the law. He was set up by his old boss, his wife shot and left for dead, and Lorenzo was framed for the murder of a cop. Now he must get try to prove his innocence but for the time being he collects bounty's to pay for the hospital bills for is vegetative girl, who is only alive through life support, she will never regain consciousness. So each episode follows the pattern of Lorenzo collecting bounties, coming into contact with people who aren't what the seem. It is not a cohesive show running on an interconnected story like say 24, there is no real continuity, except mentions back to the hospitalised bird, so if you watch episode 6 before 3 for example it's not going to cause problems. It's a new story for each episode entirely separate from the last, like David Banner or the A -Team who roam place to place, Reno Raines is also a drifter moving through the USA helping people.<br/><br/>This show was very successful, in fact one of Cannell's most successful, and although not as iconic or worldwide famous as A- Team, it actually ran longer. The show had a 5 year run which isn't bad going in this day and age, where a second season is almost a godsend for some network shows. Renegade is a well made action series. Each episode will treat you to some action, while the acting is quite good. Lorenzo makes a good lead. He has a movie star quality and it is a surprise that he has never made it bigger in the movie world, particularly as an action star. He has more acting ability than many fellow action men, yet of course starring in low budget Z-movies doesn't have the same inspiration as he got from his hit shows like Renegade, Falcon Crest and currently with The Bold and The Beautiful. Lamas after all is a Golden Globe nominee. Lamas is of course a capable action man with his martial arts background, and most who have seen his shows or movies will know, he loves to pose for the camera, and clearly loves himself, he has a cocky, showy air of the Hoff (Dave Hasselhoff!) about him. Branscombe Richmond offers excellent support as Lama's helper Bobby Sixkiller, while Kathleen Kinmont is stunning to behold. She really is fine, and the show takes delight in milking that fact with her wearing an array of revealing outfits.<br/><br/>Overall a good show that from the episodes I have seen is blessed with some capable guest stars and proudly allows Lamas and is perfect pantene hair to get into many a good scrape.",13 out of 21 found this helpful.,,19 September 2005
427,Renegade, Unintentionally Funny...,"I remember when Renegade first came out back in 1992, the opening narration went something like this, ""He was cop and pretty good at his job.  But then he committed the ultimate sin and testified against other cops gone bad. Framed for murder, they got the woman he loved.  Now he's on the run, a bounty hunter, a RENEGADE"".  F*ck man, back in 1992 I had a hard time keeping a straight face listening to something as stupid as that.  This show was created by Stephen J. Cannell, who usually creates the best action/comedy/police shows around.  Cannell is an Emmy award winning writer that has written many spectacular cop shows like The Rockford Files, Wiseguy, and The Commish.  Cannell has also created some wildly imaginative TV shows like The Greatest American Hero and The A-Team.<br/><br/>
But Renegade was a Cannell miss in my opinion.  The plot was basically just a retread of The A-Team.   But instead of 4 Vietnam vets on the run from the law for a crime they didn't commit, we get one guy this time in Reno Raines. Reno is framed for a murder he didn't commit and is also on the run from the law and a corrupt cop named Dutch Dixon, played very badly by Stephen J. Cannell.  Dixon is a total ham.  Reno Raines is constantly on the run, but somehow he still has time to help out every single small town goober he runs into.  The problem I had with Renegade is that I couldn't figure out if Steve Cannell was serious or not with this show and it's over the top plots and campy action sequences.  With the A-Team, at least we always knew not to take any of that stuff seriously.  That show had it's tongue firmly in it's cheek.  But Renegade is written and acted in the most DEAD SERIOUS way and it just comes across as totally retarded.<br/><br/>Let's say you're a wanted man with a bounty on your head.  Are you going to ride around on a big ass Harley Davidson bike, complete with long hair and a black trenchcoat?  AND hang around a big long haired Native American with a name like Bobby Sixkiller?  Oh yes, I'm sure no one will ever be able to ID you.  Yes I know there is a Lone Ranger motif going on here, as there is with all Stephen J. Cannell shows, but this was just way too much.  It wasn't subtle, but instead pounded you over the head with a sledgehammer. Reno also used the alias Vince Black ALL THE FREAKING TIME!!  This was just totally crazy sh*t.  Only a moron that was wanted from the law would act like Reno Raines.  Another thing about Dutch Dixon....Mr. Cannell, Col. Decker was a far better antagonist for the A-Team. Hey Cannell, stick to writing better scripts and novels then Renegade.  And please for the love of God Steve, don't ever try to act again.",23 out of 45 found this helpful.,,18 January 2004
428,Renegade, Decent Show,"This show came out when there were a lot of first run syndicated programs. I thought the writing and plots of the show were good enough to watch to week after week. Yeah, it had a couple of cheesy moments, but what do you expect from a show that doesn't have the budget of network shows? I remember them shooting in San Diego, CA. They even came to Southwestern College (a school I was attending at the time) to shoot some scenes.<br/><br/>Anyways, if you're an open minded person, and can overlook some ""moments"" and try to take in the plots of episodes, then you can enjoy this show.<br/><br/>If you're a big time nitpicker and that's all you do, then stay away from it and leave it alone.",12 out of 21 found this helpful.,8.0,15 May 2007

This is the first ever Region 1 DVD that I've had to import to the UK as it's that good! Buy it now! Lorenzo Lamas is a brilliant actor and superb martial artist. The only problem this series ever had was lack of exposure which probably killed it off much the same way as ""Tropical Heat"". Think of it as a modern day Knight Rider but without the Sci-Fi of KITT and a hero who is one of the best fighters ever. Combine that with the constant threat of police capture (much like the A-Team) and you have ""Renegade"".

430,Renegade, A Fun Series Worth Revisiting,"I used to love watching Renegade on late night television in the 90's. Renegade starring Lorenzo Lamas, Branscombe Richmond, and Kathleen Kimont (Seasons 1-4) was a show about an innocent cop named Reno Raines, who was forced to go on the run when he turned over evidence regarding some crook cops in Bay City, California (Bay City doesn't actually exist in real life).<br/><br/>After being captured by talented and brash bounty hunter, Bobby Sixkiller, Bobby soon realizes Reno is innocent and Reno is hired by Sixkiller to take down many fugitives on the run. During this time, Reno with the help of Sixkiller and his half-sister, Cheyenne tries to clear his innocent name.<br/><br/>The show is fun and action paced, and it is fun watching Lamas show his real-life extensive knowledge of martial arts throughout the series. The show contains funny dialogue at times, but some of the story lines are downright compelling.<br/><br/>The show also features its creator, Stephen J.Cannell, in a recurring role is number one bad guy and dirty cop, Dutch Dixon. Cannell is a surprisingly good actor and has the uncanny ability to tick you off with his smugness.<br/><br/>Most fans will also grow to love the character of Bobby Sixkiller. While Sixkiller definitely loves money, he has a heart of gold and often sticks his neck out for his friend, Reno Raines.<br/><br/>The first three seasons of Renegade are especially good. The fourth season is more of a mixed bag with some episodes really good, while some episodes seem to focus more on the silly. By the middle of the fourth season, we no longer see Kathleen Kimont on the show at all. Her character was featured heavily the first season of Renegade and then she began appearing less and less (In truth, Kimont was married to Lamas but got a divorce after the first season. Her role began to lessen from that point forward).<br/><br/>The fifth season of Renegade showed a show running out of ideas. The story lines were less compelling though it still had its moments. The first four seasons of Renegade were syndicated through hundreds of stations and the fifth season became exclusive to the USA Network. It was a surprise when USA cancelled Renegade after the fifth season because though the show was starting to show its age, it definitely had another season or two left in.<br/><br/>I cringe when people claim this show was cheesy. It did have some elements of that, but the show was a good watch and fun. In a day and age of nothing but CSI shows and reality television, it is nice to actually be able to watch something that is just flat out fun.",9 out of 15 found this helpful.,9.0,24 February 2014
431,Renegade, Good series ruined by Branscombe Richmond's obnoxious personality,"Lorenzo Lamas was a good actor for an action series about a motorcyclist bounty hunter. In some ways, Renegade was a lot like Wanted: Dead or Alive, the TV series from the 1950s with Steve McQueen. McQueen hunted bounties with his horse, Lamas used his motorcycle.<br/><br/>Lamas had great chemistry with co-star Kathleen Kinmont, who played Cheyenne Phillips. If more of the show had been spent on their teamwork and bounty hunting, it would have been a lot better. Lamas was pretty low-key, so he worked well with the guest stars and he was reliable in his role as fugitive bounty hunter.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Branscombe Richmond had a large part in the show, and he was totally obnoxious and annoying. ""Bobby Sixkiller"" played the owner of the bounty hunting business, and he would frequently show up to tell Reno Raines (Lamas) about how rich and successful he was. Bobby Sixkiller never stops yapping about himself. His character was pretty useless. The show would have been better without him.<br/><br/>Stephen Canell, the big-shot writer of many famous TV series, played the main villain, and he was a really cheesy villain. This was an ego trip for him, since he was not an actor, but because it was his show (and he was the writer), he could push himself into the cast. This was another reason that Renegade did not succeed.<br/><br/>Lorenzo Lamas played his part as a fugitive motor cycling bounty hunter very well. It could have been a pretty good TV show. It had a lot of fun moments and good action.",8 out of 13 found this helpful.,,6 April 2019
432,Renegade," Great exploration into the human mind, but not without it's fair share of flaws","Renegade is one of the great precursors to the golden age of television that we experience today. The tragic story about Reno Raines and his friends is a dark story about the inner darkness of man, but also shows the capacity for goodness humanity has. Much of the credit goes to Lorenzo Lamas in the lead role. He's a tour de force as Reno Raines and makes the audience emphasize with a character many great actors would fail to portray. The series isn't without flaws though. Sometimes the themes lack the subtlety you could wish for and the themes often get's an almost preachy vibe. This make's my score of the show a couple of notches lower, but make no mistake. This is an excellent show that everyone should watch and enjoy.

438,Renegade, American Escapism Television At It's Best,"Renegade is my favorite TV series ever. The perfect combination of gripping stories, beautiful scenery set against a backdrop of lush blue-sky, gorgeous women, and awesome vehicles. Lorenzo Lamas, Branscombe Richmond, and Stephen Cannell are all perfectly cast as their individual characters, and Kathleen Kinmont does a fine job also.<br/><br/>I remember when I was a teenager, watching this show with my Dad, or if it was a school-night, waking up at 1am to watch this back-to-back with Nash Bridges on a channel called ITV here in England.<br/><br/>But for me, the show has extended past just sentimentality. Today still in 2013, it's the 'Go-To' show for me whenever I have a spare hour to burn at home. As much as shows such as Lost, Prison Break, and Breaking Bad were all grippingly amazing, the beauty of Renegade is that you can watch a random episode from any series anytime you want without having to catch up to speed with the series' plot line.<br/><br/>Renegade does have a plot-line; being that Reno Raines was framed for a crime which he didn't commit, and is on the run from Lieutenant Dutch Dixon, but over the course of the five years in which Renegade aired, they tended to dip in and out of this bigger story throughout each series. Which made for an interesting premise because the viewer at home, as did Reno Raines himself, would never know which episodes Dixon would show up. (Well, at least it was supposed to be that way if it were not for the spoilers; If you saw Stephen J. Cannnell's name pop up at the start of an episode, you knew he would be in that episode).<br/><br/>Raines is on the run from the law, all he wants to do is clear his name and settle down to live a quiet comfortable life. In actual fact, he lives a great life; riding around under the Californian sunshine on his Harley Davidson, catching the bad guys, with an endless supply of beautiful women from all different walks of life falling in love with him. Each new episode would provide a new woman and new criminal with a totally different walk of life to the previous episode. <br/><br/>Some of the back drops are just wonderful too with a mixture of varying settings depending on each episode, depicting different walks of life; there are lot of scenes of Reno Raines riding through big cities, beaches, deserts, and small simple towns with tiny populations on his Harley which sets the scene nicely, all the tune of some very cool music. <br/><br/>It's American escapism television at it's best, and gets 10 out of 10 from me.",5 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,29 June 2013

445,Renegade, Great action show! Superb acting!,"The Renegade (Le rebelle for french viewers) is one of the best action shows running in France.

Definitely great storyline (with the relentless running away of Reno Raines and his quest to get back his true identity and eventually his honor). Sadly, the show was cancelled but reruns work just fine and make you rediscover this great action show",4 out of 9 found this helpful.,,5 June 1999
446,Renegade, Excellent show,"I remember watching this as a series when I was younger and noted that it was created by the same person who created the A-Team. It's different from the A-Team and aimed at a more mature audience. People get shot, die and the plot is a lot grittier.<br/><br/>The action scenes are a lot better than the A-Team. For one thing, there are real fire fights in which people get shot, the fights are choreographed much better since Lorenzo Lamas is a very good martial artist and there aren't silly one-liners to spoil them. In the A-Team all we got were punch ups that were obviously fake.<br/><br/>The characters are well developed. Bobby Sixkiller's character is explored in many episodes and I came to like him a lot. Cheyenne became superfluous towards the latter half of the show's run and I think removing her from the cast improved the show. Series creator Stephen J. Cannell played the series' antagonist Dutch Dixon and one can see that he really enjoyed playing him. The character is completely amoral with no sense of good in him at all and it's sometimes funny how he always seems to choose to do the most evil thing possible in any situation. I'd say that the episodes with him in are the best as he's played very enthusiastically by Cannell. Reno Raines on the other hand is completely moral and it seems impossible for him to do anything wrong, even when it would be in his benefit. Dixon and Raines were good opposites and the show benefited from this contrast.<br/><br/>The plots in the non-Dixon episodes are pretty much either Reno (Lamas' character) chasing evil villains who turn out really to be evil after all or episodes in which the people Reno chases are actually innocent (like him) and Reno and the gang trying to prove their innocence. There is a good mix of different criminals: rapists, murderers, mafia, terrorists, thieves, white collar etc and the criminal mind is explored a lot with a few plot twists thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>The complaints I had of the show were that sometimes the episodes were padded out with scenes of Reno riding his motorcycle with shots of his face, legs, the wheels etc being flipped to back and forth. The scenery was nice on the show so it wasn't that bad to watch this episode padding-out so to speak. The other complaint I have is that the show's extras were composed mainly of people who looked like supermodels. During the episodes we were treated to shots of half-naked beautiful women and while most would see this as a plus, I thought it made the show look cheap. Anyway, these complaints are small compared to how much I enjoyed the show. The action of the show is superb and I watch with anticipation every time Reno or Bobby are fighting villains.<br/><br/>There are a few plot holes such as why Dixon finds it so hard to catch Reno even when he's promoted to U.S. Marshal and that Reno is always hanging around Sixkiller Enterprises so he must be easy to find; but it's easy to ignore these minor details and enjoy the show for its many good points.",5 out of 13 found this helpful.,9.0,9 May 2012

448,Room 104, It's like if there was a 'random' button on your remote,"At first, I thought I was watching another Twilight Zone or Black Mirror, and I was excited about that. But as the series goes on, I wasn't sure what I was watching anymore. I watched episodes 1-6. These episodes ranged from pretty predictable Twilight Zone-style plots to touching dramas to whatever the hell happened with the cult episode to literally 30 minutes of interpretive dance. <br/><br/>So after 6 episodes, I'm calling it quits. I don't think it's a bad thing to question or be surprised about what you're watching, but there's a limit to that. If I'm in the mood for sports, I don't want to see a psychological thriller. If I'm in the mood for sci-fi action, I don't want a Charlie Chaplin silent film. The problem with Room 104 is that you don't know what you're watching until you've watched it (and with some episodes, you still don't know what you watched). It's like committing to watching whatever channel you land on after mashing the buttons on your remote.<br/><br/>With that said, the production values are pretty good, there are some good actors, and 1 of the 6 episodes had a twist that surprised me, so I gave it a 3/10.",97 out of 120 found this helpful.,3.0,8 September 2017

451,Room 104, Struggles for meaning,"I have about 10 of 24 episodes (thirty minute each) between seasons 1 and 2 of HBO's ""Room 104"" anthology. Besides a common setting, the nondescript double-bed hotel room 104, every episode is completely disconnected from each other in cast of characters and story, so each episode is its own unit. The episodes do share common elements and one rule, that the camera never leave the room.<br/><br/>The common elements consist often of fantastical surrealism or extreme psychological violence and a violation of boundaries, whether they be physical or emotional, or many times both such as in the act of sex. Because of this combination of surreal and many times bizarrely violent and apathetic ""Room 104"" remains compelling even as it disgusts, but maintains self-awareness enough of its own psychosis with characters often vocalizing ""I think there's something wrong with me"" so that you want to see if some redeeming moment can occur.<br/><br/>From what I have watched, ""Room 104"" doesn't hit its stride at a particular and remains inconsistent, with a sporadic episode between the seasons being especially redeeming or conversely, especially chilling in its 2017 nihilism (in season 2 episode 4 ""Hungry"" two men cut off each other's genitals and eat them, arguing with police officers about their ""right"" to do this since it's ""consensual"" and not technically ""illegal"").<br/><br/>""Room 104"" is very aware about being in the social media and internet age, often exploring themes involving Instagram, online dating, figuratively and literally talking to the wall (season 2 ep 5 ""Woman in the Wall""). Its characters are like those you find on the internet: the needy, the angry, the hypervigilant gender studies feminist (season 2 ep 12 ""Josie and Me,"" mentioning incel-speak ""beta""), the confused about identity. Many of the characters speak like the internet too--affected, too conscious of the hip (season 2 ep 3 ""Swipe Right"", possibly involving Tinder).<br/><br/>In many ways ""Room 104"" reflects a fickle and disturbed social media climate in a funhouse mirror style. The series is often surprising and sometimes engaging because of how original its fantastical surreal devices are (s2 ep5 ""Woman in the Wall"" being one). Sometimes all the extreme violence does work to show how corrupted certain issues like what is ""consensual"" have become (s2 ep4 ""Hungry"" and s2 ep12 ""Josie and Me). Perhaps the most cathartic episode is season 1 episode 5 ""The Internet"" which is an anomaly because of how normal it is, but it corresponds with the themes of disconnection and violation while needing for the opposite of both.<br/><br/>However for the most part, while highly original and promising, ""Room 104"" struggles for meaning and for emotional payoff, where the acts of horror have a point beyond their shock value or their inventiveness. Season 2 episode 2 ""Mr. Mulvahill"" (starring Rainn Wilson or Dwight Schrute of ""The Office"") is of the most shocking and inventive, but also effective because of its use of tension and a surprising twist.<br/><br/>Much of ""Room 104"" sounds better in retrospect than what my experience was, which was interested but generally dismal. I can partly recommend ""Room 104"" because of wanted to be and should've been, and sometimes for what it was. If you suffer patiently through some episodes you might get some reward, but just moderately so.<br/><br/>I am not sure if I will continue watching, but I believe there might be some creative genius that could still pull off a season 3. I wouldn't buy into any kind of hype though. ""Room 104"" is by and large indulgent and obnoxious, although sometimes mildly redemptive (season 1 episode 5 ""The Internet"").<br/><br/>I am not familiar of similar shows with an anthology structure, but if you like this kind of medley of fantasy and psychological horror and also like the theme of the internet age then I recommend tv series ""American Gods"" based on the books of Neil Gaiman. I do believe that ""Americans Gods"" offers more salve with the bruises its brutality inflicts, and more ultimate meaning beyond the violence alone.",24 out of 34 found this helpful.,5.0,20 May 2019

And then quelle surprise, he goads us into some dishwater story about how mom hung herself - before the ridiculous fight scene between a grown woman and a 30 kilo child, who she could break in half without even trying.

471,Room 104," twisted, dark, claustrophobic tale","Room 104 is Anthological series with different story in each episode. Every episode is a dark-ish comedy-drama with twist and turn. The ""comedy"" is really subtle that i don't think it should be included in comedy genre ( IMDb currently label Room 104 genre as comedy,drama ). The story is really different from each episode, so you can't really expect what story gonna be in every episode. But after i watch 4 episodes , my conclusion is that every episode has some dark twist in it. Some of the twist are darker than other. <br/><br/>The storyline in every episode is not bad , but it's doesn't reach the expectation it should have in order to make a single-set production work. It's understandable that some people might find it ""claustrophobic"" to watch because literally , they shoot the whole scene in one set. That's why good screenplay is highly needed to make this series good , and sadly Room 104 can't fulfill this and make this series kinda boring. And this is probably the only problem this series has ( although it's kinda a fatal mistake ) but other than that , every aspect of this series is quite good. The Acting , cinematography, directing is fine. <br/><br/>I don't understand the really low rating this show has ( 6,6 out of 10 ). even that shadowhunter show has better rating than this and that show is the worst series i've ever watched .

474,Jack Irish, Jack is back!,"Australian author Peter Temple's series of detective novels about Jack Irish have been lighting up television screens since 2012, when the first two adaptations were broadcast. An immediate hit, a third Jack Irish telefilm was broadcast in 2014.<br/><br/>Jack Irish is an emotionally wounded, borderline down-and-outer who had once been a successful lawyer but was professionally and personally derailed when his wife was murdered. Guy Pearce, the star of the JACK IRISH series, brings just the right amount of world-weariness to his role to suggest a classic film noir protagonist. The supporting cast, including Marta Dusseldorp as Jack's on again-off again love interest, Linda (who also stars in two other Autralian series--JANET KING and A PLACE TO CALL HOME) are just as compelling in their own way and the show is as much a series of character studies as it is a detective show.<br/><br/>Now we have JACK IRISH Season 1: BLIND FAITH, the most recent addition to the JACK IRISH canon, which is a six-part mini-series, a format that serves the story well. While not based on one of the JACK IRISH novels, it is as faithful to the original characters as die-hard fans might want it to be. With the increased running time, multiple story-lines can converge and develop without seeming rushed. Given that one of the story arcs focuses on religious extremism, (both Christian and Muslim) it is wise the makers of JACK IRISH recognized they needed a larger canvas to fairly examine the inherently sensitive issues. While it is common these days for people of faith to be portrayed negatively in film and television programs, it is encouraging to see some balance achieved amidst the accusations. Case in point: there is a scene in JACK IRISH--once we've established that a ""mega-church"" is behind a series of murders and other misdeeds--in which a character points out, while sitting in a soup kitchen, ""That fellow there runs this place. He makes $40,000 a year and gives most of it away. He's doing what the others SHOULD be doing."" (I paraphrase, but the gist is clear). One can only appreciate such fairness. It is a breath of fresh air, really. Of course, the principle characters are shown specifically to be non-believers, another annoying trend that needs to be addressed in this writer's opinion, but it's a start.<br/><br/>JACK IRISH is notable too for being about people who are older, from forty-somethings, like Irish, to a substantial cast of older, even elderly, characters. The regulars who haunt the bar Irish might call his second home are a great bunch of old codgers. And Irish's furniture-making mentor, an old master by the name of Charlie, whose infinite patience with Irish gives him the much-needed respite he occasionally needs from his problems, is a true rarity on television today. Interestingly, Charlie was portrayed in the first two JACK IRISH films by German actor Vadim Glowna, who passed away before the third film was made. The role is re-cast for the mini-series and features an actor named David Ritchie--who also passed away not long after the mini-series wrapped. Is the role of Charlie cursed? Only time will tell...<br/><br/>While it is not yet known whether there will be more JACK IRISH films/mini-series produced, it's a pretty good bet that there will be. The show is extremely well produced, brilliantly acted, with quirky humour, troubled romance and a world-view that, while sometimes cynical and dark, like the best of film noir, is ultimately life-affirming. Jack is a classic underdog and we want him to succeed, to get his life back together, to rekindle his romance with Linda (Dusseldorp's character).<br/><br/>How many characters on television today do we truly care about? Jack Irish is one of them.",32 out of 37 found this helpful.,10.0,12 August 2016
475,Jack Irish, More is less,"I loved the first three ""Jack Irish"" movies, they just went from strength to strength.<br/><br/>They formed a body of work that can stand comparison with the best in the crime/mystery genre such as ""Morse"", ""Lewis"", ""Wallander"", ""Jesse Stone"", and ""Vera.""<br/><br/>All share key ingredients that are even more important than a cutting-edge plot, the critical one being that the lead character must have feeling. It doesn't matter how tough or worldly-wise they are, these people know your pain. All the best ones understand human failings even if they don't always forgive them. Wit serves their characters well - not so much cynicism, but a knowing, world-weary wit.<br/><br/>The first three ""Jack Irish"" movies had those qualities in spades, plus unique, beautifully realised characters right down the cast list.<br/><br/>But I'm not so sure about the latest 6-part series. I think the extended format works against the tighter format of the movie length episodes. Where the filmmakers edited to fit 90-minutes, they now extend to fill 4-hours plus.<br/><br/>There are still clever touches and some very funny lines, and you can't fault the performances, but there are definitely some well-worn themes: a trail that leads to crooked politicians; ruthless multinationals; terrorists, and that old favourite of just about every series, the cult church with dark motives. Despite sub-plots going off in all directions, the principle that 'no one is introduced for nothing' is applied with a vengeance - no one is random, everything is connected.<br/><br/>Familiar elements added spice to the first three movies, but here things are perilously close to being over-spiced. Jack's buddies get a major workout with a lot more business to get through.<br/><br/>A factor is possibly the creation of more content for a voracious medium, but I can't help feeling that the six episodes would have made two more succinct movies along the lines of ""Bad Debts"", ""Black Tide"" and ""Dead Point"".<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see where ""Jack Irish"" goes from here.",23 out of 27 found this helpful.,7.0,29 April 2016

I started watching Jack Irish the movies versions last year. I was pleasantly surprised that they made it into a TV series. It is a great watch, because it is so not like any other show on television. I'm hoping for more, a second season and continue on from there. This is one television show that should be aired in the United States. It deserves a larger audience.<br/><br/>I am really in a kind of quite love affair with the Blackhawk that Pearce drives in the series. I just wonder how many are still running around the down-under continent? Australia has a knack for holding on to a lot of nostalgic artifacts of American origin or design.

478,Jack Irish, Gets the quirky confused with the serious.,"The show has it's merits as it attempts to have the quirky comedic side story parallel the serious detective story. The quirky side has characters and plot lines that go from inane to stupid, the detective side has serious business going on. Unfortunately the inane and stupid too often migrate to the serious side. The police are either invisible or incompetent, the bad guys get to be bad without consequences episode after episode, and poor old Marta Dusseldorp gets hung out to dry (luckily she has a much better gig in Sydney circa 1950's).

It contains a number of quirky plot twists and of funny, picturesque characters (such as a Greek chorus of old men propping up the bar and reminiscing about a long-forgotten sports legend), but it also dares to tackle serious, contemporary themes. On the whole the mix works ; I suppose mainly as a result of the casting and acting, both of which are exceptional. Many of the characters look and feel like real, living individuals one could meet in a pub, a courtroom, a self-help group for recovering addicts.<br/><br/>I for one hope to watch the next seasons too.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,8.0,7 April 2019

491,Jack Irish, Typical Liberal POV - Boring Outcomes,"This TV series had me interested as a new customer of AcornTV. Unfortunate though I have to say, is that the series quickly took a deep dive into liberal politics and typical sterotypes. Jack is the main character, but he comes across as an idiot and womanizer who is about as Dumb as they come. The main Women in the series are obnoxious in their brazen attitudes toward society. The so-called ""Journalist"" is of course, a Woman, braving thieves, drug dealers, crime lords, while the Artist Lover hates everything and everyone she considers ""Normal"". A hatred of Jesus, she acts superior to all. She is unlikable as are all the characters.

It must have been a combination of marketing at Walmart and other retailers with episodes (including episodes in Spanish) available on YouTube, and then eventually iTunes purchases. Since then it has been an off-and-on favorite of both kids (mostly in Spanish translation) through 2019. It's not bad, but a little too much of a massive Disney advertisement for my taste: the underlying message that any girl, even ""commoners,"" can become a princess by learning, and the regular cameos by ""real"" Disney princesses such as Ariel, is thinly veiled marketing.

517,The Bonfire of Destiny," Beautifully filmed, atmospheric period piece","I watched this because my favourite French actress, Audrey Fleurot stars in it and she's magnificent as the tormented flame haired heroine Adrienne. However, all the cast are fantastic, the period detail and costuming excellent and the horrific fire scene in the first episode, which happens in real time, devastating, upsetting and thrilling all at once. The story is a fin de ciecle tale of the rich and the poor set in Paris and filmed in some the most beautiful houses I have ever seen on film. The story is a ""page turner"", well paced, gripping and with characters you care about. I wanted all the women whose stories are told after the dreadful fire, to have happy endings. If you are looking for a French ""Downton Abbey"" this may be a bit gory and there are a few tasteful sex scenes although minimal nudity. The 18 certificate is presumably for the injury detail after the inferno, which is pretty grim. I watched the whole 8 episodes in two sittings. Recommended for anyone who likes bodice ripping historical drama although this series did have a feminist twist, most of the men either being weak or hissably villainous! Overall, extremely good Gallic drama with very high production values. 9 out of 10.",10 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,11 January 2020
518,The Bonfire of Destiny, A Great Piece of Story Telling,"First of all I have to say that I have no criticism, whatsoever, of this series. I am a student of the French Language so I recommend watching it in French with sub-titles, as watching it dubbed loses more than half of the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This is a fictional tale set in the aftermath of a genuine event of 1897 when there was a huge and terrible fire at a charity event in Paris which claimed the lives of 125 people, most of whom were aristocratic ladies. The story revolves around the lives of three women who survived the fire: one unscathed but affected, one badly burnt and disfigured and one who is uninjured but................well! Wait and see.<br/><br/>The drama is set in Paris in 1897 and the producers have done a great job of capturing the atmosphere of the city and the era, the attitudes of the people and the relationships between the different sociopolitical groups. The dramatic pace of the series is well maintained and there is a certain degree of ""cliffl hanger"" at the end of each episode, to the extent that I will admit that I was forced to ""binge"" watch it.<br/><br/>The plot is relatively simple but with a few twists and turns in a rather ""Dickensian"" fashion which results in a nice classical structure of having a beginning, a middle and an end. However, it is not without some excitement and a fair amount of tension. OK! So some will say that the ending is predictable, so what! I loved it.<br/><br/>The ""18"" rating is totally unjustified and the description ""strong sex"" has obviously been applied by a Sunday School teacher who has yet to experience sex of any kind. There is, perhaps, a view of one or two female bottoms &amp; one nipple. but that's all, although there is some rather tender, and carefully edited, lovemaking.<br/><br/>I rate this as a thoroughly entertaining piece of drama, well worth watching. It is well acted and extremely well produced with good scenery and atmosphere. Overall I was left feeling happy and glad I'd watched it.",60 out of 73 found this helpful.,10.0,28 December 2019

The cinematography, the atmosphere thats full of suspicion, the lovely and beautiful dresses and costums it really is something to behold, but the story is rather dark and bold, and very realistic in a world ruled by men.
It's about three strong and delicate women, that survived the bonfire at the Bazar but also centres around the devastating and gruesome fate many victims (mostly women) of the destructive fire endured. Hundreds of people were burned, scarred for life and permanently robbed of their beauty and youth.

531,The Bonfire of Destiny, It should have ended at episode 1,"First, I have to say the English title is ridiculous, almost offensive. To refer to a fire that took place because of negligence and killed 126 people (mostly women) as a ""bonfire of destiny"" is absurd. Why they chose to call it that is beyond me. They could have just translated the French title to ""The Charity Bazaar"" (which is the event that was taking place when the fire started).
Now about the series.
With each episode, it becomes less and less about the fire and more and more about the fictional stories. The fire is simply a trigger to the fictionalized stories. And what stories they created! It's just one soap opera type storyline after another.
A mafia head, a rich family gone broke needing to marry off their daughter for money, secret affairs, rich woman falling in love with a man living in poverty, a dead woman is actually alive, a living woman is actually dead, there's even a secret rendez-vous by horse back! (None of these are spoilers, it's not hidden from the audience) All the cliches you can think of rolled into one mini series. Just when you think they're all in there, one more cliche is thrown into the story. I mean, one character is burned around one of her eyes we're suppose to believe she's unrecognizable. Really? So if you're looking at your friend from the side you wouldn't be able to recognize them from the profile of their face? Or their mouth, their eyes, their chin... I started skipping through the episodes by episode 5, it just got to be too ridiculous and I wanted to get to the end. Only to be disappointed by that as well.<br/><br/>There are some redeeming qualities to the series. The actors are excellent (watch it in the original version with subtitles, the voice actors for the English dubbing are horrible), the cinematography, the sets, the costumes, and the kids were excellent as well.

534,The Bonfire of Destiny, Still not good enough,"I was attracted by the publications that Camille Lou posted on her social media, and waited from November to December 26th as it came out on Netflix to finally get to watch it. The actresses and actors were in general beautiful, and along with the historical atmosphere in the series, it was enjoyable to watch it to kill time.
The plot of the series is a really good idea but I found its structure was a little badly organised. I could understand what did the screenwriter want to shape of the roles like Julien or Marc-Antoine, but I think in reality the result was not good enough. In the second half I just wanted not to give up, and I made it. The ending contained nothing surprising.

The story is awkward, repetitious to the extreme. The casting is spot on, the direction passable, the problem is taking a two hour story and making it an 8 part min-series.

540,Something in the Rain, This is why I love Netflix soooo much!!,"Nobody else would have considered producing this. It is too slow, too repetitive, people are too sensitive for the story to sell outside Asia, it's overall ""too Korean"", people spend too much time eating and drinking and many other reasons. 
I am a European, old, white male and therefore as far away from the intended target group of this movie as possible (I guess). And yet, the characters and the story got me hooked within 15 minutes and I binge-watched to the end. Character development is beautiful and slow, timing is impeccable, drama is balanced with light comedy in an effortless way, every single actor is well cast and executes perfectly. And most of all, it is incredibly refreshing to see sensible ""normal"" people compared to all these overly egoistic and egocentric characters in American blockbusters that are only motivated by money, sex, violence, power... I probably should add that I am a hopeless romantic who watches Casablanca every few years and still enjoys it every time. If you fall into this category, no matter what else you like or dislike I highly recommend this series. Also if you are interested in Asian cultures or have never been to Korea you will probably learn a lot. The reason why I started using Netflix was Sense8. And this series also has the tenderness and ""love conquers all"" message but without the sex scenes obviously :-)",146 out of 148 found this helpful.,9.0,23 August 2018

542,Something in the Rain," Korean societal and family traditionalism vs modernism ... oh, and it's a romance","After watching this series a second time, I am upgrading the rating to 9 stars.<br/><br/>Situated in 2015 Seoul, a 35 year old submissive woman meets younger guy, is wooed and falls in love. The relationship between Jin-A and Jun-Hui, 10 years her junior, is both touching and annoying. The miscommunication, indirectness, missed opportunities, etc., make for some interesting plot arcs. It is enjoyable to watch Jin-A progress from a woman who cannot believe she possesses a guy who is totally consumed by her into someone who, in one sense, doesn't need him anymore but, in another sense, knows he is the only man who will ever truly love her and thus won't settle for anything less.<br/><br/>At the lowest level, this series is a Romeo and Juliet type of love story, but it has a number of other more interesting plot issues that make it one of the better k- dramas that is definitely worth the viewer's time. The most important one is the heroine's development into a self confident woman who maintains her compassionate dignity. Next is the sexual harassment plot arc that must be fully played out and ultimately affects the romance. The ultra-traditional mother, who demands Jin-a marries a wealthy husband to the point of, absurdity, takes on a comedic role at times. American viewers who know nothing about Korean culture, like me, may be struck by the constraints placed on Korean women: family duty, the favoring of the son, male chauvinism and laws that seem to treat women as 2nd class citizens. This realistic glimpse into Korean life may be the series best aspect and sets it apart from many other Korean shows.<br/><br/>Son Ye-jin, whose wholesome beauty and effortless acting in the role of Jin-A, has a good screen presence and stands out by virtue of the seemingly mild mannered self-deprecating character she develops into mature self-confident woman who decides to live life on her own terms. Supported by a very capable cast, Son is able to juxtapose her character against a panoply of relatives, friends and colleagues who, due to their bondage to Korean traditions, have some significant issues that test Jin-a's determination and humanity.<br/><br/>All told, this would make a very good first Korean drama series for you to watch",37 out of 37 found this helpful.,9.0,25 September 2018

The chemistry between the actors is palpable: they are charming together and completely believable. The uses of elevators, rain, and umbrellas are nice touches that contribute figuratively to their evolving story and again at the end-with the addition of the all-important necklace. The rest of the series explores the judgmental intrusiveness of family members, with a mother figure so over the top she is an abusive, hateful cartoon figure that borders on psychopathy. Also very important is the study of workplace sexual harassment, which this series explores successfully along with the female lead's maturing as she grows into the person she wants to be. But both themes take their tolls on the love story. I do think the series finds a positive resolution that satisfies the love story; it is rushed, but it is there in the symbols as well as their joy.",16 out of 16 found this helpful.,8.0,12 May 2019

1. coffee prince - a nice blend of comedy and romance. one of the most popular series. hero falls in love with a boy working in his coffee shop and is going crazy since he is not gay. except the boy is not really a boy but a girl pretending to be a boy.
2. legend of blue sea - this is my first one. it has every thing you expect from a mermaid romance. its funny too at times.
3. i am not a robot - this is a short and sweet love story. plot is very funny and lovely. man falls in love with a robot. but its actually a human girl pretending to be a robot.
4. goblin - an immortal warrior almost god looking for a bride to end his immortality. when he finally meets the girl and falls in love he doesnt want to die. but fate has other plans. this one has a pretty serious plot. but somehow they succeed in fusing comedy into it. and it is pretty comical at times.

550,Something in the Rain, It could have been great,"I was really enjoying this one until the last 2 episodes then after a very slow build up suddenly everything that was going on was rushed to conclusion with barely a few lines. <br/><br/>First, the big break up was so flat. We got absolutely no glimpse of the aftermath other than a few tears and a panoramic view in which time lapsed about 3 years. It was confusing.<br/><br/>Second; they went their seperate ways which I understand why she didn't want to go and he should have never signed up to leave like he did but jumping forward didn't give us the sense of separation when they met again at her brothers wedding. It was all ackward. We find out he never got over her but she was dating even though she still had feelings for him. We find out how he held up during a conversation with his friend and she tells us how she suffered in a few lines she yelled at him. It just didn't have impact and felt like a quarrel instead of an intense break up. It was flat. <br/><br/>Then she quits her job. All that build up to the sexual harassment case and on the last day of work we find out in on line that she won in court. Very anti climatic. <br/><br/>So she moves across the country to start over because apparently being in the same vicinity of her ex was to much to bear. He's talking about moving to the States permanently because it's to much to bear. I would have been satisfied if it ended that way. Disappointed but satisfied. No they show her living away with her friend and she pretends to be okay. Aa he's packing he hears her recorded message from 3 years ago and decides to look for her. Am I supposed to believe he hasn't either listened to or deleted it by now? So he goes to find her but she moved. One phone call to her brother and he's on the way. It lacks the suspense it was going for. <br/><br/>So he shows up with a lame excuse and eventually apologizes. She's playing confused but ultimately they end up kissing in the rain. We end with them frockling on some rocks back together. <br/><br/>It just feels unfinished to me. They rushed all the plot points at the end which killed any dramatic effect they were going for. It was a great story up until then. I was really enjoying it but the last two episodes killed it for me.

551,Something in the Rain," This Korean drama has an addictive charm, while drawing you into a classic journey of love","I started watching this by chance as it came up recommended on my Netflix account. It is a really sweet &amp; slow building romance, but very addictive, and the two leads are perfect for their roles. They are fine actors, who are charming &amp; likable, and also with loads of chemistry. One thing that becomes quickly apparent, is this is not the kind of love story you will see coming out Hollywood these days, whether in tv or film. As much as they obviously like each other, their circumstances make it necessary to move slow, and a slight spoiler alert here, it takes a while for them to even hold hands. But it's a very sweet moment when it happens. There are lots of modern aspects to their relationship, and despite their awkwardness, she is a successful, empowered young woman, so they very much feel like equals, with her actually taking the lead at times, being older of the two.

552,Something in the Rain, I want to hold your hand.,"I was 19 years old when I first heard The Beatles. I was rounding the bend on a rural highway, on my way home from Iowa State University to visit my girlfriend in Green Mountain, Iowa. The song was ""I Want to Hold Your Hand."" I was (and am) no expert on music, but I immediately liked what I heard: the vocal harmonies, the guitars, and the drums. The lyrics, about holding hands, didn't grab me.<br/><br/>However, the magic of two people holding hands for the first time did grab me when, as a 73-year-old man, I watched the Netflix K-Drama, ""Something in the Rain."" The hand-holding scene in the series grew out of the chemistry between a man and a woman, an excellent script, and superb direction.<br/><br/>The central character of ""Something in the Rain"" is Yoon Jin-ah (portrayed by Son Ye-jin), a single, 30-something university graduate who lives at home and works at Coffee Bay, a chain of coffee shops-think Starbucks, but smaller. Jin-ah is at the center of two storylines: as a woman falling in love with a younger man and as a target of workplace sexual harassment.<br/><br/>Sparks fly when Jin-ah's childhood friend unexpectedly steps back into her life. Seo Joon-hee (Jung Hae-in), a 20-something graduate of art school and a video game designer, has just returned from a three-year assignment in the United States. On his first day back in South Korea, he runs into Jin-ah on the plaza in front of the office building where they both work. Though they clearly are attracted to each other, more than just a years-wide age difference makes a romance problematic. Not long after Joon-hee and his sister, See Kyung-Seon (Jang So-yeon), lost their mother to cancer when they were children, their father abandoned them, effectively turning them into orphans. Jin-ah's parents took the children under their wing, so Jin-ah and her and Joon-hee and his sister grew up together and became best friends-or as some would say, like family.<br/><br/>Although both Jin-ah and Joon-hee are no strangers to romance, neither of them has experienced true love and endured the highs and lows that go with it. As their romance begins, their longstanding friendship provides both comfort and an excuse to attribute what's happening between them to be nothing more than feelings of nostalgia. Soon, though, they find it hard to ignore their mutual attraction to each other. Underneath it all, they really are good friends, care about each other, and look out for each other.<br/><br/>They soon realize, however, that their families, friends, and co-workers can't accept the age difference between them. In addition, Jin-ah begins to fear that her mother Kim Mi-yeon (Gil Hae-yeon) will see their relationship as borderline incestuous and oppose it vehemently. Joon-hee, naively, is less concerned about these issues. After all, he and Jin-ah are adults and are not doing anything illegal.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the couple hide their budding romance. This secrecy creates all sorts of uncomfortable situations. Jin-ah and Joon-hee sit through uncomfortable scenes in which their friends and family members recount their previous romances in extensive detail. They sit through discussions of what their families think would be suitable marriage partners for each of them. A rival for Joon-hee's attention begins to make a move on him. Before long, Jin-ah and Joon-hee find themselves at the center of a web of deception, even with respect to one another, out of their concern for each other.<br/><br/>Despite their attempts to keep their relationship secret, friends and family members slowly discover the truth about it. Most of their friends and coworkers are delighted, though one is disappointed and jealous, but Jin-ah's mother is enraged. She insults Joon-hee and his sister; swats her husband and son for keeping her in the dark about the relationship-she is the last one in the family to learn about it-and warns Jin-ah in no uncertain terms that she will prevail in this dispute.<br/><br/>At the same time that Jin-ah's relationship with Joon-hee develops, she begins to speak and act out against oppressive sexual harassment at work. She works in an open office at Coffee Bay's headquarters, where she and her co-workers oversee the operation of a chain of stores, train store managers, and do in-store inspections. Their supervisors and the owner are men, with one exception: a woman placed high in the organization who sides with the women in her charge.<br/><br/>Joon-hee supports and encourages Jin-ah as she stands up for herself and the other women in the office. He also supports and defends her when her most recent suitor, a distasteful, spoiled man, tries to force his way back into her life. His support help Jin-ah deal with this obsessive man.<br/><br/>I discovered ""Something in the Rain"" after watching ""Live,"" a single-season K-Drama that follows police recruits through the end of their training into their first jobs at a precinct station. ""Live"" was my introduction to South Korea and K-Drama. I fell in love with the sound of the Korean language, the characters, the story line, and the soundtrack. After ""Live,"" I searched for other K-Dramas and discovered ""Something in the Rain."" I have watched all 16 episodes at least five times and have learned something each time. Why did I do that?<br/><br/>First, ""Something in the Rain"" is one of the best series I have watched on Netflix. And for good reason. The two lead actors, a supporting actor (Jang So-yeon), the director (Ahn Pan-seok), and the series itself won prestigious awards in South Korea and elsewhere in East Asia. The director's slowly developing, extended scenes are lovely. In one such scene, Jin-ah and Joon-hee hold hands for the first time. In another, Jin-ah fills and wraps gift boxes, carefully packing each box, folding the wrapping paper, cutting the tape, and taping the paper.<br/><br/>Second, because I began watching the show as a novice with regard to South Korean culture, what I learned in my first viewing informed my second viewing, etc. Also, because I do not understand the Korean language, I had to shift my focus back and forth between the subtitles and action and thus missed some of the latter. I realize there remains much for me to learn about Korean culture, but ""Something in the Rain"" was a good introduction.<br/><br/>Third, the sound track in the series differs from the soundtracks of most other series I've watched. At first, I found it intrusive, but it grew on me, especially after 2NE1's ""I Am the Best"" near the end of Episode 1 blew me away. Other songs repeatedly announce the tone of upcoming scenes. They include Carla Bruni's cover of ""Stand by Your Man,"" Bruce Willis's cover of ""Save the Last Dance for Me,"" and ""Flea Waltz"" (Lee Namyeon).<br/><br/>The relationship between Jin-ah and Joon-hee becomes very difficult after Jin-ah's mother finds out about it, and for a while they separate and Joon-hee returns to the United States to work. However, although both of them seem to have moved on in their lives, they continue to harbor strong feelings for one another. They may be separated, but these soul mates and lovers are very much on each other's mind.<br/><br/>The series ends ambiguously: Will Jin-ah and Joon-hee get together and stay together, or will they separate again? In the last few episodes of the series, it seemed that the writers were struggling to find a way to wrap it. I thought the writers were leaving the door open for a second season, but, alas, that doesn't seem to be the case.",14 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,27 March 2019
553,Something in the Rain," Loves this show, great acting from the lead actors.","This was my first time watching Korean drama and I loved the show. I started watching the show just to watch something different and romantic but I had no idea it would be so addicting. I loved how realistic and believable Jina and Jinhui's relationship was...I also liked the office plot around the problems Jina faced in and how she dealt with them. Like another review said, the theme song was kind of an overkill and I wished they used other songs throughout the show. I also didn't like the finale as much, as I thought it was a bit slow. Overall, the show was very absorbing and I watched it till the very end without getting bored and distracted.

When she falls in love with her best friend's brother, it triggers a transformation of sorts - because he tells her to become stronger and more independent.<br/><br/>This show struggles with a lot of serious issues, but it progresses slowly and Ye-Jin's actions are very hard to understand for people who are not used to all the rules she is banging her head on. It is incredibly frustrating to watch. Almost all the characters do as they think they are expected to do, when it would be so easy to just be honest and do what they want instead.<br/><br/>There is not much space to develop as a person between the expectations of parents, work, and even friends. This point comes across, but it drags on over 16 episodes. Good actors, especially Joo Min-kyung and, as always, the lead Son Ye-jin.

564,Something in the Rain, A bird's eye view of how Korean (and other East Asian) women are mistreated in society,"If ever you were curious about how women are oppressed in Asian culture, this series will offer a good look. Jin-Ah is a 35 year old manager at a coffee franchise corporation. She falls for her best friend's younger brother, Joon Hee, who also happens to be her younger brother's best friend. Her mother is an ambitious, cutthroat woman who desperately wants to rise in life by manipulating her family members--urging her husband to climb the corporate ladder and trying to play matchmaker for her children and the children of wealthy, influential families. The mother is so caught up in materialistic, social class-climbing that she doesn't think for a moment about her children's happiness. As a result she screeches at Jin-Ah for dumping a lying, cheating but wealthy lawyer boyfriend. Her younger brother disrespectfully asks if Jin-Ah is ""dumb"" for involving his best friend Joon Hee. Both the mother and younger brother accuses Jin-Ah for being an idiot and choosing a cheating man.<br/><br/>Asa woman if this doesn't get under your skin I don't know what does. I like the realism of this series but detest the reality of how Korean women (as well as Chinese and Japanese women are treated).

I don't want to come home from a 12-hour shift to watch something based in reality. I want something fluffy and ridiculous. Perhaps there are others that disagree with me. That's fine. But I do believe that you all should take this show for what it is. It's a one-hour escape from reality. And yes, the plot is silly and the acting is a bit forced. But is there really a need to attack it for lacking a feminist viewpoint? I see the real world every day. I don't need to see it when I kick back with a miller light and a puzzle.

567,Mistresses, Degrading to women? No.,"Many people seem to believe that this is a show about a bunch of sluts. Now, let me tell you. It is NOT. It was only the trailer of the show that made the show seem this way and already at the 4th episode, all the sex is decreasing. Yes, the later episodes squeeze in a small amount of sex but that's all. I don't get why other shows such as How I Met Your Mother with Neil Patrick Harris f*cking more than a thousand (or two hundred, I forget) girls is acceptable but four women having just one partner (each) makes this the most degrading show on the network.<br/><br/>Moving on, Mistresses is a well made ABC TV show and I think that it is one of the most underrated shows there is. The story follows personal problems of four women and how they deal with it. <br/><br/>Let me now judge on the storyline and structure of the show. I believe that it flows just nicely although Savi keeps procrastinating when it comes to revealing the baby daddy is pretty annoying (as it was first suspenseful). This show continues to surprise you as the season goes, dropping bombshells at you with well structured twists. I'm a fan of this show. The creators of ABC's Mistresses did well when they add pinches of comedy and spoonfuls of emotional scenes in the show in just the right places, making it a light-hearted as well as interesting. <br/><br/>Mistresses' greatest tactic to lure their fans to watch the next episodes is suspense and it's working just fine. This show makes you dodge between which character you like and who you want to live happily ever after and that's one of the smallest things that makes you love the show.<br/><br/>For example, I like Harry but at the same time I like Dominic, and so, this show battles your emotions and makes you like both characters then makes you choose between on (on who gets their happily ever afters) only to drop a sh*t-load of a surprise on you in the end. <br/><br/>The acting is acceptable. Alyssa Milano delivers the best performance from the four although they are good. Jes McCallan DOES need an acting coach though, honestly speaking. Anyways...<br/><br/>Well done, ABC! 10/10",19 out of 22 found this helpful.,10.0,1 September 2013
568,Mistresses, Double Standard,"I think that this show was pretty well done. It was the pilot after all, so it was bound to be a bit rocky to begin with, but I don't think that it deserves the bad rap that it has been getting.<br/><br/>One thing that I find frustrating is how so many people seem to think that this show is degrading, setting women back or just a terrible show in general because it shows women being sexual. It may not be with their husbands (I mean it's called Mistresses after all, did no one know what was coming?), but has no one seen Mad Men? Granted it is not on a cable network like AMC as Mad Men is, but I feel that this is a bit of a double standard.<br/><br/>Honestly, I didn't think it was all that racy. I thought it was a different perspective and it has some fun, suspenseful moments and I am interested in seeing them play out.",40 out of 51 found this helpful.,7.0,6 June 2013
569,Mistresses, I'm surprised that I liked the first episode! *VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD*,"First off, I have no experience with the BBC series that this is based off of, so this review is only for the pilot that aired on ABC. <br/><br/>What I was expecting after seeing all the ads for Mistresses was a steamy summer drama in the same vein as Desperate Housewives. What I got was a surprisingly low key drama series focusing on four women all affected by infidelity in different ways. While the title would suggest that all four women go on some super soft Skinemax affair romp, the actual show is not just about mistresses, but also the wives of cheating husbands, and even the wives who cheat. <br/><br/>The core stories follow a woman recently widowed who is having a hard time dealing with the loss of her husband, a psychiatrist who was having an affair with married patient, a woman whose marriage is starting to hit some major road blocks due to fertility issues, and a young woman who enjoys sex but not relationships. All of these stories have been done on soaps a thousand times before, and yet I found myself enjoying the first episode. Why? It moved quickly, all four leads were perfectly cast, and the writer and director all found small, emotional moments to help the audience connect with the characters on some level. <br/><br/>I have a feeling that the title, more then anything, is what is turning most people off of the show. That disappoints me, because the show is not condoning infidelity. It is not show the subject in a positive light. It's just mining it for dramatic material, just like any daytime soap opera or night time drama has for years. <br/><br/>Seriously, drop the judgments and give the show a chance. It's well acted and entertaining, with the same quality tech aspects you would expect from an ABC series. Is it high art? No. Is it an enjoyable night time soap that takes a high drama subject and handles it in a surprisingly low key manner? Yes. I enjoyed the heck out of Mistresses, and hope to see the series continue.",23 out of 32 found this helpful.,9.0,3 June 2013
570,Mistresses, What a let down,"Mistresses UK (the original BBC version) is one of my favourite TV shows. I have seen it so many times, it is that good. So when I heard that there was going to be a US version, I was so excited and I have been waiting for it to air for ages.<br/><br/>Sadly this version is such a let-down. One of the best things about the original BBC version was the chemistry between the actors; not just between the lovers but also between the friends and especially between Siobhan (now called Savi in the US version) and Dominic vs. Hari (now called Harry). The actors that play the parts in the US version are great individually but there is just no spark between them. In the UK version, the sexual tension within the law firm was built up to the level that it became so palpable, you actually began rooting for Siobhan and Dom (even though they were cheating). Here however, it just came about - garter...slap bang! and we are left wondering what the?!? <br/><br/>The same goes for the relationship between Dr Karen and Sam, her dead lovers son. In the UK version it was very well and richly drawn out with a lot of real emotional angst...from the funeral to the son becoming so obsessed about his dad having an affair before he died, to his search for his dad's 'mistress' and the mystery surrounding his dad's death while at the same time falling in love with Karen who against all odds (and moral conscience) falls right back in love with him. It was presented as being morally questionable (so, no, the show does not glorify infidelity as reviewers above seem to indicate, but shows how easy it is to fall for the wrong person and the real consequences of such a lack or lapse of self control) but it was done in a way that it was both sympathetic and believable. Not so with the US version where everything just looks shoddy and badly written.<br/><br/>In Mistresses US, Dr Karen and Sam are totally mismatched and their acting is horribly wooden, uncomfortable to watch and just plain weird. <br/><br/>But by far the worst offender is the character Joss, who, in the UK version was this well spoken, well dressed, beautiful, sexually liberated free spirit (latterly turned lesbian) and was a friend of the gals. In Mistresses US, she has become Savi's sister (why sister - total mismatch?) who dresses like a tramp and this breaks up what was already a strained dynamic (by that I mean that the 3 'friends' in Mistresses US do not seem to 'gel' at all...their relationship seems forced, like they are 3 acquaintances who meet up once in a while rather than what was 4 inseparable best mates in Mistresses UK). Also, the whole lesbian affair storyline here was just damp and spark-less...in the UK version it was meaningful, painful and believable rather than some sort of experiment that went wrong. Maybe there is more to come in the future about this. <br/><br/>There is nothing redeemable about Mistresses US. I have just finished episode 6 and I really don't know if it is worth continuing. Rochelle and Alyssa are great, but they've been let down by the script. Maybe if I had never seen (and seen again and then again) our version (UK) I would have taken to this but...I really don't know why they changed so much of it. It was already a masterpiece. If you haven't already seen the UK version, please do so, maybe even concurrently.",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,4.0,18 July 2013
571,Mistresses, An insipid collection of badly written scenes played completely straight,"What the heck was ABC thinking? Clearly they wanted to recreate whatever formula worked for the British original. Why wouldn't they? So what could go so horribly wrong? <br/><br/>From the moment it begins it is clear this is the anti-marriage show. It pushes a far left agenda and does it with all-too-serious acting to embarrassing dialog. Yunjin Kim is a personal favorite of mine, but she seemed befuddled by the script and her character. Her opening scene with Tom was so bad my jaw dropped and continued to drop as the show went on. ""Oh! You're sick! You have cancer! Please make love to me!""<br/><br/>Every plot point is hammered home and every upcoming plot twist is being broadcast in advance. I knew Alyssa Milano (who's added weight was unsuccessfully hidden behind black clothing throughout) was going to cheat on her husband and bed her law partner the second they shared time on screen.<br/><br/>Does anyone not see a lesbian affair coming up between one of the all too pretty (aka Male Fantasy) house hunting lesbians and the younger sister? Why don't they just send out the obvious via Morse Code. <br/><br/>Poor Rochelle Aytes is saddled with the worst part. ""Oh I am so sexy and drop dead gorgeous but my dead husband is haunting me by crank phone calls. He was the PERFECT husband so of course he would never cheat on me. Now excuse me while I continue to cancel dates with Jim Carey's clone so that I can cry with the girls."" The writers on this turd deserve to be banned from Hollywood for life. <br/><br/>This type of show cannot work on Network television. It's too wanna-be steamy and sex filled for a commercial broadcast network where women have to sleep and have sex wearing their bras. This sort of content belongs on HBO or Showtime. Clearly the ABC suits want their very own Sex &amp; The City in L.A. but instead they have The Naked Gun 4, From the Files of the Mistress Housewives.

I don't think its just for women as I am a male and find a women's point of view and desires, interesting. I love the great clothes worn by the females and each of the 4 is attractive in a different way.

577,Mistresses, Sloppy moves on season 2,"First season was interesting, I think it's great that someone had the idea of looking into the minds and hearts of the mistresses who are not always bad people and also have feelings.

Rochelle Aytes in my opinion has the most boring character but she pulls it off nicely and Jes Macallan is a breath of fresh air, she's dynamic, cute but not intimidatingly cute and she brings a touch of youth to the show. Now the second season seems to be ruining it with a couple of unrealistic characters that really just made me roll my eyes every time I had to watch them. Rebeka Montoya's and Ricky Whittle characters really seem way over the top to me. Does Daniel Zamora owns a shirt? And what's with the morning glittery body and the cheap jewelery? His love scenes with April looked like a tacky Toni Braxton video. As to Miss Antonia what's-her-name, I just have a couple of questions, the first one being: Really? Is she a lawyer or a cheap prostitute? I can't tell with the Barbie outfits that they make her wear. I totally respect the actress and I actually feel sorry for her but honestly, her first appearance in the show was around 10 seconds long and it was more than enough to see that she was going to be the slut of the season. When the writers want to be so obvious it makes me feel one of two things: either they think I'm too stupid to get subtlety or they just want to make fast statements to get on with it.

Savi Davis portrayed by Alyssa Milano is this stunning lawyer who seems to have everything she wants career wise but not in her personal life. With her marriage falling apart due to fertility issues on her husband's part Savi starts to find love elsewhere.

April Malloy portrayed by Rochelle Aytes is a grieving widow who is trying to focus on raising her young daughter. April receives these mysterious phone calls regarding her dead husband, only to have a bigger surprise ringing her doorbell. Jes Macallan portrays Josslyn Carver who is a Real Estate Agent but ironically cant pay her own rent, only seems to be interested in sex and experimentation. I say give this show a chance people.

The UK version's plot unfolds like it should and the characters are well-portrayed by each actor. The US actors, lacks the chemistry and bonding.

The women in this show are shown as weak sex creatures who lay down for any guy who winks at them.<br/><br/>The women are portrayed as senseless sex objects to men who control them, use them like they are worthless and (surprise - surprise) the women fall for every trap imaginable.<br/><br/>An intelligent lawyer has her work done for her when another lawyer tricks her into showing him her garter belt? Really? How weak. She should have slapped him.<br/><br/>A competitive and successful real estate agent has sex with her boss in the office and he buys her a house and she doesn't understand that she is playing the role of a prostitute? Hmmmm. Successful at what I ask?<br/><br/>An intelligent therapist sleeps with a patient and then stands beside his wife at the funeral. How low can you go? <br/><br/>I don't understand this show unless it is a spoof on another bad show OMG Did I miss the joke? Did I turn the show off before it was revealed these women are actually from the 1950's? I apologize if I turned off the television before the big reveal and all these women stood around and laughed at each other for all the stupid things they did.<br/><br/>Did the camera turn around to show the writers and crew knee-slapping because they were laughing so hard? Did the cast need credits for their SAG pension? What the hell happened?",10 out of 26 found this helpful.,1.0,4 June 2013
583,Mistresses, Weak,"I'm a fan of Alyssa Milano and was looking forward to his series but so far not so good.<br/><br/>When protagonists are doing something wrong they have to be sympathetic and the audience has to be on their side and want them to get away with it (eg The Client List). But here there isn't much sympathy with the characters. The reasons for the adultery seem weak. Only Yunjin Kim's story has promise.<br/><br/>The 4 main female characters are reasonably attractive. But Alyssa Milano's character and her on screen sister are too different physically to be sisters. Strange choice. The men are rather far from prime time standard.<br/><br/>Unless the stories get more interesting and they bring in some hotter guest stars or new cast members, I don't think this one is going to last.",12 out of 34 found this helpful.,3.0,13 June 2013

So I started watching this show because of Alyssa Milano so why hasn't she returned yet and is she?<br/><br/>Also, Mistresses has a meaning to it and none of the characters are nor have they been actual mistresses. Second point now is what the heck is the writer thinking? You almost lost me when you put Joss with Harry. You still might if you don't make some serious changes. And putting April in a relationship was just wrong and to do it with a younger guy who Is also a loser is just terrible writing. That's my opinion and thoughts. Let me know when you want a better writer for this series cause you really need one or at least maybe a viewer with better thoughts.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,,17 July 2016
585,Mistresses, So juicy and entertaining!,"I love this show. Not one of my top fave, but definitely a good one. I love all the drama, the plot twists and the actors. The only complaint i have is that it only has 13 episodes and it only airs during the summer time. Ever since the main character left, the movie it s funnier. I love the girls and their complicated lives. This series somewhat reminds me of desperate housewives, that was my favorite TV series ever. So if you loved that one, i definitely recommend this comedy/sensual/drama. A lost of cliffhangers and exciting situations that one cannot predict. 10 out of 10 stars!!!! Watch the four friends have some fun while you rewind to a glass of wine after a long day.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,22 August 2015
586,Mistresses, April's widow story line,"Love this show, and I am hooked, but the story line with April has me really troubled. Did writers talk to young widows and get input before filming this? I assume that's a hard no.
April appears as though she's going to go so far as possibly take her husband back after he re-emerges from the dead (having actually faked his death) after 3 years. That's a tough pill to swallow. But wait. There's more. They have a young daughter and they're discussing how to tell her that Daddy is not dead. Wow. Oh, wait... here's where he's been: living with another woman and their young son, this is a woman with whom he had been having an affair. Which was not brought to light until April discovers this herself, 3 years later.
So here's where this is super troubling. Not that this all happened, and yes it's the story line of a soap opera, but in actuality - speaking as a 'real' widow who had very young children at the time of the loss, the mere thought of a return from the dead after 3 years would result in some SERIOUS psychological trauma. Because, what we've been though these last 3 years would be categorized as severe psychological trauma, not to mention what's going on with the children. So to have a fake death situation would not be taken as lightly as depicted on the show. What April experienced as shocking and traumatic as shown, multiply that times a million and now you're getting close.
And the daughter Lucy? She's already got a weight to carry given the loss of her father. To have her know that he faked his death and abandoned her on purpose, and put her through 3 years of death-grief for no actual reason, and that's something you tell her over ice cream? You're laying the ground work to 100% eff up her whole life.
No. Just no. A hard no.
Now, I have clearly been triggered by this and I'm processing some stuff here. I think all the other story lines are great and I've really enjoyed the show so far. I just wanted to put this all down somewhere and figure out if I can continue watching.

590,Indian Summers, Sumptuous production and top-notch acting deliver superb evocation of the Raj's final days,"Some months ago, I binge watched all of S1 over a weekend. Real life was effectively cancelled until the closing credits of the final episode. It was a glorious, immersive experience.<br/><br/>This is a genuine 'Jewel' of a show. Sure, it has some laboured historical anachronisms and the usage of tropical Penang as a filming location means Simla has been woefully miscast. But these misgivings aside, as a filmic experience Indian Summers is magnificent.<br/><br/>Cinematography is exquisite, the vibrant colours simply dance off the screen and the production values are top notch. The setting is lush and evocative. The plot is riveting, inter-laced with the politics of the time, (with dark resonances for us today). This is definitely a post-colonial reading of the last days of the Raj, but there is certainly some balance afforded by the marvellously textured and excellently acted characterisations. For example, Ralph Whelan is a charming sociopath, but there is nuance and intrigue in his character that makes him compelling throughout.<br/><br/>Overall, I can safely say that this is one of the best, original TV productions I have seen for some years. I can't wait for the second series!",18 out of 21 found this helpful.,10.0,12 March 2016
591,Indian Summers," Engaging, but stereotypical","I set out to watch this show with great anticipation, as it was set in my hometown of SIMLA ( erstwhile summer capital of India under the British rule). To my great disappointment, it hardly evokes any excitement or nostalgia. The plot is engaging and the makers have taken great care in representing all strands of history ( both British and Indian version), yet from a perspective of an Indian, this show ends up as yet another stereotypical drama about the glorious days of British Raj ! What hurts the most is the setting itself- the producers didn't even bother to look at actual town of Simla. As the stereotype goes, India is a tropical country, so a town situated in foothills of Himalayas appears to be a tropical rain forest ! The native tongues used by the Indian cast predominantly belongs to southern parts of India, rather than the hills in the north. The reason the British made Simla their summer capital was its stark resemblance to the British climate and geography. All in all, watch it for its plot, set against a historical backdrop, but beware as it perpetuates the stereotype of India. I would much rather pick a Merchant Ivory production !",65 out of 87 found this helpful.,3.0,30 May 2015
592,Indian Summers, Excellent and Atmospheric,The setting is beautiful and the audio and visuals and costumes really bring you into the series. I can almost smell the air of the mountains. There are several themes running through the series and you can see things starting to come together into a more coherent whole by the 3rd episode. I would rate this series as one of the best i've seen - along the lines of Downton Abbey or The Wire. There are also some really great actors and actresses like Jemima West and Henry Lloyd- Hughes. Jemima West really carries the show. Little subtleties add a lot of flavor to this series.

593,Indian Summers," With solid preproduction and great cast, the team have made sure that they haven't left any corners untouched","Just watched the first episode on Channel 4, the pilot was 1 hr 45 min long but wasn't boring at all though some of it was a bit predictable but it's only the first episode and still got 9 more to go. The first episode was about Ralph Whelan and the rest of the Indian Civil Service begin the annual move to Simla where Cynthia Coffin prepares the exclusive white British Club for the summer season. Overall it was a great experience and especially performance by Jemima West, Julie Walters, Henry Lloyd-Hughes and Nikesh Patel were flawless and true to their character.

594,Indian Summers, This is NOT the new Downton Abby!,"I'm seeing a whole bunch of stupid reviewers claiming this is the new Downton Abby. On the surface, you'd like to think that. It's roughly the same time period (give or take about 10 or less years).It's got exquisite, historically accurate costumes, lush landscapes and very detailed accuracy to manners and speech. But that's where it ends, because this isn't even CLOSE. This is closer to Game Of Thrones, regardless of the time period...and the fact that GoT isn't from the same world as ours. This is about devious, wicked people who smile in your face, but stab you in the back. They play people to be their pawns in a political battle. Innocent people get hurt, while nasty people gain power. Mind you, I only saw the first episode as I write this, but from the mini-spoilers in the ""behind the scenes"" along side the violence, intensity and sexuality (and I don't just mean sexiness. This hints at raunch, even if it doesn't show it) showed me clear this wasn't your Aunt Violet Grantham's Tea Party.<br/><br/>So turn back now if you want more lofty, sweet nature dramas involving debates whether or not the young cook servant should learn math, or the Irish Chauffeur has the right suit for dinners, or if that dumb ass duke invested his wife's money poorly again. This is closer to R rated stuff. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong I LOVE Downton Abby, but I think it's awesome that PBS is showing some hard hitting grit. Mind you, it's the BBC's fault (actually I don't know if the BBC made this. It was on Channel 4 in the UK. I can't tell if that's BBC or an independent channel.). But the UK has up'd their game from ""awesome"" to just ""HolyCrapThatJustBlewMyMindGiveMeMoreGiveMeMore"" for both BBC America releases and PBS's Masterpiece. <br/><br/>Thank you UK once again *bows*",20 out of 26 found this helpful.,10.0,29 September 2015
595,Indian Summers, Shallow and erroneous depiction of life in Simla during the last years of the Raj,"Being born and brought up in Simla, only a few years after the British left, I hated it!!! It was so hard to watch. Simla is at 7500 ft above sea level. Tropical foliage where there should have been majestic deodars or Himalayan Cedars. Why did they not film it in Scotland? The vegetation and topography is so much more like the Himalayas. The Raj was as much about Simla and its unique landscape and the way it influenced life and government as anything else. <br/><br/>The whole concept of the Mall and Promenade every evening, the Gaiety Theater and Green Room, Bandstand not to mention A race course created on a small hill using local labor to flatten the ridge to create an oval space, defined Simla. I actually have a map of the houses of the British which enabled social activity without losing ones way.<br/><br/>The producers, directors etc, just did not get it! The Indians consisted of many more levels of society...educated, refined and of illustrious families.....than just household retainers and clerks. The British Civil servants themselves, were generally competent and decent and their lives consisted of a lot more than socializing. A bad show, misinforming the viewers.

597,Indian Summers, Fantastic Television,"I went into Indian Summers out of curiosity but, with the thought that, realistically it wasn't something I'd be too into. The whole kind of 'period drama with a twist' has never worked for me. However, I quickly had a change of opinion - I think this might be the best show I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Everything that you would expect to be good is - the acting is superb from pretty much the whole cast - I can't think of anyone who lets it down. The story is complex, with various characters lives interweaving against the backdrop of crumbling colonial India, with endless contrasts of high society and vicious oppression being beautifully balanced to seem both natural and revealing.<br/><br/>The thing that stood out to me though, and it is certainly something that is harder to pinpoint, was the vibrant nature of the whole show. Despite much of the 'action' coming from character tensions rather than events, the eclectic range of character backgrounds, combined with the fierce political and cultural battles being fought brought the show to life in a way I haven't seen for some time. A beautiful colour palette with some stunning camera work makes this an absolute pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>I don't know how season 2 will live up to this standard, but I owe the whole team my confidence after such a brilliant show.",20 out of 28 found this helpful.,,30 April 2015
598,Indian Summers, More rough than diamond,"Channel 4 has gone for an updated Jewel in the Crown and mixed it with a Downton Abbey vibe. Location shooting in Penang and not India with a hefty use of green screen to make the viewer think we in the foothills of the Himalayas as British colonials spend the summer in Simla.<br/><br/>It is 1932 and Ralph Whelan and the rest of the Indian Civil Service start the annual move to Simla, the exclusively white British Club is the centre of the social scene.<br/><br/>A mixed race boy is found collapsed on the railway tracks and an assassin attempts to shoot Whelan but a Parsee civil servant Aafrin takes the bullet. It also seems that Whelan is the father of the boy.<br/><br/>Aafrin is hailed as a hero but he also has tensions in his own family as well as his forthcoming marriage. In fact many people in Simla have a back story and secrets.<br/><br/>This is a 10 part series and boy it moves at a snail pace. It really is a throwback to the dramas of the 1980s and drama has moved on since those days. People want pace and economy of storytelling.<br/><br/>Here we have lingering shots as the director wants to show off the production design, the costumes, the scenery and gives us plenty of flashbacks to boot to the shooting.<br/><br/>In fact somewhere here there was a good 5 part series which was stretched out to a 10 part series and does Channel 4 know it as the viewing figures dwindled from the opening episodes 5 million viewers which is excellent in this day and age.<br/><br/>The final two episodes picked up the pace and as we saw the upstart Indian tea plantation owner Ramu got up to his neck in trouble.<br/><br/>The series was not as upfront with its callous and brutish colonial attitudes as The Jewel in the Crown but we get plenty of subtle and unsubtle racist attitudes and hypocrisy. Whelan could save Ramu but he rather tie loose ends. Just look at the police investigation of the murder which Ramu did not commit, they were out to get the upstart than the real culprit.<br/><br/>The series will return for a second series but this should had been better. The acting is a mixture of good and bad, people certainly look good. High production values and a leisurely pace will not sustain it.",29 out of 44 found this helpful.,5.0,27 April 2015
599,Indian Summers, Not-so-Indian Summers,"When I saw the trailer for Indian Summers, I couldn't wait till the series began. For some reason I was positive that this was going to be a class apart.<br/><br/>The settings are picturesque, reinventing Shimla's green glories. The English men and women are dressed in the most befitted way. The story, although gripping, is a little slow paced for a 10-part series. <br/><br/>I enjoy watching the series, but with a grudge. I strongly feel the authenticity of Indian culture in northern India have been heavily compromised. I could be wrong, I am not a historian or an expert of the past. However, from what I see, the Indian folk shown in the series are no where close to what people of Shimla look and dress like. The dressing and physique of the people is heavily bent towards South India. Even if there were multiple cultures thriving in Shimla at the time, considering it's summer capital status, something doesn't seem to fit in.",37 out of 59 found this helpful.,6.0,5 March 2015
600,Indian Summers," Gorgeous scenery, awful character development, ridiculous American accents","Indian Summers ain't no Downton Abbey. It barely meets the mark as a show worthy to be on Masterpiece Theater. Only the gorgeous scenery and the historical context make the show worth a tiny bit of time, but I could google photos and read some books and get more out of it than I have gotten from Indian Summers.<br/><br/>I have watched every episode thus far, waiting, hoping that I would finally experience some logical character development. No such luck. Last Sunday's episode turned out to be the new nadir. <br/><br/>Bright spots are easy to discern as there are so few of them:<br/><br/>1) the storyline between McLeod and Sood has a lot of potential, and someone should write an entire series exploring this time period through the relationship between those two men. That would be fascinating.<br/><br/>2) the scenery is gorgeous, and almost makes me want to travel there, except for the fact that reality today falls very short of the fantasy portrayed in the show<br/><br/>That's about it for the bright spots.<br/><br/>I am undecided if I will continue to watch the show. I do have a compulsion to finish what I have started, so I probably will, but I won't be happy as I watch it. I don't care for any of these characters. Only Dalal's father would be good company. The rest give me the creeps.<br/><br/>This is not a family show, either. Keep your remote handy in order to avoid the unnecessary simulated sex scenes. I don't watch HBO for a reason, and don't like Masterpiece Theater programs resembling those other cable shows.<br/><br/>Lastly, can someone please increase the budget for dialect training? Why do the British dialect teachers and the actors themselves keep perceiving Americans as talking with such absurd dialects? This is a common problem in BBC shows for many years. Those actors assigned to play the Americans are evidently told to pronounce every vowel as if their faces were being stretched wide in order to get the most annoying sounds ever. No Americans sound like this. Never did. Perhaps this is on purpose - make the American characters sound as foolish as possible. Could be. In any case, it's annoying and stupid.<br/><br/>My family would love to find another Downton Abbey, but we will wait patiently for it. Poldark has been our most favorite of the recent series.

601,Indian Summers, Indian Summers - very atmospheric,"Having travelled in India, the scenery and the people were very real to me. The fashion of the time seemed authentic. However the plot was a little confusing and I didn't always know what was going on, even though I was trying to concentrate hard. I was a little disappointed in that, as I usually like anything about India, be it drama or documentary. My husband feels the same but we intend to watch again next episode and hope it will not be so hard going as to not be entertaining and a must see drama. We have read that this drama cost £14 million to make and found that one of the women actors mumbled and whispered, so much so that we had to turn the television up higher than usual, but then the more audible voices were too loud. In this day and age and spending £14 million the sound quality could be better.",31 out of 51 found this helpful.,6.0,17 February 2015

It's supposed to be about the heated up politics in the Raj before the Brits finally pulled out (or got kicked out) but my goodness, who the heck cares about dull old politics anyway? All the series cares about is the unnatural feelings Ralphie has for his sister and who's sleeping with whom and who's gone off their nutter and shot someone among a dizzying assortment of bizarre characters. None of it makes any sense anyway. The plot line is totally irrational. All I can say is no wonder the series has been canceled.

I am an American and we don't learn much (if anything) about the English time ruling India, but I am following this quite fine. The costumes and the scenery are gorgeous, the actors are very skilled and the plot is interesting enough to be patient with the at times slowly developing story line. This is showing a point in time where the Indian people are tired of dealing with their rulers and are starting to push back against them. I can tell there will be a lot of gray areas for many of the characters as personal relationships muddy these waters.

So they imported South Indian actors speaking south Indian languages because the locals didn't fit the stereotype. Honestly I expected something more complex and better than this in 2015. Even the scenery is not very Shimla which is in the foothills of the Himalayas, so why make it look like the jungles of Bengal. Oh wait, why lose another opportunity to project yet another stereotype - India the land of jungles, when in fact the country stretches from a latitude of 38N down to about 7N so as you might expect, has a much greater range of scenery - from mountains to deserts to green hills, to scrub, to yes jungles!",37 out of 65 found this helpful.,1.0,20 June 2015
605,Indian Summers," Like watching paint dry, but not as fun","We have come to expect more from Masterpiece Theater, but this is so shocking dull I can't believe it was even encouraged. Someone must have done one hell of a sales pitch in a meeting to get this project green-lighted. It moves at a nail's pace and at the end of a 2 hour episode you feel completely drained and realize you just wasted your time. A re-run of Downton Abbey in Season 1 would be a much better investment in your time. So consider this a friendly heads-up, this is not a well put together story. It lacks clear identification of the characters, their purpose and motivation of why they are there and what they expect to accomplish. At best it isn't even an interesting story or premise to hang on to.

606,Indian Summers, There's a reason this show was so gorgeously shot: It was to make up for such an ugly and utterly dull story.,"Except for the fact it wasn't even shot in India! How sad it that?<br/><br/>There were really no sympathetic characters. All the English were racists and bigots, all the Indians were... ciphers. Yes, a lot of the English of that time were horrible, espousing the beliefs on view in this program. But there were many who were sympathetic to the plight of the Indians, yet there are only two people in this program who seem to tolerate or even like the native people they live among, Alice and Ian McCloud? Just doesn't seem realistic. And Julie Walters character? Oh, lord, what a harridan! I couldn't stand hearing her voice after the first episode, the writers had her spewing such hate and venom. I don't expect something that's all rainbows and sunshine, but the amount of hate and racism and bigotry on display in each and every episode made me nauseous. It's called striking a balance, showing all sides of a story, something that wasn't on display here.<br/><br/>The worst part was the storyline regarding the missionary's wife, Mrs. Raworth and the sister of the private secretary to the Viceroy, Alice Whelan. Alice has left her husband back in London, taken their child and run away to India, but to avoid scandal she tells everyone that her husband is dead. Well, because Mrs. Raworth is a nosy, desperate, social-climbing sneak, she winkles out the truth and holds it over Alice's head, blackmailing her in order to gain entre into the higher echelons of Colonial Indian society. The question is, why? Mrs. Raworth is about as threatening as a wet tissue; this is a women who would become confused at an intersection where the street signs have been swapped. All it would take is for Alice to slap Mrs. Raworth smartly on the face and say to her, ""Go ahead, tell everyone I've left my husband. Yes, you might have a brief triumph over me, but it will be brief because I will make sure everyone knows you for the low, backstabbing, sneaky, pathetic blackmailing worm that you are. And once your true character is revealed, no amount of brown-nosing will ever get you the approval you so desperately crave. Which means I'll eventually regain my status, but you will never be looked upon at any kind of equal ever again."" For Alice to be continually threatened by Mrs. Raworth was just completely unbelievable. And ridiculous. And utterly irritating to watch.<br/><br/>The main problem is whoever wrote this thing was trying to set up a grand mystery with lots of intertwining strands of smaller mysteries that somehow tied into the whole. Instead what was created was a vague, muddied, and meandering plot that barely allowed the viewer to get a grasp on any one character before being whisked off to another scene and another ""mystery."" There was no character development or depth, no understanding of the motivation behind their actions, and because of the general sloppiness, no reason was given to care about any of the characters or why they did what they did or wonder how they ended up. There are moments in the script where we're shown, ""Hey, look, this character has feelings, is acting a little bit sympathetic even if you normally don't like them! That means they have depth!"" Unfortunately, I don't buy into those moments because they're just more examples of lazy writing. And I think all of this is because there's no source material to back the program up as with the far superior ""The Jewel in the Crown."" Which is why I will recommend that program over ""Indian Summers"" any day because unless you like a pretty veneer with no depth, there's little else to look at.",10 out of 15 found this helpful.,4.0,24 November 2015
607,Indian Summers, Intriguing plot but pathetic research,"Well, I must say that the plot is interesting and the acting up-to the mark, especially season one. The 2nd season left a lot to be desired, especially during the end and no wonder they lost ratings and didn't get renewed. **SPOILER ALERT** The climax really is an anticlimax and in a way, quiet disappointing.<br/><br/>Although, the real kicker for me and what frustrated me the most was the depiction of Shimla and the people there. It was utter disgust, to the point of things seeming absolutely ridiculous, the way the screenwriters described the summer capital. It seems they had an Indian origin director, and also said to have made use of expert advise when depicting Shimla. Well, if they have done so, they have been ripped off by some fakes, for what was shown was a bunch of bull. Simla lies at the foothills of Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh - surrounded by hills and apple orchards and pines, where the highest summer temperature here is lower coldest winters in western and south India. People cover themselves with blankets even in summertime. But what was shown here was typical Deccan plains, more common in southern India and rest of south east Asia. They showed us the rice-fields(wow) and tropical forests, the dressing of the people - everything from another part of the country. It was painful to watch this, despite the story-line and the entertainment of the characters. <br/><br/>Would request show creators to do just a little bit of a homework about the place they plan to write about or create a movie or TV series on. It's not really that difficult, unless you just don't give a damn which I feel was how the creators of this series felt :)<br/><br/>Facts aside, if you still want to watch an entertaining drama set in India and the complex relationships between the British and Indians in pre-Indepndence India, this one is a must watch.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,25 May 2016

The depiction of Simla is so erroneous, the locals , vegetation, landscape , even the language of the locals, one's left wondering whether there was any research done pre production.

609,Indian Summers, An extravaganza of stereotypes,"I am enjoying this series, because of the fabulous scenery and the historical context. It's interesting to see how the resentment is building up amongst the local people, and how racism exists not only amongst the British occupiers but amongst the Indians themselves with their appalling caste system. <br/><br/>However I am disappointed with the characters. The cast includes a full set of stereotypes of the late British Empire, from the drunken Scot to the frustrated missionary, the arrogant consul to the Anglophile nawab. Thank goodness for Julie Walters, she's the only one who can actually carry off her character and bring her to life. The rest are just wooden.",12 out of 22 found this helpful.,7.0,14 April 2015
610,Indian Summers, What a long slow yawn !,"With all they hype surrounding this programme (Jewel in the Crown meets Downton Abbey etc)I expected something special. What a disappointment. The storyline is so slow and the camera seems to linger for so long on facial shots that I am losing the will to live (or see it out to the end). Fortunately I record it on 'skyplus' so I can replay on faster speed which serves to put me out of my misery quicker. After two episodes I don't know whether I am interested enough or care enough about the characters to see it to the series finale. It seems as though every character has a 'back story' which must be woven into the plot, which together with the interminable slowness of the storyline makes for a long and winding road with no end in sight. The only plus is the scenery, which like the facial shots, we get to linger over interminably. Some of the acting is extremely wooden and colourless, especially the main male character and the missionary and even Julie Walters, who seems to rely on facial expressions to play Cynthia, can't lift the pace.",18 out of 36 found this helpful.,5.0,1 March 2015
611,Indian Summers, Worst American Accents Ever,"So maybe the fact that the actors playing Americans can't come close to sounding American isn't the most important part of the show. But it's emblematic of what's wrong with this program. The whole show feels as if they're just not trying very hard. The script is good, but not very good. The acting is good, but not very good. The plotting is good, but not very good. And so on. You get the feeling that someone had the idea to make a Downton Abbey type show set in India, and include all the stock characters: the rich man, the poor man, the victim, the downtrodden, the saint, the sinner, etc. But no one decided to work hard to make it come together as a compelling piece of television. <br/><br/>The one thing they do well: the cinematography. So if what you're looking for is a chance to look at beautiful scenery, without caring much about anything else, this show is for you.

These include Fortitude which I thought was ridiculous.(prehistoric flesh eating wasps that cause people to pull out each other's intestines)<br/><br/>Indian Summers had a storyline that you couldn't predict, characters that realistically changed/grew and a clever dénouement. Sadly, said dénouement didn't tie up all loose ends. Will Ralph get his come uppance? Does he really love his fiancé? Will Alice be able to live with her man?

614,Indian Summers," Indian Summers good - but not ""Jewel in the Crown""","I am surely showing my age when I compare this wonderful production to the SUPERB 40 year old BBC production ""The Jewel in the Crown"". I am clearly a bigger fan of the latter, but that is not a criticism . ""Indian"" shows a slightly earlier time, giving even a more a sense of the build up to the necessary but horribly violent partition of 1947, so well portrayed in ""The Jewel"". All the acting in both productions is superb - the tensions between the various Indian populations and the pretty monolithic English population (with just a few English rebels accused of going ""Native""). It is crucial history that most Americans are unaware of. I don't know how familiar even the present English generation is with this terrible colonial history. In both productions, the fantasy world the English had created in India, truly believing themselves not only superior to Indians of all classes, but perfectly secure from any native sense of injustice and rage - is incredibly remarkable - and not far removed from our own history of slavery and ""Jim Crow-ism"" in the US South (AND NOrth!). If you love this series, please also see ""The Jewel in the Crown"", for as full a picture of this time and place as we Americans are likely to get or understand. PS ""Harry Potter's"" own Julie Walters shows an appallingly wonderful side in ""Indian"". And Judy Parfitt, late of ""Call the Midwife"" was a similar character 40 years ago in ""Jewel"". - Nothing like a glorious English actress!

615,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland," A Wonderful, Creative Fantasy!","Once Upon a Time in Wonderland is the story of Alice, but later on in her life. This is nothing like the Tim Burton interpretation. This is the spirited, little girl that we loved as Alice in books but all grown up. She's now a clever, young woman with determination.<br/><br/>Wonderland takes on a life of it's own, incorporating parts of the original story like the mock turtle and chess game, but serving them up in a whole new way.<br/><br/>There are references to Once Upon a Time, there's no need to watch this before Wonderland. Wonderland stands on its own as an interesting tale.<br/><br/>It's VERY creative and the story begins quickly. I suggest watching through to at least the 3rd episode then deciding if you want to stick with it. The 3rd, 4th and 5th episode are all great character studies, while the 1st and 2nd set the stage.<br/><br/>Strong female AND male characters lead characters are a nice touch. It's very balanced. <br/><br/>The story isn't spoon-fed to the watcher either which adds to the unpredictability. Anything that seems out of place (like the phony Queen and the presence of Jafer) are there for a reason is all I have to say.<br/><br/>It's great to see an extremely creative, fantasy show on TV. Being a fan of shows like Pushing Daisies, Wonderfalls, White Dwarf (I wish that made it past the pilot), and others, I really hope this show's given a chance.<br/><br/>A lot of sci-fi or vampire shows seem to make into several seasons, but fantasy seems to have more of a challenge.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of the better ones, but I fear it may suffer a similar fate to Stargate Universe (which starred Robert Carlyle AKA Rumplestilskin), where viewers expect it to be like the previous incarnation.<br/><br/>It's wonderful to see Michael Socha (The Knave of Hearts) play the underdog who struggles to do the right thing. (He was also in the ill- fated fantasy/horror ""Being Human"" UK version which ended too soon).<br/><br/>Wonderland is focused on just a couple stories, instead of several like Once Upon a Time. It's more of a quest and journey focusing mainly on Alice, but with VERY interesting characters surrounding her.",35 out of 37 found this helpful.,10.0,21 November 2013

Regina's mom is the Queen of Hearts. They are different characters in the Wonderland books as well. Timeline aside, I am enjoying this show. I like the different characters and the unique names of places and things within Wonderland.

617,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Very Clever Series with Great Potential.,"In the ever-growing (and confusing) world of ""Once"" we now take a prolonged trip to Wonderland in this stylish spin-off to the big hit ""Once Upon a Time."" <br/><br/>""Once Upon a Time in Wonderland"" is the story of Alice, a young girl who travels to the wondrous world, where she meets exciting and even terrifying people. However, when she returns home she tells her father of her amazing adventures but he doesn't believe her. To prove her sanity she spends many years of her life searching for proof for her father. Then she meets a genie named Cyrus. The two of them go on new adventures and fall in love. However, the Red Queen tracks them down and apparently kills Cyrus in front of Alice. In her world she is about to go through a terrible procedure to forget about Cyrus and her adventures. Just in time, the Knave of Hearts along with the White Rabbit save her and tell her Cyrus is alive. Now the three of them go to Wonderland to save Cyrus and liberate Wonderland from the hold of the Red Queen and Jafar.<br/><br/>To make an original series and make it feel fresh is hard to do. To make a spin-off series and make it feel fresh is nearly impossible to do. However, this show does feel fresh and full of energy. The world introduced here is full of vibrant characters and a fantastic cast with much depth put into their roles.<br/><br/>While the entire cast is wonderful it is Sophie Lowe as Alice that makes this such a delightful show to watch. For so many years Alice has been a damsel in distress yet, the tables are turned in this enchanting series. Lowe brings much personality and depth to a role that could've very easily been stereotyped. Alice is clever, witty, kind, and even tough as nails. She might be interested in finding her true love but she isn't willing to wait around for him to save her. It is really refreshing to see.<br/><br/>Just like the parent series ""Wonderland"" has many twists and surprises around the corner to lead up to an interesting climax. With interesting characters, great chemistry between the cast, fun and intriguing villains, and a wonderful love story that does not feel forced ""Wonderland"" is a truly enchanting story that will hopefully live up to its promise.",36 out of 45 found this helpful.,10.0,19 October 2013

I thought the story was very interesting and can have a lot of depth in the future. All stories start out slow, and this one has great potential. I see a lot of people complaining and I don't understand. This series is supposed to take place in a full on fantasy world and all I hear is the graphic aren't so great. But I so what I don't care as long as the story is good and the characters are likable. The time slot may need to be changed, preferably right after the first ""Once Upon a Time"". The lead actress does a great job at portraying a more mature Alice. Which is a nice change from all the kid like movies. So if you like a show that doesn't take itself to serious and is fun you will like this series.",15 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,12 October 2013
621,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Doesn't shine as its parent's premier did but still promising,"Of course it is early so far to say in confidence yet but based on this episode premier: this is the first more and less decent Alice in Wonderland adaptation since my all-time favorite version of 90's with Tina Majorino and Martin Short. This is a sequel to the original book, so not a direct adaptation just like recent Tim Burton's version was. It is OUaT's version of Wonderland but I am glad that so far this spin-off is more Alice Wonderland rather than Once Upon a Time.<br/><br/>Wonderland – the main asset of the original book is the world itself. Considering that it is only a TV show and, judging by OUaT, not the richest one in budget terms, I prepared for the worst but hoped for the best. In terms of special effects, the reality turned out to be if not quite the second one but still pretty close. I loved almost everything: from deem and gloomy Asylum where Alice's path in the series began (surprisingly, directors didn't try to save money even there: quite many parts of the Asylum are completely CGI made) to the dreamlike surreal landscapes of Wonderland. CGI is not better than it was in the first season of OUaT but in this context, little graphical details only add dreamlike delusional feel to the world Alice appears in. To my taste, Burton's version of Wonderland was way too detailed, it was way too fleshed out. So fleshed out that it lost its ""dream"" feel which certainly was in the book and was supposed to be in the adaptation. I hope the readers, especially fans of the original book, follow my logic here. Usually I am against bad CGI but here it actually served the dreamy and surreal context of the world.<br/><br/>All in all, I liked the creativity of graphical design, I liked that the amount of special effects in just this one episode is more than in the first 2 seasons of OUaT all together, I liked the carefulness with which the creators have approached this particular book adaptation: they managed to preserve the adventurous feel of the parent show but also didn't lose the overall book atmosphere which I so hoped to see in this story. Even if you don't care about surrealism and the book, if you were fine with the CGI quality of OUaT season one, you should be fine here also.<br/><br/>Actors- to those who say that the acting was bad: I disagree. Sophie Low shows us the finest Alice performance I have seen in a while- definitely better than Mia Wasikowska's performance. Sorry but where the heck was Sophie when Burton was making his movie? Sophie and Mia both perform a mature version of book Alice but in quite similar ways with an exception that Sophie actually acts and her mimics change. Her talking style and behavior is a bit modern, to my taste (I just don't believe that this girl was raised in Victorian London) but maybe I am bit picky here. Overall, solid performance of the main protagonist. Michael Socha, who plays the Knave of Hearts, didn't open up quite yet (neither in acting nor as the character) but it seems that the script writers do have couple As in their sleeve regarding this character for future episodes – and I will be waiting. Peter Gadiot (Cyrus) plays his part in the show well enough but just to the point. His performance is not superb but neither the script so far demands it. Loved the white rabbit (voiced by fabulous John Lithgow), just want to see him more and more. The new version of Cheshire Cat was odd but I still was glad to see one of my most loved characters right in the first episode. Despite of slightly altered personality, this cat still didn't lose its charm and I do hope we are not done with him yet. More cat and the rabbit!<br/><br/>Emma Rigby as the Red Queen (Red Queen, not Queen of Hearts) is the only one from the cast who slightly disappoints with her wooden acting (in this sense, can't help but compare Rigby to fabulous Helena Bonham Carter and not to the merit of the first one). However, the actress is pretty (so are her dresses) and her character doesn't irritate which is already something. Appearance of Jafar takes by surprise but it was a joy to see Naveen Andrews on a screen one more time. After all, with the wooden Red Queen around, charismatic Jafar is exactly what we needed (well, I needed for sure at least).That it is with the cast. Let's hope together for Hershey and Stan's at least cameo appearances in future episodes. No Alice adaptation is fun without the Hatter and Queen of Hearts! <br/><br/>Story – again, too early to judge yet but so far it seems to be more complicated than the Burton's version. After 2010 Alice in Wonderland, which disappoints terribly with its simplicity, any plot differentiated with at least a bit of creativity will be met with applause by me. And so far the first episode promises to provide us with something special.<br/><br/>Outcome- so far not great but quite decent. Worth attention, worth watching: if you are a fan of the parent show Once Upon a Time, if you are a fan of the original book (adaptation is not perfect but point me the one which is), if you are neither of the first two mentioned but you just like fairy tales. Who knows?- if you didn't like OUaT you still might like this spin-off. It is fun, it is fresh, it is adventurous. It is a new story and more and less meticulous adaptation of the book. For that – thanks to the creators. Seems that it is going to be a fun ride and I, personally, can't wait to see what this roller coaster hides behind the corner.",22 out of 31 found this helpful.,8.0,15 October 2013
622,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, More Fairy Tale Characters Come to Life,"I wasn't sure what to think when I saw that there was a spin off of ""Once Upon a Time"". I was initially skeptical of that show, but it grew on me. Maybe Disney just can't resist the tie-in to all those potential money-making cartoons of theirs already out there.<br/><br/>It's not bad, although the initial scenes of Alice in the asylum reminded me very strongly of the beginning of ""Return to Oz"". The brief scene in Storybrooke at the start was a bit useless, but I found the actors to all be quite likable, oh yay, more actors from Lost, and wow, doesn't that Red Queen have some lips! It will be interesting as time goes by (provided Disney/ABC doesn't cancel it after 3 episodes like they do most everything else) to see what characters may crossover between the shows.<br/><br/>I was really looking forward to hearing Paul Reubens take on the white rabbit, but maybe it will come out later.",15 out of 20 found this helpful.,,10 October 2013

The story revolves around Alice and her adventures in Wonderland. The real world thinks that she is crazy but of course she is not. She journeys into Wonderland to find her love and adventures ensue. The voice of John Lithgow as the White Rabbit is perfect. Michael Socha is a great Knave of a Hearts. Emma Rigby is brilliant as the Red Queen. Naveen Andrews is the PERFECT Jafar. What I really LOVE about this show and ""Once Upon A Time"" is that it give adults a fairytale to love. If you don't want to grow up...then try this one. Go back to the time of childhood and enjoy falling in love with love. I will miss this dearly. I cannot believe that they canceled this show.

626,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, An Alice who actually does things!,"I've only watched half the first episode so far, but this features an Alice who really does things. A lot of the asylum scenes seem reminiscent of American McGee's Alice, and she's just the sort of dish -- erm, girl -- to spice up a story to perfection. Not like the weak Alice of Tim Burton's film, this is a girl who's willing to muck in and fight, to take charge of her own life, to be more than just a damsel in distress (or a damsel in dis dress, although she does wear some pretty ones).<br/><br/>CGI in anything relating to Wonderland is of course going to be critical. I've seen the full gamut - openly cheesy, nice try but the tech's just not there, fairly good but flawed - and this is far from terrible.

628,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland," Not as good as expected, until later in the season, it suddenly improved...","I heard of this show after watching Once Upon A Time (as I assume most people have). There is no comparison - Once Upon A Time has a much more intricate and better-developed storyline, as well as generally much better actors. I have a great respect for actors, but at the same time I feel it is equally important to offer an audience critique, especially for more popular shows.<br/><br/>I watched 8 episodes (over quite a long period of time) because it was a genre I enjoy, even though the story and actors were fairly mediocre. The actor rating is an average - I think Emma Rigby is excellent as the Queen, and Sophie Lowe does wonderfully too. Peter Gadiot is attractive but not quite sincere as Cyrus. There is something missing in his delivery - it feels less like he is delivering his loving speeches towards Alice than an audience.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, and unfortunately for the show, Episode 9 is where things really pick up. They introduce a brilliant actress for the Jabberwocky - I'd never heard of her before but seeing her in action, this unique villain had me captivated. She introduces a much more unpredictable aspect to the storyline which improves the show greatly.<br/><br/>Then all of a sudden the story actually starts to tie in with the show Once Upon A Time. This should have happened MUCH earlier in this series for people to keep watching. <br/><br/>As I have expressed before, this show is nowhere near the quality of Once Upon A Time, but it is certainly improving as of the end of Season 1 - worth a look at the very least.

630,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Good but not Great 7/10,"I can't help but feel slightly disappointed with Once Upon a Time in Wonderland. I have only seen the first two episodes, and maybe there will be hope for the rest of the season, but right now I'm not too pleased.<br/><br/>The thing about this show is that it's actually pretty good as far as the actors go, and visually it's nice. I like the fact that everything in Wonderland looks pretty unreal, as if you've jumped into a hallucination. Sophie Lowe as Alice was a perfect choice, and her genie is very attractive. The writing is interesting, and I think it's awesome that they were able to weave in the parent show as well. <br/><br/>So if everything else is fabulous, what could be wrong with the show? <br/><br/>Well, in my opinion, it makes too much sense. <br/><br/>I know, that sounds weird, but think about it...Lewis Carrol's Wonderland is supposed to be a world occupied by insane, head-strong, eccentric, and often obnoxious characters. There is no madness in this story, and the characters are all quite logical and perfectly sane. It's just NOT Wonderland. <br/><br/>I don't think that movies/shows inspired by or based on books have to be carbon copies of the source material. That just wouldn't be realistic, of course, and I have no problem with a sequel/spin-off, just like I had no problem with Tim Burton's film. In fact, I loved his adaptation, because he captured the real essence of Wonderland, not the squeaky- clean Disney cartoon of the 1950s. And all the characters were a bit mad and rude. <br/><br/>But this version of Wonderland isn't really Wonderland. Again, I'm no stickler, but is it too much to ask that Wonderland is a world of madness? That's the most basic element of book, and the fact that this ABC version hasn't showcased that at all is a bit annoying.",18 out of 27 found this helpful.,,20 October 2013
631,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Once Upon a Time in Wonderland(2013-2014),"Based on the idea of Alice in Wonderland, this spin of series takes place in Victorian England where a young and beautiful Alice (but later on in her life,) takes in a strange new land on the other side of the rabbit hole.<br/><br/>Alice's doctors try to cure her as she must be insane. ""Alice seems ready to put it all behind her, especially the painful memory of the genie she fell in love with and lost forever - the handsome and mysterious Cyrus (Peter Gadiot).

Together, the trio will take a tumble down the rabbit hole to this Wonderland where nothing is impossible.""<br/><br/>Wonderland made the most of its mixed universes with some interesting design choices. Zapping from Victorian England to Wonderland to Agrabah to the Enchanted Forest to Storybrooke made the show feel bigger and more expansive than perhaps it truly was. Great special effect and clever cinematography add the the shows fantasy setting .<br/><br/>Wonderland did get the most important thing right, and that is in its cast and characters. Sophie Lowe as (Alice) impressed me. She made Alice the perfect balance between badass tough girl and well-rounded character. She has an expressiveness and honesty which really helps to sell the cheesier aspects of the show .<br/><br/>Michael Socha's Knave of Hearts/Will Scarlett was a great find, as he really helped fill in as an audience surrogate for the show, full of snark and sarcasm but gruffly heroic all the same.<br/><br/>Gorgeous Emma Rigby as the conflicted Red Queen really showed some depth as an actress as the story progress though out the series. She is a hidden gem.<br/><br/>And the casting of John Lithgow as the voice of the White Rabbit was simply brilliant.<br/><br/>Despite its relationship to stories synonymous with childhood, This adaptation thankfully has plenty of mild violence of both the traditional kind (knives, swordplay, and fistfights) and the magical kind. Danger lurks around every corner, and the character's double-crossing and changing loyalties are part of the fun.

Alice now all old and grown up with childhood experience that have made her grow into a tough young lady, Cyrus, a genie alive for 100 of years serving under the pleasure of masters too many to count and Alice's love, The red queen and knave whose lifes is ambiguous until later in the series and Jafar the villain ,a threat to all. But the whole focal point in here isn't really 100% on Alice. The authors put huge effort into making each character contribute vastly to the series and alter the motion of events and the direction the plot is heading towards. This isn't one of those series in which the side stories are just SIDE ones. Each character is given lots of attention, their own experiences, past, secrets and intentions which are to be revealed along the way. Each one has a story, just as important as Alice's is.<br/><br/>The story at the beginning sounds like a cliché rescue mission and the characters actions in the first few episodes seem to be out of the blue, that's only because the story and the intentions of the characters unfold as we go along, so bare the very first few episodes. The plot twists are hard to figure out and are unpredictable, again it is because the intentions and the character stories unfold later in the story that those twits are hard to figure out.<br/><br/>The conversion of 4 worlds was incredible to watch, if your in love with fantasy this is your place, the authors has managed to make a homogeneous shake of wonderland, Agrabah, Victorian England, and a touch of storybrook, that all in addition to moving through a timeline of 100 of years, and i tell you it did not feel enforced AT ALL , and did not miss the ""too much"" mark.<br/><br/>The actors were all new faces to me, but are all very talented. Sophie Lowe in the role of Alice, besides to being a screen fit, has a lot of talent, charisma, and you can tell her career will have a future. Peter Gadiot plays Cyrus, Alice's love, A genie, with a lot of wisdom, character and chraisma that he gained through his years of serving different kinds of people.The actor besides being really attractive, delivers those qualities exactly as prescribed. Michael socha, playing will/the knave of hearts is a complete surprise, it sometimes feels like he steals the lights from cyrus. The red queen (Emma rigby) and jafar (Naveen Andrews) characters and actors hit the lights too, and the white rabbit(John lithgow) is a good spice up, brilliant actually.<br/><br/>The Relationship between Alice and Cyrus steals the lights almost the entire show, The chemistry between the actors is the best i have seen between two actors in a very long time. Their relationship is beyond description, it feels real, it grows, its tested, and the lines/conversations are well written and smooth.<br/><br/>However its the Friendship between Alice and the Knave of hearts that really stands out. I think this is due to the fact that Their relationship gets a lot of screen time compared to Alice and Cyrus, but its a good trick, leaves the audience wanting more of the couple.<br/><br/>The parent-child relationships are touched around a number of times with many characters all throughout the series. Not just in a scene or two, but as a part of the characters story as a whole.<br/><br/>The character development for all the actors is average, i rank it as quiet good, with the exception of Alice, where the directors focus more on showing us how the experience shaped her personality, allowing her character to apply what she has learned all throughout her childhood journeys in wonderland. The back and forth movement along the timeline of the characters reveal a great deal of character development and growth too.<br/><br/>In a personal tribute, I would like to congratulate the writers and directors who managed to make the girl the HERO who saves the day without dimming the light of her loved one, raising the bar for both lovers to be at equivalent strength, to move away from the stereotype of the girl always being the weak and fragile, the one to be rescued. Both of the couples learned from each other, taught each other and taught us.<br/><br/>A down point to this series is the bad graphics, and the too much green screen, but by the 3rd episode they will start decreasing vastly, and you will start getting used to it.<br/><br/>So if you are into that sort of atmosphere, the magical wonderland, the old vintage England, the enchanting Agrabah, relationships with many many dimensions, and life lessons that you actually learn from, this mesmerizing surroundings will take you away for good.<br/><br/>I actually wanted to have a second season of this, but i am glad that by the end of the season a complete story is told with no lose ties left to tangle.<br/><br/>Its a great series, one of the most underrated productions i have ever came across actually, and with lots of potential, good acting, cast and stories to be seen and told. Don't judge it based on the bad graphics and the few first episodes.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,21 August 2016
636,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland," Not great, but worth watching","To begin I'd like to point out that the trailer is definitely more exciting than the series is. It's a nice idea, the crossover kind of works. But it also does not for several reasons. Some actors are either really bad, or their characters are unintentionally very annoying. Like Alice for example. Throughout the storyline she is just too perky, too determined and too optimistic. Her fighting skills also are not well staged. The red queen has too much botox and a whiny voice. But her character becomes more likable throughout the story line. The truth of the matter is that the flashbacks are more interesting than the actual story. The show becomes better when it progresses and has some surprisingly interesting ideas. The genie story seems to work out slightly better than the wonderland story. But in the genie story, the characters are unrealistic in the sense that mother and sons seem to have an age difference of less than 10 years and some of them look more European-Arabic, which slightly annoyed me. The show does have some very good scenes, some great actors and very nicely placed characters like the white rabbit and the jabberwocky. The actors have chemistry and the show flows nicely with some scenes better than the others. Which makes it worth watching.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,6.0,9 March 2015
637,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Next Volume,"Alice in Wonderland has always been one of my favorite fantasy stories when I was six and I still love it now, from it's color nonsensical nature it really showed that anything to everything is possible and can happen.<br/><br/>This is another under the radar gem I really like. I'm usual not all that keen on spin off shows, to me it's always a hit or miss affair; this one actually turned out to be a hit because it does what it should do, it acts as it's own story.<br/><br/>Personally I thought making a spin off on ""Once Upon a Time"" was actually a really cool idea, because it really broaden the scope of the franchise. It makes sense since after all the original show does have a fantasy realm which means a broader world and lots of possibilities for stories. Which is why it's a shame this show didn't succeed, who know if it did may'be we could of had one or two other spin off shows may'be ""Once Upon a Time in the Sherwood Forest"", ""Agrabah"", ""Narnia"" I'm not sure it could of been a number of things and so many other characters could of surfaced may'be even crossed over with the original show. I don't know and sadly we'll never know.<br/><br/>I really like the story it's pretty much you could say like with Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" it's kinda the third volume in the series. Though personally I like this show a lot more, it to me just has a lot more heart and going for it.<br/><br/>The effects in making the fantasy world of Wonderland are solid and believable enough, like with the original most of it was done on green screen. Though it's true not all the effects are on par, but it's network tele what the hell to you expect. But just like with ""Once Upon a Time"" it's not the effects that carry the show out, to me it's really the characters.<br/><br/>And yeah like with the original show there is a plot line and it does develop but it's the characters and mystery that the show is more concerned about, making this show kinda a character drama and fantasy suspense thriller.<br/><br/>However a few major differences with this show and the original is it has a more adventurous feel to it, as we see the characters explore the land more and there is even a bit more action, it's not wall to wall but solid/decent chirography is on par. And also the show has a bit more in the romance side of things as we explore more depth into the relationships the characters have and actually makes us care as to what happens to them.<br/><br/>I also like how in the plot line there are some crucial plot points that connect with the original show which makes this spin off more interesting because it really gives you another reason to re watch to find most of those connections, sort of an easter egg hunt.<br/><br/>The characters are great both protagonists and villains. I really like the live action version of Alice, the actress Sofie Lowe I liked her performance and personally she's my favorite live action version of Alice. She's cute, has a lot of charisma and wisdom, and also really like that she's capable of kicking ass. Even like the guy that plays her significant other Sirus, whom is the genie from the lamp. He's a good genie he's got charisma, capable of kicking ass, but I really love seeing how much of a trickster he really is. Both of them have solid chemistry and I really felt it was believable, and you really felt pathos for Alice as both are unfairly separated and getting shafted in the real world which just all the more makes you want Alice to win and for this couple to be together, they deserve each other.<br/><br/>However the two characters I like the best are Will Scarlett and the Red Queen/Annastasia. Will Scarlett is great he's pretty much a master thief but with a good heart if not exactly one of gold. He's borderline selfish and selfless, yeah he's a thief but he also knows when to help his friends but most of all would do anything for his significant other. However his character is also kinda sad and is lost in some way.<br/><br/>The Red Queen/Annastaisia is a interesting character. She not like exactly an all in villainous but more just a person whose head is in the wrong place. The problem with her is that she is driven by vanity and greed. But we see her slowly but surely realize those are not what she really needs at all . I really like the chemistry between the two and the depth which is complicated, sad, but also sweet. I really bought into it hoping both will find some way back to each other and themselves.<br/><br/>And like the original show, it's a bit of a Christian show as there are some Chirstian themes on redemption, forgiveness, love, and even honesty.<br/><br/>It's a real shame that this story was cut short, I really felt like there was potential for the show to go further. We could of saw even more of Wonderland, may'be some other characters could of entered the picture like Aladdin, Jasmine, or Sinbad. And may'be even a crossover with the original show. However I wouldn't fret too much due to the fact this show didn't end on some unanswered cliffhanger note it makes the show sort of a mini series.<br/><br/>Overall this I think is a great spin off that I feel is worth a look if your a fan of ""Once Upon a Time"" or even a non fan of the franchise. Wonderland has gotten a lot bigger.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,10 November 2014
638,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Nice concept but one glaring problem.,"My problem with this show, lies mainly with the writing. To me, the writing is as cookie cutter as they come. When I watch or read something, I like whichever formulaic approach is taken in writing the plot, to be hidden beneath layers of good scenes, action, and dialogue. With this show, I constantly feel distracted by the fact that the formula is staring right at me the entire time. Its almost as if the writers are fresh out of a classroom and afraid to experiment with tweaking known working formulas just enough to make the show more engaging, and less run of the mill. <br/><br/>Thats my main gripe with the show. Some others include: - The marshmallow swamp scene seems out of place. This is Wonderland, not Candyland. - The actor's lines seem forced and could be written a lot better. - The twists aren't all that unexpected barring the Wonderland / Aladdin mash up.<br/><br/>Which makes me think a stand alone series for Aladdin might have been the better route all together.<br/><br/>-Special effects from the early nineties. The chroma keying is ugly. There's no excuse for being able to see the lines where the actors have been cut and pasted onto scenes in this day and age. Especially when Disney owns the company broadcasting the show.<br/><br/>With all that being said, there are a few things I like.<br/><br/><ul><li>The Aladdin mash up. (Again wish it were its own series though.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The acting really isn't that bad. They just don't have much to work with when reading the atrocious lines that the writers wrote.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The prospect of a girl fight between Alice and the Queen lol.</li></ul><br/><br/>All in all I think the show rates around more of a 6. It falls victim to that whole great idea, poor execution thing.",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,6.0,18 October 2013
639,Once Upon a Time in Wonderland, Once Upon a Time down the rabbit hole,"'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland' really interested me. Am a big fan of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking Glass', have seen recently the books and Carroll as a person in a whole new light as well, and really liked its parent series 'Once Upon a Time' for much of Seasons 1-5 before becoming hit and miss in the Underworld arc and in Season 6 and then having a generally disappointing last season (with a few episode exceptions).<br/><br/>So there was real interest to see how the Wonderland characters would work with this premise and 'Once Upon a Time's' format of multiple storylines, fairy-tale flashbacks and references to stories. Seeing it, it was quite enjoyable but was an uneven show and didn't live up to full potential. In all fairness though, one can say that it didn't get enough of a chance to grow, as by the latter half of the show's limited run it had actually started to grow. Comparing it to its parent series, 'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland' at its best (the last three episodes, which were great) is not quite as great as 'Once Upon a Time' at its best but its worst episodes (for me it was ""Home"", which is probably not a popular opinion, and even that was more borderline average than lacklustre) are nowhere near the parent series at its worst which was the worst of Season 7.<br/><br/>Am going to start with what didn't work in 'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland'. The asset that was consistently bad and never improved upon was the special effects, which were cheap looking throughout. The White Rabbit fares least badly, but Caterpillar and Cheshire Cat (the latter being an odd character all round and far from purr-fection) were very poorly done and Bandersnatch in ""Forget Me Not"" was beyond amateurish. Jabberwocky also looked ridiculous but was actually a good character otherwise. A lot of the episodes were on the muddled and over-stuffed, especially the first three episodes and ""Home"". Some episodes had a good deal of time wasting, the Mallow Marsh stuff in ""Down the Rabbit Hole"" didn't intrigue or entertain that much and felt like padding.<br/><br/>Naveen Andrews and Emma Rigby generally didn't gel. They both had their moments when Jafar and Red Queen were actually interestingly developed and more than stock villains and their motivations clear, Andrews in ""The Serpent"" and ""Bad Blood"" and Rigby in ""Heart of Stone"" and ""Heart of the Matter"". Mostly though the characters are one-dimensional and Red Queen's decision making and such especially can be very all over the place and both mostly were not too great. Andrews tended to be dull and lacked menace as Jafar and Rigby often overacts to an embarrassing degree and is also not sinister enough. Their competition in who can ham it up the most in ""Trust Me"" was more indigestion-inducing than fun. Some of the dialogue was pretty cheesy and didn't always flow.<br/><br/>For all those problems, 'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland' has a lot of recommendable things. Less than special special effects aside, the show looks good. It is beautifully and atmospherically photographed, complete with vivid set design (especially the Red Queen's palace) and colourful costumes. Complete with a nice contrast of vibrant Wonderland settings and the more grim Victorian era ones when they appeared. The music also has atmosphere in a foreboding and infectious way, while the main theme sparkles in a way that fits with the premise. The opening sequence is well designed.<br/><br/>While the writing is not perfect, enough of it is thought provoking and has charm and fun. A lot of the best lines go to Knave, who is on the whole one of the best characters. Emotions-wise, the humour comes off the best with the Knave's sass and he and Alice have many great exchanges throughout. The storytelling was heavily flawed for much of 'Once Upon a Time in Wonderland's' run and started off very uneven but by ""Bad Blood"" or so the emotion increased as did the tension stakes. Found Cyrus underdeveloped to begin with but ""Dirty Little Secrets"" did a great job with him, and ""Nothing to Fear's"" calmer treatment of Lizard and its tastefully done exit for the character were appreciated. Cheap physical form aside, Jabberwocky was a very promising character and made a strong first impression in ""Nothing to Fear"". A character high point was Cora's return in ""Heart of the Matter"".<br/><br/>Excepting reservations with Andrews and Rigby, and Iggy Pop in ""Forget Me Not"" was an odd choice for Caterpillar and didn't fit the look, the acting was fine. Sophie Lowe was very appealing as Alice, and really appreciated her more mature, wittier, assertive and more active in the action personality. Michael Socha often stole the show, loved him as Knave and Peter Gadiot did very well with what he did when he was used well. Barbara Herschey thoroughly enjoys herself as Cora/Queen of Hearts and Peta Sergeant's Jabberwocky was creepy and authoritative. John Lithgow was inspired casting for White Rabbit and Keith David's voice for Cheshire Cat was that character's redeeming quality (a character that was otherwise a misfire).<br/><br/>On the whole, uneven but got a lot better in the second half post-""Home"". 6/10",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,6.0,4 January 2021
640,Con Man," Wasn't sure at first, but now I'm loving it","It seemed like Con Man took a couple of episodes to find its tone, but once it did I began loving it. Yes, it makes fun of people attending cons, as a previous reviewer noted. It makes fun of people who work at cons. It makes fun of people who book cons. It makes fun of people who act in shows whose fans attend cons. In other words, everybody in this show is a little bit clueless and/or venal and/or crazy - and yet they're all likable and familiar. This isn't Great Art, but it's a hoot - and playing spot-the-SF-star is half the fun.

641,Con Man, I think it's hilarious,"The show feels a lot like Spiner's Fresh Hell or at least the basic idea does. However, the production value and the list of guest stars (which is basically the a Who's Who list of fan favorites in the sci-fi / fantasy genre) are miles ahead in Con Man and the story and characters are overall a lot funnier. The premise of the show is about a sci-fi actor who's entire career is defined by his role in a short lived TV show and how he struggles with this ""creative-stigma"" on a daily basis. The humor mostly comes from scenes between Tudyk and convention fans, convention volunteers, his booking agent and other actors in his circle. And the anecdotal aspect of it (since Tudyk plays a parody of himself) makes this show extremely funny and I had to pause a couple of times to recover from laughter before continuing to watch. Though, in my opinion it also has enough funny material for people who aren't familiar with Firefly and Tudyk to make it just as entertaining to watch.",52 out of 58 found this helpful.,10.0,15 October 2015

With all the ups and downs that the actors, shows, and productions have to live and deal with, this follows what happens when one of the stars, who played the lead pilot in their now canceled show, goes around to the different ""Cons"" speaking about the show; and what happens to him and his agent.

643,Con Man, Alan Tudyk shows he is a deceptively good writer!,"While it's no secret that Alan Tudyk's career has been substantially helped by his successes in the sci-fi genre, his self-written ""Con Man"" gives the actor a well deserved poke in the self complacence. Mr. Tudyk's writing is witty, ridiculously funny in parts, thoughtful and opens his soul to us. We see a man who has never had his magnum opus (in his own mind) despite being loved and adored for his work on a science fiction show that was cancelled far, far too soon. As a result, he grows to hate the very show that made his face so well known. To me watching the series, I was struck by the thought that Leonard Nimoy's book ""I am not Spock"" shares a similar tone to Alan Tudyk's concept. He plays the role of former star so well, I've no clue if Mr. Tudyk personally feels this way or not, though I suspect there is some personal truths in the writing of this show.<br/><br/>The glimpse of him playing ""Cash"" during the 'lost episode' clips had me interested in what I thought was going to be a goofy insert - but I found that in those moments the actor and co-producer Nathan Filion filmed a very interesting, entertaining and intense vignette.<br/><br/>If you enjoy low-brow humour, it is replete throughout. If you want to care about the plight of a man who, though he was forced to make some garbage, strives to be better - to entertain. That's what this series does. Con Man entertains, and it does it with respect and care.<br/><br/>Congratulations team. You have made something memorable and enjoyable. Now, go make more.

The satirical style of comedy created by the people in front of the camera and behind the camera is its own style that nobody else is quite able to replicate. <br/><br/>All the negative reviews are over my head. I cannot express how much I loved the series, I cannot say enough good things about it, and I cannot give it anything less than 10 stars.",12 out of 14 found this helpful.,10.0,11 February 2018
658,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, Great Fun,"I have not seen the film this series is based on. But the series is just wonderful, charming, bizarre and a great deal of fun. Its like a parody on 80s teen movies but it ends up something much more. This alternative universe is a warm place to spend a couple of hours in. Paul Rudd is excellent as one of the lead character, he is overacting but so does everyone else in the cast, and it works. In some strange way it doesn't feel like a parody but more like a reality somewhere else. Like a movie started to become real and the characters live on far after the movie ended.<br/><br/>The cast is excellent and its just big names everywhere like Amy Poehler, Bradley Cooper, Jason Schwartzman, Elisabeth Banks, Chris Pine and it goes on and on. And its great fun seeing this big names and some in minor parts building up this summer camp universe. <br/><br/>For everyone that likes bizarre, sometimes childish but still funny movies.",43 out of 70 found this helpful.,8.0,31 July 2015
659,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp," Ignore the mixed reviews - if you like the movie, check this out...","WHAS:FDoC is awesome. Its not really a series of 30m stand alone episodes, its much better digested as one looong movie which is easily watched over a couple sessions. Fortunately netflix makes this easy.<br/><br/>The show is a lot of fun. As with the movie, its not really easy to describe. Its part parody but often played very straight and not even necessarily for the joke. There's a lot of the show (and movie) which come across as a straight forward camp storyline. Some of the jokes miss. Some a predictable. But when you put it all together its a TON OF FUN. There's goofy stuff. There's creative bits. There's wonderful cameos. Amazing setpieces. Perfect music. And a lot of laughs. It also manages to poke fun at at least five or six movie/TV themes (camp films, courtroom drama, rock bio, military, coming of age, etc).<br/><br/>It should be noted that the finished product is really pretty amazing given the limitations of schedule and trying to recapture the look/tone/feel of a movie made many years ago. They do some VERY creative camera-work and editing to stretch each actors involvement to feel like everyone was there the whole time.<br/><br/>So...check it out..and stick with it. The first few episodes are pretty straight forward..then stuff gets wacky around ep3 and doesn't let up. Its awesome!!",26 out of 46 found this helpful.,9.0,3 August 2015
660,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, It makes the audience feel like they've never left Camp Firewood-- a wonderful continuation overall.,"If you did not like the jokes in the original movie, do not watch the series; if there is one thing that the two have in common, it's a childish sense of humor. Personally, I love it, but do not expect to like the TV show if you did not like or have not seen Wet Hot. <br/><br/>I'm praying for a season two, but given the busy schedules of the actors involved, it'll be iffy. Also, it kind of depends on the ratings. If you're a Wet Hot fan and reading this, give the show a 5-star review! <br/><br/>With that out of the way, I think this is bound to make die-hard fans like me feel all warm inside. It makes the audience feel like they've never left Camp Firewood— a wonderful continuation overall. There were a few minor things that seemed too modern (this is a very small example, but a lot of the new female characters had ombre hair, something that wasn't really a thing until 2005+), but it didn't really affect my viewing experience. <br/><br/>Tiny spoilers in this paragraph! The Camp Tigerclaw subplot sometimes showed hints of whatever Netflix did to ruin Arrested Development in season 4, but I think that it was perfect overall; this isn't because I enjoyed it (which I didn't!) but because it was unobtrusive. Any cinematography, costuming, or lines that seemed out of place stayed at Camp Tigerclaw and didn't bleed into Camp Firewood, for which I am grateful. <br/><br/>Overall, I think this is a home-run. Cult movie nerds like me will fall in love with Camp Firewood all over again. I'm kind of regretting binge-watching the whole thing right now—sad that it's over ☹ <br/><br/>(I don't think that there was enough Ben and Mckinley, but that's just a personal thing. They still had some cute moments~ Get Mckinley laid!)",21 out of 41 found this helpful.,10.0,31 July 2015

But we decided to try the show anyway since 40-somethings in wigs playing teens seemed like an amusing idea. And it was! For me, that joke never got old. Besides that, there were some great parody story lines, playing on old TV and movie tropes, that I found very funny.<br/><br/>-Standout Actors-<br/><br/>The show is worth watching for Paul Rudd and Elizabeth Banks alone. They both went hilariously over the top, plus their story lines were among the funniest. Kristen Wiig, Josh Charles, Chris Pine, and Michael Cera were standouts in smaller roles, for the same reason.<br/><br/>-This show is polarizing -- for a reason-<br/><br/>Some people won't get the humour here, perhaps because they just don't appreciate irony and absurdism. But maybe there's another reason I think some people haven't been exposed to all the cheesy after school specials and movies of the week that this show is parodying. TV has become pretty sophisticated in the past decade or so; it's not quite as innocent (and in some cases, silly) as it used to be. And if you're not familiar with what's being parodied, it's hard to get the joke.",13 out of 24 found this helpful.,8.0,14 August 2015
662,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, Wet Hot American Summer First Day of Camp,"Wet Hot American Summer First Day of Camp is the newest Netflix original series and it is a continuation of the 2001 Film Wet Hot American Summer. The film has many of the same stars and has some new ones such as Chris Pine, Jason Schwarzmann, Michael Cera and numerous other recognizable stars. The series explores life at summer camp to and extreme level and also to a some what relatable level at some times however for the most part the series is absurd and unrealistic which is not necessarily a bad thing as most of the comic aspects of the film rely on dry humor and the crazy things the characters do. The characters feel like cartoon characters and the whole show feels like a real life cartoon, I could not help but think of Cartoon Network's Camp Lazloo when I watched this which is a very unique new type of comedy from the traditional less absurd comedies such as Big Bang Theory and Silicon Valley. The series will not be as enjoyable to all who do not enjoy this ridiculous humor however the stunning cast and filmography will be a definite treat.<br/><br/>8.5/10",19 out of 38 found this helpful.,9.0,1 August 2015

There was no plot to speak of, and the dialogue was inane. My guess is that the only reason it's gotten any good reviews at all is because it has such a seasoned and talented cast. What I don't understand is why Amy Poehler would go from a stellar show like ""Parks and Rec"" to this dump of a show. <br/><br/>I know there's great writing out there.

The writing was lame, there was no connection to the movie to speak of, and I wondered why all the actors agreed to do the film (does anyone read scripts?). Somehow, there was enough to get me to watch the rest and I must say there were some funny bits. It reminded me of SNL, where maybe one out of four skits get me laughing.<br/><br/>It was great fun watching all the actors do their thing, some of them surprisingly well. Jon Hamm is a riot, especially in a fight with Christopher Meloni. Both of them playing their absurd roles totally straight-faced. I did not recognize Chris Pine, and enjoyed him as well as a half-dozen a-list actors and actresses.<br/><br/>I'm glad I stayed for the later episodes.",12 out of 25 found this helpful.,8.0,1 August 2015

It might be a feel good movie for them and for the producers but it's just painful to watch for everybody else.<br/><br/>Netflix clearly got played on this one and proves that producing decent TV is not easy.

666,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, Do not understand what all the hype is about.,"I guess I should start by qualifying that I have not seen the original movie. Most of the positive reviews said that this is not a prerequisite, so, led on by all of the promoting that Netflix had been doing, I dove right in. And I'm pretty sure I hit my head on the bottom.<br/><br/>To put it succinctly, this over-hyped show seems to disappoint in just about every respect. As I think another reviewer mentioned, this is like an extended episode of SNL (one of the more recent, god-awful ones). The writing isn't at all clever or witty (so much so that it's hard to even identify most of the punchlines), and the delivery doesn't make it any better. Instead, it's pure celebrity porn -- one big name cameo after another -- and little else, substance-wise.<br/><br/>Basically, if (i) you're a die-hard fan of the franchise, or (ii) you know you'll get a kick out of ""campy,"" yet lackluster performances by Paul Rudd, Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, or one of the countless other 30- and 40-year-old stars pretending to be teenagers, maybe this is worth your time.

I love TV, I love movies, I watch up to 80 hours of all genres a week due to health reasons. However this one show will not be given a 2nd chance. Sorry! Maybe if they had made the characters a little more believable, so a person could pick a favorite and cheer on whatever their goal was for the summer.

669,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, WET BLANKET American SUMMER,"Yet another ""wet blanket"" to add to the list of financially and internally motivated uprated shows/movies from Netflix Originals. I read that Netflix does not look at the ratings of their shows to avoid the messy mid-first season cancellations that other networks like NBC face and not to affect the shows ""integrity"". This however is a double edged sword as Wet Hot American Summer can attest to. This show along side of other ""financially motivated"" over rated ""WET BLANKETS"" of Netflix Originals, such as ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"", ""Sense8"" and even... yes... dodge incoming flak...""House of Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" are well in over rated territory. Do all of us a favour, if you ever find yourself caught up in the nonsense of ""what's in"" and what is currently being talked about at your local water cooler... which in turn may cause breakouts of overratedness and loss of common sense... do what everyone should do... a palate cleanser. Just look at Breaking Bad and its rating of 9.5.

671,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp," Just a fun, amazing comedy that is hard to explain.","This show was based off the also very good movie, by the same name. It follows the movie by being the first day of the camp, whereas the movie was the last day of the camp. To make a prequel fourteen years later was pretty surprising, but it was just as amazing and funny as the movie, maybe better. It would be very hard to explain, like they tried to in the last episode, but it will not cover everything. It was an exceptionally well written script meant to be funny and not very serious, and it is just that. The movie uses a cast made of almost all well-know stars that will have you laughing until the very end. The characters all have their own personalities, but share the same stupidly hilarious humour. The entire show is full of stupid, but very funny jokes that will have you on the floor laughing just about the whole time. The very well-picked actors and actresses make the entire show even better. They do things you would not usually see them do and it is just so amazing.

Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

675,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, Oh Come On Folks!,"Another Netflix miss, and they are batting pretty low, except for Sense8, which won't fly for the audiences who like the others. Another reviewer asked people to compare Netflix series to shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, (the BBC original) House of Cards, and the other really amazing and groundbreaking series out there. This is the old if it worked once, it should work again, right? Even though the movie this is based on didn't work at the time, but now has a cult following (of whom? Oh, the Dumber and Dumber crowd!). It is odd that it didn't work, as those were the days of the aforementioned Dumber and Dumber and such fare, but even those were better, even with sex and sex organs as the main plot lines. This prequel to the movie (Prequel??? But the actors are the same as the 2001 movie, so older, making no sense, even for a cartoon, which, at its core, it is) misses on all counts...not funny in any way, not an escape, childish (but not funny). Bugs Bunny was funnier. It is an embarrassment and so over the top that it flops on the other side. Maybe if it were billed as sci-fi...as this is surely such a bad (and badly acted) alternative reality that it could not possibly be considered based on reality as we know it. Just horrid, I barely got through one episode, then went looking for the Mad Men stars, so scanned further along, but even they couldn't rise above the writing and seeing such fine actors make utter fools of themselves was no fun, either. I admit i don't like many series and not stupid comedy (but the ratings were good, so I gave it a shot and the Mad Men connection reeled me in), but if something is done well, I'm all in. Well, I'm all out on this one and it was no summer escape for me. I can't think of one thing in this series that was even OK, except maybe the DP knew how to point and shoot a camera. Even the music and clothes were misrepresented for the period.

This is made worse by the fact that they are working side by side with so many actual teenagers. <br/><br/>I understand that part of the ""excitement"" for fans of the original movie is getting to see the old cast reprise their roles, but this series comes off as cheap ""See how many really famous actors we crammed into this cast?"" celebrity porn. In most cases, the talent is largely wasted (I'd bet some of them are even embarrassed by the finished product), and I actually thought some of the best (or at least most genuine) acting was done by the real teenagers in the series. <br/><br/>It could have been so much better.

678,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, If you're a fan then you'll like it but if not...,"When I heard that netflix were bringing back this cult comedy I was surprised. Personally when i first watched the original I enjoyed it but after a while I just forgot about it. I was shocked at how much of a cult following it gained over the years. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the movie and i shouldn't really complain about getting a whole season of seeing the actors back playing their characters before the original movie took place. I did find it funny how they are supposed to be young adults but they look much older than before. I don't really care about this sort of thing as long as they address it. Anyway I probably should review the TV show so here goes... I've binge watched all of the episodes and the weakest episodes were definitely the first two, and understandably so. However it does gradually improve, but that doesen't mean i loved the last few episodes and this is definitely down to me not being a huge fan of the movie. I can definitely see fans of the movie loving this nostalgia filled series; there are lots of callbacks to the film, some which i probably missed and people can feel joy in this aspect. But as I am not one of these people I just found this series to be a fairly funny show. The a- list actors were the main redeeming quality and the cast alone is why my score is a 7 and not a 4, but I do wish we saw them much more. I found the younger cast annoying and i didn't care about them at all. The cringe was a little bit unbalanced and left me not enjoying the experience a lot more. But that's not saying i hate awkward shows; the UK and us office are one of my favourite TV shows and that is because they did it right and there were enough jokes to balance out the funny awkwardness. But ""First Day Of Camp"" is a different story and I think people who enjoyed it, deep down were probably a little disappointed.<br/><br/>Overall, if you are a fan of the original then you may find some enjoyment in this prequel but if you aren't then you are not missing out by not watching it. But i still found myself chuckling at times and whenever an actor who I liked showed up I did find some enjoyment in that aspect.

679,Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, My favorite TV show of all-time,"Whoa. Slow down. That's a pretty ambitious statement, favorite TV show of all- time? Really? Yeah. I also think it's the smartest TV show of all time, because no one makes comedy like this. It's sort of similar to the style of humor and the randomness of Family Guy. Also, in a way, it's the kind of humor Scary Movie tried to achieve.<br/><br/>I love the good vibes and how they manage to capture a genuine summer camp feeling while still being completely ridiculous in the acting and story line. The soundtrack is great and to my surprise consists of pretty much all original music. So nice. They poke fun at pretty much every television and movie stereotype, sometimes in such subtle ways many could mistake certain parts for being cheesy, or lame. But rest assured, it's 100% intentional. Every episode and almost every single scene has subtle elements of comedy within the comedy that makes for inceptional hilarity. The whole series really embraces lame-on-purpose and takes discreet comedy to a whole new level.<br/><br/>I hate to be judgmental and all but I feel so strongly about this show that I can only conclude that if you don't find this TV show hilarious then A) you don't get it, B) you haven't been exposed to enough pop culture to understand what they're mocking, or C) you laugh out loud at films like Central Intelligence and find Barney Stinson to be the funniest man alive.<br/><br/>I just wanted to write this review out of pure passion. Third time I see the show now, and it still holds up. Just wanted to give some cred to the geniuses behind this awesomeness.<br/><br/>Sidenote: the movie is not nearly as funny, but it's very entertaining to watch the TV show and then the movie, just to see how young everyone looks.",6 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,6 August 2016

Some of them played teenage camp counselors despite being too old. Fifteen years later, most return to play the same characters in a prequel during their first day at Camp Firewood in the summer of 1981. The time bending silliness of that construction is boldly inventive and utterly hilarious. On top of that, this eight-episode Netflix series doubles down and goes even more ridiculous. The plot is insane. The jokes are even broader. The original confused me on my first viewing.

682,Maude, Then There's Maude!,"Unfortunately, I never saw Maude until I got the DVD first season of her show. It appeared nowhere in syndication maybe because it was too controversial and might offend too many people. Compared to other shows today, Maude is quite mainstream and ahead of it's time. I loved Beatrice Arthur in this role of Maude, forget Dorothy Zbornak. Bea plays a terrific Maude Findlay, the cousin of dimwitted Edith Bunker, from All in the Family. Anyway, the casting of Bill Macy as Maude's fourth husband is genius. They work so well together. Adrienne Barbeau is terrific as her divorced daughter, Carol. Of course, we never see Philip, the eight year old dimwitted grandson. Then there is the supporting cast which is stellar like Conrad Bain as the conservative Republican right wing doctor neighbor and friend to Walter's character and Esther Rolle who plays the African American maid, Florida Evans who is fawned over by Maude's character in the beginning that she doesn't get much work done. Don't forget Rue McClanahan as dimwitted Vivian and friend of Maude. I can't help but like Maude. For all things that she gets wrong, she gets a lot of it right. Today's television writers and developers should learn from the sitcom master, Norman Lear, that a great show like Maude's can be both controversial and funny and genius too. Most sitcoms today lack the balance between left and right. Lear's sitcoms provided both sets of opinions without winning the battle. I'm sure if the sitcom people today would watch, they might learn something about developing quality sitcoms. Remember it's not quantity but quality and it's a shame.

The role of the mother in the early TV sitcoms was such where she was branded ""Miss Perfect Homemaker"". Maude was the New York suburban housewife who broke the mold to all of that by giving a pejorative spin to so many of the politically liberal philosophies which prevailed during the 1970's ...While Alice Kramden (""Honeymooners"") and Edith Bunker (""All in the Family"") established ground-rules on the perfect mother and wife not being so perfect, it only went so far, and was attributed to a lack of adequate household income... Maude was different in that, she, herself, was the culprit to domestic upheaval, and that, she ,alone, was anything but perfect!!!...Maude was the lousy Long Island Liberal.. Have at least twenty percent of the guests at your party be African American...The maid is not inferior to me...She is to have lunch in the dining room...THAT'S AN ORDER!!..My daughter can have casual sex in my house, just to prove that I'm a modern mother....All of these socio-political actions were disconcerting qualities of successful liberalism...The ultimate compliment being...Maude is just like Jane Fonda or Barbara Walters!!!... One of the most scathing indictments of Maude was that she used minorities as objects of tokenism to nurture her seemingly egalitarian beliefs!! Arguments in the Findlay home would linger into the wee hours of the night, and would ultimately translate to Maude basically saying ""I need to assuage my guilt!!"" The television show ""Maude"" was WAY!!!! ahead of it's time, and was an accurate depiction of the increasingly emerging, yet typically atypical upper middle class domicile of the seventies...Social hang-ups and affluent facades made the perception of lace curtain living a precarious panacea!! Regardless of any political party affiliation with anyone on this show, anguish stemming from unrealistic expectations always seemed to rear it's ugly head!! A largess of emotional afflictions with the characters on ""Maude"" were always related to instinctive reactions!! Modern problems were perpetually subjected to the trials and tribulations of egregious human errors!! The transition in the overall American value system is what compounded the day to day domestic dilemmas in Maude's family life!! This show is one of my favorite situation comedies of all time!! Up until 1972, no TV show possessed such acrimonious and such witty dialog like ""Maude"" did in the whole history of television!! I wish more shows could be so realistic about attitudes and quirky lifestyles!!! Having the same producers as the show ""The Honeymooners"", it does not surprise me. The talent for articulating abominable human behavior in both these shows was simply amazing!! The series, ""Maude"" encompassed a bevy of recognizable flaws and executive class frailties which made it extraordinarily humorous!! Quasi affluent families in America are not stilted, ""Maude"" was one of the first television shows to point this out!! Objectionable humor is often times a necessary metamorphosis in small screen entertainment!! While some may protest to this technique, it signifies a very healthy element of realism in a television show to bring out household peculiarity concerning skeletons in the closet to everybody's immediate attention!! After ""Maude"", suburban New York will never be the same!!",26 out of 44 found this helpful.,10.0,8 January 2004
684,Maude, Pass the damn Tylenol!,"I really want to like this forward-thinking show from legendary TV creator Normal Lear, but the more episodes I've consumed in syndication lately, the more irritated I am getting. There's so much bickering and yelling over one another on this show that it's giving me mad anxiety.<br/><br/>I've barely made it through the 4th season and I am just about ready to tap out. Their British maid Mrs. Naugatuck is especially unbearable and quite possibly one of the worst casting decisions in all of television. Most shows tend to get better in their 3rd and 4th seasons as they continue to hone their craft, but this show appears to have gotten worse as it goes on. At least Adrienne Barbeau's career was launched with this series, but even here she's given little to do and reduced to jokes about her ample bosoms. Mind you, they are real and they are spectacular, but I doubt that's enough to keep me watching.<br/><br/>Maybe if I keep the headache medicine handy I can hang in there and finish the series, but it seems unlikely.

When CBS premiered this spin off from ""All In The Family"" in September of 1972,no one had the slightest idea that it would last until April of 1978 where it ran for an astounding six years.<br/><br/>""Maude"" gave people a chance for the people of ""All In The Family"" to tackle the female side of issues..by creating a powerful,subtle and holds no punches as well as humorous and full of fight woman that had just as stronger views as Archie Bunker--who else couldn't keep her mouth shut! She spoke her mind on things and her her political views were extremely rare to boot! However,Maude's household was full of surprises cause you never know what can you expect especially the occurrences happening at the Findlay's. In other words,in Maude's house she didn't take no crap from any sucker cause she was the total boss of the dome! Tough-spirited yet gullible. Bill Macy was the perfect husband Walter who was an salesmen played it to the hilt! Also rounding out the cast were there next door neighbors--the nutty and slightly unpredictable Harmon's played by Rue McClanahan and Conrad Bain,and the Findley's daughter Carol played by Adrienne Barbeau and their housekeeper played by two different actresses(Seasons 1-2 played by Esther Rolle who played Florida who after this had a spin off from Maude as well called ""Good Times"")and Carol's son(from a previous marriage) and Maude's nephew Phillip(played by two different actors especially one of them who played the first Phillip went to star opposite Linda Lavin's son onanother CBS series ""Alice"").<br/><br/>One of the best three favorite episodes from the series was the one where Phillip was acting like a real brat. Carol and Walter were fed up with him,but Maude believed there was no such thing as a bad child. THEY WERE WRONG! She showed Phillip who was the boss around here especially when adults are in charge!<br/><br/>The other episode where Phillip had some friends over to the Findley's for a party complete with a live band. What made Maude so angry in that episode was that Phillip was with some friends in the back yard smoking pot while the rest of his friends really trashed the house! But anyway when Maude asked Phillip about the pot,he really gave his mom a hard time and his room and himself was smelling like pot as well and of course lied to her about it,but it was Maude that gave him a wicked back hand across his face for talking back to his mother and to her! In other words,Carol didn't know how to control Phillip when he got older,since she was a divorce parent who never took time out since Phillip's dad was never around,but it was Maude who really gave the kid a good advice and some common sense,and to Carol as well on how to raise her son!<br/><br/>The other episode was when The Harmon's had a special guest in the neighborhood and no one really knew it at first,but the beans leaked out and out of the blue comes the Duke himself---JOHN WAYNE! and also had a musical interlude by no other but Donny Hathaway in a rare TV appearance who also wrote and compose the show's theme song.<br/><br/>LONG LIVE THE QUEEN....MAUDE RULES!!!",14 out of 28 found this helpful.,,13 September 2002
686,Maude, Vicious Hag on Steroids,"Bea Arthur played Maude. She had been in the Marines during World War II, and always had issues due to hating men, and hating the U.S.A. Typical of any Norman Lear sit-com, Maude was angry at America.<br/><br/>Her husband was played with Bill Macy, as the wimpy and alcoholic Walter Findlay. Walter was the punching bag for Maude's hatred of men and Americans. Walter was symbolic of everything that was wrong with American men.<br/><br/>Conrad Bain played Maude's friend, Dr. Arthur Harmon. Bain was there to provide the intellectual perspective that agreed with Maude. He was the voice of liberal intellectuals who hated America too. Bain verified Maude's hatred of American society. He also seemed to be having an affair with Maude. On more than a few episodes, Walter accused Dr. Harmon and Maude of having an affair.<br/><br/>Rue McClanahan played Maude's friend, Vivian Cavender Harmon. Later on she would star on Golden Girls with Bea Arthur.<br/><br/>Adrienne Barbeau rounded out the cast as Maude's ultra-liberal, man-crushing daughter. She was the perfect Frankenstein Monster of women's lib. Created by Maude to hate American culture, and men. Barbeau managed to be even more angry at America than Maude. Whenever Barbeau was on the show hating on the USA, it was Maude that was the voice of reason, trying to talk her down.<br/><br/>This show is incredibly ridiculous to watch. It has not aged well.

687,Maude," LOUD spin-off from ""All in the Family""","Norman Lear is notorious for his liberal (so they called it ground-breaking) television series of the 70's in which he tampered with conservative censors' traditional television taboos. ""All in the Family"" was the first step, and despite the over-the-top stereotypes, it succeeded. The downside is the way the show outdated itself by being too topical, but on the other hand it stands as a time capsule. ""Maude"", a spinoff based upon AITF's recurring character, was a novelty at the time and chose to play the feminist card (however loosely), but at the end of the day, the only element that survived the translation between the two programs was the heavy dosage of loud shouting matches. Bea Arthur is a better actress than this show displays, since she is rarely given the opportunity to do much more than posturing and screaming ""Walter"" repeatedly. Many 70's programs are now waving the banner of 'retro' to gain some sort of badge of hip for the straplings that weren't there; this show should be returned to the vaults and only drudged up for retrospectives iconifying what made this era of entertainment the very worst that the century had to offer.",14 out of 29 found this helpful.,,21 October 1999

689,Maude, Controversy---Thou Name Was the 1970s.,"The controversy of ""All in the Family"" continued with this original spin-off. The titled character (Beatrice Arthur), Archie Bunker's (Carroll O'Connor) cousin, was everything that the aforementioned was not. She was a wildly independent feminist who was on her fourth marriage (with appliance store owner Bill Macy) and cut others with a dry wit that was quietly malicious, but admittedly hilarious at the same time. Adrienne Barbeau was a dominant fixture as Arthur's daughter and neighbors Rue McClanahan and Conrad Bain just added to the overall adequacy the show had. ""Maude"" was in constant scrutiny. One episode dealt with the freedom of choice issue (a woman's right to have an abortion) and that definitely remains the most fiery and politically-incorrect (especially for the time period) episode of the series' seven-year run from 1972 to 1978. Never did reach as high as ""All in the Family"", but was a legitimate envelope-pusher that still strikes a nerve in many conservative circles.

Bill Macy was the perfect husband for her, playing Walter to a T. Conrad Bain and Rue McClanahan were wonderful as well, playing the slightly nutty Harmon's, and watching their relationship develop was a testament as to how the writers could bring two characters believably together.  Rounding out the cast were Adrienne Barbeau, and the late Esther Rolle and Hermoine Baddeley.  <br/><br/>This show also tackled as many serious subjects as All in the Family.

693,Maude," RIGHT ON, MAUDE!","Maude is one of my favorite sitcoms off all time. Even though it's pretty dated stuff, it still is uproariously funny. I think the older comedies are funny because they mixed social content with humour better than today's sex-drenched drek.<br/><br/>I read somewhere that Maude Findlay was supposed to be Edith's sister in this spin-off. Although the two are as different as night and day, Maude does sound like Edith when she's irked. Beatrice Arthur plays Maude, a feminist who has been married 4 times and is looking to make her mark in the world. She lives with her 4th husband, Walter (Bill Macy), a man who can deal with her manic depression and mood swings, and her divorced daughter (played by the buxom Adrienne Barbeau) and her son. Also, there are the Harmons, played by Conrad Bain(Arthur) and Rue McClanahan(Vivian).<br/><br/>Maude was always funny because the cast worked brilliantly together, the script-writers had consultation from the great Bobs Weiskopf and Schiller(of I Love Lucy fame), and the shows of the 70's didn't have to worry about being PC, because at the time, people weren't so sensitive about their stereotypes then. It was truly zany, with too many great moments to mention; mine was when The Harmons were having trouble in their young marriage and were relying on sex games to liven it up. One night the Findlay's go out to visit the Harmons, and Vivian is naked, but wrapped up in Saran Wrap. She opened the door thinking it's Arthur, but when its Maude and Walter, she screams and slams the door, and The Findlay's are standing with their backs to the camera for 40 seconds. It was gut-bustingly funny, waiting for their take on what just happened. A true comedy hit of the past.<br/><br/>

695,Maude, Funny as heck but so loud.,"Many feel compelled to emphasize the topical themes addressed over its 6 yr run, but I view those just as the basis on which great Catskills type comedy was built. Fine by me. If I want the news I'll watch 60 minutes. People claim it was daring to feature controversial plots, but I bet others before would have done that if conditions had permitted. I can't pinpoint the style elements and humor that links I Love Lucy, Dick Van Dyke and other CBS comedies, but Maude also has it. When it's corny, it's sophisticated corn. When it almost gets too sappy and serious like a Facts of Life episode or a Golden Girls social justice episode (ugh the worst thing a comedy can do) someone cracks a joke to break the tension (Thank goodness) to remind us this is a sit-com not a grim play.
I love the show, but I wish the people in charge had toned down/reduced the ear=splitting yelling by the Findlays. It got old and is puzzling why it was allowed to endure.

696,Maude, And then there's Maude!,"I am only 15 years old and was not even thought of when Maude was on CBS but I love to watch this show on TV Land.  It is so funny!  I am a Bea Arthur fan and I like to watch The Golden Girls and Mama's Family too so I know Bea Arthur and Rue McClanahan from Golden Girls and Rue McClanahan from Mama's Family.  When I first tuned in to Maude, I was suprised because I saw Rue McClanahan and her mouth was moving and I heared a womans voice but through my TV Speakers, it didn't sound like her!  I eventually got used to her northeast axcent she was doing on Maude.  I was so used to a southern axcent from The Golden Girls and Mama's Family.  My favorite character on Maude (Other than Maude obviously) is Mrs. Naugatuck.  She is too funny!  I think we all recognized Hermione Baddley from Mary Poppins!  She seems to be always playing a maid but I really liked the episode when Mrs. Naugatuck first came, she and Maude were useing the word ""Oppinion"" alot when they weren't getting along at first.<br/><br/>Mrs. Naugatuck: ""You're very oppinionated!"" Maude: ""That's your oppinion.""<br/><br/>and so on!  We were filling out a survey at school on our favorite TV shows so I filled out a less obvious show for me and put Maude.  Some kid in the next desk looked over at my ballet and sayed ""Maude?  What's that?!""  My algebra teacher sayed ""Oh, that's some messed up TV show in TV land.  That actress is a witch!  I hated her on Maude and I especially hated her on The Golden Girls,"" he sayed.  ""Also, that show is a knock off to All in the family.""  What I was trying to say by that is, I am glad I found positive comments on Maude because not many people in my town like that show.  There is only one lady I know of that likes it, she is also a Golden Girls fan. I have alot of Golden Girls fans at my school but none for Maude.  Alot in my town say they like The Golden Girls but they don't like Dorothy.  I just don't understand.

In the case of White Gold we have double glazing salesman all pushing for that big end of month bonus.

It's an excellent rip-off of Michael Caine's 1966 'Alfie' device (and character... which Jude Law failed to pull off in 2004.)<br/><br/>The opening gag from the first episode sets the tone for the series... it's crude, tacky, rude... and very, very funny.

She's great fun as Vincent's sassy, foul-mouthed missus.<br/><br/>James Buckley and Joe Thomas team up again, and fill the screen with remarkable chemistry while they spar off each other effortlessly. Beesley should re-write 'The Odd Couple' for these two!<br/><br/>The musical inserts are spot on and a fantastic reminder of an unremarkable time in the UK where wide boys drank Stella from sleeve glasses and thick hair and thin ties were de rigueur!<br/><br/>I'd love to see the show renewed but I'm not sure it could be.

You certainly want to binge watch all the episodes at once, but perhaps not as much as ""Cuckoo"" or ""Fresh Meat"". <br/><br/>Despite this, I would not say it is as funny or accomplished as other British comedies with similar target audiences (""Cuckoo"", for example is much funnier in my opinion). The main problem with this new show is that we hardly feel any empathy for characters, Ed Westwick's character is quite unlikable and the only character we really feel sorry for is Sam Swan (Lindsey Cocker). We understand that the others are quite irritating and annoying figures, but that's about it!<br/><br/>The other reason I find that this show is not as funny as it could be is because its seems a bit restrained in terms of use of language and insults. The show was shown at 10pm, and words such as ""c**t"" are used throughout the series. Vulgarities are then certainly present, yet it feels as though Joe Thomas and James Buckley's insults are quite restrained. And those two characters' vulgar and overly-offensive insults were some of the most hilarious parts of ""The Inbetweeners"". <br/><br/>""White Gold"" is then certainly good, but did slightly disappoint after shows like ""The Inbetweeners"" where I felt that Thomas and Buckley were at their best.",26 out of 35 found this helpful.,8.0,27 May 2017
712,White Gold, Loved it !,"This TV series, which just premiered on Netflix, is basically a chance to see Ed Westwick play the part of Chuck Bass again. If you loved the arrogant asshole that Chuck Bass was in Gossip Girl, you'll definitely love Vincent Swan. The cast in this show is absolutely great. Ed Westwick, James Buckley and Joe Thomas are an incredibly funny trio that you will for sure grow fond of over the episodes. If you've ever worked or been in contact with sales, you'll definitely relate to the characters and the situations that they find themselves in. It is a great example of a smart comedy. What I think makes the series so funny and interesting is the fact that the main character, Vincent, talks a lot to the audience, becoming also some sort of narrator. The soundtrack is also great, featuring a lot of amazing songs from the 70's and 80's , such as Another One Bites the Dust, by Queen. However, something that I've wondered is : How will the writers continue the series without making it boring, since, well, a salesman's life can be interesting only to an extent. There's one thing that,to me, isn't much of a problem, but I can understand why some people have complained about it is that, even if you are a fluent English speaker, but don't understand very well people that speak with a heavy Essex accent, you'll definitely have trouble understanding everything they say, which means you'll have to pay a great deal of attention to what's being said.<br/><br/>Pros - Great acting - Funny, but not stupid - Great soundtrack<br/><br/>Cons - How will they continue the story ( not necessarily a con) - Heavy accent",12 out of 15 found this helpful.,8.0,26 August 2017

716,White Gold, Low Brow Brit Humor With A Nod And A Wink...And Some Great 80's Tunes,White Gold...it's a mash-up as I see it. A kind of combination of several shows It brings to mind some prime indignant ingredients of Jason Priestley's off-kilter Call Me Fitz series combined with a bit of Trailer Park Boys brain-dead haze. Ha! Maybe The Brits and The Cannucks are still conjoined somehow? This is nuts and the cast plays it to perfection. Then there's the huge nod and the wink. The Jude Law-ish cool cat who narrates and gives constant monologues to the the camera/viewer. His off-the-charts narrating drives the comedy into the sublime depraved idiot level. How these people dress themselves is a small wonder. They're clueless save for a penchant for keeping on day after day - somehow achieving more bad behavior. This is irreverent funny stuff as The Brits do so well.

722,White Gold, Season 2. Nowhere near as good as the first season.,"No spoilers, not many will have seen them all yet. All I can say is that after the spot on 80s setting, the brilliant soundtrack, and the beautiful comedy and drama mix of season 1, season 2 is a disappointment. After a strong start the episodes seem disjointed, contradictory, and rushed as the story reaches its climax. There's still some really good comedy in here, but it's almost as if they've concentrated on too many cast members at the expense of really following anything meaningful. I honestly think the creators rushed it and really just wanted to get us to the very different setting they've got planned for season 3.

If you suffer from issues of thinking you no longer have faith in humanity, or wonder why you should even try to be a better person when life is getting you down. This show, this amazing character that Gervais has brought to life will make you realize why it is all worth it.

So just be good.""<br/><br/>I suffer from several medically diagnosed mental illnesses, and this show treated the subject matter with respect, not becoming a blatant parody of the commonly thought stereotypes about mental illness, but becoming a rich three dimensional character who has a mental illness and how it affects his life and the lives of people around him.<br/><br/>It was not an uproarious comedy like I was expecting, but in the end, what it was, was everything I needed at the time, heartwarming and leaving me feeling a good mix of sad and happy.",74 out of 77 found this helpful.,10.0,19 September 2013

732,Derek, Groundbreaking,"Ricky Gervais is a comic genius the likes of which we haven't seen in decades. His comedy is somehow both universal yet specific, appealing to a worldwide audience yet never losing touch of his English heritage. But enough about that, this is about something more important.... Derek....<br/><br/>The Office was a brilliantly clever comedy, Extras was even better, Life's Too Short was criminally underrated and wasn't given a chance to find it's feet, An Idiot Abroad is a masterful use of a genuinely interesting and captivating idiot and then there's Derek....<br/><br/>Derek is a masterpiece. I have to qualms about stating that. In future years, maybe even five or ten years down the track, Derek will be the sitcom that all other sitcoms are compared to. The sitcom formula of a studio audience and general dumb jokes is already all but dead, and Derek is the nail in the coffin of such shows. In fact, it is the inevitable fresh step forward for sitcoms in general.<br/><br/>Derek lets go of the usual sitcom laughs and replaces them with real life giggles. Sometimes you're not even sure why you're smiling, then you realise it's because of the situation you're watching. Even worse, sometimes you don't even realise you're smiling.<br/><br/>But it's the emotion of Derek that sets it apart from other sitcoms. It's not lame, superficial, meaningless emotion either, it's real emotion, due in no small part to the brilliant supporting cast. In almost every episode I've watched so far I've gotten teary. And thats exactly where the future is for sitcoms. Real emotion. People are getting sick of cheap laughs and emotionless humor. The best comedy comes from tragedy, always has and always will. It's a shame it's taken TV 60 years to realise that. Derek, along with a select few other shows, may very well be the savior of the sitcom. Because if I the future of sitcoms is Two And A Half Men then I might as well kill myself now.",212 out of 238 found this helpful.,10.0,10 March 2013

I didn't laugh that much and I thought it was boring. However, watching it a second time, and watching the first 2 episodes, I think its fantastic. Like Gervais' masterpiece the Office, its something you have to watch more than once to ""get"", but once you do, its fantastic. The funny parts truly made me laugh out loud (very loud I may add) and its brilliant as a drama. The characters are funny, believable and likable. The character of Derek's disability is treated in a way that is funny, but still respectful. Karl Pilkington is hilarious (and especially brilliant at the end of the second episode). The episodes are very heartwarming, and each so far has given me a weird feeling of both happiness and sadness at the end.<br/><br/>Its not a blatant laugh out loud comedy like I and many may have expected, but so far its a fantastic comedy drama with a lot to say about whats really important in life: friendship (not trying to sound too soppy).<br/><br/>Definitely give it a chance, and you will be rewarded :)",107 out of 127 found this helpful.,8.0,12 February 2013
737,Derek, Staggeringly Good,"Firstly, I'm well aware that Ricky Gervais's humour is not at all for everyone, but please, if anyone let's this jewel of a program slip them by because of that reason it's a very great shame! Personally I was always a big fan of Ricky Gervais. I remember when The Office first came out and was thoroughly impressed by, not just the wit and humour, but the direction and three dimensionality of the characters. Extras continued to show just how brilliant he could be as creator of top notch comedy, but with Derek he's pushed the envelope several degrees further and in a strikingly different direction.<br/><br/>It's billed as a comedy but is a difficult program to classify. Some have called it a comedy drama but I'd have to say it's in a genre all of it's own, with more moments that force the viewer into deep reflection than any kind of laughter and few moments that I can honestly call ""drama"". Though certain films are able to pull at my heart strings enough to leave me with a runny nose and a very sore face under the eyes, this program is one of very few I've seen that's able to do so during most episodes. Perhaps ""bitter-sweet comedy"" is a better description.<br/><br/>What continuously strikes me most about it is how it draws attention, so vividly and on a weekly basis, to the terrible way we in the western world treat our aged. All of the acting is of an extremely high standard, particularly Gervais' Derek and the superb Kerry Godliman as manager Hannah, with Gervais' particular style of hands off direction (which worked so well in The Office) his actors play their roles in a sublimely naturalistic way. The tenderness with which each of the residents stories is handled is truly breath-taking, with small (what in other shows might be out of place) montages depicting to the audience memories of past youthful days, scattered throughout the series. The music used in the series is also worth a mention adding poignancy to many of the scenes.<br/><br/>I saw an interview with Ricky and Stephen Merchant and he was describing how, in contrast to the Office consisting of in a large part, deception, Derek consists of sincerity. I can't ever remember seeing a more sincere television program, and have seen few films with a similar level of sincerity.

747,Derek, A rare show about the value of kindness,"How refreshing it is to both find a show whose theme is the value of kindness and to see its creator take a chance by making an enormous departure from his previous works. ""Derek"" is not at all what I expected from the usually smarmy (albeit very funny) Gervais. This particular work was a revelation to me, no less so than Jim Carrey's performance in ""The Truman Show"" or Jerry Lewis' work in ""The King of Comedy"". The show ""Derek"" proves that Gervais can step away from type and deliver something wonderfully positive and life-affirming. The character Derek takes us by the hand- and heart- and reminds us of what we can be at our best, when we can shut out modern humankind's knee-jerk predilection to ridicule. Derek is a simple character who is not at all simplistic. More importantly, we see him develop. <br/><br/>That said, I was saddened (and, unfortunately, unsurprised) at the negativity of the message board posters concerning this show. I'd like to think that most people who would post such comments feel they have a grasp of what suspension of disbelief entails. It is a simple contract: we are asked to clear our minds of any history of the artist who has created a new work and see this new work on its own merits. The internet is too often sullied by posters who are more in love with their own ability and freedom to attack something worthwhile for the aggrandizement of their own egos. Due to the (all too rare) positive theme of the show, it is doubly troubling that it has been panned by those who are either unwilling to suspend their disbelief, or have no concept of what that means, or why serious viewers understand the requirement do so in the first place.

To me, it is more than worth watching; it should be required viewing for those of us who reject modern cynicism, especially cynicism for cynicism's sake. It must be noted that Ricky Gervais has made a career out of being a cynic, yet was unafraid to step away from type to give us this gift.<br/><br/>Thanks, Ricky. I, for one, never thought you would- or could- do it, especially so well. What a production, and what a performance.

748,Derek, Kindness Is Magic... And So Is DEREK!,"MY ""SPOILER"" ONLY SPOILS THE ENDING OF THE ORIGINAL PILOT EPISODE (not to be confused with the 1st episode of the 1st series), it doesn't appear until the end of the review and I give you ample warning :)<br/><br/>People keep commenting that ""Derek is NOT a comedy!"" I can assure you that Derek is indeed a comedy. It just happens to be a tad sad and a touch touching at times. Feel free to label it a ""Comedy/Drama"" or ""Dramedy"". If you find it depressing as opposed to uplifting, you have my every sympathy. I can only feel sorry for you.<br/><br/>DEREK is yet another modern masterpiece by THE Ricky Gervais aka ""The Arrogant Man-Child With An Annoying Laugh Who Bullies People"". If that's your opinion of Mr Gervais... YOU'RE WRONG! He should be perceived as ""The Hysterically Hilarious, Incredibly Intelligent, Painfully Poetic... Arrogant Man-Child With An Annoying Laugh... Who Brings Out The Best In People"". AND YOU CAN QUOTE ME!<br/><br/>If you decide that Derek is crap without watching the whole thing, that'd be like turning off Forrest Gump, Rain Man or Shine after 5 minutes because Hanks, Hoffman and Rush are merely mocking retards... or hating Matt Groening because characters like Grampa Simpson and Professor Farnsworth are merely mocking senile senior citizens. If you look at Derek and see nothing but David Brent acting like a Gumby whilst shuffling around a Nursing Home with his jaw sticking-out, you're missing the bigger picture. Derek is merely a lovable simpleton with a heart of gold. Nothing more, nothing less. Ricky cleverly resists the urge to ""Go Full Retard"".<br/><br/>Some may argue that the real scene-stealer is none other than ""The Little Roundy-Headed Manch Twonk"", better-known as An Idiot Abroad's Karl Pilkington, who portrays Dougie the Caretaker. Even though Karl's essentially playing a Suzanne-less version of himself who works in a Nursing Home and sports a Monty Burns hairstyle, his performance is nothing short of impeccable. In fact it's so good that he could give acting lessons to the likes of Hanks, Hoffman and Rush. This inevitably adds to the ""conspiracy"" that Karl is merely an actor and everything he has ever said is simply scripted by Gervais &amp; Merchant. Anyone who has avidly followed Karl's career up to this point will instantly dismiss this theory... and quite rightly so. Ricky is brilliant... but not quite brilliant enough to write the kind of crap that Karl dribbles daily.<br/><br/>Rounding out the main cast are relative newcomer's Kerry Godliman as Hannah, the increasingly lovable Nursing Home Manager, and David Earl as Kev, the increasingly creepy Autograph Hunter who gives the likes of Quagmire from Family Guy and Jay from The Inbetweeners a run for their money in the seediness stakes.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT! I very much doubt that a resident will die at the end of every single episode. The sheer brilliance of the pilot's heart-warming conclusion should be blatantly obvious. It's to hammer home the concept that Derek is NOT ""Retarded"" or ""Spastic"" or ""Scope"" or whatever the PC term is these days. He's not an ""Ass-Burgers"" sufferer or whatever you find yourself compelled to label him. He's just a tiny bit slow and a tiny bit simple. He MIGHT be ""Or Tistic""... but we'll PROBABLY never know. He's easily amused because he clearly doesn't get out much, hence his enthusiasm over something as simple as going to the pub. With his prominent under-bite, his bizarre bowl-cut (that his mother probably opted for) and his bland taste in clothes (that his mother probably picked out for him), the poor bugger never really stood a chance of being accepted by ""The In Crowd"". I imagine that he's probably spent most of his youth being bullied and now, as an adult, he's finally found sanctuary among the elderly. He also loves working in the Nursing Home because he loves Hannah, he loves Dougie, he loves Kev, he loves taking care of people and... more importantly... he loves to be needed. GOD I'M DEEP! :p<br/><br/>As Karl would say, ""BULL$H!T! You're talking BULL$H!T!""<br/><br/>If you've never seen the original pilot episode of DEREK that I referred to, simply search YouTube for ""Derek Full Pilot"" and click on the one uploaded by ""NozinAroun2"". You MIGHT also LIKE the Facebook Page ""David Earl aka ""Kev from Ricky Gervais' Derek"". In closing, I'd like to apologise to anyone who was offended by my use of pop culture references such as ""Go Full-Retard"" and/or ""Ass-Burgers"" ;)",27 out of 40 found this helpful.,9.0,1 February 2013
749,Derek," Funny, sad and Brilliant!!!!","Derek is about a man played by Ricky gervais who works in a nursing home along with Hannah and Dougie and he has a best mate called Kev who is so so funny, you will roll on the floor laughing!!:) When you see it don't think Gervais is playing a handicapped person because he isn't in my eyes or Gervais' eyes, think that he is playing a person who is too kind for his own good.<br/><br/>When I rate shows and films on IMDb I rate them on what I think they should be rated, so thats why I have given Derek a 9 and not a 10. This show is hilarious, extremely sad in some parts like S1 ep6 and S2 ep5, if you do not cry or get emotional in these episodes you are not right in the head sorry to say!!;) I would recommend this to anyone who is a Ricky Gervais fan, I am getting into The Office but Derek I have to say is much better at the moment, but my mum said that the office is very slow and it takes time for you to get into the characters.<br/><br/>Derek=9/10 from me!!!!",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,9.0,2 September 2014
750,Derek," Wonderful, charming, smart, and poignant","I don't know much about Ricky Gervais, never watched The Office (American or UK), nor have intentionally sought out his other projects, but Derek is an absolute breath of fresh air. It's quiet, witty, and very clever, and it's a rarity in that it's core plot is the kind acts of kind people—clearly an amazingly unpopular theme in the present day.<br/><br/>The humor is smart and sweet (the episode when Derek is so proud to show us ""Baby Monkey on a Pig""—hilarious), and the show's social commentary is also spot on. In the episode when the young, self-described ""gangster"" arrives at the home to begin his community service, his revelation at the end about these whittled, tossed-away veterans who are some of the only true, great, respectable men of their time, and how embarrassing and misguided his fellow self-proclaimed ""gangsters"" are for thinking they represent anything serious—that scene is just, well, it makes you stand up and say ""THANK YOU"" out loud. <br/><br/>If you want stimulus TV, watch just about any other show but this one. If you want a thoughtful, well-written, well-acted, poignant series that is brave enough to simply be about kindness, then, enjoy.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,4 February 2014

I was laughing at one minute and soul searching the next; the contrast so great that I was left asking myself what had happened.<br/><br/>At times you'll love, you'll hate, and you'll shake your head, but if you enjoy a smart drama that combines humour with mortality then you'll enjoy this series.<br/><br/>You will need to watch more than five minutes to get invested with the characters.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,28 January 2014
752,Derek, Absolutely wonderful,"Derek may not be what others suspected, myself included, and frankly it wasn't quite funny in my opinion. But I believe that Derek was incredibly well crafted and really got you to connect with the cast.<br/><br/>I think that there is so much negativity surrounding the show because people watched with the wrong state of mind. I'd assume that as soon as they were disappointed by lack of comedy they lost all hope and didn't really try to connect with it going onwards. It definitely has funny moments but it was more closely related to the drama aspect. When watching Derek you have to think of the nursing home as a real place, and the cast as actual people, not characters. If you try to connect with the work that Gervais has created and not compare it to his previous work, you'll be presently surprised. <br/><br/>Derek's script focused not on an intensely funny plot but character development; it's a learning experience for not only those who work at nursing home but for the viewers as well.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,10 November 2013
753,Derek, If you have ever worked in or wondered about assisted living then watch this!,"This show is brilliant. There is no other word. I've worked in assisted living and it is one of the most heart wrenching and rewarding careers that I have ever had. I've learned so many lessons there and being responsible for the energy you bring in the room is one of them. This show, hands down, is an eye into the world of assisted living. <br/><br/>Ricky Gervais is absolutely amazing in this as well as the entire cast! It gives you typical Gervais British humor but with absolute loving kindness. It is a true look at how hard it is to lose people you grow very attached to and how wonderful old people really are. They need love and attention at every corner. It also is a sad but true look at how the families can treat their parents and loved ones.<br/><br/>My greatest memories from working with the elderly are from their life stories. They love to share their lot in life and it wasn't always a lot but it was their life. They deserve great respect for the life that they led. This show touches that and the many ways you can simply connect with someone by just a touch of their hand. <br/><br/>I am so thankful someone finally is giving a look at how incredible this job can be and how selfless the people that work in these homes can be. They get a bad wrap from the few bad people but for the most part it is a rewarding job. Ricky has brilliantly brought this world to light and anyone who doesn't see that hasn't spent enough time with the elderly. <br/><br/>Amazing cast, dirty and ridiculous humor, but best of all? Well written insight!! Must see show!",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,30 September 2013
754,Derek, Ricky Gervais is arguably the most brilliant comedy mind working today in the world,"I fell in love with Ricky Gervais during the first three minutes of ""The Office"" when I first was exposed to his comedic genius in 2003. Some people get him and others don't---I am glad I do. His writing ability takes the viewer from laughing beyond the ability to breath until you sobbing so hard you cannot see the television screen. Very few writers have this ability. His comedy is NOT for everyone. I have attempted to acquaint both ""The Office"" and ""Derek"" to some friends and family members who never did get the humor. Well, that is the nature of humor...one size does NOT fit all. Often a second viewing is required for Yankee viewers to catch all of the subtle lines often spoken under the actor's breath or so quickly they escape the lazy viewer's attention. But rewind and absorb EVERYTHING. Sometimes the biggest laughs come from the simplest lines. The Cabaret night performance had me laughing until I thought I was going to faint. And the final scene in episode seven rivals the final scene of ""The Office--The Special (Christmas episode)"" I am glad I'm living at a time when Ricky Gervais is working and providing entertainment. He is a rare treasure beyond compare.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,29 September 2013

There were times I couldn't breathe for laughing and there hasn't been a comedy that has made me like this for a very long time.

756,Motherland, Genuinely funny comedy.,"Came across this rather by accident when flicking through the television for something to watch, and gave it a chance.<br/><br/>Motherland was far more funny than the vast majority of shows around at the moment. Far better than the toilet humour of many panel shows and the repetitive and predictable gags of sitcoms like Big Bang Theory and devoid of the cringe inducing snippets of canned laughter which nowadays run alongside weak comedies to make viewers think it is funny. <br/><br/>Motherland knew what sort of show it wanted to be and the story it wanted to tell, and didn't deviate throughout the pilot episode. The episode was full of humour throughout and enough drama to keep the story going and feeling fresh, and didn't have to rely on the old humour fallback of ""child says something funny"" clichéd trope, popularised by things such as Kids Say the Darndest Things and use effectively in Outnumbered, but the world does not need another Outnumbered.<br/><br/>Motherland was a raw, entertaining and an ultimately funny TV show, which I am looking forward to watching more of.

Every character is incredibly funny and well written, and the accents just make it all better (I'm not from the UK, so I'm biased though).
Although there is a storyline, each episode tells a different story, so it's even more entertaing and it never gets boring.

Liz is sarky single mom who's had a hard life, and Kevin is a cringing, lovable, pushover, which emphasise the reality of school mom's. all the side characters are equally fleshed out and have there own awful personalities, but you understand where they come from, the sarcy backhanded comments remind you of my own experience as a child.",10 out of 15 found this helpful.,10.0,17 November 2017

Anyone who has ever had children will relate to this and will have experienced the characters involved, obviously caricatured and comedicly enhanced for the show.

But most of those at the moment follow pretty depressing themes and there's only so many you can take before you need some light relief. So I kept flicking through and trying to find a decent comedy I hadn't seen yet. None were really engaging me until I begrudgingly gave Motherland a try. I laughed out loud - alot- at the honest, good old British humour. Classic and fresh at the same time. I'm 45 now but it still rings true of life when I was a young mother, many moons ago. I'm currently sitting up at three in the morning, trying to stave off sleep, watching series one, episode five, as I've become addicted to it.

They're all infinitely slappable and I have no sympathy for any of them since they can't actually stand up for themselves in any way at all. How Linehan got involved in this fiasco is beyond me since he's one of the greatest comic writers of our generation. Maybe his wife henpecked him into attaching his name to it. The laughs are few and far between, and filling the gaps is some sort of what's meant to be observational humour but it falls flat when you're watching supposedly intelligent people do stupid things.

There is nothing remotely funny in a woman having a meltdown driving her car full - pelt along narrow suburban streets whilst her children play unconcernedly in the back, and behaving frantically in front of the Head Teacher. This is desperate stuff,and to be fair,some older members of the cast seem somewhat aghast at what they are being asked to do,but others plough on regardless,hoping this will soon be forgotten and just glad the cheques cleared. Don't get me wrong,middle - class mums are fair game - but ""Motherland"" is too smug by half and whilst ostensibly mocking the pretensions of The School Run it is actually reinforcing them.

The first series is great, funny, well written, fairly realistic and enjoyable, the second was garbage, all the bits people enjoyed in series 1 dialled up to eleven to kill realism and make it a chore to get through. If it wasn't for Liz I think I'd have switched off, comedies rely on characters being likeable and whilst liz, Anne and a few others are Julia and Amanda absolutely ruin series two, they're both selfish nasty users that are genuinely not good people, I assume we're supposed to root for the three outcasts but especially after using the guy in the coffee shop, liz, Kevin, vile to her mom, somehow trying to play the victim when she just makes idiotic choices. She's so horrid in series two it's unreal, I went from liking her to hating her after three episodes. Honestly can't state how bad this series is written, I get the premise, but her attitude and treatment of others is inexcusable and just bad, whilst Amanda is played by the god awful actress whose ruined many a rom com I've seen her in, it's unrealistic that no one would call her up on it and take the ridiculousness of her actions, the ignorance, selfishness and acting is just awful to watch.<br/><br/>I'll see out series two, it's genuinely unfunny, for example a dad, obviously with gay undertones working in a child environment and speaking a sentence he verbalises perfectly later to liz but at work uses words to obviously imply he's a kiddie fidler is just idiotic lazy writing.<br/><br/>The humour went from effortlessly natural to ridiculous cheap and embarrassing",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,5.0,19 January 2021

784,Free Rein, implausible teen horse drama,"The actors do their best with some silly dialogue, and kids will have no problem following the simplified plot lines. I do realize this show is aimed at pre-teens and horse lovers, but it can be added to the list of horsey shows clearly written by people with zero knowledge of horses . How about doing a little research? Then maybe we wouldn't see dumb scenes like Zoe stepping into Raven's stall, where he's standing already bridled, with reins hanging. Or constantly showing the horse in his big box stall, tied in the corner on a short rope. Or hear lines like ""Bob loooovves buttercups!"" (Buttercups are toxic to horses, in fact). And can you believe it--Zoe gets picked for the horse show team after only two riding lessons! On the plus side, the horses look well kept, tack is appropriate and kids all wear helmets. The stable and the surrounding scenery is lovely.The show seems to be gathering a following, so maybe in season 2 they will try a bit harder to get some advice and guidance from people who know horses.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,5.0,4 July 2017

B) LISTEN to that consultant and c) do some research?!<br/><br/>The target audience for shows like this, are pony mad kids. I know, I was one of those. But, folks, can we PLEASE have some common sense? I mean, general, safety common sense? Realism? Anything?<br/><br/>*spoiler warning*<br/><br/>In our first episode, it's obvious this is a bit of a comedy/tongue and cheek. OK, that's fine, but we have teens acting out of character for today's day and age, even for an England setting. OK, I'll over look that.<br/><br/>But it's a known fact that any horse person riding on a rural road, will NOT run over people who are walking on it. C'mon Hollywood, let's get real. Let's stop typifying characters that blatantly. Next, and the biggest error is said missing horse.<br/><br/>Folks, horses get loose. We don't panic unless they are worth about a million dollars. OK, if they are worth over 10K, we get a bit worried, but it's a known fact that horses do NOT go far from home. And let me tell you, a horse would NOT be going to the beach. Seriously? Woods, yes--grass and shelter, but not in an area that is totally unnatural to them. And if said horse is 'that dangerous', trust me, he would be in a stall where it was double bolted.(triple, quadruple--trust me, we have some escape artists at every barn I work at).<br/><br/>That's just the first 10 mins of episode 1. So, if this is how it starts...ugh...but, like I said, I am an equestrian, and the sad thing is, the real goings on at a farm are interesting, if you just talk to someone who works at a farm. Go to a farm. Study a farm. Talk to horse people. This looks like someone's researched every bad horse film on the planet, and decided to do them proud and make a worse one. And by worse, I mean completely unrealistic horse situations.<br/><br/>If you have horse mad children, I highly recommend International Velvet--that's a PG-13 rated film. Sylvester (that may be more for old kids given a few situations in that), The Man From Snowy River, Phar Lap, Black Beauty, The Black Stallion. Those films, while they do stretch believability (phar lap is a true story), they are still better made.",12 out of 16 found this helpful.,5.0,5 August 2017

790,Free Rein, Annoying and Unreal,"I don't understand why this show get 7.7 rating. I mean really?<br/><br/>The story is about a girl from the US who visit her grandpa in the UK because her mom is having problems with her dad and finds out that she has a gift in riding horse.<br/><br/>This could easily be a good show but somehow the writers made this into a show about one annoying, cocky, selfish girl who think she can do anything to anyone.<br/><br/>There are loads of plot hole. The story's main location is a stable run by Sam, the daughter of the former owner. And this stable have only 1 adult staff. Really? What? I'm not surprised at all that this stable is in a serious deep hit and Sam ended up having to smuggle one of the best horse they have.<br/><br/>But the most deadly flaw in this show is the main character 'Zoe'. Yes the girl with the gift about horses. She appears out of nowhere to stop Raven, the horse with mysterious past which nobody can tame him down. But yeah, the girl has a gift. And once she knew she has a gift, she started to be bossy to anyone around the stable. She doesn't listen, she talks back, she ignores every basic things. I'm not a horse person but I know that no matter how talented you are at something, you still have to get the fundamental right. It took Zoe more than half of the 1st season to realise that. Yes, she is that cocky. And she a B. Real B.<br/><br/>She yelled to one guy (in the rain, yeah very dramatic) that she likes him and nothing can change that. And one day later she goes and tells him that last night was crazy, that we are not ourselves. Really girl?<br/><br/>I don't know why the writers are so messed up or their real objective is to get the viewers hate her. I mean, I've never rooted for her at all. Not even once in the entire season 1. If I was not forced to watch this show because of my work, I would have stop it before the end of ep1 and report to Netflix that they should take this show off. I really can't stand her. Her script is awful and the actress who play the role add more fuel on the fire because her acting is very annoying. I mean the script alone can make Zoe such a bad person but the actress put in more effort to make Zoe even more unbearable.<br/><br/>Zoe could easily be a bad ass character who comes and saves the day for Brightfield Stable but she just became a girl that I want to give her a slap or two. Why did she think that she can do everything. She wanted to catch a thieves, just jump on their backs. I wanted her to break her neck so much when she fell.<br/><br/>Not only Zoe that is annoying. Her little sister, Rosie is somehow act older than her own age. I know it's for the entertainment angle but it's too much.<br/><br/>At first I thought Becky is a real nice girl but she became too obsessed with the Pony Ghost until at one point I just wanted to pull her head out of the screen and shout to her face to stop. It was too much although her obsession led to the discovery of the thief but it's out of control and unreal.<br/><br/>And why the children have to find the thieves on their own. Why didn't they told Sam? (they didn't know that Sam is involved with the thieves yet) Why did they act like there's no adult on the island? And why everyone listen to Zoe when they're trying to find Raven like Zoe is the one who know every square inch of the island. Even the older boys like Marcus and Pin listen to her. I mean what is that? Why did you guys let the girl who's only been there took charge of the search.<br/><br/>A nice try on a easily could have been good story but ruined by childish script and characters. Too much effort to put drama into it. Not lovable main character (for me though). Only the script have made Zoe loathsome enough, the actress didn't need to act much about it but she added more and it made her character unpleasant.",9 out of 12 found this helpful.,1.0,18 August 2017
791,Free Rein," Look, it's okay. Don't get your hopes up too much.","Look, this show isn't perfect. It's actually far from perfect. Main character Zoe is moderately unlikable - she is self-absorbed, obnoxious and unwilling to listen to experts and their riding advice, constantly falling back on the ""I'm a natural rider"" excuse to do whatever she wants. Make sure kids are aware that it takes years of riding to get to the level she was at if this show inspires your kids to start riding. 
However, all other characters are decent and interesting, both the main secondary characters like Mia, Marcus and Pin and the lesser used characters like Susie. If the writers put effort into Zoe like they did with everybody else, this would be a great show. The plot is also a strong point. The twist in the first season does originally feel like it comes out of nowhere, but was actually very clever in that there are little subtle hints to who the horse thief was.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,6.0,11 July 2018
792,Free Rein, Who comes with ideas for movies like this?,"Usually I do not waste my time writing reviews for brainless stories like this, but this particular one was so bad, I HAD to do it. <br/><br/>Typically American movie. Girl with no particular talent, no training and no knowledge about horses becomes a skillful rider just like that. She is so good at it that trainers and people who actually have knowledge about horses, are just idiots who can't teach her anything. She gains over night skills which real riders accumulate over decades of training. She's so outstanding and mesmerizing that all the boys fold at her feet. Of course we have to have one of the usual cliches: the love triangle. I love you, I do not love you, I love the other boy more. Of course, the ""right"" boy remains by her side, while the other one, not very heartbroken apparently ... quickly reorientates himself. And have I mentioned the perfect hair dues and garderobe? <br/><br/>She has, of course, a younger sister, a spoiled brat (with a heart of gold, of course!) who roams around unsupervised for hours and hours and without any concern whatsoever from her mother. And who (who would have guest that?) becomes the hero of the day by finding out who is the rich man who could save the stables from ruin. As a result of a ... treasure hunt.<br/><br/>And then comes the story with the smugglers and the duke. Who appears, surprise, surprise, exactly in the moment of need. After finding a neckless 100 years old in a box in a hole in a wall, which looks like it has just been bought from a jewlery shop. <br/><br/>Did I mention the ""staff"" of the stables made only of ... children who seem to be rather dressed like going to a party than for work? Stables are not this pristine places where everything is clean and spotless and the amount of work there is huge, a child will not cope so easily. Did I forgot to mention the miraculous complete recovery of the pony Bob due to an equally miraculous remedy administrated by a child who happens to have extended veterinary knowledge? While a experienced vet (6 years of university, people , school not of the easiest kind!) gets to the point of actually euthanizing the horse and who accepts without an ounce of doubt to administrate an untested and unknown remedy :/<br/><br/>Ah, and last, but not least, no one seems to have anything to do with school or real work (of the ""earning a living"" kind). Exactly like some of the CW series where each episode is about a party of a sort in a sleepy town usually south where everybody seems to sleep on pile of bucks, siping cocktails and cavorting around. <br/><br/>When did the movies for children become so stupid and stereotypical? Everybody becomes successful over the night, there is no fail, no struggle, no serious mistakes, no loss. What had happen to stories like ""The Road to Avonlea"" for example, which actually were entertaining and very proper for kids of different ages without too much effort? When did the standards go so low that atrocities like this series become popular enough to justify a renewal? Do people have so little so low standards they accept anything crappy just because it is ... overly optimistic and shinny?<br/><br/>The only good thing where the animals. Stunning horses.

And wtf is up with her sister, guys? This girl's like 8 and she leaves her house without letting anyone know, the spoiled little wench. Of course, while Zoe ""attempts"" to search for her, she gets sidetracked by this pissy horse and it becomes Zoe the Raven Horse Whisperer. The disappearing sister is shuffled aside like nothing and is quickly resolved in the end. Why had she left the house? Oh, because the poor little thing didn't have WIFI and couldn't connect to her internet. I would have struck her sideways in the head and smashed that bloody device if she were my kid.

796,Free Rein, Good for all ages,"Netflix recommended this series to me because I watch Heartland.

Currently I'm 28, and I used to watch The Saddle Club when it aired back in 2001 when I was 11. I think it appeals to a slightly more mature audience than TSC, and the child actors are better in comparison. Being an equestrian myself, I can't help but roll my eyes at the idea of a teenage girl with zero prior riding experience suddenly becoming the stable's best rider in a matter of months, but it's still all around a great series.

799,Free Rein, No one has any horse sense here,"Cute show, but as other have pointed out, the producers should have talked to actual horse people, because no one on this show, especially the so called ""professionals"" know squat about training one.<br/><br/>I can buy that the ""wild"" horse could bond with the inexperienced main character, Zoe -- any horse would sense right off that she wants nothing from them so they'd be intrigued and even feel safer with such a person, especially if they've been abused. Or even that she is a natural rider, without having had any official training or actual experience. Achieving more in a couple of weeks than others might do in years, I was one myself. BTW... it's highly unlikely that Raven is a stallion - don't need to be one to not trust humans - or act wild. lol. The horse would have to have quite a pedigree in order to not have been ""cut"" already and looking at how this horse moves, he's got too many conformation drawbacks that you wouldn't want to perpetuate through breeding.<br/><br/>I love the cross section of horses shown (especially, Bob and his awesome leg feathers). It is quite indicative of the location and beautiful to obverse. The location itself is also lovely. But for starters, no one who knows anything about training horses would try to lunge an inexperienced or scared one in a big open space, especially one as unpredictable as Raven; where a) the horse is more easily distracted; and b) there's so much space for it to ""run out"" in and avoid learning anything at all. Along the same lines, you wouldn't try to saddle one for the first time by choice in a big open paddock. In fact, they should have been rubbing this horse down with towels, blankets, saddle pads, etc in a confined space from the beginning to get it used to the tack and being just touched and handled, not just suddenly throwing it at the poor guy a year later out of the blue. And the list goes on... a lot of basic stuff that a truly professional trainer, or even just experienced horse people would know about. In general, other that the horse is black and pretty (which by themselves does not get you very far in a competition), the writers give no clue as to why the owners even want to keep this particular horse in spite of all of it's problems. It's never been fully trained for riding, so they haven't a clue as to it's potential, and the girl who owns him is hardly the sentimental type. Even his behaviour isn't consistent. Horses that are freaked around people are freaked pretty much all of the time when around people -- or loud, busy surroundings -- not selectively as this one is -- well unless they've been encouraged to be drama kings by people around them who are inconsistent and/or don't know what they're doing.<br/><br/>If you love horses, have kids who love horses, and want to learn how to actually handle them, gain their trust, do yourselves a favour and watch a show like Heartland instead. It too is family oriented, well written, charming, beautifully filmed, funny, sad, not predictable, thinks outside of the box, the age group starts out about the same as this show -- and the writers have actually done their research where the horses themselves are concerned. Stick with Free Rein for the cute teen story line, but overall don't do what they do with the horses. You'll either get badly hurt, or badly hurt the horse, psychologically, if not physically. They pretty much only learn bad behaviour if we teach it to them, or don't teach them properly to begin with.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,6.0,5 June 2018

Since when did a new born foal stand tall at one point it was looking out of the stable door, and when mother wasnt there was happily eating hay and drinking milk. A foal usually isnt even weaned until the are about 3 weeks old.<br/><br/>When it was being walked through the yard i could swear I heard its shoes metal on concrete, I mean really. It looked more like a yearling to me.<br/><br/>The wild mother well I am convinced at the end it changed as at one point it was featherless around the feet and quite a slim horse and tall, but at the end it looked more like a fresian with feathered feet.<br/><br/>There were other things I wonder who their equestrian expert is.<br/><br/>Still I watched it. It was ok but hey I am a grandmother 68 so perhaps being a bit picky as we have horses.<br/><br/>I like the fact actually that its clean no swearing but the usual bit of drama and bullying just like you do get in the real world.

I wish there was a word where I can describe Ice Bear, I like him though so yeah.<br/><br/>So far this show is pretty cute, funny and wonderful in my eyes. I think my favorite episode so far is either ""Food Truck"" or ""Chloe"", but I think Chloe is the one I'd like to watch over and over again. Also Chloe maybe one of the first child genius characters that is actually in college, thats really just wow to me. She's also pretty sweet. <br/><br/>Anyways, We Bare Bears maybe one of my new favorite shows on Cartoon Network right now, It's just so great and wonderful.To the whole plot and the music in the show It really is destined to be great. I advise you to watch it.",34 out of 40 found this helpful.,10.0,1 August 2015
811,We Bare Bears, It's Pretty Good,"A while back I made a review on this show and was overly enthusiastic, giving it a 10/10. It was kind of embarrassing so I'm going back to review it again. OK, so We Bare Bears is a show that aired last year on Cartoon Network. It's still going with a positive reception. The show is about three bears: Griz (a grizzly bear), Panda (a well Panda), and Ice Bear (a Polar Bear). They live in the sunny city of San Francisco as they try to fit in with society. The show's central theme is pretty relatable. We humans try to fit in with other humans and three bears trying to awkwardly fit in with them is pretty funny. When they're not trying to fit in, they're doing other weird things like getting tote bags or starting a food truck. It's basically a slice of life anime except it's not in Japan and the characters aren't school girls. I like this show a lot. The characters are pretty funny and relatable. My favorite bear has to be Panda. He's basically the bear equivalent to every otaku in the world and it's hilarious. He's probably the most awkward out of the bunch and I can't help but laugh with him. Oh yeah, the show has a unique premise I really like. It uses a lot of modern day references like smartphones and laptops, except when they mention them they feel, get ready for this, SUBTLE. They very clearly have a use for them and they don't shove them into the audiences' faces to act cool or modern unlike other cartoons. The art style and animation is also nice. It's cute and tame but maybe a bit too tame. I don't know, it looks too friendly at times but I guess that's only a nitpick. I also don't really like how some people in the show just act like jerks around the bears. Don't get me wrong, there are some nice people but I felt like at times some of society would act a bit too mean. So yeah, that's my thoughts on the show. It's one of the best shows on Cartoon Network and I'm glad it's in its family.",39 out of 48 found this helpful.,8.0,2 August 2015
812,We Bare Bears, Another struck of gold for Cartoonnetwork,"Nowadays Cartoonnetwork has been revolutionizing cartoons of this era with shows like Adventure Time, Regular Show, The Amazing world of gum ball, Steven Universe, Over the garden wall, Clarence and now this wonderful addition to the CN family. This show is simply amazing.It's hilarious and quirky.This show features three bears namely grizzly,panda and ice bear. They each have their own unique personality that makes them different and more genuine.The animation is so soothing and calm for my eyes.Like The Amazing World of Gum ball (another great show from CN) it's like candy for my eyes.This show has likable characters, great humor,unique plots,beautiful animation and art style,and great voice actors. I can't wait for this show to be as popular as Adventure Time.I hope CN continues to make great shows so that cartoons don't die out and they can last for future generations.This show deserves a 10/10.",26 out of 32 found this helpful.,10.0,5 August 2015
813,We Bare Bears, A phenomenal show with a great amount of potential.,"Firstly, I would like to say that Cartoon Network is one of the best programs right now when it comes to children's entertainment. We Bare Bears, Steven Universe, and Over the Garden Wall (even if it is a mini-series) are prime examples of what this channel is capable of doing.<br/><br/>Regarding this particular show, this is probably the funniest cartoon show I've seen in a long while. And I mean LONG while. It revolves around three anthropomorphic bears who try to blend in with human society. <br/><br/>We have Grizz, the leader of the trio and the oldest, who is a loud and enthusiastic character who has a lot of heart. What I like about him is that he shows pure and genuine care for his friends, on top of his humorous love for everything. Sure, he is comical most of the time, but his character shines brightest when he asks questions in worry and concern (""Are they bullying you?"" and ""Are we in the way of you making friends?"" are some examples of his sincere kindness, where he isn't loudly speaking).<br/><br/>Next we have Panda, who is the middle-sibling. Panda is very shy and to himself, and is in most cases the voice-of-reason. He often spends his time on his phone, for he is obsessed with social media. Panda is also very, very silly. He is the most childish out of the group, and is treated like the youngest a good portion of the time. He is the sweet one, and his innocent and shy nature toward things make him the most adorable. Plus, a lot of people can relate to his love of manga and online-dating. He is a surprisingly realistic character.<br/><br/>Finally we have Ice Bear, the youngest. Ice Bear is the odd one out of the bunch, speaking in a monotone voice, and exclusively in third person. Now, when it comes to shows like this, there is always the odd one. Most of the time, cartoon shows make this character outright random, or stupid. But with Ice Bear, as far as these characters go, got it out of the park. Ice Bear is silent, sure, but he is also very caring with his friends, much like Grizz. Also, while he doesn't show that much emotion in his words, he does feel emotions. There are scenes where he is downright angry, and scenes where he has a giant smile on his face. He isn't a weird funny statue. There is room for a lot of character development in him, as well as the two others. <br/><br/>What this show does right is combining humor and emotion into one. What's great about We Bare Bears is that it will never try and make you laugh, it just does it. The humor flows so smoothly, and it is clean of any bathroom-humor and jokes about bodily secretion. A lot of shows nowadays tend to think passing gas and obnoxiously stupid characters are funny, which is only correct if you're talking about toddlers. This show has none of that; it makes you laugh without it being in-your-face, and it has my utmost respect for that. The show can also be emotional, one episode making me verbally gasp as one character hit another. A particularly sad episode was ""Burrito"" which had a very emotional ending (which will not be spoiled here).<br/><br/>Finally, the animation. THEY. DID. EVERYTHING. RIGHT! The humans in this show aren't cookie-cutter designs, even if they are in the background. We see curvy women, people with freckles, foreigners and even women who wear Hijabs! Even the sub-character, Chloe, is Korean. I haven't seen a show this broad in characters in a while (besides Steven Universe, which also hit a home run with this).<br/><br/>To sum this review up, watch this show. Only 12 episodes are out so far, but they are great. Arguably the most polished show I've seen on Cartoon Network.",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,12 September 2015

817,We Bare Bears, Cartoon network new hit,"This has got to be one of the best modern cartoons for Cartoon network. This show is based on a web comic strip the shows creator posted a while back and unlike other cartoons based on something from the web (via breadwinners, annoying orange and to a lesser degree Fred the show)it's not total garbage. This show has a much slower pace compared to most other cartoons on now which is a plus because even if a show like adventure time and Regular show can be fast pace its nice to have a show with a down to earth atmosphere. But that doesn't mean the show can't have thrilling or adventurous moments, in a regular show like fashion the plot will start with a simple predicament and lead up to thrilling crisis that our bear friends will have to pull through although unlike regular show the crisis at the end is not due to some last minute supernatural force to add extra action and zaniness the crisis in we bare bears is more realistic. The Main trio consist of Griz the leader who is a big lovable loaf who is quick to get into the latest trend to become popular, this may sound petty but it's in good taste because the bares themselves feel and sometimes treated as outcast and he wants to be popular so he and his brothers can be accepted in the human world and he dose have standers to keep by so he doesn't get too sucked into whatever his weekly obsession, Panda who is an anime nerd which is pretty funny considering he comes from a eastern continent and he's the shy, sensitive, calm one who enjoys long walks on the beach...oh wait...But in all seriousness that's one of the running jokes, Panda trying to get a girlfriend, he's not exactly the smart one but he knows the most about teach witch modern media plays a big role in this show pretty well and panda is the go to guy for internet stuff for the trio. Ice bear is the quiet, mysterious one who is also a ninja and master cook. He's quiet but he has some of the best moments both funny and epic. The modern media is pretty unique to this show and as stated before it fits in pretty well though there are a more plots around it than without (at least for now) it the show knows when to take a break from the media. The show has so great animation too it reminds me of a storybook like style, it's simple but it's charming an it fits the shows setting. The show is a comedy and it's pretty rare to find a comedic cartoon know a days that doesn't involve fighting evil one way or another, and that can make room for morals like not having the media interfere with your personal like or keep quiet at the movies or too much of a good thing is bad. I highly recommend this show for anyone really.Especially for kids who should be watching this instead of Teen titans go!",15 out of 19 found this helpful.,8.0,13 November 2015
818,We Bare Bears, cartoon network is just getting better and better,"In this show, we follow three bears. Grizz, panda, and ice bear. They really are just trying to fit in. Some of the episodes can be dull , like when they're going on the computer, trying to be Internet famous, but some episodes have heart in them, like Cleo. What you may notice is that all 3 of the main characters are NOT unlikable assholes. They feel remorse and apologize for all their destruction they caused. They're lovable characters, even when the story gets random.And its actually funny! Cartoon network really is improving with their shows. You could say this is a make up for teen titans go.

I quote him in daily life now, like ""Ice Bear respects your attempt to avoid social situations "", I've gotten many adult friends to watch the show just from me quoting Ice Bear..

821,We Bare Bears, Very Entertaining Cartoon,"I would originally have given this a 9, but I feel the later episodes in season 2 went downhill a bit. Nevertheless, We Bare Bears is a cleverly written, content and intelligent cartoon. I thought season 1 was great, and early season 2 was superb. When I first saw this show, I thought it would be a pandering snorefest trying to relate to younger viewers with social media. However, instead, the show cleverly mocks social media for its addiction, and never over-uses it in its episodes. Instead this show offers a bit of commentary on discrimination and, as I previously mentioned, mocks the addictive-ability of social-media. The three main characters are very likable, and express a creative commentary relating to the feeling of living in (or in the bear's case: near) a large city. I, however, absolutely cannot stand most of the 'baby bears' episodes. They take away all of the interesting commentary, and instead, you're just supposed to blurt out ""Awwwwwww, they're sooooo cute!"" But besides these episodes, We Bare Bears is a wonderful, relaxing and very relatable cartoon. I would recommend it to anyone. Do, however, stay away from the baby bears episodes and 'Bear Flu.'",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,18 October 2016
822,We Bare Bears, Promising... I hope.,"I watched We Bare Bears Premiere yesterday and I kinda had mixed feelings about this show<br/><br/>It starts really well with the episode ""Our Stuff"", where we get to know the characters, their tics (Ice Bear FTW!) and follow them on a funny quest to get their stolen backpack back. A 10/10 debut episode with a lot of good plot twists. But then, we have the ""Viral Videos"" episode, that doesn't explore the characters potential and has a way more shallow plot that fails to grab your attention.<br/><br/>So far, it seems like the show has a whole eccentric world and a lot of possibilities to explore, but I guess the writers are still trying to find its type of humor and sometimes they end up trying way too hard to make you laugh. Even so, I believe this can turn in another big hit for Cartoon Network if the they find its formula.",25 out of 36 found this helpful.,6.0,28 July 2015

827,We Bare Bears, Sooooo good!,"My family and I have been watching this show from day one. We get super excited when a new season drops. It's like, frickin Christmas.<br/><br/>The theme song is by far the catchiest. We find ourselves humming it at random throughout the day. Even the ending little banjo riff puts a smile in your 💓 for the day.<br/><br/>Yeah, some say it's a bit subdued for a cartoon, I say it's more thoughtful and considerate storywise. We love that you get to form a bond with the characters that helps you share in their brief adventures. And don't get me wrong, the humor is definitely strong within. I laugh cry.<br/><br/>Moreover, as a very mixed cultured family, (we like Skittles, a big ol' rainbow) the social awkwardness is completely relatable. We have all suffered the dating struggles, people concerned with your background, being rejected for not being ""culturaly pure"". Watching these bears positively work their way through it all is a small comfort.

828,We Bare Bears, Unbelievably incredible,"Okay. This show is AMAZING!!!!!!!!! I've never seen anything like it. The characters are unique, not too immature, and work together. They have aired close to 20 episodes, and I've only seen them use crude humor once. The Bears obviously love each other very much, and would do anything to help one another. That is a fantastic element to a kids cartoon.<br/><br/>⚠️THE FOLLOWING IS A SPOILER!⚠️ In one of the episodes, the Bears go to a movie. They are interrupted by rude people talking and eating loudly. Later on in that same episode, the Bears are walking down the street. They walk by a guy disrespecting his mom, and people yelling at each other. I think the main point of this episode is to question viewers if they are like these people, so if they are, they will change. I also think that they are trying to give them a better view of the world and how rude and disrespectful it has become. Another fantastic message. I'm not calling everybody idiots or anything like that, but let's face it, this time period isn't like The Andy Griffin Show.<br/><br/>⚠️THIS IS A CHARACTER SPOILER!⚠️ The Bears also have a friend named Chloe, who is a child prodigy, and not an immature, crude, prank-pulling, snot-tasting idiot like Nickelodeon's shows have as characters. (That didn't concern SpongeBob. It's the only good show on Nickelodeon right now.) She is very fun and friendly. I love her personality. Now, shifting to Ice Bear. Very unique. Never seen anything like it. He's my favorite character. I love how his voice just stays monotone. Very creative. <br/><br/>⚠️PLOT SPOILER!⚠️ I also loved the first episode. I thought the part when they were putting their stuff in their backpack was genius. They each put one of their favorite items in their, which told about their personality. Panda put his phone in, which shows he obviously loves browsing, and Ice Bear put in ninja stars, which shows he is extreme and loves to practice fighting. Genius.<br/><br/>This show is....incredible. Cartoon Network has struck gold. I hope this show will end up getting really famous. The creators are geniuses.

It's rare to see a TV show be this bold and ballsy. Each character is perfectly inappropriate in their own ways, making for constant laughs. They push the limits for shock factor (a gay bomb, that makes people gay), and don't care about offending people. <br/><br/>Brickleberry is not for everyone, and certainly not a family friendly show, but people who can take a joke and laugh at bold humor should love this show.",24 out of 27 found this helpful.,8.0,15 October 2014

There is also a rude talking little bear immediately comparable to Stewie and Cartman. <br/><br/>It's a brilliantly written show with hilarious characters, dialogues and situations. It can be extremely politically incorrect with its out of the world jokes and situations, which is why some people may Hate it with passion.

If you don't like this type of humor, stay away from Brickleberry. Nobody is making you watch it. It's sure to offend with its stereotyping, lampooning of certain disabilities, illnesses etc. The name of the head ranger in this series should be a tipoff as to what you'll be in store for. It's Woody Johnson. Brickleberry is offensive, raunchy, tasteless, gross, and even disgusting at times. It goes where no animated series has ever gone before.

841,Brickleberry," Crude, rude and frickin hilarious","There has been a lot of hate for this TV show. Many say the jokes are predictable, offensive and disgusting. Sure, the comedy is dark. In fact, it can get very dark at times. However, it is still a funny show. The comedy is so out there that you are genuinely surprised with some of the things that the characters say, even if it was just a side comment. Although these jokes could be considered predictable, it is their unpredictable placement that makes it great to watch. Some of the humour was a bit cringey, which made me glad that I watched many of these episodes on my own. But these weren't too common (either that, or I am not easily embarrassed!).<br/><br/>When the series starts you aren't told much about the characters aside from their generic traits. You learn the odd thing about each character (for example, a certain someone's love for more mature women), but don't expect it to expand much beyond that. It was quite interesting for them to do this as most cartoons give their characters some back story. It means that each episode is a surprise when they are thrown into highly unlikely situations in an unassuming National Park.<br/><br/>I would recommend this show to people of my age (college/university).

For those who think it is poorly written I say it's more about the craziness of the characters than the story itself you're switching between different stupid situation that only seem to get worst but there is still coherence in the storyline and the characters.<br/><br/>What I found brilliant is the way this show takes to make you laugh,you think you know where a joke is leading but ultimately it's always more crazier than what you could have thought.<br/><br/>Alas I don't think this show will stay on the air like so many who where loved by such a few(freak show,Wonder Showzen...)<br/><br/>9 out of ten even if some will hate me for it",50 out of 88 found this helpful.,9.0,30 October 2012

I know this isn't going to last long or whatever, but either way it is WELCOME. It's characters are nice, and the jokes pretty much hit bulls-eyes. Not only that, but it doesn't try to be ""too mean spirited"" or ""dumbed down for little kids"" like I see every other damn Cartoon doing on the 2010s these days. It uses vulgar humor that actually seems fresh in a way, and gives you a classic feel of ""2007 George of The Jungle"" in a sense Not only that, but the animation is just great, not choppy or even non- expressive.

846,Brickleberry, My new guilty pleasure.,"No more than one minute into the show there were several moments that would be deemed offensive to those sensitive to crude humor. I was laughing beyond control with how far the creators were willing to push the envelope in just the first episode. Hopefully after the first episode that will not change. With South Park completely running out of ideas, this show perfectly supplements it because its not just stale satire about current events. This show is the perfect show for those that watch Adult Swim or college students looking for a late night laugh. The characters do not have a lot of depth but with a cartoon of this style I wouldn't perceive it as required. Workaholics will not be returning till next year so until then this will do. If you like Tosh.O then this will be enough reason for you to watch comedy central for another 30 minutes on Tuesdays.

847,Brickleberry," Forced, unoriginal humor","Having watched the first two episodes of the series, I can say with confidence I will not be a returning viewer. The show's animation style is immediately reminiscent of Seth McFarlane's cartoons (Family Guy, American Dad, etc), while failing to add any color or flair of its own. In other words, the show just looks bland and boring.<br/><br/>The characters fail to impress, and each is just a grossly exaggerated racial, gender, or sexual orientation stereotype that just screams ""beating a dead horse"". The black character meets with the KKK, is afraid of forests (hurr hurr), and for some reason, has a penchant for sleeping with older women. <br/><br/>The jokes tend to fall flat, and just seem to be trying way, way too hard to offend without offering any subtlety, style, or ""smartness"" in their delivery. I failed to chuckle more than once or twice in an episode. Most jokes simply did not work. <br/><br/>If you want to give it a try, I encourage it, but I personally was completely put off by what I saw: an unoriginal, poorly made show that offers nothing new or interesting to the viewer.",67 out of 148 found this helpful.,3.0,17 October 2012
848,Brickleberry, It Just Isn't Funny.,"I was really looking forward to this series, after what seemed like months of Promos on Tosh.O. Well, I've sat through two full episodes so far, and I have yet to laugh even once. I just can't find anything humorous in it at all.<br/><br/>I see some of the other reviews compare it favorably with some of the titans of Comedy Central like South Park, The Daily Show or Tosh.O, but it not only doesn't compare with them, it's not even remotely in the same league as them.<br/><br/>Mind you, it's not *awful*, the animation is competent and the actors appear to read their lines correctly, but it really just has nothing going for it. They sure seem to be trying really hard to be funny, but it never seems to come off. The jokes aren't amusing, the characters are predictable, formulaic, and vapidly unoriginal, and the plots could have come from a Universal Cartoon Plot Generator. <br/><br/>Even when they are doing their darnedest to be outrageous and offensive, the acting and animation is so tepid and milquetoast, I just can't seem to care. I'm pretty sure they could do a 30 minute graphically explicit exploration of Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" and no one would even notice.<br/><br/>Pass.

(at the time I am writing this there are only four reviews) The reviews are fake because no one who loves offensive shows will say it's offensive in the reviews. Just read how the first 3 positive reviews sound like adds for the show. Even the one bad review is there to support what the other reviews have said. The show is not even that offensive. All four reviewers have only written one review on IMDb. What are the odds that the only four reviewers would have only written one review on IMDb and its for Brickleberry? (If they have more than one review in the future, it would be there just to discredit what I have written) The show is not good by any standard. Just on the notion that it is poorly written and there is no comedic timing. If the show is so bad that the creators have to make fake reviews, maybe they shouldn't be making this show.

852,Brickleberry, You really have to be dull witted to enjoy this,"I want to preface this by saying I enjoy Tosh.O (well the earlier seasons), I like Lous C.K., I even enjoy The Jeselnik Offensive. I'm okay with jokes that would get a lot of other people up in arms. But that's the thing, they have to be jokes. They have to be funny. I made the mistake of watching the first season of this show and I wish I could take it back, not even to recover the lost time, just to ensure they don't get better ratings because of me. Like other reviewers (that weren't planted from someone on the Brickleberry team) had said, it's just bland and one dimensional in every sense of the word. They don't make jokes about offensive material, they just present it and expect you to be so dim that you'll let out a slack jawed chuckle. They basically hold out a sign with the words ""RAPE"" or ""AIDS"" or some other offensive material and the clap sign lights up. It's insulting to the people that expected a funny and ""in your face"" cartoon, but it's only in your face because it's standing two inches from your face and screaming how edgy and cool it is for using naughty language and touchy subject matter.<br/><br/>Brickleberry comes off as a preteen boy that really likes to curse and make dirty jokes around his friends to seem cool. In other words, juvenile and trying desperately to be entertaining when it's just not. There is nothing redeeming about this show. Not the animation style, which is painfully plain. Not the characters, which are all cardboard cutouts of stale stereotypes (with maybe the exception of Malloy, but he's basically Daniel Tosh in bear form). And definitely not the writing.<br/><br/>There is nothing. Don't watch this show for the love of God, don't watch it.",43 out of 98 found this helpful.,1.0,19 August 2013
853,Brickleberry, Brickleberry is hilarious,"I also don't understand the hatred for the show. Yes it is similar to the likes of American dad and Family Guy in that it has a family/ community and a character that is out of place eg Dog, alien or bear or has an outrageous attitude and sarcastic manner, but that adds to the overall humour.<br/><br/>The show is funny because of the constant sick jokes. When south park started so many years ago it had terrible animation and too many inappropriate jokes but it was still very popular. The clear success of SP, FG and AD (you can figure out these abbreviations)proves that this is what the world demands. <br/><br/>What America forgets is it is only a small fraction of the world and goes ahead and cancels shows even though many people find these shows hilarious outside of America. I realise that they focus their ratings on the US audience but they need to expand their audience. If they had ever seen shows like Fawlty towers, Father Ted and Not going out they would realise their is an audience out there. <br/><br/>Brickleberry needs to be given a chance instead of keeping long since funny shows alive like the Simpsons. The main problem is people don't like change and new ideas. Acting like a bunch of old grannies who use a VCR and a big brick for a phone. Change is good try something new everyday and make life interesting.<br/><br/>Sorry for going into a rant but I hate the threat of shows I like being cancelled because only 1 million people watch it. They are not allowing for downloads and people outside their circle.",28 out of 61 found this helpful.,9.0,31 October 2012
854,Brickleberry, I tried to like it...,"I did, I gave this show a chance. I thought that it would be a hit being on Comedy Central and featuring Daniel Tosh and Kaitlin Olson..*sigh*.. but I was wrong. Like many other reviews before me, this show lacks originality. There is nothing on the show that hasn't been seen, said, or heard before either on the Tosh.O show or another animation show. And I can't believe I'm actually only giving Brickleberry a rating of 3 because I'm usually the one out of my friends that likes the stupid cartoon shows, but this one just didn't cut it.<br/><br/>However, On the other note I think maybe the ""tween"" phase of kids will like Brickleberry because it comes on late at night and it has offensive jokes and language that they usually can't watch when their folks are around. And for this reason, there might be hope for Brickleberry because of the tweens. Hey, we all did it, watched stupid shows because they were on late at night and had bad language or scenes. Then when we are older re-runs come on...late at night...and when we flip through the channels and start to watch the show we go WTF, this is retarded.

862,Goblin Slayer," A dark, but enjoyable, fantasy adventure","This anime series, set in a world where adventurers battle monsters, it introduced to us through a young priestess who is starting off at the lowest level of adventurers. She joins a group as they go off to battle goblins, low level monsters they believe will be easy to kill... things go horribly wrong but she survives thanks to an adventurer known as 'Goblin Slayer'; most adventurers of his level don't bother with goblins but for personal reasons he targets nothing else. After this she joins him as they take on various levels of goblins. As the series progresses they are joined by others and we learn more about why he wants to eliminate every last goblin.<br/><br/>This is a solid action/adventure anime which is shocking at times; notably in the opening episode. It is also fairly gory as goblins of all ages are slaughtered by the eponymous Goblin Slayer and those who fight alongside him. The tone is darker than most series in this genre with the possibility of death very real, even our hero gets seriously hurt at times, and it being quite clear what happens to the goblins' female prisoners. The story progresses well with the level of threat increasing as it progresses without merely feeling like the next level of a video game. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of the genre and look forward to the promised second season.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",9 out of 13 found this helpful.,8.0,6 January 2019
863,Goblin Slayer, Goblin Slayer is no Berserk 2 but if you willing to give it a chance someday it might be there,"Goblin Slayer is probably the most controversial and the most hated anime show of 2018 for the first episode only and as a manga reader I really don't understand why cause from my point of view the first episode actually toned down the level of gore and nudity a lot compared to the manga and it all to serve one purpose that is to show us as the viewer know how messed up a dark fantasy anime can get after so many fast food Isekai anime ruined the definition of the term ""Dark Fantasy"" with OP main character and their cheat code ability.That being said Goblin Slayer is not a perfect anime or even a good adaptation from the source material cause like I said before it toned down and cut a lot plus the horrible CGI Slayer and the rushed production in the animation department clearly not helping the anime at all but with the season 2 announcement in the season finale I can only hope that studio White Fox will learn from their mistakes and move on to give us the faithful adaptation of Goblin Slayer that we deserve",9 out of 14 found this helpful.,8.0,30 December 2018
864,Goblin Slayer," Im Going to slay some Goblins, Are You Coming?","Dear readers if your like me, just a simple anime watcher, that heard rumors about a anime called Goblin slayer, that was so dark, that it triggered a ton of people, and that you just had to learn more or watch it to see for yourself, then I suggest you stop reading this review and go watch the first episode of GS, but I assure you once you do, you will not be able to stop until you finish the first season in one binge. I usually am weary of dark anime, and this one sounded like it would be very dark, but I decided to test my stomach and give it a watch, and like I just said I binged watched the entire first season in one night and now I crave more. Let me start by saying the first episode is probably the darkest, and as the show goes on the darkness decreases. The first episode introduces us to a priestess who joins a group of young adventurers who are given the quest to wipe out a nest of goblins in a cave, despite being confident that this should be a easy task, the group is ambushed and mutilated by the goblins, and only the priestess is able to crawl away, and is rescued by a solo adventurer called Goblin Slayer, who is immediately shown to be a badass, as he wipes out the horde all by himself, and not just the men, but the women and the children too. The priestess then decides the best way to get over her traumatic experience is to join goblin slayer on his quests. Hilariously it turns out, goblin slayer only takes goblin quests, because he has made it his sole duty to commit genocide against the goblins, and the show cleverly reveals his reasons for this. Also despite the show starting out with the priestess, the title named character becomes the central focus of the show, except for a few subplots that focus on minor characters. GS is portrayed as a mysterious, stoic man who is obsessed with killing goblins and always wears his helmet, and even when he takes off his helmet, his face is never shown, which will drive you crazy by the end, but the purpose of this is because his helmet is his true identity. And by God, does he looks incredible, his aesthetics are clever and almost practical, what's interesting despite the show being 2d, sometimes hes made up of cgi that is obvious but doesn't ruin the scene. And when Gs goes into berserker mode, it is just incredible to watch. Despite all this GS is still portrayed as a compassionate man who despite being very skilled and strong is not invincible, and throughout the show many characters make a point to him that he shouldn't push himself too hard. Every other character in the show is not given as much character development as gs, but their simplicity is enough and everyone is likeable. Despite being a loner, Gs eventually gains a team made up of the priestess, a elf archer, a dwarf, and a lizardman shaman, who compose a fun ragtag group. Also GS is shown to live with his childhood friend called farmgirl, who provides him with emotional support and also most of the fanservice in the anime. Despite not being considered a harem anime, GS still manages to gain a few admirers, and that can sometimes mess up the tone of the show, but I suppose its to lighten up the atmosphere. Like I said the show does decrease the darkness, but still has many dark moments throughout, that reminds the viewer, that everyone even GS could be in extreme danger. This tension is what drives the show, and makes every adventure that would just be a simple quest in other adventure anime, seem like a life or death situation for the characters, because it is. The first episode is the darkest because it needed to establish the tone of the show and the danger that comes from hunting goblins, which is why the rape scenes, brutal killings and torture of female prisoners is necessary so you know how vile and evil the goblins are, and why you should support GS killing them in so many creative ways. This anime has great worldbuilding, excellent fight scenes, and compelling dialogue. The voice acting is incredible, the eng dub is actually better then the original and the reason why is because Brad Hawkins gives GS a sense of humanity and personality over the original scary stoic voice, and when he talks about killing goblins, he either does it hilariously or passionately. Despite this technically being a dark anime, I believe the level of darkness its been branded with, was greatly exaggerated. There is hardly any really gory scenes, indeed there are grotesque moments but nothing too severe, also there is very little cursing, and the show maintains a sense of hope and has endearing moments. Not to mention the humor is golden, especially when goblin slayer interrupts conversations to only talk about goblins. Lastly, I hope they make the second season fast, because I am in the mood to go hunting for some goblins alongside GS.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,7.0,31 March 2019

When I asked why they liked those 2 they said the kids were more real and could act, plus they love Selena.<br/><br/>From my perspective as a parent and a TV watcher of Disney Channel for some years now this really is one of the worst thought out shows. ""Sonny With a Chance"" is just about OK, but it started off pretty lamely too, but we've had Miley as Hannah, Demi as Sonny, it's about time Disney stopped making shows about kids wanting to get into show biz because maybe a different storyline would be more interesting and believable.<br/><br/>All I can say is if this is the best Disney could come up with they need a serious shake it up of their writing staff because too many more dreadful shows like this one will drive viewers to Nickelodeon in droves! To conclude: unlikeable characters, bad plots, bad dancing - makes for a bad show! 1 out of 10 because IMDb doesn't give less than that!",57 out of 83 found this helpful.,3.0,30 November 2010
881,Shake It Up, Review from an adult's stand point,"I'll start with something positive. The show does have some catchy songs and fun dance sequences. That's about all I can think of.<br/><br/>Now, as an education major, and someone who has spent the last 8 or so years teaching children, I have to say, this is a whole new ""low"" for Disney programming.<br/><br/>For starters, the show has 2 cute, fairly talented young girls for lead actresses, and the foundation for what could have been a great children's show. However, the characters are not likable, and it doesn't help that the writers do not give them much to work with. They are whiny, annoying, complaining, self-centered little girls. Plus, being a show for a wealthy company on a popular channel, I'm confused to why these teen actors were not given acting lessons. The acting is not good, my friends. It only grates on the nerves of the viewers (especially adults.) Next, this show does not have a real point to it. Yes, the actors sing and dance, and there's a loose plot... but that's about it. Most children's shows, especially on Disney have (or should have) a moral or lesson (underlying) for each episode. Miley in Hannah Montana lied to her father, got herself into a sticky situation, received a consequence, and learned a lesson. It happened over and over, but the writing was generally good, the acting pretty good for a kiddie show, and each episode had it's funny and sentimental moments. (You can disagree, but compare Hannah to SIU and it's like night and day.) The same goes for Good Luck Charlie and Wizards, the only 2 shows left that are worth families watching on Disney in my opinion.<br/><br/>Shake It Up, is teaching kids what, to be sassy and disrespectful to their parents, or all adults to that matter? Sneak out at age 12, to a big party, and pretend to be 16 to meet boys? That's a GREAT idea, Disney. Great role models! *sarcasm* The girls have serious attitude problems, and the show glamorizes the fact that the kids are smarter than the parents, because the parents are always clueless. The teachers at school aren't seen all that often, and when they are, the main characters are being disrespectful to them, or behaving badly in order to be cute or funny.(neither work) The show COMPLETELY sends the message that school and homework=""bad &amp; uncool."" The characters are always degrading the importance of education (Why would you want your child to think like that?) The main characters are not charming, and kids watching do not really learn anything of value. The little brother of one of the girls is a smart-mouthed little brat (the opposite of how you would want your child to act) who really needs a good spanking (if you disagree with spanking, then a time-out, and a quiet talk with his mommy). The comedy is just silly, even for a kids show. All around, I would not recommend letting your child watch this, unless you want to encourage back-talk, bad behavior, and sassy attitudes.<br/><br/>Come on, Disney. Cancel this show, and bring on something of value!",55 out of 86 found this helpful.,1.0,18 June 2011

Cece is just... awful. Bella Thorne is adorable, I'll give her that, but the character is such a show-off, always calling herself the ""best dancer ever,"" bragging about her spot on a dance show, and bragging about her debit-card and allll the things she just bought with it. Rocky is pretty much the same. She's not a good actress, and she's very obnoxious. The other two kids, Deuce and Ty, SO. ANNOYING.

I like Wizards of Waverly places, but this show is just BAD in general. The jokes aren't funny, the story line is a bore, it consists of bad overacting and terrible dancing. The girls dance incredibly sloppily and the only character who can really dance is Roshon Fegan. During each episode, I feel like what they define as ""acting"" are just their lines said screaming. The only positive things I have to say about this show is that I like the theme song, the boys are cute, and the two main characters are gorgeous; that's probably the only reason Disney picked them in the first place--after all, they can't dance, and they definitely can't act.",41 out of 67 found this helpful.,3.0,13 January 2011

I hate this show and I bet there are many who agree with me!!! The thing that the show is about seems alright but the actresses act so bad It ruins the whole thing..no wonder they only have each other..i wouldn't like them ever!! This show won't go far.

886,Shake It Up, You people are crazy! This is a Great Show!,"Compared to the other crap shows on the Disney channel, this show is way better than any of them. On the other Disney shows, there is always one ugly character (examples: Dez on Austin &amp; Ally. Luke on Jessie. Zack &amp; Cody on Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody.). But on this show I can't think of one character that is so annoying because of their appearance. Not even Deuce, who's got gargantuan eyebrows. This show has a great cast who actually can dance. Bella Thorne and Zendaya are adorable girls who I think have real talent in dancing and singing. The characters Rocky (Zendaya) and CeCe (Bella Thorne) are just downright hilarious. I love how CeCe can be such a dope sometimes and I just love it. However, my favorite characters happen to be Gunther (Kenton Duty) and Tinka (Caroline Sunshine) Hessenheffer. I love their accents, their ridiculous taste in fashion, their wickedness, and of course their acts they pull. In one episode (can't remember which one), they sang this hilarious song they wrote for a talent show. It was all about wanting a goat for Xmas and the lyrics were SO funny. But what really got me upset about this show was that they got rid of Gunther. Why?! Oh, why!!! I haven't seen the entire show so hopefully, they bring him back at the end (like what happened to Steve on Full House). Other than that, this is a great show!",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,7 August 2014
887,Shake It Up, I cannot stand this show,"I do love Disney, having grown up with it.

On the other hand, there are also some stuff on there I cannot stand, especially this and Hannah Montana.<br/><br/>At least Shake It Up! has Bella Thorne, who is very cute and is pretty decent compared to everyone and everything else on the show.(I have never been able to stand Miley Cyrus, not just as a singer and actress but as a person too).<br/><br/>I cannot stand everything else though. Zendaya Coleman is incredibly irritating, and Davis Cleveland is so obnoxious that there are times where you wish the ground would swallow him up. That's not all, the production values do look amateurish often, the music is forgettable at best, the story lines repetitive and predictable, the jokes and writing unfunny and tired and the characters clichéd and irritating.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I just cannot stand Shake It Up! despite any effort to try to tolerate it at least. 1/10 Bethany Cox",18 out of 32 found this helpful.,1.0,19 July 2011

When i was searching through TV channels and nothing was on so i decided to put on shake it up because i had no choice. So when I just watch 30 seconds of the show, I was bored. The jokes are not even funny. The acting is so horrible that I would through up multiple times and that shows how bad the show is. This is not the magic of Disney. Today we get shows that have to do with real people. I remember as a little kid, the original mickey mouse cartoons were on so I would watch that( please note that I am 14 and the cartoons were re-runs). I wish Disney today would just go back to the basics and make more mickey mouse cartoons and i'm not talking about mickey mouse clubhouse which just ruined mickey mouse.

889,Shake It Up, Disney has gone to a new low!,"After hearing some friends say the show was good I decided to give it a chance even though I normally don't like these kinds of shows. I don't like Sonny with a chance and most Disney shows with ""Teen"" Singers/Dancers/Actors. But I thought I might like this one. I have no idea why and I was so wrong! This is probably one of THE worst Disney shows in years-if not the worst! Hannah Montana was OK and Suite Life was OK. This show is the worst of them all! Its the opposite messages you want to send to kids. First of all, in the beginning episode you see the two main characters, CeCe and Rocky, dancing for money on the streets. Not for food but for a cell phone! Next they go on a dancing show to fulfill their dream (nothing wrong with that , right?). Well, CeCe and Rocky come 2nd at some of the competitions. Instead of saying ""We'll try harder next time"" they whine and whine. Not a good message to send to kids! Next is the wardrobe. I noticed that the 2 main girls wear clothes and makeup that would take hours to put together. It looks unreal how they would look so ""Professionally done"" at school! Next is the writing. The writers just re-use the same lines on every show! And the same character personalities. Every show now on Disney there is a mean, popular girl, usually 2 girls who get picked on by the mean girl, the annoying brother and the goofy kid. Almost all those characters are on Hannah Montana. The one good show on Disney I like is Good Luck Charlie. Its good, funny and has normal kids. No kids trying to be famous.

890,Shake It Up, Grab the Remote Before the Theme Song Ends!,"Shake It Up! is Disney's newest show about two 13-year-old girls living in Chicago. The show is centered around the teens' new ""jobs"" on a hit television show called Shake It Up Chicago where the latest dance crazes are broadcasted. Plots of the episodes mostly include scenes from the show, school and some of the girls other antics. Not only are the plots hollow and problems resolved way too easily, but the girls are also far too independent for 7th/8th graders. There are almost no adults in the entire show (CeCe's mom works late nights as a cop, Rocky's mom has only been in one episode, and other teachers or authority figures are almost never shown). If any teenage girl actually lived like this, especially with how gorgeous Bella and Zendaya (stars of the show) are, they probably would have been kidnapped by now. Not only are the plots, characters, problems and resolutions ridiculous, but so is their dancing. The only good dancer on the show is the part of Rocky's brother Ty played by Roshan. In my opinion Shake It Up cannot be considered a ""dance show"", due to the fact that they ONLY display freestyle/fad dancing, aka the latest crazes in music videos. They pay absolutely no respects to any other form of dancing such as ballet, tap, jazz, lyrical, modern, hip hop, street, acrobatics etc. I have been a dancer for 13 years and I have never seen something so ridiculous as to call itself a dance show. In all, this show may be amusing to 5-7 year olds, but anyone older than that, grab the remote as fast as you possibly can.<br/><br/>(p.s.

891,Shake It Up, Just awful.,"Shake it Up is, in essence, a cheap attempt by Disney to attract the singers and dancers who made up the ""High School Musical"" fan base. But this is just poor. The plot was probably thought up while the creator was on a drunken rant and the actresses hired based on their appeal to preteens instead of true acting ability. The show, like every Disney show, has the two female friends, their male companions, the ignorant black man who serves as a ""clown"" of sorts. This show couldn't be any worst. The jokes aren't funny,not even to my younger sister. The characters are unappealing, the show is extremely overacted and the whole thing has a production value that should PAY you to watch it. This just showcases, once again, Disney cannot rent a good show. Even when ABC or Disney gets a good show, they get rid of it for poor shows like this. I would rejoice if it were canceled.",16 out of 31 found this helpful.,1.0,10 June 2011
892,Shake It Up, This show is terrible,"If you thought the Hannah Montana character was disrespectful to adults, you'll think she was an angel compared to these two characters, Rocky and CeCe. They talk back to their teachers and are flat out disrespectful. The characters are spoiled and act as such. You would think Disney would want characters on their shows who encouraged kids to be better kids but these certainly wouldn't. The ""Show It Up"" episode is particularly terrible. Disney makes Rocky come across as ungrateful and only doing good deeds to get recognition. (She storms off the stage at an awards show at school because she keeps getting 2nd place awards. Even mocking the 1st place winner as she storms off. She talks back the principal as well.) <br/><br/>The acting is terrible. While I can stand to watch CeCe, the Rocky character is awful. Maybe it's her acting style but everything is way overacted and over the top. None of the other characters stand out as exceptional either. <br/><br/>Sure the idea to have a show with the dancing theme is different, the story line itself is not that exciting either. Even the dancing to me is sub-par. I just think with all the talent out there, Disney can do better than this show.

893,Shake It Up, What a stinker.,"Oh my word! Who's idea was this? This is the worst show Disney has ever had. The plot is dumb, the acting is terrible, and it's not funny at all. I'm sure so many people (including me) would love to be up there on TV, people with talent. Disney hit an all time low with this cast. They have no talent for acting whatsoever. Seriously, who picked these people? The plot is dumb because the most common people get picked for a spot on a dance show as background dancers. But they sure are in the front a lot for a couple of background dancers. And there these two German characters who make you want to start a war with Germany. There's this stupid red head twig, Cece, who has dyslexia. She gives it a bad name. She has bad grades and does a terrible job of acting stupid. It's so stereotypical. She makes it look like all people with dyslexia are lazy and stupid and they use their disability as an excuse. Her character is supposedly ""wild and free"", but she just looks like a moron to me. But then there's her best friend, Rocky. She's annoying and intrusive. And there's this guy Deuce. He's also not very bright. And he's also a ""business man"" if that's what they dare to call it. And then there's Rocky's older brother, Ty, who is equally annoying. He's a ""playa"" who wants to be a rapper. And then there's Cece's little brother. This child is rude and loud.

894,Shake It Up, Not great,"I could probably comment on how Disney is going downhill, or that they need to stop with the shows about double-lives or trying to get into the show business. I will give it the benefit of the doubt that the jokes are a result of bad writing, the acting has potential though. These are the kinds of jokes I'd probably find funny if I was still 4-11 years old, because they've been recycled so much on Disney. For the most part it's so unrealistic, and need I explain why? It should only take you one episode to determine no 13 year old girl is THAT independent in the middle of Chicago. I remember shows like Even Stevens and Lizzie McGuire, that are arguably just as cheesy as anything else Disney puts out. However, the main difference was it taught kids valuable life lessons, and TV doesn't care about that as much any more. The kids act spoilt, sassy, like they can always win and always get whatever they want. If kids keep growing up with this idea in their head that they can be sassy little brats as adults without getting beaten up or killed, it just shows you what's wrong with today's generation.<br/><br/>However, I do have a guilty pleasure for the fashion, the theme song is catchy and danceable, and the actors are really cute.

Cece's brother Flynn is an absolute headache &amp; cannot act AT ALL. Any thing he does seemed so fake.

Cece &amp; Flynn's mom really didn't do much for the show either &amp; I think she was as useless as Deuce &amp; Ty. Ty, Deuce, &amp; the Mom were basically just added in there as excuses for characters. I think that in this show, Disney tried too hard to get creative with names because I have never seen anyone or heard of anyone named Deuce. Doesn't the word Deuce have something to do with Tennis?

In one episode they sneak off to a party and in another they fake their age to get a boyfriend. Their hair, clothing and makeup is ridiculous to the point of making me actually laugh out loud (the only thing that made me in this ""comedy"") and if a real girl dressed like that and did the stuff they did, they would get raped. It is not a good influence on children telling them that it is OK to lie, cheat and act way too old. The other characters are just downright annoying. the little brother is an idiot who is out of control and needs a good old fashioned spanking. <br/><br/>The plot is clichéd, predictable and silly. The two girls go on a ""dance show"" which only includes the same style of dancing which could probably be performed to a better quality by a 6 year old.

902,Shake It Up, Despite all the hate I find this extremely entertaining..,"First of all EVERYONE I've talked to about this show has really enjoyed it so far. Disney shows are typical of having relatively thin plots, if you're expecting elaborate drama-filled entertainment you're watching the wrong channel. That being said I've found ""Shake it Up"" to be INCREDIBLY entertaining. The dancing is truly great in my opinion (I have a background in ballet, jazz, and hip hop and recognize seasoned performers when i see them). ""Quest Crew"" has already made an appearance in one of the very first episodes and there is NO DOUBT that they are a talented group of dancers. I've found the acting to be good as well, especially when compared to shows like ""JONAS"" or ""I'm in The Band"". The main characters ""Cece"" and ""Rocky"" have genuine chemistry and in my opinion add a fun and youthful edge to the face of Disney. Co-stars like Roshon Fegan and Adam Irigoyen add timely comic relief and truly complement the Chicago based setting in which the show takes place.<br/><br/>I'm immensely surprised at how passionately people have shown hate towards this show, especially considering how the majority of naysayers admit to being adults; it is possible that this is a show that can only be enjoyed from the perspective of a teen like myself; the ideal demographic that shows like this are catered towards. Nevertheless, ""Shake it Up"" has bumped Hannah Montana as my second favorite show on the Disney Channel.<br/><br/>Overall I encourage you to watch it for yourself and form your own opinions.",13 out of 33 found this helpful.,10.0,1 January 2011

But you won't know til you watch it.<br/><br/>As for me, all I can say it that even the sketches I thought were stupid or bad, I still couldn't look away. I was always, for better or worse, interested to see where it was going, engrossed almost. And the sketches I liked? I go back to over and over and over. I can't get them out of my head. I wake up from nightmares thinking about having to marry my mother in law (you'll get the reference soon).<br/><br/>Either way, at the very least this show does something different. It has a distinct voice, it's weird and strange in ways you forgot were possible, and it sticks for better or worse. Give it a shot. I love it, but you may not and that's expected.",51 out of 57 found this helpful.,10.0,23 May 2019

The sketches are well written, the characters are quirky enough to seem realistic but so ridiculous that it gives you those uncomfortable laughs. I genuinely laughed out loud at a lot of these. My favorites were the song about skeletons using bones as money, you have no good car ideas, the one with poop on the receipt, and the eulogy for former baby models (because I think the host is hilarious).

931,Courage the Cowardly Dog, One of the great Cartoon Network shows...,"Along with Dexter's Laboratory, this is the show that has kept me watching Cartoon Network, even when they put dribble like ""Totally Spies"" on.<br/><br/>This series, although having a few 'flat' episodes, is a great example of a well made cartoon. Rarely do you hear the same music twice (which has, on numerous occasions destroyed other series where you hear the same stuff over again over numerous seasons), the voice acting is always great (from the main characters to Mr. Katz and the Goose God), the animation is great (the varied reactions they give Courage is worth watching for alone) and the stories are always unique, even when they're not up to the series standard bar (which is pretty darn high, IMO).<br/><br/>Ultimately, the series is a culmination of so many excellent factors, with the most important being the way that it can be scary but not so much that you can't let kids watch it. It's the perfect black humor cartoon for kids and adults that I wish was out on DVD, as I'd buy it in an instant.<br/><br/>My personal favorite episodes are ""The Chicken From Outer Space"", ""Revenge of the Chicken From Outer Space"", ""King Ramses' Curse"" and ""The Gods Must Be Goosey"".

934,Courage the Cowardly Dog, One of the most interesting and disturbing cartoons ever.,"Since Cartoon Network had been on, I had taken note of its shows, but I never considered watching them. I didn't think much of their shows when passing through them to get from one channel to the next, but when I sat down and saw ""Courage the Cowardly Dog"", I was amazed. I easily became addicted to watching the shows (and even staying up until 3:00 in the morning just to see the rerun of the prime time episodes again). Essentially, the show is about a dog named Courage who is adopted as a puppy by an elderly woman (most likely in her fifties or sixties) named Muriel, who is married to an equally aged man named Eustace Bagg. Muriel is kind-hearted and compassionate, but Eustace is selfish and inconsiderate (most of the time). They live in the middle of Nowhere, which is an actual place (with a city a few miles away by the same name). Strange events plague Courage's family, and since Muriel and Eustace don't have enough wisdom or sense to recognize these events, Courage has to save them from whatever is happening. Along with Johnny Bravo, I'm surprised to see this on Cartoon Network. The elements of the shows are very cartoony yet disturbing. While I've never put my finger on it, my brother has the idea that it could be the music. Whatever it is, the show is great.",48 out of 52 found this helpful.,,21 June 2003
935,Courage the Cowardly Dog, The best Cartoon Network show!,"Oh, man, this show rocks!!! Who could forget the crazy antics of Courage, and how he'd always scream in a different way each time (i.e. his guts fly apart, his eyes grow, he's cut in half) They would have like a different villian for every episode, and there were all kinds of crazy things like snowmen, the Sandman, Eustace as a pickle pirate(!) and such. I must say even Eustace has become likeable to me! He does show redeeming qualities in a few episodes (""Serphent Of Evil River"", ""The Mask""). I've liked some episodes so much I've even written down stories of them!<br/><br/>
And Dootuss...If Scooby Doo is scarier than Courage, how come Scooby Doo is BRIBED into doing his bravery (by getting scooby snacks) and Courage does it because he loves his owners?! He's a LOT braver than Scooby-Doo! I also doubt SD could handle a giant fungus foot, or a little mind-controlling alien, or a crazed, emotionally disturbed goat.<br/><br/>Pure genius! I must say, when Arthur Anderson had to voice Eustace and Lionel Wilson quit, Eustace really lost his pizazz. But that doesn't stop me from liking everything else about the series!! My favorite episodes are ""Human Habitrail"" ""Mission To The Sun"" ""King Ramses' Curse"" ""The Transplant"" ""The Tower Of Dr. Zhalost"" ""Mondo Magic"" ""Dome Of Doom"" ""Farmer-Hunter Farmer-Hunted"", the list goes on!

936,Courage the Cowardly Dog, My Favorite Cartoon Network Show,"I love Courage the Cowardly Dog, I have loved it ever since I was a kid, and I still love it to this day. Why?

Eustace and Muriel provide most of the laughs, I know this may sound mean but I think Muriel being fat adds a lot to her humor. Courage can sometimes get a laugh, but the computer in the attic is better.<br/><br/>Now for horror, oh God, this show is traumatizing. There are several episodes that scared me as a kid and still creep me out to this day. Freaky Fred was scary because that could actually happen. The puppet man was disturbing. But the one everyone remembers is King Ramses, if you watch that episode you will probably scream.<br/><br/>And the show is also dramatic, the last episode shows what happened to Courage's parents and I actually cried.

Not to mention how he would pull off one the the funniest horror-ish screams, with the giant holes in his mouth, the overall increase in size of the mouth, and the noise as well.

945,Courage the Cowardly Dog, Terror In The Land Of Innocence.,"I look back on Courage the Cowardly Dog and it's hard to question its uniqueness and boldness. In terms of content and presentation some shows simply have no equal and ""Courage"" is one of them. Horror comedy per se is a slightly tricky genre; it can be trickier still when catered primarily to a juvenile audience. But all this didn't stifle its creators as they stealthily ventured into thematic territories few of their contemporaries would dare, intermixing horror with comedy, comedy with horror, and every once in a while producing something that's nerve-jangling horror by any standard.<br/><br/>The opening intro sums up the premise quite well so I needn't go too much into the details. Courage is a timid, petrified canine who finds a home in the middle of Nowhere when he's adopted by Muriel to the dismay of her grouchy farmer-husband, Eustace. What follows is a chain of horrifying misadventures as Nowhere is anything but an ordinary town: it's a stygian barren land. Fortitude isn't the absence of fear but taking action despite its presence and Courage demonstrates that time and again in every episode by coming to the rescue of his new owners (even though Eustace abhors him).<br/><br/>Eustace's bumbling personality does allow for moments of comic relief but be warned, this is still a dark, dark show. Infidelity, prostitution, exorcisms, satanic curses etc. hardly qualify as the kind of stuff you'd expect to notice in children's television programming but it's all there -- well disguised, covert, hidden behind opaque curtains but still there. The effective technique of integrating CGI with traditional animation adds considerably to the show's dreamlike, disorientating aura. You, the viewer, become one with CtCD's supernatural landscape which makes for an impossibly engaging viewing experience. The soundtrack does a wonderful job augmenting the tonal sensibility of the story, mirroring the characters' momentary thoughts, (panic, peace, disbelief, awe, horror) and transplanting energy to the ambient scenery. The soundtracks of the episodes ""The Great Fusilli"", ""King Ramses' Curse"", and ""Windmill Vandals"" sound like the sort of music devotees would play while performing macabre rituals before the devil himself. Perhaps the technical adroitness and the mature subtext are the reasons John Dilworth's magnum opus still lingers in my memory deep into adulthood when so many other cartoons have faded into oblivion or simply don't hold up.<br/><br/>On a concluding note, I'd say Courage the Cowardly Dog is a timeless gem. Instructive but never overbearing; chilling but always heart-warming. :)",7 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,13 October 2014

947,Courage the Cowardly Dog, Purely Genius!,"Courage the Cowardly Dog is one of my childhood's fondest memories. Most of the episodes are dark, creepy, yet brilliant and makes you think. I rarely see shows like Courage nowadays. The voice actors are talented and perfect for the roles of Courage, Muriel, Eustace, the smart aleck computer, etc. There's also hidden meanings and morals in most of the episodes. In 'Mask,' there are references to feminism and domestic violence. In the episode where Courage discovers that one of the library books he borrowed from the local library are overdue (I forgot the name of the episode), the moral is ""return what you owe."" There are also some creepy, and sometimes downright disturbing episodes. There was an episode that haunted me for years, but yet, I love it; it's called 'King Ramses' Curse.' 'King Ramses' Curse' is one of the many episodes of Courage that would scar you for life. The antagonist of the episode (or should I say ""victim of Eustace's greed,"" considering Eustace stole what isn't his) is the undead King Ramses, whose slab was stolen by Eustace, and he told them to ""return the slab or suffer my curse"" (one of the most memorable quotes from the show). Despite its scary episodes, it's a very good show overall. Both kids and adults can watch it and love it because it lacks childish humor, all of the characters are lovable, makes you think, etc. Too bad Cartoon Network cancelled this show so they could make room for their stupid, new shows.

953,Courage the Cowardly Dog, A another great Cartoon Cartoon.,"Hello again Today I'm going to review another great Cartoon Network show that I watch as a kid called Courage the Cowardly Dog. This show is about a dog named Courage who lives in the middle of nowhere with his owners Muriel and Eustace Bagge. My Favorite Character is Eustace who is a mean old man who calls Courage a Stupid Dog all the time. My Favorite episode is The Mask wear a masked person comes to the farm and Courage has to find out about her. My favorite villain is Katz who is a cat who is always trying harm Courage.

The story is about a dog named Courage who has to save his owners from supernatural events pretty much everyday. Just from the premise it sounds cool, but there is so much more. This really is one of Cartoon Networks finest shows. One the best things about it is its use of music. It adds so much atmosphere to the already very atmospheric moment. Just watch one episode. You'll understand that the music is really good stuff. The jokes are very funny. You have no soul if you don't smile even once watching an episode. The show is also well animated.

957,Great News, Great News is a delightful masterpiece!,"Great News, even though it was short-lived, is worth a binge watch. While it has it's issues, which many have pointed out, check the dates those reviews were posted on. The negative ones were mostly posted in 2017, during the show's first season. However, the series solved it's issues by the time the fifth episode of the season aired. But, it wasn't until the seventh episode that the series truly began to shine. It is one the best sitcoms to air on NBC this decade. It's so witty and humorous. Each character really comes into their own after a handful of episodes. The character of Chuck, played by John Micheal Higgins, is the most lovable of them all. His charm is irresistible and I found myself enjoying his portrayal most of all. Give a watch and stick with it, it gets better, even when you think it's already at it's best. Support the series online, and tweet at Hulu or Netflix to pick-up the series for a third season, if you like it.

I think the latter has pretty much been developed as far as she can go -- there doesn't seem to be any growth or arc here yet. On the other hand, Richie is really good at the few moments she is given to shine. Her character needs more space, more development if this show is to survive.<br/><br/>So far, it is too dependent on two notes: (1) the meddling stage mother and (2) the arrogant and insecure overbearing lead anchor.

I think the show will hit its mark with people who can relate to helicopter parenting and unless you are or have known a parent like the one Andrea Martin portrays you probably will be left in the dark. That being said, I think the side stories about the newsroom are funny as well and wasn't offended in the least when the focus shifts to the older newscaster. I don't think he was portrayed in an offensive manner. In fact, I think he adds a believable slant on being an older person working within a younger work force.

967,Great News," Yes, it's familiar but it still feels good","Yes, it's basically a recycling of the 30 Rock dynamic and characters. Yes, it's got echoes of Superstore and Parks &amp; Recreation.

That's like saying you don't want any more hugs from your mum because you had one already. 
Briga Heelan and Andrea Martin head the show with their highly dis/functional mother/daughter act but they're superbly supported by an ensemble cast including Adam Campbell as the boss, and source of romantic conflict; the fabulous John Michael Higgins dealing a strong line of schtick as the loveable dinosaur of an anchor; Nicole Ritchie, who has spades of comic timing, as his narcissistic co-anchor; and a clutch of quirky characters in the supporting cast.

974,Great News, The Clone Wars,"I don't dislike this show.<br/><br/>You can definitely see many of Robert Carlock's &amp; Tina Fey's touches in the show.

Briga recently playing the great Heidi character on the Netflix series LOVE.<br/><br/>Here's what bothers me about this show... Did they think we wouldn't notice?<br/><br/>This show is a sliced and diced, chopped, pressed and reformatted version of 30 Rock.<br/><br/>Tina Fey/Briga Heelan - Liz Lemon/Katie Wendelson John Michael Higgins/Tracy Morgan - Chuck Pierce/Tracey Jordan Jane Krakowski/Nicole Richie - Jenna Maroney/Portia Scott-Griffith Horatio Sanz/Judah Friedlander - Justin/Frank Rossitano<br/><br/>The list goes on.<br/><br/>Unlike the Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, which was a wide departure from a show about a show format, this show has Wigfield, Fey &amp; Carlock back in VERY familiar territory. It remains yet to be seen whether they've managed to capture lightning in a bottle, or merely static electricity on the rug.<br/><br/>As many have noted, the WONDERFUL Andrea Martin has really carried the first few episodes, but she can't do it alone and this show be a success.

It reminds me a lot of 30 Rock, with a ""normal"" trying to deal with a crew of weird egoists in a television setting. It took that show a while to get going, and I hope NBC will give this show a chance to find its legs also.

981,Ransom, This one has lame duck TV show written all over it,"There are some absolutely brilliant TV shows being put out these days. This is in part due to the additional streams of content coming from the likes of Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and of course the older TV newcomers like HBO, Showtime, etc.<br/><br/>In some cases, network TV has raised the bar to remain competitive and then there are shows like Ransom where it's just garbage that will inevitably be canceled mid-season or soon thereafter.<br/><br/>I just don't understand how a network like CBS can spend millions of dollars on such a crappy show, especially during a time when the competition for producing great content is so rapidly increasing. You think they would hire better people, people who wouldn't dare release such a weak show.<br/><br/>Now, I've only watched the first episode but it was so bad that there really isn't a reason to keep going. The cast was demographically thrown together, the story was full of holes and unrealistic scenarios, and it's your typical struggle then happy ending fake plastic TV trash that is contributing to the downfall of network TV.<br/><br/>Let's look at the first episode a bit more closely. A new college grad gets rejected from a job with this crisis agency but doesn't take no for an answer. In the lobby of the agency, after being rejected, a kidnapping news story comes up on the TV. She zips over to the kidnapping in a taxi, shows a business card of the crisis agency she took before leaving to the police officer guarding the scene, and he just lets her in. She then casually strolls into the building and into the war room where the hostage negotiation is taking place with nobody questioning her at all. She then puts her two cents in as the negotiator is on the phone with the hostage taker, and nobody says a word or throws her out. You get the drift and the whole episode goes down like this. Stinky, stinky, waste of time rubbish.<br/><br/>It's now just a matter of time before it gets canceled. CBS has failed big time with this show and the fact that they actually released it is a strong indicator that the network is heading further into irrelevance.",56 out of 87 found this helpful.,1.0,2 January 2017
982,Ransom, Doesn't Feel Right...Too Fake,"If I were to judge a series by the first ten (minutes) I'd get the feeling Ransom is a dumb ed down Hollywood-ized look at criminal negotiation. A young woman, recently graduated and seeking employment, attempts to interject herself into a police hostage situation through the third-party negotiation team hired guns. As if she could just stroll in to a situation controlled by the police we must plant in our mind she is some kind of special. Simply put this couldn't happen and if she did somehow manage to breach the police line the company she seeks employment in would certainly not hire her. <br/><br/>OK, I realize in all of the world hostage situations take on quite diverse flavors. In some places I'm sure independent contractors for hostage resolution probably take the lead, maybe even in place of law enforcement. So I'm being forced to think that in Canada these types take the lead over the law enforcement apparatus that should be in full control. OK again, I'll go for it just to see where it leads. I guess the creators of this show win this one as I'm interested enough to give it some more time.<br/><br/>As we go on the girl seeking employment as a negotiator gets a chance by cornering the head honcho. She continues to give him reason for pause and yet she isn't sidelined, in fact she's immediately hired. This is suppose to be character building I suppose yet it feels completely made for TV and in no way real. Sometimes made for TV is good of course, but this immediately purports to be a reflection of reality and in the first episode I'm not getting it. The A-Team was suppose to be completely out-there, this team shouldn't be. As a viewer I find myself wanting something more rooted in gritty reality. As you can tell I'm not really getting ""on board"" with this, I guess, uber negotiation team/company who works both within and outside the law. That in itself might be a good premise for a show but whatever that show is it needs to build a much more believable story to work from than I'm getting in this first episode. In the real world this team would likely get everyone killed consistently. So watching episode number two isn't very likely.<br/><br/>I read this was taken from two real hostage negotiators real experiences. If so how come it feels totally made for TV and fake? It'll never make it unless something radically gets more real and more compelling.",18 out of 26 found this helpful.,4.0,20 February 2017
983,Ransom, mystery with a twist and rescues,I like mystery and cop shows. Ransom promised both so it was intriguing to me and I gave it a chance. The way the young college girl got into the first scene without ID was a bit far fetched. The head of the agency is a bit of a James Bond type which is appealing. Beaumont is like Bond in that he is mysterious and well dressed but can handle any altercation! There is a story within a story which I find holds my interest. It looks like this could be stories that are resolved each week which also appeals to me. Complete the problem and story each week and let me move on!

It's not the typical drama we see in North America. The writing is clever with the episode story and the series story. I look forward to watching and learning more about each character and seeing how each one relies on the others.,4 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,10 June 2018
996,Ransom, What a great Show. A must see!!!!!!!!,Just love this new series Ransom. Frank Spotnitz has put a great cast of actors together. They compliment each other. Luke Roberts is excellent in his role. Just love him. Can't wait for next week to see the next show Regeneration. Great to see well dress cast and such great ending. Enjoying every minute of the show from start to finished. Such great scenery also plays a great deal of enjoyment as we wait for the concussion. We also need some love scenes that Eric falls madly in love with someone. We need a little romance once in a while. Hope that we see some in the next few shows. Keep up the great work and keep those showing coming every week.,7 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,12 February 2017

1003,Ransom, Borderline,The begining was good the writing was better but then the writing got sloppy as the season went on. In the begining no one talked back to Eric as it went on everyone talked back to him on a team this would not work. I could live with most of that but the no gun thing is sooo stupid. The tv show the mentalist had this but in many scenes he relied on his partner's and their guns. There are people who actually do hostage negotiating for a living and none of them do it without a license to carry a gun. Now of course when they go in to certain situation were you would not wear a gun. The problem is having a group deal with violent criminals and doing it unarmed there is no such group. Why ? Someone on that team would be killed there are groups all thru out the middle east and Mexico a lot of foreign countries with high kidnapping rates. In reality there is no group who is 100% successful and there is no group that has not had to deal with violence on their end. I could go on but my point is these shows are suppose to be believable. You want your audience to invest in the characters and to believe this is something that could really happen.

1036,Dear White People, Not well written,"I was looking forward to this, but it was just really clumsy. The writing was unbelievably on the nose.<br/><br/>The thing is, this could've been awesome. I wanted to love this, to learn about these issues, and to see how I could be more helpful as a white person. Those are worthy goals and worthy ideas to explore in a Netflix series.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found it incredibly difficult to connect with the characters. I'm not saying they have to be likable-for example, Walter White on Breaking Bad isn't likable, but I'm emotionally connected to his journey.<br/><br/>Anyways, on to the next issue with the poor structure: The antagonist isn't well developed. Let's say the ""bad guy"" on the show is white racism. That's a legitimate concept; one that the movie Get Out developed to perfection, so I don't have a problem with that at all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's not well played. There's no realistic conflict. The white people in the show were so cartoonishly racist I wasn't able to suspend disbelief. Racism is subtle and insidious, and I find those situations to be more inherently dramatic and engaging than what they did here.<br/><br/>I didn't learn anything new, I didn't see the world through a different perspective, and I didn't feel any natural curiosity to binge watch. It was a chore to get through 2 episodes.<br/><br/>But most of all, what's the point of Sam White's journey if she's already so ""woke""? Does she struggle at all with her beliefs, her worth, or anything internal? Will she change at all as a result of her experiences? She's just annoying and whiny.<br/><br/>You guys are writers: Find creative ways to talk about these issues without simply jamming your own ideas into your characters mouths. Make it subtle. Write an episode where things are communicated with a look instead of the characters blathering to each other as if they were reading from a Buzzfeed article. Use sub text in your scenes. Quit being lazy because you're afraid it'll dilute your message. This isn't a soap box, it's a story. You've clearly forgotten that. Use the tools of great story telling and stop writing this show like it's your personal essay column. It's boring.<br/><br/>Please do better. The world needs this show. It could be great.

I could barely handle watching what I did. Maybe it gets SUPER good at the very end. But I really doubt it. And a big excuse I'm seeing is that it's a ""satire"" show. That's definitely true, but that does not make it good. Just because you're making fun of something stupid by being even just as/more stupid it still makes you stupid.

1040,Dear White People, Dear Ignorant Reviewers,"Most of the people posting 1 stars didn't even watch the show or only a few minutes into it. It's nothing like what they are saying. I'm as white as they come and from the Deep South, but I'm not such a tender little snowflake that I start crying every time racial issues are discussed because I'm afraid my feelings might get hurt if I hear anyone talking about white privilege. It's hilarious that those criticizing are just like some of the characters dealt with in the show. <br/><br/>The show actually displays many points of view and does a good job at portraying the complexities of college life and how students deal with being away from their comfort zones for the first time and confronted with the myriad of issues and perspectives that others may have. I have feeling that most of negative reviewers have never had that experience and are still stuck in the script they were born into. And if they had been exposed to thinking which challenged their assumptions, then they failed miserably at learning anything.<br/><br/>In any case, it's for anyone who has used their brain to venture beyond the dogma they grew up with to find something to relate to in show. But people who let talk radio and cable pundits do their thinking for them are most likely not going to get it and probably shout and scream that it's ""anti-white"". Oh well, their loss.<br/><br/>For one thing, it's a comedy and a satire. It's portraying how people think and act in a certain time and place. It's not asking you to agree with them, nor does it push any political ideology on anyone. It's called fiction. And it's quite clever and a show I'd recommend to any with at least some semblance of an open-mind. It really draws you in after the first two or three episodes and leaves you wanting more to see more of the well- developed characters.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it humanizes the ""other"" no matter who you are. And that's something we could really use more of in these times of knee-jerk ignorance. Give it a try, you'll be glad you did.","607 out of 1,152 found this helpful.",9.0,15 May 2017
1041,Dear White People, Auto-segregation,"This is the main principle of this show. The few people that try to talk sense and logic are showed as the bad guys. The only freedom of speach that most black people accept in this show is their own, when a satire magazine does the same thing they are staged with a blackface party. <br/><br/>This show tries to talk about social issues but it fails on many points. The most serious issue this show talked about is when a campus security officer points his pistol at one of the main characters for refusing to show his campus ID and then calling them dogs. While police brutality is a real thing that happens from time to time, this show makes it look that it can happen in an Ivy League campus, which I highly doubt that it's possible. <br/><br/>Now before that happend, there was this big party where they played this song that had the n word, not with the r but with the a(I am censoring myself because I am afraid this site won't let me post this review, and I didn't watch this bad show for nothing) and one of the white guys tells the other one to stop. As you would expect people start talking about why should they not use words in a non-racist, artistic way. The black guy ask what would the white guy feel if he started calling him ""redneck"" and ""cracker"", to which the answer was that he didn't care. A normal answer for some one that knows that words have the power you let them have on you. But that starts a whole race debate at the part. Which leads to the two guys almsot fighting and the campus security coming in.<br/><br/>If you need more reasons to hate the protagonist, her boyfriend is the one that called the police(and he is white). Once word spreads that he is the guy that called them, everybody starts hating him, even his girlfriend. Oh yah, she cheated on him the night before finding out that her boyfriend called the security. They don't make up at the final of the season, so he got that going for himself(good for him). <br/><br/>There is this joke where a student from Kenya tells another black student( that I swear to God he is whiter than I am, and I don't go out in daylight) that his ancestors where smart enough to not get caught. I guess saying that Africans sold each other wouldn't have been as funny, but it would have been way better to tell the truth in a show made to promote the opression of black people, that they create for themselves.<br/><br/>The satire magazine of the campus is shown to be those guys that say ""All Lives Matter"" or ""Blue Lives Matter"", and they are considered white and powerful. Little side note, the Blue Lives Matter and ALM started after Black Lives Matter started screaming kill all cops, so I guess people refuse to learn about this like the African slave lords. Those guys are the ones that fight for true free speach, think of them as Charile Hebdo, by making satire out of a lot of things. Sure they make fun of the protagonist, but then again she is the one that started most of these problems.<br/><br/>The few black people that don't agree with the protagonist are called Uncle Tom, but don't worry about that because they turn around at the end when they found out some rich guy wants to stop their auto-segregation and give money to the university.Sure the guy is quite corrupt, so that looks like a bad guy, if we don't consider the good some very bad people have done in the past. Do we judge them by the good they did, the bad or both?<br/><br/>The people giving this a bad review that didn't see the show, they are right, the show is bad, the good things are few and not that strong to stand on against everything bad that it has. And this si from watching the first season. Also, the people that praise it for being amazing might have their point, each and everyone of us likes a movie or tv that is bad, but it does not exclude it from being bad.<br/><br/>And now for the final statement. I am a liberal from Romania(some people might say that I have no right to talk about American society or other things of such nature, but freedom of speech is something both countries share) and I consider this movie bad. I only gave it three stars for all the good points. But if the first season was this unbearable, then I don't want to know what the second one has to offer.",125 out of 224 found this helpful.,3.0,10 June 2018

The premise is the richest kids in the world going to one of the richest colleges in the world. We are then supposed to feel sorry for ""POC"" snowflakes as they have to suffer through ""white people"" wanting to be their friends.<br/><br/>One of the most telling scenes is at a party. They have a gangster rap song where of course we have multiple uses of the word n**ger. When a white student sings in tune with the song (as are the black students) we then have a scene where our black protagonist freaks out about how offensive it is. I have no issue if people find certain words offensive, but then those people should NOT use those words themselves. Either it is okay for everyone or not okay for anyone. Is this concept so bad?<br/><br/>Sure their is some criticism of ""black people"", but anyone can tell that the show is very heavily social justice and meant to attack western culture and western identity. It took the minor failings of the film version and amplified them 10000000000000000000000 times.<br/><br/>This comment is already too long and I could add many more issues to the list. It is also extremely boring and takes a film that took 108 min and turns it into a 10 part series....<br/><br/>TL;DR Any show that uses microaggressions as a serious term needs to be called out.",124 out of 227 found this helpful.,4.0,2 May 2017
1043,Dear White People, Dear writers of this show,"Hi
Let's stop treating all white people as racists. Yes, there are many idiotic white people who judge people on the colour of their skin, but, there are many more white people who couldn't give a damn about a person's skin colour, judging them on whats on the inside, not on the outside packaging. There are also many black, asian, people of colour who are racist.
So, lets stop with the stereotyping of white people as automatically being racist and try writing a show that works towards showing people as people with good points and bad points, but, underneath the skin colour as being exactly the same.",103 out of 187 found this helpful.,1.0,2 August 2019
1044,Dear White People, Schizophrenic,"This show really has two sides for me, when only reviewing this as a comedy/drama show it is actually quite good, even hilarious at times. The individual stories of the characters are interesting and realistic. <br/><br/>However, the title makes me assume that they want to send a message about racism and white privilege, and the story line surely tries to make us see how people of color are still being treated differently. However, it fails miserably in sending a genuine message that would make people think about this matter in a way that they would want to change their behavior towards people of color. <br/><br/>Instead it confirms stereotypes and has a very judgmental take towards white people in general, when this generalization is the very problem that people of color are facing the other way around. So in my opinion this show is doing the opposite of what it is intending to do. Because of this at times it even comes across as pretentious and hypocritical. <br/><br/>In the end, it is still a very enjoyable show to watch. I watched the entire first season in one go but it leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand a good comedy/drama show and on the other hand a show that completely misses an opportunity to address one of the major cultural issues we face in these modern times in a way that could actually help us move forward.",84 out of 153 found this helpful.,5.0,4 May 2017

STOP pushing the victim mentality (ie 'oppressors', 'patriarchy' and other BS. Learn what the concept of 'personal responsibility' is) - it is condescending towards black people and in no way promotes peace.

In actuality just getting bored of turning down the sex scenes and dealing with the SJW crap it's using as some sort of justification for a ""meh"" and, quite frankly somewhat racist script.<br/><br/>Though through all the meh, I have to say the soundtrack is cool and it's actually very nicely shot. I just kind of want to grab the show and tell it.... stop it. Stop being so stereotypical. It's a very cool cast. I just think the script is just ... grrrr... Just ... I don't know. Try and be more inclusive of everyone and just quit it with the sodding bickering from everyone. It almost feels like it's trying to create division.

Now the same has happened to 800 Words and there are enough characters to keep the show going many more seasons. I don't often get attached emotionally to series tv but this one was of the exceptions.
As far as some people not understanding the liberal parenting style of the father in this series it's important to remember that drama can't be drama if there isn't tension in the writing. Who'd want two perfect children who never do anything wrong?

1076,800 Words, Funny and Serious,"800 Words was recently broadcast on PBS, and watching the 1st season made me buy as many series of it as I could get my hands on. The premise of the show has been discussed in other reviews, so I won't repeat it, but I'll give my opinion as to why the show is so good. The characters, actors and scripts are excellent, as is the scenery. The way it takes the trope of a quirky small town with ""outsiders"" adjusting to life there works so well because the show is very funny and very serious at the same time. That combination of laughing and then thinking - wow- this has something important to say about being human, grieving, family dynamics, making mistakes, loving and muddling through. It isn't preachy. It steals your heart because you fall in love with the characters. Even the town ""villain"" is likable in a way because the quirky characters are fleshed out human beings. The handyman is laid back and might be taken as a fool, but as with the Shakespearen fool, he has the role of helping his employer see the lay of the land and the people in it- plus he has a heart of gold. There are special characters throughout that show up in one episode (the has-been surfer dude is one of my favorites) and townspeople who make regular appearances. I like comedy to be meaningful, and meaningful drama to contain comedy. This show hits the bullseye.",15 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,22 September 2017
1077,800 Words, Loving this show,"I live in California and I hunt down and watch shows from other countries. Masterchef Au is by far the best Masterchef from around the world. One type of show I have found that I think Australia does really well, is the family dramedy. Offspring is one of my favorites, which led me to Love my Way, and other shows. Which oddly the same people seem to in so many of the shows I watch from Australia. House Husbands I really like and I love Upper Middle Bogan and Doctor Blake Mysteries, Sea Change... I enjoyed Anzac Girls very much and I learned so much about Australia and their history. of which I had no idea about before. I had never seen the main actor, Erik Thomson in anything and he is great. Watching shows from other countries, with actors you have never seen or heard of, makes the experience extra fun. This show feels like a winner to me. Oddly enough it reminds me a bit of Northern Exposure. I like how it is set in an unusual location with different types of people. The entire cast looks quite good as well. I am looking forward to watch the entire season and hopefully it will get renewed and carry on for a few years. I wish some of these shows would find their way onto Netflix USA or Amazon Prime or Network TV over here. I am not sure why Australia does not syndicate their shows. I know the government funds a lot of TV, so maybe that is the difference. Our loss. Update, it has been a huge hit, and I am so glad. It is going into season 4. It just keeps getting better.
I am furious that they canceled this show. It made it onto Netflix and it felt like it was just getting started! This show had years of stories left to tell.

1094,800 Words, A very good New Zealand drama,"Firstly, in my review of the film of godspell, I asserted that I had watched it on channel 5 and stated that the only good content on commercial TV is material not actually made by them. I should have added that only applies to commercial TV here in the UK. 800 words is an Australian drama made by network seven, a commercially funded channel which also produces the excellent drama a place to call home and the soap home and away.
800 words is the story of a family called Turner , comprising of George, a journalist whose task is to write an 800 word article for a newspaper column each day relating to the days events, hence the title of the drama, His daughter Shay and son Arlo.After losing his wife Laura in a tragic accident, details of which is explained in the course of its progression,(or maybe not quite an accident as you may conclude)George moves with his Arlo and Shay to start a new life in Weld, New Zealand.
The family's welcome is not very warm because George had stated in an article that Weld is a dead end, but after George apologises stating that by dead end he meant that it was the end of being dead and gaining a new lease of life.
Slowly but surly the townsfolk forgive him paving the way for he and his family to build a very good social relationship with them.
Each episode sees the turners involved in a different escapade which involves romance, some misunderstandings, strong disagreements in one episode and the subject of Laura's ashes to name but a few.
This is a very good entertaining drama, well executed and directed,and not too heavy.
 The show is broadcast by the BBC, and although it doesn't produce them, the production values are more or less on an equal footing. Which brings me to assert that commercial TV in Australia (and the USA and Canada for that matter has much higher production values than its counterparts here in the UK.TV Companies like ITV ETC do have good ideas for dramas, its just that they are very poorly executed compared to BBC dramas.
So why is commercial TV in Australia so much better than the ones Here? My guess is that over there, a large proportion of the revenue goes on production which is how they produce the above, as well as programmes such as the excellent Prisoner cell block h and Wentworth prison. As far as the commercial TV companies over here are concerned, Whatever they spend their income from advertising on, taking an educated guess, it sure is hell not on any of their productions!",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,4 May 2018

1097,Damnation, How Could anyone cancel this show??!!,"As it stands right now, there will be no second season of Damnation. 
And that might well cause many people not to bother watching this series. 
But Netflix has demonstrated that it is no better than the traditional television networks at placing quality at or near the top of the list of priorities when it comes to maintaining or cancelling its programs.
Fans of Dirk Gently, which Netflix has also cancelled, will attest to this.
Damnation and Dirk Gently join a long list of excellent television series, such as Deadwood, The Black Donnellys or My Name is Earl which were cut off by boardroom executives who probably never even bothered to watch these shows, who place endless increase in ratings above all other things, who believe that a show's worth can be measured in nothing else but numbers.
You should watch Damnation. 
You should watch it and, if you think that it is a show that deserves far better than it received, then you should let Netflix know that they were wrong in cancelling it.
You should do the same for Dirk Gently and any other Netflix series that you think deserves to be allowed to continue.
Because, unlike traditional networks, Netflix, and the USA network, from which the show actually originates, is completely dependent on its subscribers, who may not be able to work miracles, but if enough speak out may well be able to resurrect the recently dead.
You should also watch Damnation just because it is so damn good.
It has a brooding power which will cause inevitable comparison to Carnivale (Yes, another superb yet prematurely cancelled series) and Hell On Wheels. The two lead actors, Logan Marshall-Green and Killian Scott are almost certainly going to be in a neck and neck race as to who becomes the next major superstar/ male idol. Green could easily be cast as Tom Hardy's brother. In fact in some shots you might swear that it is Tom Hardy. Scott could easily be cast as Travis Fimmel, Ragnar from Vikings' brother. And both actors have that kind of smoldering intensity and flawless acting ability that makes it hard to believe that they could ever not end up being stars. The entire cast is in fact superb. It even includes Christopher Heyerdahl, who Hell on Wheels fans will remember as The Swede, one of the strangest and creepiest villains of all time. 
Damnation is just flat out great.
Set in the Depression era, the story is set around the conflict between a farmer organizing preacher, played by Scott, the forces that want to prevent the farmers from organizing, including a strikebreaking cowboy, played chillingly by Green, and a corrupt sheriff played by Heyerdahl. But none of that is what makes Damnation so good. It is the superb tension and complexity of character, the darkly powerful intensity that makes this a series well worth watching, even if there isn't going to be another season.
Watch Damnation.
You'll see what I mean.
And then, like me, you'll almost certainly want to send the mindless suits that cancelled this show to burn forever in...
Well.

1099,Damnation, Waited until the season was over to review,"I measure how well done a show is by whether or not I think about it in the days between episodes. This is one of those rare shows that caused me to think about it with anticipation. Damnation will definitely be on my short list of new favorites. The character development drives the story. I took off a star because the pacing wasn't perfect, but for the most part it was spot on. <br/><br/>I do not usually review shows, but I decided to review this one because I was surprised that the overall user rating was so low for the quality of the series. As I suspected, when I read other user reviews I saw that they lowballed it because they do not agree with the political slant, as a result it jaundiced the overall rating. The acting was well done, the cinematography is first rate, I adored the costuming and sets. Basically, I do not understand how anyone could give this show a 1 star because they do not agree with the politics. Do yourself a favor and watch for yourself and decide, unless of course you are too much of a snowflake to watch programming that disagrees with your political views.",81 out of 91 found this helpful.,9.0,22 January 2018

1103,Damnation, Good period drama to understand/mirror the present.,"If you liked ""Deadwood"" you might like ""Damnation."" Both ""Damnation"" and ""Deadwood"" are about power politics and corruption in western settings, ""Deadwood"" being set in the 19th Century Gilded Age in South Dakota, ""Damnation"" set in rural Iowa during the Great Depression (1931). FYI, the writers and director of ""Damnation"" have worked on projects like ""Longmire"" and ""Office Space."" The writing is well done (if brutal), and the acting excellent. Filmed in Calgary, Alberta, the scenery passes well enough for some parts of Iowa.<br/><br/>One of the differences between the two series is that ""Damnation"" is, while set in the past, deliberately intends to comment on our current state of affairs in the early 21st Century. The 1930's, like our time now, was a time when the economy failed millions, institutions such as the press, law enforcement and the courts appeared to have been corrupted, and the answers to these problems seemed they could only be solved by revolutions either by the extreme right or the extreme left. The comparisons can be taken a little far: one character, representing the ""Big Business"" interests coming after the small farmers, reveals that the interests he represents wants to eventually kick the farmers off their land to not only mechanize agriculture, but also mechanize factories and warfare (I think with our fears of Artificial Intelligence, this is more a fear of our time than the 1930's).<br/><br/>Another difference between ""Deadwood"" and ""Damnation"" is that the ruthless business interests are actively being opposed. The farmers are attempting to unionize and strike to protect themselves (though two of the main characters, who are the main labor organizers, would likely really prefer a workers revolution). Also, media like the investigative press and radio may also end up playing part in opposing ""Big Business"" and their enforcers. So far however, the local paper in ""Damnation"" is covering up the attempt to drive the small farmers off their land by price fixing and violence by strikebreakers. <br/><br/>The USA Network provides excellent video interviews with the director and writers, who make clear this is their intent. ""To understand the present, go back to the past,"" one of the writers says, or that the series, while set in the 1930's ""Mirrors the Past (director Adam Kane)."" USA also provides a couple of good mini-documentaries ""Legacy of the Heartland: The One Thousand"" and ""Legacy of the Heartland: War of Words."" The documentaries and the interviews put the characters and the action in better context, and really make this interesting, well thought out series more understandable.",46 out of 53 found this helpful.,9.0,22 November 2017
1104,Damnation," Great acting, well written and very well crafted.","I really enjoyed this show. The first thing riding against it is the fact that it is a slow burner. It's sad how our attention spans have dwindled since we have become accustomed to the instant gratification of streaming. <br/><br/>Streaming's great but you can have too much of a good thing and one can easily dismiss the amount of effort these writers put into developing the story line of this series. It wasn't until around episodes 7 and 8 where it really took off, but I saw enough potential to keep watching up to that point. <br/><br/>I wasn't only rewarded for my patience, but felt relieved that I stuck with it and horrified at the thought that I might not have done so. There are so many story arcs that really come together by the end of the first season, with a bit left hanging for a brilliant setup to season 2. If there is another season I think the show will maintain that momentum, seems like a big ""if"" though. <br/><br/>I'd be very sad but unsurprised if the series is cancelled. Not just because of it's initial slow pace, but also the socialist views it represents. One thing I will say is that it has no connection with the SJW sentiments we see today as other people have argued. It is based on the genuine struggle between working folk and big money interests, signifying the beginning of the end of the American Dream. This was around the time that government started getting cosy with big banks and the likes of the Rockefellers. This story depicts those people as well as workers who unionised and stood against that exploitation, with roles played by various fictitious characters.<br/><br/>Sure, the extent of the violence might have been ""unrealistic"", but it is extremely entertaining. It's Wild West style shooting but with upgraded weapons, set in the 1930s, therefore technologically relatable to WW2. What the show did get right, which was crucial, was its depiction of racism and the social constructs in America during that time. It's especially interesting that it takes place in the heart of the country, not too north and not too south. I'd argue that although the extent of the violence might not be totally plausible, it justifiably enhances an extremely compelling story. 10/10 and I pray to Jesus that this show gets a second season, screw Henry Ford.",24 out of 27 found this helpful.,10.0,5 March 2018
1105,Damnation," Can't wait for SERIES 2, But I hear they're not making it. Missed a trick there boys","I'm not normally given to writing reviews but I felt I must to counter the low scores, and low score mis-guided reviews.
I watched on NETFLIX so unless it was edited... well... I'm not altogether sure what these people want, someone wrote ""I was hoping for something really gritty. Dust bowl sand in your teeth gritty... ...and a little murder on the side. 
You get a lot of that.
Someone else referred to 'soft porn', there were a couple of sex scenes, fully clothed - no nipple or bare bum at any time, and just proves you don't need it. 
Someone else was bemoaning the plot having concentrated on the commies being good guys, it's a DRAMA NOT A DOCUMENTARY.
So, my advice ignore the reviews and watch it yourself.
However I would say; some of the plot is telegraphed and therefore expected, but this does not detract from the overall enjoyment.

1107,Damnation, USA's answer to Peaky Blinders,"Just finished watching this on Netflix in the UK and I am both perplexed and severely disappointed that this did not get commissioned for a 2nd series.<br/><br/>Its a classic morality play, but with two differences/enhancements. One, it contains a decent narrative surrounding the politics of the time that a more simplistic series would ignore, and two, I have seldom watched a series with such tremendous strength in depth of leads. Seriously - whatever the Director did to enable these performances should be applauded.<br/><br/>The most prevalent 7 or 8 actors all bring their A game. There is nothing to separate them. Not one moment which elevates one above the other - all simply sublime. And the dialogue they get is excellent. My biggest pet hate is shoddy dialogue. Once I've winced a few times at either unnatural dialogue, or dialogue where the viewer is treated like an idiot (yes designated survivor, I'm talking about you), you've lost me. This managed to stay riveting but doesn't cut corners or - worse - becomes self indulgent rubbish. Perfectly balanced, perfectly paced. And wonderful cinematography too by the way.<br/><br/>I haven't felt this burned since Carnivale wasn't renewed, but the second series did stray from the path a little, so I kind of get that, if not condone it. This has been cruelly snuffed out in its prime.<br/><br/>Seth and Crealy had massive potential to have been cult icons. Who knew what this was building up to!! And ref my headline comment, this had all the makings of an American equivalent to Peaky Blinders. It deals with a complicated relationship between brothers, it has its basis in historical fact, its brutal on occasion, it deals with the harshness of the day very well, the characters are essentially anti-heroes with many redeeming qualities, excellent dialogue, nail biting twists and turns, fantastic ensemble ....

I only review titles I feel strongly about and this is definitely one of them.<br/><br/>Basically, a cowboy Western cast in 30s USA Iowa with the required shoot outs, corrupt law enforcers, salt of the Earth country folk fighting for their rights and livelihoods, evil industrialists and your requisite group of evil doers...the show had a bit of everything from that genre and made it all come together in fine style.<br/><br/>They assembled a very good group of actors for this show. Logan Marshall-Green brought a ruggedness and vulnerability to his character, playing the brother of Killian Scott's character - his acting and character grow on you as the series progresses. Scott's character was destined to fail redemption and zeal, in your face by Killian. One running away from his past, trying to reinvent himself and with the past catching up to him while the other embracing that past. They were both wonderful. <br/><br/>The supporting cast were just as memorable and well acted by the likes of Christopher Heyerdahl, self interested Sheriff at the outset that does good in the end, Gabriel Mann was as slick and slimy as could be as the front man for an evil industrialist and Melinda Page Hamilton played the frightening, of one mind and yet predictable/unpredictable Connie...I will not spoil that gem of a performance for you.

They were extremely confusing, disturbing, and embarrassing. Was diagnosed a year later. I am now in my mid-20s and it's something I still have to manage daily. With all this being said, Pure does a fantastic job of portraying this mental illness and how it affects the sufferer and the people around them. When you live with this type of OCD you convince yourself that people will think of you differently if they knew the utter madness that went on in your head. It's refreshing to see a TV show that not only accurately portrays this fear (as well as all the other fears that come with it), but also does it with a mix of comedy and drama. The writers and actors pull this off without it being stereotypical. The editing and direction is also something to be admired. It's graphic at times but I think it's necessary for the depiction of Marnie's thoughts. (If nudity bothers you, reconsider watching). It honestly exceeded my expectations considering this is a very hard topic to discuss and portray with care. Glad to have found it.

1127,Pure, Bingeworthy - would recommend,"As someone who didn't even know Pure OCD and intrusive thoughts of this kind existed before watching Pure, I found it an eye opening and also really enjoyable watch. Although it's advertised as a comdey, I'd definitely say it has a good balance between comedy and drama. It's often difficult to find humour in and around mental health disorders with sensitivity, and without coming across as condescending or patronising - this doesn't appear to have been a problem for Pure's producers.
Also great editing and acting. Would definitely recommend.",19 out of 32 found this helpful.,10.0,15 February 2019

I've watched five episodes so far, but I'm on the verge of abandoning it every minute. It strays into embarrassment regularly, and I hate embarrassment. I just do not want to be around as an observer when things get embarrassing.

1157,Katy Keene, Frustrating,"Genre: Light situational drama<br/><br/>I usually like shows such as this, Bold Type, Pretty Little Liars, Gossip Girl... all members of a similar genre, a group of friends trying to make inroads into establishing careers/futures and supporting each other through tribulations.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Katy Keene has borrowed some of the worst parts of the genre from Riverdale. It is completely unrealistic. With these kinds of drama's often you need to suspend disbelief a little bit, especially with inter-personal situations. But Katy Keene turns suspending disbelief into a fairy tale, and then tries to pretend that its real.<br/><br/>Conflict emerges, often which is not a real conflict. The decisions and challenges of the characters are not believable, therefore it ruins any sense of connecting with the characters. Even if you start to feel invested in their story, a miracle promotion, opportunity that defies reality or a conversation that sparks the continuance of the plot point as subtle as a sledgehammer, awaits you the next turn. Its a world where problems are trivial or trivialized, everyone gets what they want, nobody learns anything and everyone is as dimwitted as two slices of Bologna.<br/><br/>I tried to get into it, I really did, but after half a dozen episodes it just did not hold to the standard of many other titles with similar premises that have a much better cast, better writers and a more believable narrative.<br/><br/>3/10.",11 out of 20 found this helpful.,3.0,1 April 2020

1179,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The gold standard by which action cartoons should be judged.,"Many die-hard TMNT fans will tell you that the cartoons are juvenile and overrun with corny jokes, corny plotlines, and references to pizza. They'll proclaim that the original Mirage comics are the ""true"" incarnation of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.<br/><br/>They're mostly right, but the first season of the cartoon (a 5-part miniseries, originally shown in the space of one week on syndicated TV in 1987) knocks the block off the comics and off all other action cartoons ever written.  It retains the dark, edgy feel of the comics, but contains enough humor to avoid seeming stern or self-absorbed.<br/><br/>The miniseries details the origins of the TMNT and their master, Splinter the rat--it seems Splinter was originally Hamato Yoshi, an instructor in the Foot Clan of ninjitsu in Japan, until he was double-crossed by one Oroku Saki and banished.  Yoshi then fled to New York City and lived in the sewers with the rats and four pet turtles.  One day, Yoshi found the turtles covered with a powerful mutagen which turned the turtles into humanoid turtles and Yoshi into a humanoid rat.  Knowing that they would be considered freaks by society, Yoshi trained them in ninjitsu.  Yoshi named the turtles after his favorite Renaissance painters:  Leonardo, Raphael, Michaelangelo and Donatello.<br/><br/>While skulking through the sewers, the turtles rescue April O'Neil, a TV news reporter who has run afoul of an army of street thugs while investigating a series of break-ins committed by ninjas at high-tech scientific equipment companies.  Upon meeting her saviors, April promptly faints, and the turtles take her back to their lair.  When April comes to, Splinter tells her their origins.  April, however, is unimpressed and thinks the turtles are responsible for all the break-ins she's been covering.  The turtles persuade April to hold off on any impulse reporting and let them find the crooks for her.<br/><br/>The turtles and April investigate these robberies and discover that they were perpetrated by an army of robots wearing the colors of the Foot Clan, leading Splinter to conclude that Oroku Saki is the leader of the whole operation.  Splinter gets captured by Saki's robots and taken away.  The turtles hunt down Saki in his base--a mobile underground fortress called the Technodrome--and discover that Saki, who now calls himself the Shredder, is indeed responsible for the crimes the turtles have been investigating.  Not only that, it was Saki who dropped the mutagen in the sewers, thinking it would destroy Yoshi.  Shredder makes a bid for the turtles to join him, but they refuse, and then proceed to kick the butts of his henchmen.<br/><br/>In later episodes, it is revealed that Shredder is in league with an alien warlord named Krang from dimension X, and that Krang wants to bring his troops from dimension X to conquer Earth.  The turtles manage to foil Shredder and Krang's ambitions by causing the Technodrome to suck itself into dimension X.  April is able to document the turtles' battles with Shredder and Krang and convince some of the skeptics of the turtles' heroism.<br/><br/>So, there you have it.  This is the cartoon origin of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and it's about 100 times better than the comics origin (and the movie origin, which was loosely based upon the comics).<br/><br/>The miniseries is available on laserdisc (extremely rare!) and on a collection of 3 VHS tapes titled ""Heroes in a Half Shell,"" ""Hot Rodding Teenages"" and ""The Shredder is Splintered.""  A somewhat condensed and edited version is available on the VHS tape ""The Epic Begins,"" but it's worth the extra cash to buy the 3 VHS tapes and get the full, uncut miniseries.",12 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,15 April 2002

Splinter thought them to become ninja superhero teens and also the turtles would get help from news reporter, April O'Neill. I thought James Avery did a good job at voicing the Shredder and so did Jim Cummings for the final seasons for this show. I also thought Barry Gordon did a good job at Donatello because I also liked Barry Gordon doing Razor from Swat Kats: Radical Squadron and the other voice actors were good too!

1181,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Fun Childhood Memories That Weren't As Great As I Remembered,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to kids in the late 80s-early 90s were among the most popular toy lines available, as well as one of the most popular cartoons both on syndication and CBS Saturday Morning. They were talking turtles with a rat leader, living in the sewers, using matrial arts to fight bad guys in New York City, eating pizza, cracking jokes, and hanging out with hottie April O'Neil. I mean, as kids, we loved it! Now revisiting this series, the cartoon that started in 1987 and wrapped up in 1996, I can see some significant flaws and how the show went from an action/comedy classic to over the top cheesy to more serious. <br/><br/>The show began in 1987 as a mini-series that played on syndication (mainly new FOX stations). The turtles before this were a little known cult comic book series that was VERY different from what ended up in the cartoon. In the comic, they were violent, wise cracking turtles who cussed, smoked, drank and weren't afraid to cut off heads or other body parts. It was a dark strip, similar to Batman pre and post campy era and Sin City. To make the cartoon more in line with the new toy line and appealing to children, many things were changed and liberties taken. The turtles were given colored masks to tell them apart (in the comic book they all wore red masks). Also, while still wise cracking, their personalities were toned down significantly, in particular Raphael and Michelangelo. Raphael was still ""rude"" but in a much nicer way and Michelangelo started talking in surfer lingo, popularized by many films in the mid 80s like Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Also, the turtles weren't nearly as violent, rarely using their weapons and instead of fighting humans like the comics, they fought robot foot soldiers and mutants from Dimension X. Pizza, Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang and the Technodrome were all additions to the cartoon series. <br/><br/>The cartoon did a wonderful job appealing to children and changing the attitude from the comic strip. It was funny and fun and kept viewers interested. The first season in particular did a wonderful job of keeping the action and comedy at a great balance. The turtles fought with their weapons, the animation was high quality, and the entire five episode series had an edge to it. That completely changed in the second season were the series started going downhill fast. Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, the creators of the series, were disappointed in this change. They wanted to keep the dark, edgy elements. Instead, the jokes got corny, the fighting scenes silly, the animation poor and the writing atrocious. This continued until the last two seasons, were the show tried going back in a dark direction, but it was too late by that point, as most of the fans had grown up and moved past this series.<br/><br/>Overall, as a kid I couldn't get enough of this show, but as an adult now I see how bad some of the episodes were and how far it strayed from its source of material. If you haven't read the highly underrated comic book series, I recommend it. It's like night and day to what they became by the early 90s. I'd honestly love an adult swim series that goes off the comic book that appeals to young adults and more mature audiences. While the new cartoon is doing great on Nick, us adults who grew up on these guys would more than welcome them back as a show that has more adult themes.",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,6.0,24 November 2014
1182,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, A childhood favourite that still holds up today,"I am still very fond of Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. It was a huge favourite of mine when I was little, and re-visiting it again it is still is. yes perhaps not the truest to the comics but on its own terms it is amazing. The animation is amazingly detailed, with the colours smooth and the character designs on target. The music is wonderful, the theme tune is very memorable and the incidental music compliments perfectly, while the writing is humorous, intelligent and smart and the story lines interesting and coherent. The characters are still memorable, all four turtles are immensely likable with unique personalities, Splinter is both wise and kind and April is beautiful and not vapid. I also love Shredder, he is funny and menacing and overall just a really interesting lead villain. And the voice acting from all involved is top notch especially from Barry Gordon and James Avery. In conclusion, wonderful show. On a side note the 2003 series was decent enough, but lacked the charm and heart here in this series. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,10.0,3 December 2010

It may not be as good as other 1980s animated actions shows such as THUNDERCATS, but it still is better than the other 1980s cartoons that dominated the airwaves thanks to the amazing voice talent and surprisingly good animation. The story lines were a tad lame at times, though nobody expects great storytelling from a show about turtles that live in a sewer and eat pizza.

1190,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Cowabunga! Turtle Power!,"I loved this show when I was a child! I was such a fan of it back then that I wouldn't miss one episode of it. Plus, I collected stuff from it. For example, as a kid I once bought a mug with the famous hero turtles. And there was one year when I disguised myself as one of the turtles in Carnival. Not to mention that not only I watched this in my house, but also in the house of a neighbor and friend of mine at the time.<br/><br/>This animated TV show brings me very good memories from childhood. Ah, the good old days...<br/><br/>The opening song is spectacular, absolutely unforgettable - as well as its instrumental version which plays during the final credits of each episode.<br/><br/>'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' had most ingredients necessary to capture the attention of most kids of my generation, for it was thrilling, entertaining, packed with action, adventure, darkness, classic humor and... pizza! The turtles are the heroes, they are the ones with the power to save the world from the evil Shredder's schemes and the bizarre Krang. Shredder has two helpers, Bebop and Rocksteady (hilarious names!). But they aren't really evil. They're more stupid and incompetent than evil, so they aren't a major threat for the turtles and the world.<br/><br/>A curious thing is that Shredder has always half of his face covered with an iron mask. I only saw him once without it and my opinion was that he was very Japanese-looking.<br/><br/>Although the turtles (Michelangelo, Raphael, Donatello and Leonardo) are very efficient and intelligent, sometimes they see themselves in sticky situations with the villain Shredder. But they always can count with the help of Master Splinter and reporter April O'Neil.<br/><br/>Cowabunga!",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,15 August 2007

1192,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Still one of the greatest cartoon shows ever,"I don't care that the original 1987 ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" cartoon was toned down drastically from the Mirage comics first published in 1984 by co-creators Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. As a die-hard Turtle-fan I grew up while Turtlemania was at its peak, so this cartoon was obviously a must. Sure, it's a wanton commercialization of a once-novel idea, the grit and violence now slapstick rather than graphic. The show basically follows the adventures of our four reptilian mutant heroes (Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, Michaelangelo, and their sensei Splinter) as they continue a never-ending battle with the Shredder and his Foot Clan, and finding allies/foes with aliens, travelers from Dimension X, and even other mutants. Mixing old characters (April O'Neill and Casey Jones, for example) with new and original ones (Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady), ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" succeeds in just being fun entertainment, and is still one of the greatest pieces of animation made within the last 25 years. The new animated movie certainly looks promising in returning the characters to their roots in the real nitty-gritty, even though I'm not too hot on CGI turtles.<br/><br/>10/10",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,20 January 2007
1193,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, A piece of my childhood that I can still enjoy... and that's a rarity,"I remember watching this as often as I could when I was younger. When I was 11-12 years old I would get up early enough in the morning to watch it before I left for school... but I was interested in the show from as far back as I can remember. I collected the action figures(not dolls, no; boys play with action figures... girls play with dolls) from a young age, as well as comics, and I even own two VHS tapes with two episodes each(unfortunately, these were dubbed, as most filmed entertainment geared towards kids are, in Denmark). I write this review right after having watched all four episodes in immediate succession for the first time in more years than I can say for sure. Possibly as much as a full decade. All the fun of them came right back to me even as I thought of them. Sure, the show had its flaws... there are glaring continuity errors aplenty, the dialog(packed with more or less lucky one-liners) and plot lines are often somewhat daft... but when you look at the plus side(as well as keep in mind that this is still a children's show), it's just no contest. The pacing is excellent. Having just watched an hour and a half of it, straight, I can say that I wasn't bored at all, in spite of remembering most of what would happen. The action is exciting, intense and downright cool. And the theme music(which I found myself humming in anticipation before the tape was in the VCR)... I doubt there is or will be anyone, whether kid or adult(who is at least a little in touch with their inner child), especially male, who don't like it. The plots are often simplistic, but as far as I remember, never (too) obvious and usually entertaining as well as gripping. It mostly manages to dodge the Batman-esquire/James Bond-ian cliché of having Donatello produce some gadget from his belt to solve their problems. The humor is silly and somewhat childish, but it fits its audience quite well(and I can't claim that I didn't laugh several times throughout watching the four episodes). The whole level of writing basically does, really. The fights are well-choreographed and fairly frequent. All in all, a pretty solid show, that provides many hours of check-your-brains-at-the-door entertainment. I recommend it to any fan of the four green humanoid heroes, and anyone aspiring to become such a fan. Turtle Power! 8/10",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,2 August 2006

1196,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, One of the defining cartoon shows of the 1980's.,"Today there aren't really too many outstanding cartoons around. OK I enjoyed Pokemon, and Earthworm Jim was quite cool, but Ninja Turtles rules over both of those. I'm from the UK, so we got Ninja Turtles (called ""Hero Turtles"" over here because of our pathetic censorship board) a little later than the US. That said, I can still remember how excited I was when this show first appeared: Everyone at school was talking about it. The series was based on the comic book by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. While the comics were very dark and gloomy in some parts, the series was a little more light hearted. This first series is the closest to the comic books. It has a very anime look to it, and uses quite a few different martial arts weapons (something that upset our censors a great deal). This mini series tells how the turtles were created, and also sets up who their enemy is. The fight scenes are well done, but the real fun part of this series is the dialogue between the characters. Overall this mini series is probably the best of all the turtles cartoons (I'm not even going to mention the 2003 version) and I can definitely recommend it to fans and newcomers alike. One final thing: As of now this mini series is only available on American DVD. Make sure you buy the American version, because looking at the episodes shows just how much was cut out of each episode by the UK censors.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,6 August 2005

All the contestants are shallow, conceited, desperate, mean-spirited, fame hungry losers who have no real talent or skills in life, but simply desire to be famous and earn money for participating in this trash. The contestants treat other horribly and the challenges themselves encourage nasty behaviour, meaning the show promotes bullying. All the female contestants are treated particularly poorly and abusively by their male ""love interests"", as well as being exploited and objectified sexually, which is incredibly misogynistic and sexist. This shows promotes narcissism, laziness and poor moral values among its gullible audience, in particular young people, who would rather aspire to be reality TV stars on terrible reality TV shows, rather than achieve academically or pursue professional career paths. Someone needs to finally incinerate this festering, unholy plague before this infectious virus spreads any further throughout society, with fire to reduce to smoke and ash, which is what it truly deserves.

1217,Love Island, The most lovable garbage,"I sat down to watch this with a friend for us both to laugh at the contestants for the first episode and find something more meaningful to do with our time after that. As we finished watching the first episode we both knew it was utter crap and probably a waste of time but despite knowing this we continued to the next episode, we spent 12 hours of our lives that night and subsequently every episode since then wondering why we were watching this horrific yet addictive pile of excrement. The thing with it is that the producers have realised what they are making and unlike all others of its kind have steered into it.<br/><br/>While others site us to watch X-Factor / The Voice / Britain's Got Talent and other such garbage I would honestly cancel all 3 of those shows for another season of Love Island right away. In the episode featuring 12 idiotic young adults attempting to care for plastic children I have probably laughed more times than collectively across all the ""mature comedy"" on TV nowadays.<br/><br/>The plain raw humanity of the show ridiculed by the producers is comedic and dramatic gold and I have thoroughly enjoyed my viewing. I'd advise new viewers to give the first episode a go. If they don't like it (like the vast majority of the other ""unbias"" reviewers of this program) then don't watch it.<br/><br/>Please note this is a review of Season 4 only.",23 out of 48 found this helpful.,8.0,30 July 2018

1219,Love Island," Guilty pleasure at start, then it drags","Note - this is a review of the 2020 season only.<br/><br/>So I started watching the 2020 season with my wife after seeing a SNL sketch mocking it. At the start, the show was entertaining, albeit more of a guilty pleasure. The style of as slightly unique when compared to what I know of US shows. Unlike US shows which eliminate people slowly getting down to the final contestants, this UK show eliminates people only to add more. Neat twist on it. And that definitely kept our attention, for a little while.<br/><br/>But eventually the show really begins to drag. The elimination, recoupling, etc scenes go on forever, with nothing to show for it. By the time of the big choices, most of the contestants have already let you know what they will do - so then you have a 15 minute drawn out sequence which you already know the result. Sucks, right, that is not actually the worst.<br/><br/>What ultimately turned me off was the producers focusing on a whiny, insecure contestant for three plus episodes. First, she whined about how her guy might fall for another girl. Then, she whined about how he might not come back to her. Then when he did come back with someone, she whined about how these things always happen to her. And that my friends was it for me. I quit watching. What I do know from the previews is this girl was going to be the focus of the next episode as well, so four straight episodes of her whining.<br/><br/>Grant you, there are 11+ other people on the show at this point, but the producers decide the best ""entertainment"" is focusing on her lying on a bed or a bean bag or another bed, whining and complaining. It was just awful, so awful it pretty ruined the whole show. So if what I just described seems appealing, do watch. If it doesn't, then if you do watch, quit after the first five episodes. Don't get sucked into watching because you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>I gave it three stars for the show format being unique, some of the contestants being entertaining and charming, and the narrator providing some humor. But after episode 15, I would give it 1 star, and even that is generous.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,3.0,18 June 2020

1222,"Upstairs, Downstairs"," Goosey goosey gander, wither shall I wander? Upstairs anddownstairs and in my lady's chamber...","It is a widely held belief that Upstairs Downstairs was television at its finest, and the most popular tv drama in the world. But why precisely is so good? It is almost entirely studio bound and looks like it should be just another worthy but squeaky clean period drama. This is why it is very hard to convince anyone unfamiliar with the series of why it is so special. But John Hawkesworth, the producer, believed television was electronic theatre, not second rate film, and this allows the stories to concentrate on words, emotions and intense acting. The grittiness of the series, the performances and its skill at depicting human emotions were its chief assets. Gordon Jackson's magnificent character performance as Hudson is a display of a modest, warm actor who made a character who stood for all he disliked totally loveable. David Langton's charming, liberal Richard Bellamy was a far less snobbish and severe man than his butler, but his first wife, the statuesque Lady Marjorie certainly made up for him. Simon Williams' portrayal of Lord Lucan lookalike James Bellamy showed real development over the years, the haughty, caddish son who is changed forever by the war and plays his final episode ""All The King's Horses"" nothing short of brilliantly. Lesley Anne-Down and Jacqueline Tong's introduction, the Christmas story ""Goodwill To All Men"" in many ways sums the series up, combining a devastating look at the London poor with the escapist charm of a traditional Edwardian Christmas, leading to a bittersweet conclusion offering an idyllic scene of Georgina being giving her presents as the snow falls outside, just after her grandmother's wise observation that her outing to help the needy was more out of a need for adventure than real charity. If the first season was the series finding its feet and the second was it settling down to more of the same, the third season is the oddest of them all. It reflects a period of change both in pre-war Britain and behind the scenes, as Elizabeth and Lady Marjorie were both written out at the actors' requests. This leaves the upstairs structure of the house unsettled, and the series is dark and sombre, as James' doomed marriage and Richard's bereavement make the house seem a far cry from the high society gatherings and royal dinners of the early seasons.<br/><br/>Although the fourth series, which depicts the war years so powerfully is considered the best, I would personally dispute this. Good as it is, what is most interestiung is the fifth series, as Britain's social structure is collapsing, and the full impact of the war is felt. The roarring twenties try to blot out the horrors of the trenches but leave James and many like him haunted, directionless, forgotten and despairing. The fifth series also introduces a new wife for Richard in the form of the delectable Hannah Gordon. Her interpretation of Virginia is a joy to watch; beautiful, witty and poetic. The daring storylines provide all the characters with moments to shine in, from Lady Marjorie's adultery in the excellent ""Magic Casements"" which deals unconventionally with an age-old theme, to the heartbreaking ""I Dies From Love"" which details the suicide of a kitchen maid. The sexual attitudes of the day were explored in ""A Suitable Marriage"", the bleak ""A Cry For Help"" and the astonishing ""Whom God Hath Joined."" Some of the wildest plotlines should not have worked but did, such as Hudson's hopeless affair with a parlour maid in ""Disillusion"" and Mrs Bridges' breakdown in ""Why Is Her Door Locked?"" There are really only two unsuccessful episodes of the entire sixty eight, but many masterpieces. ""The Glorious Dead"" and ""Another Year"" are devastating essays on the tragedies of the war, and ""Distant Thunder"" is a superbly claustrophobic episode, as war looms both in the household and in Europe. ""The Sudden Storm"" ends the third season with war declared, Daisy crying with the fear of what is to come while the rest of the world seems to be celebrating. The final episode, ""Wither Shall I Wander"" ended the series marvellously, with a perfect mixture of the happy and the sad. The pomp of Georgina's wedding allows a diversion from the sale of the house and the loss of James. Hudson delivers a tremendous speech to Edward on the tradition of service now dying out, and one can't help but be swept along with the fever of the episode. The final scene, as Rose is left alone in the house with the ghosts of the past echoing around her, is both a fine depictuion of the sentimentality of leaving a lifestyle behind and a cunning wallow in nostalgia. The like of Upstairs Downstairs will never be seen again. This type of television, like the England it depicted, is gone forvever.",81 out of 84 found this helpful.,,3 July 2001
1223,"Upstairs, Downstairs", The Perfect Time Machine,"Probably the best TV series ever! For someone Anglophile like me it is the perfect time machine to enter a typical household of the Victorian/Edwardian era. Although it shows an ""upper class"" household, the focus is on the ""downstairs"" personnel. The problems and stories of the kitchen maidens, footmen etc are much more colorful and sympathetic than the actions of ""her ladyship"" and Lord Bellamy upstairs. Nevertheless absolutely all characters are designed thoroughly, sympathetic and authentic. Furthermore this series shows a sort of real ""theater"" which has left TV long time ago and will never appear again! Long close-ups which show the affection of every actor, long dialogs with full sentences and - long pauses between them to enable the actors and the viewer to reflect everything. In addition the fine set design, the costumes, the ""funny stuff"" around, for example an early - hand-crafted! - vacuum-cleaner! Another extraordinary fact is the combination of fictional characters with real history: Everything finds its way into the story, the death of Queen Victoria, the Titanic Disaster, WW I, the Spanish Influenza, Wall Street and so on. A period of nearly 30 years is described, and with the last episode you are crying, just because you wish to know how everything will continue... But, that was a lack of this absolutely brilliant series: The main characters hardly age during the decades! Butler Hudson and cook Mrs. Bridges for example are already ""old people"" in the first episode, playing 1901. In the last episode - 1929 - they have not changed in any way, they even plan to ""start a new life"", running a small guest-house.

1225,"Upstairs, Downstairs", The Best Drama Ever on Television,"It wasn't a huge budget that made this series great, immensely popular, much honored, and the biggest hit in PBS history. It was the fabulous writing and the rich characterizations presented to us every week. All these people we cared about, even negatively in the case of James. And that's why even now there is a U/D web site. Interwoven were the historical events of Edwardian England stretching through World War One into the Twenties. The series reached it's peak halfway through the war with ""Women Shall Not Weep"" - a magnificent episode available on video. By the Twenties the upper class was cracking more than the lower - a theme of the series. U/D was such a hit America tried its own hand at the wealthy/servants scenario with ""Beacon Hill"" - highly touted but dismally written flop. Special credits to Jean Marsh as Rose (who never found happiness, but wouldn't have been happy anyplace but the world she was brought up in!); Marsh also was a creator of the series.

1226,"Upstairs, Downstairs"," Classy, intelligent, and engrossing Edwardian era drama","This is the best dramatic series ever produced in Britain or aired on PBS. It chronicles life at 165 Eaton Place, depicting the personal lives of the aristocratic Bellamy family above stairs and their servants below. Actual historical events are incorporated into the story, including the death of Queen Victoria, the sinking of the Titanic, World War I, the General Strike, and the Wall Street Crash. It paints a vivid portrait of the discrepancy in social status of those in service as compared with their wealthy, titled employers. Nevertheless, we see the loyalty and affection these servants frequently have to the family they serve.<br/><br/>The master of the household is Richard Bellamy, a Conservative Member of Parliament and clergyman's son who married above his station in life. He is a man of both professional and personal integrity, whose political views sometimes come into conflict with his wife's titled family, the Southwolds. His wife, Lady Marjorie, is the Earl of Southwold's daughter, an elegant and gracious lady, the very epitome of poise, who can handle any situation with admirable aplomb.<br/><br/>Their tall, dark, and handsome son and heir, Captain James Bellamy, is transformed from a haughty, aimless cad to a wounded, anguished officer devastated by war. Really, much of the series is a depiction of James's struggle to ""find himself"". The spoiled and rebellious daughter, Elizabeth, disdains the debutante life expected of her, opting instead for charitable and feminist causes, frequently setting the household into a stir. Eventually she makes an ill fated match with the poet Lawrence Kirbridge.<br/><br/>The middle class comes into play when James marries his father's stately, radiant, and dignified secretary Hazel, a kind and giving individual who is neglected and rejected by her husband in favour of his step-cousin, Georgina Worsley. Georgina is a stunning but absolutely self absorbed creature, initially engrossed with the social whirl of her own season. Her sole redeeming behaviour is her wartime nursing but alas, she follows it up with a decade of partying, cigarette holder in one hand and cocktail in the other. <br/><br/>After the untimely death of Lady Marjorie on the Titanic, the genuine chemistry at Eaton Place is between Hazel and her father-in-law Richard, who hold the fort together while James is off soldiering. Later Richard marries a Scottish widow, Virginia Hamilton, a rather willful individual I never much took to. She lacks both Lady Marjorie's grace and Hazel's earnest integrity, making an uninteresting lady of the manor when compared with her two predecessors. Once again 165 is home to children after Virginia moves in with her two young offspring, Alice and William.<br/><br/>Frequent upstairs visitors include Lady Prudence, Lady Marjorie's loyal and outspoken friend, the most overbearing creature on earth and provider of comic relief, and Sir Geoffrey Dillon, the Southwold family solicitor. I quite enjoyed the character of this harbinger of financial gloom and discrete maker of ""arrangements"" to cover up the frequent family scandals.<br/><br/>Downstairs the servants form a family unto themselves at their own kitchen table, with Mr. Hudson presiding in state at its head. Hudson is the stern Scottish butler who takes pride in the Bellamy family upstairs, manages their household efficiently, and puts the other servants in their proper place when necessary. The cook, Mrs. Bridges, is queen of her own domain, the kitchen. She can be maternal, but is generally in fine scolding fettle, always in a huff over some outrage, culinary or otherwise, and shouting at her poor scullery maid.<br/><br/>Rose, the longtime parlourmaid, is one of the real stars of the entire series. We see much of life at ""good old 165"" through her eyes. She is such a kind, hard working, and loyal soul and deserving of so much better than life in service offers. She longs for a husband and children of her own, and has her own ill fated romance with Australian sheep farmer Gregory Wilmot. There's also the blossoming romance and marriage between the vulnerable housemaid, Daisy, and her footman, Edward. During the series, we witness Edward's progress from cheeky young footman to shell shocked soldier to struggling unemployed husband to new chauffeur to butler-in-training. <br/><br/>Various other servants come and go from 165 Eaton Place, including the feisty, brazen Sarah who both causes trouble in the household and induces it upon herself; the crafty chauffeur Thomas; Lady Marjorie's aloof and snooty personal maid Roberts; the deranged footman Alfred and the smug one Frederick; the naive parlourmaid Lily; the embittered governess Miss Treadwell; the tragic Irish scullery maid Emily and her later replacement, poor dear Ruby. <br/><br/>Upstairs Downstairs depicts society galas, country house weekends, and an elegant dinner party fit literally for a king. It features five series, which can be divided into three groups based upon who is mistress of the household. Series 1-2 with Lady Marjorie involves almost a scandal an episode! Series 3-4 sees Hazel as the new mistress and casts a darker, more serious tone with her marital difficulties and all the drama of the Great War. The final Series 5 features Richard's new wife Virginia, Georgina's flapper years, and focus on James's post war wanderings. The characters do not age during the thirty or so years spanned by the series, from the latter Victorian era to the Roaring Twenties.<br/><br/>It's an absolutely magnificent series that boasts both wonderful screen writing and acting, as well as authentic period costumes and decor. It flawlessly captures a past era, contrasts graphically its titled and servant class distinctions, and involves the viewer emotionally in the fate of its characters, both those above and those below stairs.",17 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,2 April 2006
1227,"Upstairs, Downstairs", the finest thing that has ever been on television,"My wife and I are just starting the fifth and last season. Last fall we started going through all the episodes on DVD in order. We do around 3 per week. <br/><br/>I never saw the series in the 1970s, though I heard of it.

1231,"Upstairs, Downstairs"," ""What are we going to do with Uncle Arthur?""","'Upstairs, Downstairs' was the surprise television drama hit of 1971 despite originally going out late on Sunday nights with very little fanfare. The Edwardian drama was the brainchild of actresses Jean Marsh and Eileen Atkins, inspired by the immense popularity of the B.B.C.'s 'The Forsyte Saga'. Set at 165 Eaton Place, it told of the lives of the Bellamy family and their servants. Marsh played 'Rose Buck', the ever so-prim head parlour maid, with Atkins earmarked for 'Sarah a.k.a. Clemence', the cheeky Cockney girl who brings scandal and shame to the Bellamy household. When she proved unavailable, Pauline Collins ( fresh from the first series of 'The Liver Birds' ) replaced her. With all due respect to Atkins, its impossible now to think of 'Sarah' being played by anyone else. I loved the way she stood up for herself, dreamt constantly of a better life, and gave as good as she got. Gordon Jackson played the strict Scottish butler 'Angus Hudson', with Angela Baddeley as 'Mrs.Bridges', who ruled her kitchen with a rolling pin of iron. Tory M.P. 'Richard Bellamy' ( David Langton ) seemed a decent man. In addition to him, there was his elegant wife 'Lady Marjorie' ( Rachel Gurney ), their caddish son James ( Simon Williams ) and wayward daughter Elisabeth ( Nicola Pagett ). <br/><br/>When not working, the servants used to discuss what was going on upstairs, such as James' money troubles ( 'A Pair Of Exiles' ) or The King coming to dinner ( 'Guest Of Honour' ) or Miss Lizzie marrying an impotent poet ( 'For Love Of Love' ). One of the strongest episodes was 'I Dies From Love' in which Irish scullery maid Emily ( Evin Crowley ) hanged herself after being cast aside by a footman. To add insult to injury, we then found out that her body had been earmarked for medical experimentation despite her Catholic upbringing. There was no equality in those days even in death.<br/><br/>Other servants were cheeky footman 'Edward', played by Christopher Beeny, and Jenny Tomasin as dimwitted scullery maid 'Ruby'. John Alderton came aboard in the second season as chauffeur 'Thomas Watkins', a fairly straight character to begin with, but who then evolved into a devious con-artist - witness his fleecing of the Bellamy's when a blackmailer came on the scene with Lady Marjorie's love letters to Captain Hammond ( David Kernan ). Thomas and Sarah later got their own show. Poor Lady Marjorie went down on the Titanic ( funny how James Cameron never mentioned this ) at the start of Season 2. Her replacement was the tasty Meg Wynn Owen as 'Hazel Forrest', Richard's secretary. Elisabeth's successor was 'Miss Georgina Worsley' ( Lesley-Anne Down ), a vacuous deb who eventually enlisted as a nurse during The Great War. One of the great things about 'Updown' was that, as well as being top-notch drama, you got a history lesson as well. The Great War episodes were fabulous. One of the most moving scenes ever shown on television was when Edward came back from the trenches with shell-shock. Full credit should go to script-editor Alfred Shaughnessy and producer John Hawksworth, who both took all the major creative decisions. The wonderful Strauss-like theme tune was by Alexander Faris.<br/><br/>'Updown' caught on in America, despite five Season 1 episodes being omitted due to being made in black and white. The Americans attempted their own version, the unsuccessful 'Beacon Hill'.<br/><br/>After five seasons, 'Updown' ended in 1975. A lengthy repeat run then followed, and 'Guest Of Honour' was chosen as part of I.T.V.'s 'Best Of British' season in 1982. It is presently to be found on I.T.V.-3.<br/><br/>Sagitta Productions moved to the B.B.C. in 1976, where they did the equally popular 'The Duchess Of Duke Street'. 'The Two Ronnies' did an 'Updown' parody, as did Stanley Baxter ( filmed on the same sets used in the show! ), the 'Carry On' team spoofed it in two editions of 'Carry On Laughing', and it inspired Jimmy Perry &amp; David Croft's last sitcom 'You Rang Milord?'. Perhaps the most inane spin-off was 'Russell Harty Goes Upstairs, Downstairs' in which the late chat-show host was seen dropping in on the residents of Eaton Place for tea and a chat.<br/><br/>Forty years after it first appeared, 'Updown' remains compelling, powerful ( it tackled difficult subjects such as homosexuality, adultery, suicide, mental breakdown, and the aftermath of war ), sometimes humorous, always entertaining viewing. in 2010, the B.B.C. revived 'Updown' with Jean Marsh reprising her role as 'Rose' and a new family at Eaton Place. Despite it boasting superior production values, it failed to grab the imagination the way the original did, and was axed two years later. T.V. bosses would do well to take a long hard look at the original in order to learn how to do a show of this kind. It managed to pull in big audiences without insulting anyone's intelligence.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,25 August 2008

1233,"Upstairs, Downstairs", British Drama at its Best,"One of the greatest dramatic series of all time, Upstairs Downstairs (U/D) is about life at 165 Eaton Place in Belgravia, one of the wealthiest neighborhoods in London. It reflects the tensions between masters and servants, between different categories of servants, and between the existing order and those who do not fully accept it--servants who aspire to careers outside of domestic service, persons motivated by middle-class values, and the nouveau riche who respect money and power more than tradition. Both upstairs and downstairs residents are influenced by British imperialism and xenophobia.<br/><br/>The household is headed by Richard Bellamy (David Langton), the son of a clergyman, who has married Lady Marjorie, scion of the prominent Southwold family. As a political and social conservative, Richard attains high administrative offices, but, as a member of Parliament, he prefers to vote according to his conscience rather than the Southwold family's preferences. Lady Marjorie (Rachel Gurney) is imperious and aristocratic. Their son James (Simon Williams), an army officer, is plagued by such bad judgment that we generally cannot sympathize with him. His sister Elizabeth (Nicola Pagett) is idealistic and romantic, but unrealistic. Her relations with the male sex always turn out badly, until (having left U/D after Series 2) she is said to have found marital happiness in America. Following Marjorie's death, management of the household falls to James's new wife Hazel (Meg Wynn Owen), the daughter of an accountant, who is guided by different values than other members of the Bellamy family. Marjorie's niece Georgina (Lesley-Anne Down) arrives in Series 3, with a sense of idealism and adventure. After the war, Richard marries Virginia (Hannah Gordon), who provides companionship and support.<br/><br/>The downstairs staff is directed by the butler, Hudson (Gordon Jackson), who relies on discipline to preserve traditional standards, and discretion to prevent scandal, but can be sympathetic when the occasion warrants. Mrs. Bridges (Angela Baddeley), the cook, overcomes kitchen crises and follows household gossip. Rose (Jean Marsh), the head house parlor maid, later ladies maid, is devoted to the family, but occasionally expresses dissatisfaction with her ""place"" in the system. Under house parlor maid Sarah (Pauline Collins) makes up in imagination what she lacks in education; anxious to escape domestic service, she becomes a chorus girl. Chauffeur Thomas Watkins (John Alderton) is something of a con-artist, but he evidently has genuine affection for Sarah. Under house parlor maid Daisy (Jacqueline Tong) marries footman Edward (Christopher Beeny) and attempts to advance his career. At the bottom of the servants' hierarchy is the kitchen maid Ruby (Jenny Tomasin).<br/><br/>The stories deal with a wide range of subjects. Many episodes are connected to such real events as the death of Edward VII, World War I, the Silvertown munitions factory explosion, the 1926 General Strike, and the Stock Market Crash. The producers gave great attention to verisimilitude -for example, consulting with Buckingham Palace staff regarding protocol for hosting the king's visit to 165 Eaton Place.<br/><br/>Many viewers consider Series 1 (1903-1909) U/D's least successful series. It had a lower budget than subsequent series; and, due to a technicians' strike, the first half dozen episodes were filmed in black and white. Writers, directors, and actors were still trying to set the parameters for the program. As a result, this series includes several strange stories; and some characters (especially the footman Alfred), lack credibility. Some performances are too loud, too demonstrative, and poorly choreographed. Many of the stories in Series 2 (1908 - 1910) provide various perspectives on marriage; others deal with problems created by a superannuated nanny and by Elizabeth's suffrage activities. King Edward VII is a dinner guest in one episode; and this series ends with his death. Series 3 (1912 - 1914) witnesses the arrival of Hazel Forrest as Richard Bellamy's secretary, and her marriage to James Bellamy. Lady Marjorie having died on the Titanic, Hazel assumes the management of the household. She eventually overcomes downstairs resentment; but her middle-class outlook leads to clashes with Richard and James. This series ends with the outbreak of World War I. The war casts a shadow over Series 4 (1914-1918), which many consider the best. The Bellamys take in a family of Belgian refugees, James Bellamy and footman Edward join the army, other members of the household take on war-related duties; and a local baker, of German descent, becomes a victim of anti-German hysteria. The war impacts the household in various ways--the staff must dine on ersatz meat and potatoes, James comes home severely wounded, and the house is hit by a bomb. Series 5 (1919-1930) deals with life in the 1920s. Richard finds happiness with his new wife Virginia. But old values are challenged, as the younger generation engage in wild parties and other reckless behavior. As a result of the stock market crash and the Depression, both upstairs and downstairs residents must leave Eaton Place to start new lives elsewhere.<br/><br/>U/D's 68 episodes were the product of 9 writers and 8 directors—so there are some inconsistencies, and some episodes are better than others. But, overall, the performances are outstanding. By informal count, U/D was nominated for 17 Emmys and received 7, most significantly, 4 successive awards for outstanding dramatic series. It was nominated for 9 BAFTA awards and received 2; and was nominated for 4 Golden Globe Awards and received 1. It also received a Peabody Award, a Royal Television Society Award; and its theme song won the Ivor Novello Award for Best Theme From a Radio or Television Production. The program could have continued beyond five years, but the actors, writers, and directors chose to end it. Thus, there have been no further episodes of this outstanding drama.<br/><br/>Christopher Hodson, who directed 14 episodes, described U/D as ""the sort of series that doesn't come along more than once in a lifetime."" Few would disagree.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,11 October 2013
1234,"Upstairs, Downstairs", 30 years of family life at 165 Eaton Place,"I first viewed this series in the 1970's on PBS and have taken up the habit again. It is just so entertaining and classy that I can't shake my addiction to this wonderful period drama. Sadly, most of the actors have passed, only the younger ones are still alive. But that doesn't reduce the rich legacy of the whole cast. During the five seasons of this series, viewers witness the evolution of an aristocratic London family from 1901 to the early 1930's. <br/><br/>We journey with the family upstairs and their downstairs staff through many of the pivotal events of the era: the Titanic disaster, the Great War, the clash between labour and wealth, the market crash and depression. Not all the episodes are riveting but most of them kept this viewer transfixed to the screen. Lord and Lady Bellamy, performed by David Langton and Rachel Gurney, are the main characters upstairs as the series begins. Richard Bellamy is a Member of Parliament; Lady Marjorie, who comes from the landed gentry, oversees the staff with grace and a strict code of behaviour. She has her society friends and Lord Bellamy comes in touch with the leading figures of the day, from Lloyd George to Churchill. We even watch the family welcome Edward VII, the King of England, whose visit is punctuated by a servant giving birth. <br/><br/>Downstairs is dominated by the butler Angus Hudson, performed by Gordon Jackson, as an upright, no-nonsense Scot who runs the household with admirable efficiency and strict discipline. Angela Baddeley is the cook, a true perfectionist in the kitchen who tolerates no insubordination. If things go wrong, she can become unhinged until Hudson steps in to calm her down. Jean Marsh, who conceived the series with Eileen Atkins, is the head parlourmaid, Rose. Rose typifies many of the changes going on in her world and manages to be a friend and confidante to characters upstairs and down. Atkins never did appear...more the pity, but with the rest of this stellar cast, the series always sparkled anyway. <br/><br/>The cast changes as time passes and some remain to the end. Some characters with minor roles rise in prominence and more prominent ones disappear or recede. In this respect, it resembles family life in any era. The audience feels like a fly on the wall over the period as we see the intimate details of the lives of characters upstairs and down amid the changing face of British society. When the series ends, we feel the loss of the characters but with a great sense of satisfaction for knowing them and the world in which they lived.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,9.0,10 August 2012
1235,"Upstairs, Downstairs", Classic television,"I have just bought the whole 5 series on DVD and am currently watching them all, especially the first two series which i never saw on their first showing. The series has not dated and is just as powerful as when it was first shown. Pauline Collins was a revelation as the sassy housemaid. I had only ever seen her before in the strange sitcom 'No Honestly,' in which she again co starred with real life husband John Alderton. They also starred in 'Thomas and Sarah' and the environmentally aware series 'Forever Green.'",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,,28 May 2004
1236,"Upstairs, Downstairs", the finest moment in television history pinpointed,"I saw for the first time recently the episode of Upstairs Downstairs where Richard Bellamy (m'Lord) is sitting in the morning room with Hazel and he says ""as for the future: I have my doubts, but then tomorrow's a long way off"". He is in profile, and his hair is white with age, though it looks vaguely like a wig that was worn centuries before by the aristocracy. I've always thought that the key to learning history is to find the points when one way of life changes, and that moment in Upstiars Downstairs showed me how those values and characters were not part of a distant past, but very real and wonderful people. I found myself feeling so at home with the situation in 'good old 165' that I have found no other more precious moment in a film or on television that is finer. What I mean by that is the kind of moment like at the end of Hannibal where Sir Anthony Hopkins says to Julianne Moore: ""all you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror"".<br/><br/>All worth tears and smiles",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,16 July 2005
1237,"Upstairs, Downstairs", Intriguing.,"The post Victorian era in London and countryside are abound with adventure and intrigue. This series shows us the social dichotomy of those who owned homes and wealth, and those who served them. A variety of circumstances course through this show depicting an era without television, limited radio, biased newspapers, phones whose service shut off at regular hours, and other than trains and limited automobile use, horses were still the predominant mode of transportation.<br/><br/>Upstairs live the masters. Downstairs work (and live) the servants. The family are a traditional ""posh"" set with some money--more than average, though not ravishingly wealthy. Their servants are well behaved, reserved, obedient, loyal, and love the family they serve. The family themselves are respectable in nearly every way. Their code clashes with the loose morays of those outside the home, and social combatants engage in venomous and confrontational dialogue.<br/><br/>Apparently the DVD sets are going for $60+ American. Well, ""Upstairs Downstairs"" isn't Star Trek nor Aliens, but seeing the trappings, hearing the dialogue, watching the mannerisms in old PAL video (a finer definition than American NTSC), and streaming it from an authorized website like Amazon or Acorn TV is well worth the low cost. The images are crisp. Much clearer than they could be seen when first broadcast, unless you were living next to a transmission tower.<br/><br/>Another perk of this show is that the actors aren't all pretty. They are real character actors. The performances they deliver past muster with flying colors, as they deliver lines that could only have been written by someone in an authority of the period. <br/><br/>Great Britain had a closed market system empire-wide, known as the Commonwealth, and this allowed for a circulatory fiduciary economy that was insular and protected. Even so fortunes are made and crushed with the stroke of a pen. And the idle rich have their own cruel games to keep them occupied. Another theme and challenge that confront the family Belamy. <br/><br/>I watched the first episode just to see what the series was all about. I actually had seen small portions of it back when it first aired many decades ago. With a better understanding of the world I found the series very engaging for what it was. We're not just seeing a successful family, but one with principal. One founded on the values of right and wrong, and how they deal with the challenges that batter their 19th century castle door (to coin a phrase).<br/><br/>To be honest, I got a little tired of it because it's not normally the kind of TV show that I'm used to liking and watching. But, if you like your entertainment refined, then this should prove worth while.<br/><br/>Enjoy.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,,29 December 2012
1238,"Upstairs, Downstairs", Amazing television,50 years since Upstairs Downstairs first graced the small screen but it remains the best ongoing period drama ever transmitted. Superb storylines from the beginning of the century to the depression of the early 1930s with the stories getting better and better the longer the 68 episodes progressed. Gordon Jackson had the role of a lifetime as the Butler Angus Hudson. Ive never seen a finer acting performance on British television but virtually all the cast were brilliant. The only weak point and i remember this from watching it 45 + years ago was the fact that over the 30 year storyline period no one aged at all which stretched credibility a little but a minor point,1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,11 February 2021

1242,"Upstairs, Downstairs"," Finally I get to watch it on DVD quietly in my own time. Cried, laughed and cried","A friend of mine said you should watch Upstairs Downstairs I missed in 1971 living abroad. I was able to buy a full copy. <br/><br/>First off i have to say that the first series is a bit confusing as it is in black and white for 6 episodes (due to a strike at the time with the broadcasting company), and one of the main characters leave the house at the end of episode 1, and is seen again episode 2, as though nothing happened, so i had to google again to find out why. Sarah played brilliantly by Pauline Collins. This was a continuation issue as the series was sold to the USA, so it was changed slightly to accommodate continuity or something. Anyway it didn't spoil it for me, once i knew what was happening. <br/><br/>Each episode you get to meet more characters and their 'ways'. I loved Lady Marjorie, and Richard Bellamy not sure at the time about their spoilt kids. Downstairs wow I felt there was more snobbery going on down there then up them stairs. Hudson well played superbly and just like I would expect a good butler to be, Mrs Bridges I adored, and Rose. Ruby poor little ruby, who I felt so sorry for. Sarah introduced who was a bit of a larf and made everyone happy but she was a really sad person behind the mask. <br/><br/>Rose down trodden Rose who would just do everything for anyone, and made a rod for her own back, i could have shook her a few times was so happy when she found someone and fell in love finally but...... <br/><br/>I found the story lines at times quite risqué. We had a terrible suicides which made me cry, also the writer introduced a homosexuality scene, and even though this was in earlier episodes, one of the characters was very cleverly bought back and shown how even in the twenties young men were coerced to be sex slaves. <br/><br/>Then the perfect Lady Marjorie and adultery, i didn't see that one coming nor did i see her leaving the show. (I read since she told one of the actors she had made a mistake and should have stayed). <br/><br/>Elizabeth crazy bored spoilt child who tried to make amends in her life, and sadly she left the series, i was gutted, as i could feel a lot more could have been done with her character. <br/><br/>James again another spoilt brat who thought it was OK to toy with the emotions of the staff but came good when he married his fathers secretary Hazel who i adored i think she played a really good part in the series. <br/><br/>Over the series the characters started to develop and i become more embroiled in it, and the stories more interesting. I did find the first episode a bit like I was sitting on a fence, should i carry on or not, but i am glad i did, as from 2 - 5 it became one of the best i have seen. <br/><br/>I wont go into it too much, suffice to say, each character was played brilliantly, the writing was superb, the war years and the zeppelins, well i didn't realise they did bombing raids, so learnt something new <br/><br/>New characters introduced Edward who came back from the war shell shocked, he married Daisy a new housemaid, i loved their relationship. <br/><br/>Georgina the orphaned member of the family who was a tearaway but played superbly and believably by Leslie Anne-Down, had nothing to do, just parties, but came good in the war, but afterwards her subsequent behaviour was to be the end of someone. <br/><br/>I cried over James, sad though that some of the characters kept disappearing for episodes, we seemed to miss a lot of their lives etc. <br/><br/>I loved the episode in Scotland with Hudson and the keeper of the salmon naughty Hudson. <br/><br/>I did find a lot of racism in the show which was highlighted and Hudson was one of the worse for it. <br/><br/>Mrs Bridges i could have cheerfully hit when she bullied and belittled Ruby. I actually went off her character to be honest. BUT she redeemed herself over Hudson when he got sick. <br/><br/>The writer finished the series really well. I do think though we could have had a bit more of Thomas and Sarah, even if we were just given an insight into their life alongside. I did love Richards new wife, Virginia who looked remarkably like Marjorie and the two children, again who suddenly just disappeared. <br/><br/>Maybe when you see it weekly you don't notice but when you binge watch you can see all the missing people who are there one minute and gone the next. <br/><br/>I was very sad when i finally watched the last ever episode but it was written really well.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,9.0,7 September 2017
1243,"Upstairs, Downstairs", Positively Brilliant Television,"Brainchild of actress Jean Marsh, who plays the house parlor maid, Rose Buck. Gordon Jackson is remarkable as Mr. Hudson, the butler. Set in Edwardian England, much of the story is told from the servant's POV, which makes this series unique imo. The series doesn't shy away from issues of class and sexism. You get to see the changes in this period of history; the manners, fashion, and decor... from horse-drawn carriages to ""motor cars,"" from gas lights to electricity, from bells to buzzers, etc. And the events leading up to and surrounding WWI. Some people call it a ""soap opera,"" but it's so much more, really.<br/><br/>This early series eclipses the newer remake imo, and also much of the first few episodes of Downton Abbey are practically lifted whole cloth from this original series. When it began, Upstairs Downstairs was on a tight budget, and while it lacks the lavish production of Downton Abbey, it surpasses DA in substance and accuracy. I find the servants far more interesting than the bourgie or aristocracy. I love the way the meticulous labor of the servants is addressed, and how the daughter, Elizabeth rebels against the status quo and challenges social mores, albeit from her privileged position and in sometimes misguided fashion. This show is brilliant.<br/><br/>There is an episode where the rebel daughter Elizabeth bucks against conventions of society and takes great interest in the poor and working class, and in women's rights. I have seen no other series in the history of television address the suffragette movement, and the harsh prison punishments leveled against those women as this one. In fact, this series is sometimes a veritable history lesson re: crime and punishment and law circa Edwardian times in England.<br/><br/>Never seen another series that addresses the abject poverty and what was at stake for those of the servant class who were dismissed without reference from employment. Or addresses the widespread conditions of poverty for the poor and working class under an aristocracy/ monarchy/ imperialism (and can be related to today as well- the poor and working class suffering still in a world wide system that benefits the few at the expense of the many).<br/><br/>Season four is remarkable as well for it's serious depiction of WWI; not only addressing the futility of so much life lost, and for what, but also addressing xenophobia, prejudice, bigotry, and jingoism. It could seriously be a lesson for us today as the U.S. continues warring the globe over; and especially a lesson for the fomenting of hatred and bigotry against the victims of U.S. warfare, as we saw happen leading up to and during the ""Iraq War;"" many Americans ignorantly falling in line with the state-sponsored anti-Arab, anti-Muslim propaganda, while innocents abroad were being killed and bombed and displaced. In addition, the series was courageously anti-war during the Vietnam War and its ending. Even the character James Bellamy, one of the ruling elite class, is shown to have an epiphany and life-changing revelation of the extreme uselessness and destruction of imperial war. I would love to know more about other series that take this on, esp. WWI; as even the comedy Blackadder Goes Forth did so well. This series also shows how difficult life was for returning veterans.<br/><br/>Can't say enough about Gordon Jackson's performance as Hudson, the butler; he shines throughout and is probably one of the most beloved and endearing characters of the show, though there are many.<br/><br/>Absolutely of the highest caliber, this series.

1245,"Upstairs, Downstairs", The original and best of its kind.,"Today's dramas are too soapy and cinematic for my taste, but what really gets my goat is the way they try to impose 21st century morals onto past generations. Happily none of that nonsense applied to the very classy Upstairs Downstairs which follows the fortunes of the Bellamy family and their servants from about 1903-1930. UD cleverly juxtaposed the two 'families'; Richard Bellamy and Hudson were both traditionalists, Lady Marjorie and Mrs Bridges powerful matriarchs, and Elizabeth and Sarah were their rebellious offspring. Other strong characters included the caddish James Bellamy, the sensible Rose and poor, downtrodden Ruby. Cast members and events frequently came and went, but the real strength of Upstairs Downstairs was its historical accuracy and consistently excellent writing, and the show barely suffered at all when Lady Marjorie left at the start of series 3; in fact series 5 is probably my favourite, with the penultimate episode being arguably the best of the entire run. In 2010 the BBC revived Upstairs Downstairs but made all the mistakes i alluded to earlier, and it isn't a patch on the original - but then again very few tv shows are.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,10.0,1 March 2021

1247,Kuroko's Basketball," ""Super-powered"" basketball with awesome character development!","I'm a die-hard basketball fan. I've watched a lot of basketball movies (Hoosiers, Glory Road, etc.) and the one thing they all have in common that absolutely bugs me is lack of defense in games. I lost hope and thought all basketball movies/TV shows were like that.<br/><br/>But, Kuroko's Basketball surprised me! Every character and team in the show displays tenacious, realistic defense in games! The characters and teams demonstrate strategic thinking, analytical observation, emotion, and heart within their games. I loved that! Basketball is mostly a mental game, like chess, and this show does that so beautifully! Every player, every team, every game has its own style and unique challenges! Every game is different, unique, and more entertaining than the last! Any game-winning play is never predictable--you're always in suspense and never know what'll happen until the game clock runs out! I loved the humor! Character interactions and awkward situations are hilarious! This show taps into a lot of your emotions. You'll laugh, you'll get angry, you'll be heart broken, and you'll be on the edge of your seat! When I say ""super-powered basketball"", I'm referring to how unique basketball skills and abilities are dramatized to look like superpowers. And it's awesome! Plus, characters get better and better throughout the series, and it's awesome to see them develop new exciting moves or new dominating abilities.<br/><br/>The music gets better and better every season!

1259,Borgia, Better than the Showtime series,"This show is probably confusing a lot of people. Showtime just did ""The Borgias"" with Jeremy Irons, but this isn't it. It is an original production by Canal+, which appears to be like a European version of HBO.<br/><br/>Despite being made by a French company, the show is totally in English, and stars an American. What's most surprising, though, is how tame the Showtime series seems in comparison to this.<br/><br/>Despite being on ""Premium Cable"" in America, the Showtime series is very TV-14. The violence is tame, the sex is mainly suggested, and there is very little foul language. A few cuts and it could easily air on any network in the US.<br/><br/>""Borgia"", on the other hand, feels much more like HBO's groundbreaking series ""Rome"". The violence is brutal, graphic and unflinching. Sex is frequent, full frontal nudity a matter of fact. I suspect this is an authentic depiction of life in Rome around 1500.<br/><br/>Speaking of ""Rome"", the first thing I noticed, besides visual similarities, is that Anne Thomopolous is an executive producer. That name seemed very familiar, and sure enough, she was one of the producers of ""Rome"". I'd call that a good sign.<br/><br/>She's not alone in the behind the scenes talent, two other noteworthy names pop up: Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson. Levinson is a well known Hollywood director, with credits like ""Rain Man"" and ""Sleepers"". Fontana is the creator of HBO's ""OZ"", the first hour long drama produced by that company. One might argue that Fontana invented the ""R-rated premium cable TV series"" that is so popular now. He paved the way for stuff like The Wire, Rome, Dexter, and The Sopranos.<br/><br/>That's a pretty big talent line up for a European TV series. In terms of name actors, however, this show unfortunately can't compete with Showtime. They have Jeremy Irons playing Borgia, where this show has John Doman.<br/><br/>Doman is a good character actor, and his performance as the sarcastic, mean-spirited police captain in ""The Wire"" is legendary. That said, he feels very out of place in this otherwise extremely authentic looking show, mainly due to his unapologetic American accent. It's like Kevin Costner as Robin Hood, the producers apparently just decided to suspend disbelief and dump a modern American accent in the middle of the Vatican. You get used to it, but it's a little off-putting at the start.<br/><br/>The kid playing Cesare Borgia is capable, but there are times he seems to be pushing into melodrama territory, particularly any time he gets angry. The guy in the Showtime series was cool as a cucumber, yet viscous and brooding at the same time.<br/><br/>The men at least aren't up to Showtimes standards, but the women are a different story. Lucrezia and Julia Farnese are both much better in this show than Showtime's. Julia is a total sex goddess in this, someone who is used to getting her way by any means necessary. And Lucrezia is her young counterpart, inexperienced but curious. The two women both nail the parts and are totally convincing, more so than the depictions of these characters on Showtime.<br/><br/>I recognized a few other actors, most notably the actor who plays Samwell Tarly in HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" as a young Cardinal. The ""bit parts"" are played by unknown Europeans, and are usually great.<br/><br/>I won't spoil the plot, but it is basically the same as ""The Borgias"": The rise to power of a corrupt pope and his family. Of course, is it based on actual history, so spoilers are easy to come by if you want them. The main difference between the plotting of this show and the Showtime version is that this show manages to remain interesting all the time, where I felt it was somewhat of a struggle to get through the Showtime series. I just didn't care about anyone except Cesare and Rodrigo in the Showtime version, all the other characters were boring.<br/><br/>This version places lesser characters like Julia Farnese and Juan Borgia in the limelight as well, so we actually spend time with them away from the Pope. Additionally, the Showtime series concentrated on the Pope's arch enemy Della Rovre to a much greater degree, where this show seems focused on the family and their friends. I find that to be much more effective, since the enemy is now viewed through their eyes only, the audience is essentially placed on the Borgia side of the table permanently. It's like you're part of the family.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this to any fan of historical drama, with a special emphasis on HBO's ""Rome"". This is almost like an unofficial successor to it, it has the same feel of authenticity.<br/><br/>""Borgia"" is available on Netflix instant watch, and as far as I know this is currently the only way to see it in the US.",166 out of 187 found this helpful.,,21 November 2011
1260,Borgia," A very good show, clever, raw, full of life.","Is it perfect? No. The accents and some displays of over the top drama bothered me at first, but I soon forgot I was watching TV, as I was engrossed in the fascinating politics of the conclave and the presentation of the amazing Spanish family.<br/><br/>Borgia (canal +) a very good show. Ambitious, clever, dark, and yet funny, shocking and entertaining. I think it captures really well what it was like to live in these violent times without ""modernizing"" the characters. It never judges, simply exposing theirs lives and minds, so similar and yet so different from ours. I love Doman's Rodrigo as much as I hate Irons's one in The Borgias (he's more a Della Rovere). Domans portrayal is raw and full of life. Lucrecia, Juan, Vanozza, Gulia, Alessandro, Della Rovere are very well cast and nuanced and complex characters. Mark Ryder is simply incredible as Cesare Borgia,growing from a stubborn, tormented and insecure teenager to the megalomaniac and ruthless genius Machiavel wrote about. The history is very well researched, and never dumbed down to the audience. I find the costumes and the grim settings very appropriate. The show is punctuated by violent scenes which remind us how uncertain personal fortunes were, how lives were easily crushed without remorse. The nudity and the love scenes are very well filmed and feel natural.<br/><br/>I've tried watching The Borgia, but I stopped after the end of the first season. It was pretty but empty, silly (the incest obsession). Like the Kardashians but with people who happened to bear the name of Borgia (the real history is much more interesting). The characters were going nowhere :Irons a sad ghost without will, Cesare plotting his way to his sister bed with no other ambition, Lucrezia was like a annoying kitten and Juan a brainless fool.<br/><br/>Borgia is a very superior show, in my opinion.",28 out of 33 found this helpful.,9.0,17 September 2014
1261,Borgia," Flawed, but still amazing","Give it a chance! This show takes some getting used to (especially if you come after more lavish Showtime production). The first few episodes are heavy with exposition, the mishmash of accents can be jarring and the young Borgia are immature and not very likable. However, it quickly becomes obvious that this is done on purpose: after all, the brothers, Cesare and Juan, are still hot-headed teenagers eager to prove themselves while Lucrezia is just a child. During the course of two seasons, through trials and tribulations, they grow and mature, and Cesare is very believable as a flawed character with conflicting motivations, and the force to be reckoned with, just like his legend suggests. Cesare and Lucrezia not only do they look like their portraits, they are doing a terrific job bring their complex characters to life. <br/><br/>Other cast is superb, too, even Doman, who might lack Irons' expressive voice but brings commanding presence necessary for the most influential man in the Christian world. All in all, the character development is one of the best I've seen on TV (worthy of anything on HBO), even the minor characters seem like real people with their own agendas rather than just the talking heads. This show is also truer to showing life and times: St. Peter is run down, just like it was, in all the night scenes it actually looks like the world lit only by fire. <br/><br/>As far as historical accuracy goes: remember, most of the dark deeds attributed to Borgias are due to the smear campaign of their enemies. I doubt that the real Borgia were really much worse than any other noble family squabbling over Italy at the time. I think Fontana successfully combines some of the legend with the actual historical events, not without some dramatic license, as expected. There's a wealth of details that makes Showtime's show look like Dallas in period costumes. After a somewhat shaky start, it became my favorite adult historic show since Rome.",28 out of 34 found this helpful.,9.0,31 July 2013
1262,Borgia," Overall, recommendable","I read reviews complaining about the historical accuracy and actor's accents. Keep the following in mind:<br/><br/>If I wanted to watch a show based on historical facts, produced with utmost accuracy, I'd watch a documentary. Borgia has a historical base, but otherwise, it is just a dramatical account of a time period. Credit to the film crew, though; I do find the majority of the set decorations to blend very well with the storyline, giving the viewer a sense of accuracy. <br/><br/>The actor's accents: I don't have a problem with any accent. If I expected the delivery of each individual's accent based on their historical origin, in keeping with the English spoken at that time, which was also not a world language as it is today, 99% of the viewers wouldn't understand but 25% of the verbal interaction. Frankly, the differences in accents do stand out, but they are not distracting. I rather have an actor stay with his/her natural accent, than pretending to be from somewhere else, and then receiving criticism for their inaccuracies. <br/><br/>The acting abilities: Unless your name is Kevin Spacey (House of Cards) or you're some other high end Hollywood hotshot, I don't expect anyone to deliver Oscar worthy performances. Small inaccuracies are to be expected, especially given that this is a comparatively small production that works on a shoestring budget. Hollywood has deeper coffers and more A-listers. A few things do stand out, though: Doman's portrayal of Pope Alexander is well done. A man caught up in his own desire to rise above and finding the ability to do so at all cost. He is caught between being a man, while having to be a pope. Who wouldn't struggle? He does well, just as long as he doesn't have to reach too deep into the character tool chest, and draw from deep emotions. He plays the sexual deviant better than the irate villain, and the irate villain better than a person who finds his own physical limitations. (You'll get what I mean, once you see it)<br/><br/>Ryder's performance on Cesare is rather consistent. He's consistently acting well, especially when the performance comes to showing the higher-than-though attitude. He's also consistently overly dramatic when it comes to displaying deep rooted anger. Overall, I think he does well, and I'm having fun watching him move through the show.<br/><br/>The ladies are all very well played. However, with the exception of Isolda Dychauk (Lucrezia), none of the female cast has to reach too deep into the emotional side of acting. Dychauk is a pleasure to watch, though. She's coming across rather believable.<br/><br/>Sex: Being European, I do find it amusing that some of the American viewers get offended by breasts and genitalia. Newsflash, folks. It's human nature. If you don't like to see it, just don't watch the show, or turn your head. I have yet to see an overabundance of skin on this show. The moments when sexual acts were displayed was in keeping with the storyline, and never gave me the impression as if the writers thought: ""Well, we're losing momentum here, let's show some breasts..."".<br/><br/>Church/Religion: What I find most amusing, is that the Catholic Church is portrayed as corrupt, self serving, political, war mongering, sexually deviant and utterly repulsive; especially when it comes to the matter of portraying itself as pure, innocent and true. Following the books of history, one can only conclude that not much has changed over the centuries. (Side note; by denomination, I am Roman Catholic myself)<br/><br/>Overall, I find Borgia to be quite entertaining and worthy of one's time. Watch it with a grain of salt and don't take the show as a historically accurate account of the people of Rome. However, do watch the show with an underlying interest in inter-Church politics, greed and capitalistic tendencies. Then, transpose your findings onto the church(es) of today. See what your findings are...",35 out of 45 found this helpful.,10.0,12 June 2013

The actors are brilliant in bringing the characters to life..the story line follows the Borgia family. I never knew much about them until this series. they are quite an interesting group of people.If you are a history buff, I am sure you will enjoy this series.

1264,Borgia, Much better than others,"It's difficult to make straight-face judgment about such big movies, but I loved it. For someone trying to understand Machiavelli, the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Spanish Reconquista, the atrocities of conquistadors in the New World, the Xenophobia of the Italian Wars coexisting with the globalization of Politics (Avignon, Holy Roman Empire, America) and even a little of the soft underbelly of Catholic Faith, this is really good. Compared to others' sensationalism, this show is more like a loving son's explanation of a disreputable mother.. ""yes, she was what you say, but look at the choices; and how did things change?"" <br/><br/>It's also difficult to compare once immersed in one version of the Borgia story. But I thought the choice of Doman, and his accent, and all other actors well thought out. Narration by the Vatican Historian Burquardt puts it all into proper perspective, especially through the choice of Schefe's delivery. The comic is introspective and subtle and coated with the gut feeling one gets watching men executed by slow sawing in half, upside-down. Other productions seemed more careless to me, like casting the Three Stooges in an elaborate Hi-Def slapstick porno movie.<br/><br/>It's probably difficult to maintain the intensity, but there should be a season two.",33 out of 51 found this helpful.,10.0,24 December 2011
1265,Borgia, Netflix Borgia way better than Showtime version,"I definitely enjoyed Netflix version of Borgia so much better than the Showtime version. I already watched all three seasons of Netflix version and it was phenomenal as were the actors. I also found the actors more diverse, accurate and aesthetically pleasing than the Showtime version. Netflix version was more believable and historically accurate. I loved the different accents as it made the atmosphere and overall characters more realistic. I'm just starting the 2nd season of the Showtime version and it's such a different world all together from Netflix's Borgia. The Showtime version is just too Hollywood, fake and almost comical at times. I expected more of Showtime considering I love most of their shows i.e. loved The Tudors, Dexter, Weeds, Camelot and White Queen. Netflix is definitely a great competitor since they have a few pretty cool shows of their own. Sorry Showtime, have to go with the Netflix Borgia on this one. :-) Such an amazing show and cast especially Mark Ryder(Cesare), John Doman(Rodrigo Borgia) and Isolda Dychauk(Lucrezia).

1266,Borgia, This version is a Very addictive show! Much better than the Showtime one.,"I first started watching The Borgias made by Showtime; I quickly lost interest. They spent no time on the give and take negotiating and within an hour you see a very corrupt new pope already in and out of bed running around with several whores. It was kind of ridiculous the way Pope Alexander was introduced.<br/><br/>Borgia, a multi-country collaboration, starts off slower and we are introduced to a real man that is shrewd at bargaining. We watch a character arch that becomes more and more powerful, thus ruthless. The arch is shown with all the characters. This production is more engrossing, the writing is so much better.",10 out of 13 found this helpful.,9.0,22 June 2018

1268,Borgia, Good and bad.,"I just watched this first season on Netflix, and I do believe that it is at least equal to the Showtime production in most ways, with a few very notable exceptions. <br/><br/>Mind you, it's not a carbon copy; the story lines follow the same basic historical themes, but the two shows choose somewhat different avenues to explore, which is interesting. This show does seem to hew closer to historical truth (although at times it's more simplistic), but also falls short in a few places. <br/><br/>First off, the choice of John Doman as Rodrigo Borgia was a bad one. He's not a bad actor, but the part was clearly not written for him. When you have an entire cast that share appropriate period/regional accents, it becomes jarring and downright bizarre to hear the lead character speak in unvarnished American tones. <br/><br/>Further, the writing does nothing to accommodate for this. See, most Americans can't pull off long lines of casual conversational dialog that include full proper English like 'will not' or 'does not', as the British can. Instead we rely on contractions like 'won't' or 'doesn't' unless we're giving particular emphasis to the subject (or giving a speech). Its an adaptive peculiarity to be sure, but one which we employ for good reason; it just sounds odd otherwise. <br/><br/>The writers completely failed to account for this reality, and instead wrote Doman's lines as though they were to be read by a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. The result is dialog which comes out unbelievably clunky and difficult to listen to. Every time Doman opened his mouth, it pulled me right out of the show. It was clear that he just didn't know how to deliver these lines. Bad bad bad, and in a show with such high overall production values, it should never have been allowed to remain so.<br/><br/>The other issue is that this show clearly didn't have to same budget as its Showtime counterpart, and that comes through in the quality of some of the CGI as well as the smallness of some of the sets. It just doesn't feel as grand. <br/><br/>It's worth watching to be sure, but it could have been much better with a few very minor changes.",65 out of 115 found this helpful.,6.0,14 October 2011
1269,Borgia, Excellent Historical Saga!!,"I stumbled upon this show on Netflix thinking is was going to see the version with Jeremy Irons. But I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw!! This is the most exciting show of the historical Borgia family. The drama continues to rise on each episode that makes the viewer want more and more. It delivers power house performances by Mark Ryder as Caesare Borgia and John Doman as Rodrigo Borgia. The supporting cast is outstanding as well as the locations of each story line. I personally think that this version of the Borgia story is better than Showtime's version. This is more historically accurate. It draws you in to where you can't wait to see what happens next. It truly is a work of art. Although there are a variety of accents of each character, the overall show is truly thrilling to watch. You must watch ""Borgia""!!!",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,5 June 2014
1270,Borgia, BORGIA rings true,"If you are hesitating between watching Tom Fontana's BORGIA and Showtime's The Borgias you find your answer right there in the different titles. It is interesting how two different titles can be so well fitted to the actual quality of the show. The shows are very different in how story is developed and in how characters are portrayed. Showtime's The Borgias is to be honest a bit of a polished turd as the title of the show would suggest. It lacks depth and relies on big names with British accents (apparently British accents are important...) to cater to an American audience. It feels a bit like if they tried to just move the Tudors to Rome which makes the show feels British and fabricated. In contrast BORGIA seems very true in how it conveys the story. Much like the series ROME the show builds a world which is believable to the audience and does not seem manufactured as it does in The Borgias.<br/><br/>When it come to characters and performance BORGIA is wildly superior on all fronts. Although it does not have the best known cast the performances are absolutely great and there is incredible depth to each character on the show. Almost no character on BORGIA is sympathetic yet we sympathize with them. The characters on BORGIA seem true: Rodrigo Borgia, Lucrezia, Cesare, della Rovere, Farnese are all more interesting, more compelling, less polished and less sympathetic then their counterparts on The Borgias. Some criticism that could be directed to BORGIA and where The Borgias is superior is for example special effects and other production issues. I do think that BORGIA does a better job in terms of style and wardrobe but sometimes the scenery can look a bit cheap which is due to a smaller budget. <br/><br/>Overall BORGIA is a far superior show. The ratings on IMDb are misleading because The Borgias has a larger more active audience on this site and will therefore score higher but there is a reason why The Borgias has been canceled and BORGIA is still going strong. If you want to watch a show which is in par with shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Rome, The Walking Dead or even the Tudors watch BORGIA by Tom Fontana not The Borgias.",20 out of 32 found this helpful.,10.0,30 October 2013
1271,Borgia, Much better than Showtime,"Jeremy Irons has the talent and the voice, but he is not Alexander VI. He doesn't look like Rodrigo Borja.- Showtime has success in the suntous technical aspects, the Jordan direction, and a great Cesar Borgia by Francois Arnaud.-<br/><br/>This one has a much better script, more historically accurate (even there some huge historical mistakes) and better actors in the supporting roles.-<br/><br/>Specially great are the ladies Vanossa, Julia and Lucrezia<br/><br/>I love all the intrigues between the cardinals, and the roman families.- People complain about the languages. but real life Rodrigo Borgia probably sound exactly like Pope Francis, speaking an intelligible Italian.<br/><br/>Any way all the actors looks much more the historical figures, than in the show time miniseries.

1272,Borgia, Will it be available on DVD?,"Just curious when/if it will be available on DVD? I've watched it on Netflix and it's outstanding, well worth watching for sheer opulence and historicity. Its definitely shockingly honest about the corruption of the Papacy and the nepotism of the period, and the characters are very colorfully showcased, particularly the character of Cesare, who seems more a troubled, tormented soul than all the other characters. Lots of nudity and frank/honest sexuality. I've searched on amazon to see if its available but I cant seem to find it. The panoramic views of Rome and its environs are also lushly depicted.

1273,Borgia, Well made,"Feels like a cousin to the shows Rome and that Blood and Sand gladiator series. Historical drama with an extra helping of violence and sex!<br/><br/>Like others I was a bit dismayed at hearing a NY accent surrounded by European accents by all other characters. However, after 2 episodes I didn't even notice. The role of Rodrigo was not a perfect casting, but not far off the mark.<br/><br/>It plays as a man between the cloth, love, ambition, and inadequacy. This is not the tragic Shakespearean archetype, but more of an Everyman struggling with life and politics in his 50s. He wants to do good, but got to where he is by doing whatever he could - good or bad. The occasional screams or fist pumps work well to illustrate the point, in my opinion.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast were fine with a beautiful Lolitaesque Lucrecia being a highlight. I would have proffered a more Latin looking Cesare but the actor was not horrible all said and done. <br/><br/>Lastly for fans of Assassins Creed video game, it's amazing to see Rome look remarkably close to the game.

1274,Borgia, Engrossing,"A lot of people criticize John Doman's American accent. After the first episode, you get used to it, and actually Doman is perfect for the part of a scheming, unpredictable pope: what better than an American to play the wheeler-dealer? I love Doman's bold portrayal, and his subtle facial expressions invest Rodrigo with a latent power, explosive and surprising when it surfaces.<br/><br/>Also, the sets, costumes, cinematography are all magnificent! I had to pause the video sometimes just to take in some of the gorgeous shots of the Castel St Angelo or the Coliseo at sunset.<br/><br/>The reason this series works is that it is appropriately GRIM, and spares no expense to make things look realistic, and the writing moves things along and is clever. The actors are all superb. Juan is as detestable as he is charming; Mark Ryder Cesare shows his pain, want, ambition, pride and recklessness well. When his eyes got big after Alexander promoted Juan to captain of the Palace Guard, I knew this was a quality production. Lucrezia, Giulia, Vannozza are all amazing. Cardinals Sforza, Farnese and della Rovere are standouts.<br/><br/>Give this series a chance if you like historical dramas.

1276,Borgia, The visual equivalent of a page-turner,"For a TV series, this is an excellent one. I agree with the reviewers who say that it is reminiscent of Rome. There is much more passion than in the Showtime series Borgias. The female characters are stunning. The interpretation of Lucrezia is exceptional as the actress shows all the naivety and emotion of the girl's young age but also her growing awareness of her power. The actress who played Julia was also stellar. If there is any criticism, I just wish that the writers had focused more on the women and the relationships, as this is where the show shines. I thought that Donan plays well as Rodrigo. Much better than Jeremy Irons because Irons was just plain creepy. Donan has an aura that makes it more plausible that people would agree to support him (and that so many women would fall in love with him). The depictions of Juan and Chesare are weaker. I thought that reflected more on the writing than on the actors. Jaun's appearance kind of bugged me, as I kept thinking of him as a modern Frat boy. The actor who played Chesare, if his colouring was darker, looked exactly like the famous painting of the real one! I disagree with the reviewer who quibbled about the CGI backgrounds. I thought the painting- like effect was an effective nod to the artists of the time. I found myself getting confused by all the politics but that's okay. Its a good excuse to watch it again! On a final note. It was great to see John Bradley again! I hope he gets more screen time in his next TV series or movie.

1277,Borgia, Among the best period dramas,"I started watching it with zero expectations, at first I found it gloomy and dragged but in the end of the first season I found myself absolutely stuck to the screen.<br/><br/>English is not my first language, I saw the dubbed version, so the problem of accents (that's why English-speakers write that the drama is badly directed or badly acted) doesn't disturb me. If you are irritated by the accents you'd learn that the real Renaissance Rome had a mix of various Italian dialects and all Europe's accents.<br/><br/>I think that the first 3 or 4 episodes are slow, cause it is only the introduction into the whole great story with many subplots. But then the pace grows and the next episodes are quite suspenseful. Second season with its Italian locations looks more beautiful and expensive then the first one (which was shoot in the Czech Republic instead of Italy).<br/><br/>Like many other historic shows it is a fusion of real facts and fiction but a very clever fusion. Tom Fontana (unlike of most of scriptwriters) really read everything on the Borgia topic, he doesn't oversimplify the politics and doesn't import all the 21st century interpretations into the medieval world.
But the issue is not only that this drama is quite historically accurate (where Rodrigo is an experienced and capable politician, Cesare is full of political ambition and cruel, Lucrezia is known as the virtuous duchess and patroness of art etc.). I like that the characters look like real developing people, multi-layered and believable, neither white nor black but in fact grey. Many twists are unexpected, even for those who is aware of the Renaissance history, no one plotline is forgotten in the end.<br/><br/>Well, if you a shipper, want an incest story with luxurious costumes and if you hate politics - this show is not for you, try other Borgia show.
This one demands some knowledge of history or at least attention to the plot when watching. But if you want a period drama with clever and enthralling story, give it a chance.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,10.0,6 November 2018
1278,Borgia, Oldie but goodie,"If you just happen to be stumbling upon one of the two 2011 ""Borgia"" series, as I did recently, you may find it interesting to view each of them---if you like one, you probably will want to check out the other. The other reviews herein are pretty helpful in hashing out the differences. My take: the Showtime version has a more believable lead in Jeremy Irons---- with all due respect, John Darman's American accent in the middle of all those European types, in the Canal version, is pretty distracting. Of course, in that version you also have brothers Juan and Cesare with two different accents. Ah, well....I'm nitpicking. Overall, as sumptuous and entertaining as Showtime's 'The Borgias' is, 'Borgia' does concentrate more on story. But either one will drive home an inescapable truth: the realistic expose of life behind Vatican walls. The most powerful organizations of Christendom---despite their pious showiness---- have been mired in greed, immorality, power-play, and paganism ever since they broke away from the simple truths of the first-century followers of Christ.....interestingly, just as was prophesied in the Scriptures.

1279,Borgia, Make your own comparison - worth watching,"Honestly, I'm looking forward to a Season 3. Like many others wrote, Doman's American accent really stuck out and seemed out of place. But I watched the The Borgia with Irons (I adore Irons and watch everything he is in) as he delivers lines as I should expect, but Irons portrayal seems so small in comparison to Doman and I think the right choice was to make Rodrigo Borgia a larger than life figure. He just seems so raw and rash and loud and the events just made me feel Doman was a better choice. All the actors get better as the series goes forward. I think by concentrating less on certain actors abilities, you just begin to feel your way through this series and the circumstances that befall the characters. They appear to be the ""outsiders"" fighting for and defending their place in the world, ruthlessly.<br/><br/>The Borgias with Irons wasn't bad, but I found myself slightly bored with it.

1280,Borgia, Poor cousin of the Showtime series,"Since watching the first episode of this show, I have been searching the web to see what people thought of this and was really surprised to find out that a lot of people thought this show to be better than ""The Borgias"" on Showtime. The main points in favor of Fontana's version seemed to be historical accuracy and the ""European vibe"". As far as the second argument, being European myself, I am not impressed with the ""vibe"" that consists mainly of full frontal nudity. I don't see why a sex scene can't be tastefully made and leave something to the imagination. I really don't need to see the genitals to know that people are having sex in a particular scene. As for the historical accuracy, having read a lot about the Borgia family, I see inconsistencies in both show, but one must remember that it is television and not a documentary. The Showtime series might take more liberties with history for the entertainment value, but it makes for more interesting story lines. What I can't forgive Fontana's version is the fact that the show would not invest money in props and costumes. These were supposed to be the richest people of their times, and yet Lucrezia seems to own two dresses and one set of jewelery, and the same goes with Giulia Farnese. Both women should be covered with jewels from head to toe, should wear elaborate gowns and have complicated hairdos (especially Lucrezia, who was very vain about her hair). Also, very often the set consists of white walls, a table and some chairs. Where the hell are frescoes, tapestries and golden and silver plates? For me these count as huge historical inconsistencies. The show has a small budget and is is obvious in almost every scene, whereas Showtime version had some of the most beautiful, lush sets, props and costumes in the history of television. Also, the matter of accents is a huge problem, but it was mentioned in all other reviews so I will not elaborate on this topic, and will only say that I agree that having members of the same family speak with six different accents is a ridiculous idea. As for the acting...The pope sounds like an American gangster, and John Doman is terrible in this role. There is nothing similar to the perfectly executed Rodrigo- Cesare power-play from Showtime's show. Juan Borgia looks as if they picked him up at the local gym and sticks out in the Reinessance Italy almost as much as his American dad. And Lucrezia is simply terrible. She is a far cry from Holliday Granger's spectacular performance, has no chemistry with her father and brother (truly, if they really had had that little chemistry the rumors about incest would have never been coined). And her terrible German accent ruins every line of dialogue she has. The only redeeming quality this show has is Mark Ryder as Cesare Borgia. Although I am a fan of Francois Arnaud's Cesare, I must admit that Mark Ryder does a great job. His Cesare is much more frightening and crazy, and sometimes even bipolar, which is probably historically more accurate. Especially in the second season, he really shines in this show. All in all, ""Borgia"" lacks all the features that made ""The Borgias"" so good: lavish costumes and sets, powerful Rodrigo-Cesare and Cesare- Lucrezia chemistry, and consistency in acting (and accents!). It is not a bad show, but it definitely looks like the Showtime's series' poor cousin. And if this is supposed to be the ""European vibe"", then I vote to go all Hollywood instead.",15 out of 33 found this helpful.,3.0,16 August 2014
1281,Borgia, Shockingly awful,"I know the Borgia-story, and both this series as well as the Showtime one, definitely take their liberties when it comes to historical facts. That is something I expect and I'm not watching shows like these to get enlightened. For that we have books. However. This particular show is a grand disappointment. I'll not be wasting time describing the bad acting, silly dialog and slow progression. Instead I'll recommend the Showtime series! Jeremy Irons is brilliant as the Borgia Pope, the script is brilliant, the actors are both much better at acting and generally more beautiful to look at.<br/><br/>I've read a few of the reviews here, and I'm surprised at how many prefers this c**p over Showtime's. I'm pretty sure those who prefers Borgia over The Borgias does that because the former is so simple, and easy to watch, while the latter actually moves you!",9 out of 18 found this helpful.,4.0,26 April 2015
1282,Borgia, Accents Galore,"As an Italian American with deep roots still tied to Rome, I find this show a disgrace to the history of the holy city.<br/><br/>Where to begin? First of all, pick an accent and stick with it. Lucrezia has a German accent, Juan is French, Cesare is British and Rodrigo is American? Are you kidding me? This is absurd. I would rather listen to an actor attempt a terrible imitation of a historically accurate accent than just sound like an idiot.<br/><br/>I understand that Showtime's version of the Borgias has a much larger budget with the ability to hire more profound talent, but I think the budget has nothing to do with this mess of a show. Jeremy Irons is a legend and does not simply do a good job portraying Rodrigo Borgia, but he becomes the man in the flesh. John Doman reads lines meant for a much more elegant tongue than his American accent allows. It's cringe-worthy at best to have to suffer through one of his monologues.<br/><br/>Mark Ryder makes it difficult to like Cesare (though maybe Cesare is not meant to be 'liked'). However, on Showtime's version Francois Arnold makes the audience both hate, pity and love Cesare all at once - a feat Mark Ryder could never accomplish. Stanley Weber lacks the ability to portray Juan as a wild, hotheaded coward as history tells. His character simply fades into the background like a wallflower. I would also have to go as far as to say Marta Gastini's portrayal as Guilia Farnese is the only actor that lives up to their character.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the historical inaccuracy of the show. If you think showing full frontal public nudity and gore makes this more historically accurate then you need to watch Showtime's The Borgias - then you will see what truly should make a show accurate.<br/><br/>In summation, if you want to watch a great period drama series about medieval corruption in the papacy just watch Showtime's The Borgias. You will only be disappointed watching Borgia.",17 out of 40 found this helpful.,3.0,31 March 2013

Rodrigo had a harsh American accent that made me feel like i was waiting for a push by Smucker's jam to buy their product. his two sons, Cesare and Juan had two totally different accents as well as his daughter Lucretia and her mother. with one person speaking in a harsh American tone, another in an almost french accent, and then another sounding Spanish and another being an almost olde English, i honestly couldn't focus on the story or what was going on because everything seemed so... wrong.",19 out of 46 found this helpful.,2.0,2 November 2012

Not that I'm learning anything from it, mind you, but other people very well might.<br/><br/>The simple premise is that our two hosts, Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage, recreate the conditions of popular myths to verify or, as is more often the case, bust them. Of course, a premise alone does not a good show make. The fun comes from watching Jamie and Adam gleefully trounce the sometimes ridiculous stories. Adam is the energetic and outgoing one, taking every opportunity to goof off and make the work look more like play, whereas Jamie reacts to things with a much drier sense of humor and is somewhat more sarcastic. I was as disappointed as anyone upon learning of the inclusion of three ""Jr. Mythbusters"" for the second season, but my concern was ill-founded, as I realized that they had just as much personality as Jamie and Adam, and my conclusion is that anyone who thinks the show has gone downhill as a result of the new additions is simply averse to any change whatsoever. The show remains a favorite.<br/><br/>On a side note, you really have to admire how smart these guys are.

They do a great job in making the whole thing crazy and funny. You feel like you get to know them. That is a good thing as it then gets more personal. The show is well directed and well written. The cinematography I think is cool. You see booms and cameras in the picture all the time, but that gives credibility to the show. It gives the impression that they're focusing at documenting the experiments and not on the look of the show. I like that kind of ""rough"" and incidental look of the show. When I say it's well written I mean well written. It's not coincidence where they go to get the stuff they need and so on, but they made it seem like it is. It's things like this that gives this show a nice down to earth feel. The fact that the two host obviously have a lot of fun when putting the myths to the test also reflect on the show and it makes you interested and makes you pay attention. If you start watching time flies. They also does a good job in letting us know what the experts think of the myth.

The hosts and Adam &amp; Jamie, together, they have had lot's of experience working with special effects. Adam &amp; Jamie take a myth, that maybe some people have heard of, and some people haven't, and they actually put it to the test, to see if it's a possibility that the myth could work. Sometimes they do, and sometimes the myths are busted, hence the name, ""MythBusters"".<br/><br/>Along with Jamie &amp; Adam there's Buster, Buster is a crash-test dummy, who helps them along the way, cause let's face it, some of the stunts they do, aren't exactly safe. Also in the crew are 3 Jr. ""MythBusters"" and they do try to put smaller less harmful myths to the test.<br/><br/>So, that's basically the whole concept of the show, except, when a myth is busted, they try and do things just to see what could make the myth work, and usually that's where the fun part is.<br/><br/>So, if you like seeing people testing things to there limits and beyond, watch the ""MythBusters"" it's a great show, with a great cast, and lot's of action.",46 out of 56 found this helpful.,,12 December 2005

Watching them blow stuff up is good, as it feeds the pyromaniac that all people have. Hopefully the first season will come out on dvd soon. My only question is : What else have these two done? Their bios on IMdB are woefully uninlightening. I did not know that Jamie and his workshop, M5, were behind that cool Nike remote control car. I was floored when I found out. I see nothing but good thing from this show in the future. I wonder what they do with all the myths that they construct to use on the show? Hopefully. they keep them somewere in Jamie's shop. Will we see a Mythbusters exibit in the future? Stay tuned...",41 out of 50 found this helpful.,,18 February 2004
1292,MythBusters, The best show out there,"It's ironic that ""Mythbusters""- a show hosted by two (pyromaniac?) guys who look like my uncle Gordon that attempt to prove myths of all strifes false- is the best show out there, trumping all the sitcoms, dramas, news-hours, sports programs and ""car"" shows out there. Why? Well, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman have figured out how to entertain, and they've got it down to a science.<br/><br/>Hyneman is the more reserved of the two hosts, and also the most memorable, with his penchant for cleanliness and his neat beret. He's usually the one who figures out the basics of a myth and possible ways to ""bust"" it. Savage is the younger, louder and more energetic one of the two. He usually comes up with the ""rigs"" used to test the myths. Both are intensely crazy and cool, and are the kind of guys that I look up to, even if they are obsessed with explosions.<br/><br/>Supporting these two wackjobs are a team of nutties that I happen to like very much, collectively called the ""Build Team"". The two that have stuck around are Kari Byron, a beautiful, enigmatic woman who fits the show well; and Tory Belleci, who I don't like very much, as he's a bit of a camera hog, and tends to play the idiot. Two others left just before the second season ended: Scottie Chapman, who is easily the best of the builders, as she is very intelligent, works well with the others, and is the embodiment of cool. Christine Chamberlain is not a personal favorite of mine, as she seems too serious to be around the rest of these guys and doesn't share everyone else's sense of fun and humor. Coming in at the end of the second season is Grant Imahara, who, while not the best builder, could well be the definitive cast member: a smart, humorous guy who is slightly nerdy and is an electronics expert.<br/><br/>All in all, this nutso gang attempt to ""bust"" myths of all sorts, from Civil War legends to modern high-tech tales. Not once have their attempts to try out a myth seem contrived, calculated or (most of all) deadly serious. And yet, they manage to deliver educational material along with their terrific sense of fun. Everybody could like this show, from teachers to scientists, from little kids to their hard-nosed parents. I wholeheartedly recommend this show. It, for me, is the benchmark against which all nonfiction shows are measured, and is the second best show of all time.",47 out of 59 found this helpful.,,29 October 2005

1294,MythBusters," Started out great, went downhill recently","This used to be one of my most favorite TV shows ever. It was the first show I looked up on IMDb so I could rate it a 10. It has never been entirely rigorously scientific, but that would have been too boring anyway. In the first seasons they managed to strike a great balance between sensation and scientific validity. Initially each episode spent quite a bit of time showing how Jamie and Adam constructed their experiments, which made it quite educational.<br/><br/>Then it gradually went downhill. The attention for how the experiments were built, was gradually reduced with every new season. Until 2013 however it never reached a level where the show was reduced to all style and no substance. Then however, episodes started popping up that were obviously intended to promote some other Discovery show. This only got worse with the 2014 season which started with a Star Wars special that gave a forced impression like ""someone paid us to spend an entire episode on this franchise that has no ground in reality at all"".<br/><br/>Then came the live Twitter pop-ups, which I find horribly annoying. Every thirty-something seconds there is this moving rectangle in the corner of the screen that grows to cover a substantial area of the image. I do not care at all about the text inside it. Having comments from random viewers shoved in my face is like watching YouTube and being forced to read the inane comments below the video. Ignoring these pop-ups is nearly impossible due to the attention-grabbing animation and the simple fact that they cover essential parts of the image. Please, please stop superimposing this junk on the broadcast. TV is not interactive and I like it that way, so do not pretend it is by feeding us these obviously heavily moderated tweets. Anyone who badly wants to read live tweets can see them on any other device they like.<br/><br/>My dwindling respect for this show got another hit when I stumbled upon a report of some episodes being unauthorized re-makes of copyrighted material, like the ""airplane boarding"" episode which never aired in the USA because the lawsuit is still ongoing. I still have respect for Jamie and Adam because I tend to believe they just go with what their producers hand them, and most of all, because of all the years of televised enjoyment they offered me.

So that is somewhat the educational part, but more so is that the are busting myths that are actually heard of. Like whether walking or running is better in the rain. So, basically, this is stuff that you could use in everyday life. But my favorite part of the shows is the massive projects that they do.

It's those two polar opposites that makes this fun to watch. Jamie is a proponent of the former while Adam is a lover of the latter. Among my favorite bits: duck's quacks do echo, just at a frequency that humans can't hear, ping pong balls can bring up a small boat from the bottom of the water, and almost every cool thing from a movie is impossible.

Occasionally the pacing was off, so that you got to the finale without a lot of time to fully appreciate the event but whatever. Hyneman and Savage are effective if somewhat different personalities with some fun interplay, in retrospect the inclusion of B Team members Imahara, Belleci and a very attractive Byron probably extended the life of the series for several years and gave a needed break from the two leads.

Deep down, these guys really are buddies, but the humor mixed in with the science actually makes the show work. Adam sometimes gets too cartoony and Jamie a bit stodgy, but when they bounce off each other and an experiment goes right, or even funnier goes wrong, it's interesting as they scratch their heads and try to figure out why gasoline won't erupt into flames or their washing machine won't explode. Rounding out the cast is folklorist Heather Joseph-Witman giving the facts or history of the myths, Tory the builder and comic straight man and Kari the redheaded sexpot, a very talented artist in her own right. Of course, the true star is Buster the resident victim. A sort of human-sized articulated mannequin dummy, he's been blown up, set on fire, dropped from the sky and in an elevator and the mute witness to things blowing up in his face. I imagine this series will stay available as long as they can find myths that can be tested scientifically, or at least be able to blow up.

Even a tough name!), a stunt man who moonlights as a bounty hunter.  <br/><br/>His partner is nephew Howie Munson (Doug Barr), a guy who is a semi-genius (having been in countless colleges) and fancies himself a stunt man also, in spite of the fact that he ends up getting the worst of the situation usually.<br/><br/>And then there's Jody Banks (the blossom of womanhood herself - Heather Thomas), who was as rough and tough as they come, but looked a HECK of a lot better in swim-wear than her fellow stunt men!<br/><br/>Every week they were bringing felons back to justice, saving towns from outlaw bikers, fighting against evil UFOs, finding themselves surrounded by beautiful women and, every once in a while, big name guest stars (Buddy Hackett, William Conrad, Barry Newman, Richard Burton (!!!), Shecky Greene) - even Roy Rogers came by for two shows!  What talent!<br/><br/>No wonder it stayed on the air as long as it did; it had everything a male chauvinist pig could want in a TV show.  Even, for a few seasons, Markie Post (and if you've never seen Markie in a bikini, you HAVE to watch this show!!).  <br/><br/>It lives on in syndication and, naturally, finds new generations of fans every time it's on.  So, join the legion of fans who forever cheer, ""Viva la ""Fall Guy!"" - you won't be alone.<br/><br/>Ten stars and a set of gold-plated elbow pads for ""The Fall Guy"" - and let's hear it for that Fall GIRL!",39 out of 44 found this helpful.,,4 July 2000
1310,The Fall Guy," He's the unknown stuntman, that makes Eastwood look so Fine","Lee Majors could have been a burned out 70s star during the 80s much like Burt Reynolds and John Travolta, but the former Six Million Dollar Man resurrected his career yet again with ""The Fall Guy"". Majors played Colt Seavers, a working class Hollywood stuntman who moonlights as a bounty hunter. You gotta love a TV show that was brave enough to have it's star walk around with a name like ""Colt"". The Fall Guy was full of manly macho bravado, right from the iconic opening lyrics, where Colt gets into full country cowboy mode and laments his status as a Hollywood stuntman. Even though that song is clearly grounded in the late 1970s, with it's references to women such as Sally Field, Cheryl Tiegs, Bo and of course Farrah, it continues to play effortlessly well across the decade. You understand the plight of Colt Seavers. He does all the dirty work for guys like Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford (more 70s stars), but he never gets the girl. It always felt right that Lee Majors would sing about celebrities from the 1970s anyway, even in an 80s TV show. Nobody questioned it, it was like oh wait it's Lee Majors singing, well of course he would be singing about Farrah, Bo and Clint Eastwood in 1984. <br/><br/>This isn't the best written TV show, but for a Glen Larson show it sure is. The concept of Hollywood mixing in with bad guys is a hit out of the park. The creators can always give the audience that extra double wink with what they're doing, after all Colt Seavers is a Hollywood stuntman. It's mind bogglingly enticing to wonder what Stephen J. Cannell (a far better writer who was an 80s TV tycoon that specialized in action-humor) could have done with this show. I'll admit nostalgia plays a huge part in my fondness for The Fall Guy. I can actually remember when this show first aired back in the early 80s. I was 6 years old, and this series was sure bet for Wednesday nights. It even had it's own set of Colt Seavers action figures and toy pick truck modeled after the one Lee Major's used on the show, so you knew this show marketed itself at children as well as adults.<br/><br/>There's something so magical about '80s TV, that even silly TV shows like The Fall Guy can",23 out of 25 found this helpful.,,11 June 2007
1311,The Fall Guy, Trivia: The creation of The Fall Guy - How and why it came about.,"Some time back I was visiting David Sommerville, lead singer for the 50's doo-wop band The Diamonds ('Little Darlin'/'Why Do Fools Fall In Love') who was at the time, living in David (Kung Foo) Carradine's shack (literally) above Mulholland Drive in the Hollywood Hills. Looking around I joked with him that he must have stolen the idea for the outdoor bathtub from the opening credits of 'The Fall Guy' where Lee Majors is seen soaking with a stogy clenched firmly in his teeth. I was informed it was quite the opposite - <br/><br/>David was hired to do the music for a couple of TV specials chronicling the life of stuntmen by his friend and fellow composer; television producer Glen A. Larson. Shortly after, David began writing in anticipation of another installment of the series which never saw the light of day. While vacationing at Glen's place in Hawaii, he'd discovered the unused sheet music buried in his guitar case and as he began playing he caught Glen's attention. Wheels spinning, he changed the original name in the opening verse to Farah; ""Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell but I've been seen with Farah"", and picked up the phone - <br/><br/>As fate would have it, the 'The Six Million Dollar Man' had just been canceled so, with Majors on the other end they sang him the (soon to be theme) song; 'The Unknown Stuntman' and the television series 'The Fall Guy' was born. Now, about that bath tub -<br/><br/>Having been to the quirky Carradine/Sommerville ""ranch"" with it's tree-house house, outdoor plumbing and combination horse stables/guest quarters, Glen thought it was the perfect setting for the residence for his new lead character; Stuntman/Private Investigator, Colt Seavers..... Only in Hollywood!",15 out of 16 found this helpful.,,12 February 2011
1312,The Fall Guy, This show raised the Bar.,"Sure, this show had holes in it, it is cheesy, but I loved it.  In Junior High I grew up on this, and it influenced me greatly.  I can not watch boring sit coms, which maybe have 2 sets, or even cheaper made reality tv shows.  Do I really care who gets voted off the island , or can keep their hand on a rock for 2 hours.  After years of watching Colt drive through a china shop with his truck, use the trailer part of the truck which is used to move cars as a ramp, use a a rocket pack and hang onto the side of a chopper. All in a hour show! This show raised the bar high.  My wife hates Heather Thomas. and says she's there for her anatomy, with her lines ""Colt he's got a gun or ""Oh Colt.""  Howie was funny, and added good comedy.  The Unknown stunt man theme was great.  I loved the time some thugs beat up an identical truck to Colt's and he drives off with the real one and these 2 huge guys leaving the bar say,  ""hey what did you to my truck.""  Speaking of trucks I think that truck must have started the SUV craze, with the imprint it left on many 30 and 40 year olds minds. I love the Mad comic spoof on this show.

They were also joined by the beautiful Heather Thomas who played Jody Banks.<br/><br/>Like many 1980's action shows The Fall Guy was not to be taken seriously. The plots were crazy, the characters were crazier, the stories were rather mad at times and what can I say about the stunts-they were out of this world.

The show has a lot of great action in it. If you like 1980's era cop shows and car chase scenes especially where the cars flip and smash and blow up, this is a great show for you.<br/><br/>But there is also a surprising amount of comedy in this show and it still holds up as funny and entertaining although the stories and action scenes are pretty dated and not as slick as you would see in shows today.

1321,The Fall Guy, #I might roll a brand new car#,"I always remember The Fall Guy's invasion on the British TV screens in the 1980s and the typical things added in with the classic opening of ""The Unknown Stuntman"" song. In fact, this goes to Lee Majors from his earlier stint starring as Steve Austin in Six Million Dollar Man to another Glen A. Larson creation of ""The Fall Guy"" about the unknown stuntman and so-called bounty hunter Colt (Coltrane?)Seavers. The plots generally worked out fine from starting with Colt's ""on screen"" stunt work to usually hunting down and tricking criminals whom evade justice being centred mostly in and around Los Angeles with sidekick assistant from a slightly flustered Howie and sparkling Jodie. I like the course of the action scenes, some stunts with the use of a large wheeled pick up and Colt armed with a gun that he normally uses on a film set and fires just blank shots. Some well known guest screen names have appeared on some episodes and quibbles aside, some of the scenes were quite funny when Colt goes knocking on somebody's door usually only to get an edgy and unfriendly welcome along with some of the endings were when Howie outspokenly blew Colt's chances of meeting a girl together with an unplugged food vending machine. Some of the lyrics from The Unknown Stuntman are funny and the most funniest is when it goes; #I might roll a brand new car#. Ha Ha Ha.

1323,The Fall Guy, The BEST action-adventure series of ALL TIME!!!,"I have been a fan of this series for a long while. It is a recipe for ultimate entertainment:...start with a dash of real man macho stunts, throw in a pinch of T &amp; A sex appeal, add a big-ass explosion or two, mix with some genuine humour and saute with some classic one-liners and super surprise guest stars. Bake for an hour and top off with a car chase and crash. Voila! You are in for a real treat. <br/><br/>This show may never be mistaken for a Shakespearean drama, but it sure is a lost classic in it's own right. This show is NEVER dull. Be thankful that Al Gore or John Kerry never made an appearance(though it was edited by Howard Deane in season four). Some episodes were downright gripping, poetic and contained a powerful message such as ""A Hundred Miles a Gallon""(lost love and a look at a road not traveled by Colt), ""The Life of Riley""(the heartbreak of a child abduction with excellent acting and unique direction to boot), ""Trauma""(the tragedy of losing someone you care about) and ""Boom""(a serious and hard look at terrorism...years before 911 or the Oklahoma City bombing).<br/><br/>There were also certain episodes that had non-stop action and thrilling pacing like ""Death Boat"", which was a humorous opposite to ""The Love Boat."" This second season show was loaded with incredible eye-popping stunts such as a semi truck utterly destroying a house, a pickup truck and a car(with a fishing boat in tow, no less) blowing up a gas station after a crash into the fuel pumps, a boat chase and gun battle that leads to a boat bursting into flames and igniting, a car chase on a winding cliffside road between a convertible and Colt hanging from a HELICOPTER by a ladder(as seen in the opening titles in season 2-5) which climaxes with the car going over the edge of a cliff and falling apart upon impact of the rocks AND MORE!!! Hell, most feature films these days don't give you so much raw energy! <br/><br/>I could go on and on since I own every episode on video and I currently have 90 uncut 16mm film prints of this series of 110 episodes(I count them by the story, not the hour...hence the 2 hour episodes ""The Fall Guy"" and ""Colt's Outlaws"" are counted once and FILM is the ONLY WAY to fully appreciate this fine and underrated series, I might add), but in closing I will say that I am perplexed as to why garbage shows such as ""Macgyver"" and ""Knight Rider""(by Glen A. Larson, who created The Fall Guy, natch) are currently seen on TWO DIFFERENT cable networks taking up airtime while a true original sits on the shelf collecting dust. At the time that I type this on August 17th, 2004 U.S. President George W. Bush is engaged in a tense Presidential re-election campaign. Most in Hollywood are against the President. Perhaps those out in California at Twentieth Century Fox see a similarity between the no nonsense take-charge character Colt Seavers(who has been called a ""cowboy"" in several episodes just as the President has) and the President and they don't want his southern sense of action to become popular until after the 2004 U.S. election?

And I did not at all like Zena.  I think there is a major difference that has not been addressed.  Even though most of these episodes of Fall Guy were kinda cheesy, they had a morality factor that is lacking in most shows now. These guys were usually trying to get the bad guy, help the good guy, and survive themselves.  I would like to think that was a large part of the appeal. And the fact that who was good and bad was very obvious was also a big part of it.  It made the destruction, violence, and hot women all the better.  Zena of the 80's?...Thats a little rough.

Helping them out is data analyst Madison. The main characters are charming, quirky, quick-witted, and have great camaraderie with each other. Love Alexa and Madison's banter. Sort of teasing with each other. Alexa has a cat. I love seeing Alexa's interactions with the cat.<br/><br/>The actual mystery is actually pretty good. There are plot holes. Mainly involving the follow-up after the cases are solved and Alexa's involvement with them. You know what? It's ok. This is a light-hearted mystery show. There are plot holes in every show I watch, and we all overlook them. No different here.<br/><br/>I think the strength of the show is in the personalities of the characters. They're quirky and different. It's refreshing. There's not much with big personal drama. We find out a touch here and there about the characters. But it doesn't dominate the show. You do get a sense the whatever happened with Alexa, her retirement, her husband's death, had an unusual effect on her. There's a story there that maybe will get fleshed out over time? We'll have to wait and see.<br/><br/>The humor in the show is different. It's not the typical mainstream type of humor you see in American shows. It's very conversational-based. Quick-witted and quirky.<br/><br/>I really liked it. At a time in the world when everything is dark and crazy, this show is a breath of fresh air. It's not gritty. Evil people aren't winning.

I always watch at least three episodes of anything before I decide whether to quit or not. The episodes for season one are all one-offs. Not arc stories. If you're thinking of quitting after episode one, I recommend trying episode 4, 'Can't Stand the Heat,' which imo, is the funniest thus far. I wrote a review for that one. I also recommend episode 5.

1337,My Life Is Murder, a step in the right direction,"Australian commercial channels have a history of producing cheap, clickbaiting, police dramas, or worse: bad imitations (see the recent botched re-boots of Ms Fisher and Dr Blake). So I was curious about this one.
As it happens, the first episode was watchable, and in parts enjoyable. The set-up for the series is based on a well-known formula: retired cop (for reasons undisclosed -this is presumably a red herring backstory that will be revealed one detail per episode) gets out of retirement because a former colleague needs help to close a case worthy of investigation. Said ex-cop accepts the assignment and gets paired with IT whizz sidekick with a personality twist or two (this one has a thing about car detailing and high-end vacuum cleaners). So far, it's standard cop drama / PI fare, and we've seen quite a few variations of this recipe over the years.
What makes the series watchable is the acting lead, kiwi star Lucy Lawless (perhaps best known for her role as Xena) who delivers a good performance. The script for the first episode had the merit of not being totally obvious from the first five minutes, so keeping the viewer engaged. And the portrayal of the lead female character was engaging.
But there are some flaws that need to be addressed. I'll skip over the McGyveresque level of unbelievability of the aforementioned whizz kid's online search prowess. More seriously, in this day and age, unless you are trying to wink-wink / nudge-nudge Amazon for international distribution, one should seriously consider naming the female lead character something other than ""Alexa"". I felt that was either cheap, low, unfair, or all of the above.
Also, don't create a sub-plot about European appliances with an unreadable instruction manual, and then force the lead actor to deliver an articulate (scripted) phone conversation in the said language (German): if Alexa can have this level of interaction, then she could cope with the foreign language manual, couldn't she? (coz google translate would not be able to speak German that good, would it?).
Overall a good first effort, but needs smarter/stronger scripts to rise to the level of Australian classics (Ms Fisher, Dr Blake, Rake, Janet King, Jack Irish, Mystery Road, and so on).",38 out of 45 found this helpful.,,18 July 2019

1343,My Life Is Murder, YOU JUST CAN'T ESCAPE CRIME SOLVING,"Let's face it, for most people actress Lucy Lawless will always be Xena the warrior princess. The fact is she's done far more roles than that and the series ended over 18 years ago. But it will always be associated with her. That or her part of Lucretia in the cable series SPARTACUS. Both are heroic roles but she needed something a bit different. Thankfully that happened with the Australian series MY LIFE IS MURDER.<br/><br/>Lawless stars as private investigator Alexa Crowe, an ex-police detective who gets roped back into solving crimes by her old partner. Using techniques that are a bit different from her co-workers, Alexa was able to have an unprecedented number of crimes solved in the past. Now she stays at home and tinkers with her quality German mixer and trying to cook. While she might deny wanting to get back into the swing of things, her interest in the items brought to her takes over and soon she's on a new case.<br/><br/>Her first case involves a male escort whose latest customer was found dead having jumped to her death from his balcony. Of course the easiest way to find the clues needed to find out if this is a suicide or a murder is to pose as a client for the man and get into his life. The problem with that is that it also could put her life in jeopardy if he is the killer.<br/><br/>If that mystery wasn't enough the second episode has her trying to solve a locked door mystery. Locked door mysteries are those where the victim is found dead in a hotel room with all the doors and windows locked from the inside. Never an easy puzzle to solve but I would say that the odds of Alexa solving this crime are pretty good.<br/><br/>Subsequent episodes involve a number of other mysteries that challenge our heroine and her abilities. CFO dies during a morning bike ride, a cooking school student is killed, a hit and run driver who turns herself in may not be the actual killer, dealing with a clairvoyant on a case, returning to her school after the death of a beloved teacher and more happen in the series. All of them present interesting cases and all combine a bit of mystery, adventure and humor that make this show one that all can enjoy.<br/><br/>While watching the show I kept thinking back to Jessica Fletcher and MURDER SHE WROTE as well as Miss Marple mysteries. The only difference is that both were much older than Lawless. But the world of crime solving women is small and it's nice to see another character brought to life that serves women well.<br/><br/>Watching the series I was stunned to later realize that Lawless is 52. She doesn't look that much older than she did when she played Xena. No that isn't a misogynistic comment, it's a compliment. Always stunning and at the same time with the ability to act better than a number of actresses out there this show was made a joy to watch because of Lawless. As the central character of the show the weight of its success rides on her shoulders. She carries it well and one can hope that we'll see more of Alexa Crowe in the future.<br/><br/>But for now we have these 10 episodes to get us by. And being on disc means we can watch them over and over again. At least until series 2 comes out. Let's hope that happens because this one is a lot of fun to enjoy.",8 out of 8 found this helpful.,8.0,26 March 2020

1353,Dragon Ball, Dragonball matches up quite well with Z.,"I do not know if my tastes have changed over the years, but once I used to say by far the best incarnation of Dragonball was Z. However, upon watching this entire series on DVD uncut I now have to say that this one is equal or maybe a notch or two above Z. Though I can still say quite easily that GT is the worst of the bunch as while this one needed a continuation, Z did not. This one follows the young boy Goku as it chronicles his friendships and adventures while finding the mythical dragonballs that number seven and when gathered together summon the dragon, Shenron to grant one wish. The show started out as more of a comedy, a comedy with at times quite perverted humor in it. As the show progressed though it would more and more rely on action to the point that near the end of the show it closely resembled Z, most of the pervert nature of the show would be gone near the end. Why? I have no idea, but it would make a reappearance here and there near the end, but nothing like it was in the beginning. In fact, Z and GT would see virtually no humor of this type with the exception of Master Roshii. This show is sort of made up of three adventures involving the dragonballs. After each of these adventures there was a world martial arts tournament story. The first adventure involves a plucky teen named Bulma finding Goku and the two end up going on an adventure to find the dragonballs. They meet Yamcha here as well as Oolong and Puar. They also meet the nefarious Emperor Pilaf who has to be the funniest villain in the dragonball universe. This story would become Goku training under Master Roshii and meeting Krillan during the world martial arts phase. Then the Red Ribbon Army would be next as would be the meeting of Goku and Tien. Finally, Goku would have to face off against the evil King Piccolo in both the adventure and the tournament. Then for some reason the show keeps going on about five more episodes than it really needed to. Still, this one was fun and the fighting would become really cool near the end.",14 out of 16 found this helpful.,9.0,5 November 2010
1354,Dragon Ball, Definitely beats its sequels,"I've lived in Mexico for a few years and grew up watching various anime. For some reason, many of them such as Dragonball weren't as popular in the US and many European countries back then. It's only since the turn of the century that this franchise hit the US. <br/><br/>I stopped watching the series years ago. This has mainly to do because I didn't really like the English dub of DBZ with lot's of cuts and a complete new soundtrack. It's just recently that I rediscovered the whole franchise through the internet and my conclusion is that these original series from the DB trilogy are actually much better than DBZ.<br/><br/>If you don't like DBZ &amp; DBGT or think they Jumped the Shark at some point, it's probably due to one of these reasons: <br/><br/>-The characters grew ridiculously strong and got stronger every minute. <br/><br/>-The battles became long and monotonous. <br/><br/>-Too much time was wasted in having people stare at each other explaining the plot which wasn't always that interesting.<br/><br/>-The villains got too far fetched (Majin Buu is a great example).<br/><br/>-Several characters lost its importance.<br/><br/>-You don't like these kind of anime at all.<br/><br/>Except if it's the last one, I think you're probably going to prefer the original DB cause most of these aspects weren't nearly as exaggerated. This show is in its essence an adventure story based on an old Chinese tale called A Journey to the West. It revolves, in this case, around several martial artists so it does contain a lot of fights. What differentiates this show from its successors is that, since this is where it all began, none of the characters were too Godlike to start with. The fights were therefore not only way shorter (a few episodes at max) but also funnier and more interesting. It wasn't all about who's the strongest one? The reason why I prefer DB above DBZ is almost the same one as why I never really liked the English dubbed DBZ. It really became too over the top at one point and I felt like they tried to make the show cooler than it already was. <br/><br/>Another characteristic that DBZ and DBGT lacked is the atmosphere. Most of this anime takes place in a fictional type of China with a plot which belonged to the fantasy genre. In DBZ however, it switched over to science fiction and most of the fights took place in open fields. <br/><br/>The last aspect is the characters. Of course, Goku is the protagonist, but this series also introduced a lot more iconic characters with all unique aspects. The antagonists on the other hand were also much more interesting since most of the weren't actually ""super villains"". At the beginning you had Pilaf who was basically a comic relief followed by the Red Ribbon army containing several kinds of bad guys and ending up with Piccolo Daimaoh who, up to date, is my favourite DB villain.<br/><br/>I still like DBZ but sometimes I really wonder whether it would've been better for them to quit much earlier because I was a bit disappointed by the way it ended.<br/><br/>One other thing. It's only now when I realize that this anime is definitely not meant for little children, it's meant for everyone who likes anime. Some parts, I enjoy more than I used to because of the mature sense of humour. If you want to watch it, look for uncut versions.",26 out of 33 found this helpful.,10.0,20 October 2008
1355,Dragon Ball, It's a good show.,"I have watched this show and i guarantee its good. Well it may start off a little slow but it gets really good. It's child friendly and adults will enjoy it too. Like Dragonball Z and Dragonball Gt it will keep your interest. The fighting and powers of the warriors can keep children and adults all over the world amused. The show does have a little bit humor to it than the other two series, but thats what it was originally created for. The humor doesn't stop the show from having a good plot. Throughout the show they have great adventures and they always meet new allies and villains. To the last comment, I wouldn't say that your comment wasn't true, but I don't want to say it was true. The creators have made special uncut versions, but those must be bought on DVD or VHS. The edited version airs on television. They just wouldn't put extreme adult content on a show for children. So, what if a few of the characters like girl magazines and one is obsessed with females its all part of the humor. There are no female body parts that are revealed in the show, not even on the uncut versions. So, when i was reading the last comment I figured that the person who wrote must be misjudged. Watch the edited version. If you are not offended by anything enjoy the uncut version which is more adult oriented.",15 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,25 July 2006
1356,Dragon Ball, I actually liked it after giving it a second chance.,"I never had an interest in this series or the one that followed it. But after hearing so many good things about it. I decided to watch for myself. I read this is the first series that started it all. So here's what I learn from seeing all 153 episodes.<br/><br/>Dragonball takes place in an alternate earth that's nothing like ours. The humans live like we do, only they're accompany by dinosaurs, talking animals, and aliens. And most of the technology is years ahead of us. The whole plot focuses on Goku, a monkey tail boy who doesn't know he'll make a difference in the world. He encounters a teenage girl name Bulma, who is hunting down 7 dragon balls. Goku owns a dragon ball himself, which was once own by his grandfather. Goku didn't know what was so special about the balls, so Bulma told him what the story to it is.<br/><br/>The 7 Legendary shinny balls, known as Dragonballs have the ability to summon the eternal dragon when all of them are gathered together. The person who summons the dragon can get any wish he or she desires, and one wish only. Bulma has her own wish plan when she gets all 7 of the dragon balls, while Goku is interested in tagging along with Bulma on her journey. Because Bulma finds Goku to be of some use due to his inhuman strength.<br/><br/>During their quest, Goku &amp; Bulma will meet new friends and allies. As well crossing paths with many enemies and those who plan to use the dragon balls for evil purposes. Later on Goku will hope to become stronger than he already is. In order to do so he does some difficult training in martial arts from Master Roshi(his grandfather's friend). Goku is already a born fighter which is yet to be unleashed once he passes the limits of a normal human, and compete in the following ""World Martial Arts Tournament"" to gain the title of World Champion. Goku is about to experience a journey that unpredictable to anyone.<br/><br/>I gotta admit, I actually do like Dragonball now, after seeing this whole series. Even though this is lighter than the following series. But I wanted know the characters, story, and locations more by seeing the beginning than the middle. I was entirely confused with this one and DragonBall Z(the series that follows). Which is probably because I was a little kid who didn't consider anime as worthy as American cartoons.<br/><br/>Unlike today, where I do consider anime a pleasure to behold. I regret not getting into Dragonball from the very beginning, but it's never too late to become a fan of a franchise that's been around way before I was born.<br/><br/>Enough of my lecturing there. Overrall Dragonball has originality, character development, humor, drama, and suspense that really kept it going. As well as a collection of movie parodies, Chinese related locations/themes, and the whole idea of Sci-Fi combined with Fantasy &amp; Action. I can see why Eiichiro Oda of One Piece was so influenced by this series. Since he and the creator Akira Toriyama are best of friends.<br/><br/>After spending 3 months on this series, I'm gonna get started on DragonBall Z which succeeded even greater than it's proceeder.",8 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,3 December 2007
1357,Dragon Ball, The Right Mix of Action and Comedy.,"It's not an easy thing to do. But the Japanese can do it. Anime is very good in mixing stuff the right way. This is no exception. This anime is based on the popular manga, written by one of my favourite manga writers, Akira Toriyama, author of the hilarious Dr Slump manga. Dragon Ball is partly based on the old folklore tale of ""Journey to the West,"" although I don't know much about the story, except that some of the characters in Dragon Ball were based on ones from the story. That is all I can really say on that.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a 12 year old monkey boy, named Son Goku, who meets up with a 16 year old girl named Bulma who is searching for seven mystical balls named Dragon Balls, which when gathered together, will summon the dragon god Shenlong, who will grant you any one wish. Throughout their adventures they meet many memorable characters, such as the perverted shapeshifting pig Oolong, the not so good around girls desert bandit Yamucha, and an old martial arts master, who's technique and strength is only matched by his appetite for pretty, young girls known as Muten Roshi. There are many great stories spanning across 153 episodes, including several Tenkaichi Budokai's (Known in the American version as The World Martial Arts Tournament.) An evil organisation bent on world domination (who cares if it's cliché, you can't go wrong with the classics) called the Red Ribbon Army, An ancient evil known as Piccolo Daimao, and many more. My personal favourite parts of the series were the Piccolo battles, and that's where the tone of the series changed to be slightly more dramatic. It's an excellent show because you also get to see the steady transformation of a gifted, and pure child into a martial arts genius.<br/><br/>People who are more used to the non-stop action of its successor Dragon Ball Z should be warned that this series focuses a lot more on humour on most parts, until later in the series. There are many great fights in the anime, they just aren't as frequent as Dragon Ball Z. But if you are a fan of action anime, I would still highly recommend this to you.<br/><br/>This show was taken to America and turned into a kids show, which is not how it should be seen. If you want to watch this anime, watch the DVDs with Japanese dialog with subtitles. I'm sure you will enjoy it. Masako Nozawa is great as Son Goku, and captures his personality perfectly. Even if you do want to watch it, you need to watch it on DVD, as the television version edits out anything that is even slightly adult. It's just way too G rated. The original version (mostly in the early episodes) is filled with toilet humour, sex jokes and nudity. I feel that that's the way the series was originally made, and it should have been kept that way, rather than focus on the younger audience. But it is a good thing that they did in a way, as the people who were fans of the dub at the young age can grow up and discover the original version, as I did.<br/><br/>The animation is nothing really to talk about. It started in 1986 and it was pretty standard animation for that time, in Japan anyway. There is nothing wrong with it, it's just not something to write home about. But in a way, I find that nice because it has an 80's feel to it. It doesn't take away from the quality in the least. The soundtrack of the series isn't bad, but tends to reuse music a lot throughout the series. I thought the Tenkaichi song played during the Jackie Chun fight was the best of the series, but the opening and closing themes were pretty good as well.<br/><br/>Even if you don't like the start I would recommend that you continue watching, as you may find you like it later on, partly because of the way the tone changes a little in later episodes, where it stops a lot of the toilet humour and sexual stuff (not all of it, just a fair bit) and focuses on more serious stuff, like death. All in all, I'd say this is a great way to introduce yourself to anime, or even just if you want something fun to watch. Don't watch it if you want a series that will make you think, because that isn't what this is for. The show is hilarious, and the action is great.<br/><br/>Now to bring up the subject of the new American live action movie that's coming in 2009. How do I feel about the concept? I have made no secret about my disliking for the way the American's have handled this anime. So am I excited about the movie? In short, definitely. Do I think it will be a good movie? Probably not. Do I think it will be a good adaption of the series? Bit of doubt there. But do I think it will be entertaining? Now that I can give a yes to. I don't expect quality cinema from the movie, and I don't expect a reflection of Dragon Ball, I just expect a fun movie that shares certain aspects of it, and from the casting work, I think they could do a pretty good job. I look forward to seeing how they do it, and I am definitely psyched to see a live action Son Goku and Piccolo duking it out, hopefully with some epic ki blasts. A huge Kamehameha wave or Mafuba by Chow Yun Fat should be worth the $10 admission fee alone. I can't wait to see it, and I hope it's good enough, and successful enough to be the start of a franchise. You know, I'm the sort of guy who will probably like it anyway.",13 out of 17 found this helpful.,10.0,13 May 2008

It doesn't have all those ""Super"" stuff of Dragonball Z, all characters have different combat tactics and special moves, and they obtain their skills through hard training and not fury or spells.

1359,Dragon Ball," Good show, but read the Manga first","As a fan of Manga and Anime, I really enjoyed the Dragonball TV series, but I thought it could have done a lot better, but before I get to that, let me just explain one thing about the show.<br/><br/>DRAGONBALL IS NOT A KIDS SHOW! Some of the content of the show is not suitable for children, particularly the uncut Japanese version. The English translation does try to clean it up a bit, but it still contains some things anyone under 10 shouldn't be exposed to. For example, one character (Oolong) attempts to ""have his way"" with another while she sleeps (although in the English version he was just after the Dragonballs) and in several episodes we see some of the male characters nude.<br/><br/>OK, that's cleared up, so what's the show about? The series is based on the manga by Akira Toriyama, which was based on a Chinese legend, and follows the Adventures of Son Goku, a child with incredible powers. Goku meets Bulma, a 16 year old girl, who is looking for the Dragonballs, magical relics that, when all 7 are united, can summon Shenlon (Shenron in the English versions), who can grant 1 wish. Goku agrees to give Bulma his Dragonball (which he calls ""Grandpa as it is the only thing he has that reminds him of his Grandpa, Son Gohan) only if he can join her. But they are not the only ones after the Dragonballs.<br/><br/>While Dragonball offers some entertainment (although it does get better as it goes along), the Manga was far better. This maybe because the manga series was just straight-ford, while the anime goes of the track a bit with pointless episodes that weren't featured in the manga. That and the extra scenes that try to develop the characters we don't really care about.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the series is fun and never takes itself seriously. Any Dragonball Z fans who haven't seen Dragonball should do so.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,,3 January 2006

1367,Dragon Ball, My reaction to an incredible anime,"DRAGONBALL REVIEW<br/><br/>* NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD; I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THE SHOW BEFORE READING THIS REVIEW: <br/><br/>For a few months now, my friend and I have been watching all sagas of the original Dragonball anime. I cannot describe how much I love this show. This show has memorable characters, morals, themes, great character arks and a truly immersive world. <br/><br/>I love how the sagas revolve around one objective/ark that is attainable. I love how each saga ramps up the scale, stakes, villains and overall world.<br/><br/>I love that the characters are a twist on the classic characters from the hero's journey tale; for example, Master Roshi (the wise sage) is expected to be pure and incorruptible like Gandalf. He turns out to be a pervert. Another example is Yamcha (the rouge) who is expected to not be afraid of anyone. Yamcha turns out to be afraid/shy around women. <br/><br/>I love the tournament sagas, especially the first appearance of Jackie Chun. Without spoiling this part, what he does on stage before his fight is so hilarious and organic for him that it's great. And without spoiling Jackie's true intention, his intention is both reasonable and gives a great moral about humility. <br/><br/>I love the Red Ribbon Army ark, especially when Goku has an objective to help another in saving the person's father's life. Apart from Master Roshi, Korin (Karin) is probably my favorite character. The buildup of this character and his first appearance is done so well. What happens afterwords is very exciting and is so satisfying to watch that I won't spoil it. <br/><br/>In all honesty, I didn't really care for the cornel antagonist, I thought the tower saga was great filler, with the exception the development of one Goku's pivotal characteristics, mercy.<br/><br/>I thought General Blue was all right, though I was shocked and on the edge of my seat when Blue actually had a way to gain the upper hand from Goku via psychic paralyzing power. Goku really never overcame it. At the times he did escape from Blue's powers was because of chance and assistance from other characters. <br/><br/>However, things really kicked off again in the Red ribbon Army Saga when Mercenary Tao comes in. This character, with the exception of Piccolo (Sr. and Jr.), is the most threatening character in the original series. They make this apparent by the way people react to him and the way he deals with his enemies. <br/><br/>What I love about Mercenary Tao is that he is really the one to physically and to a point, mentally defeat Goku. He is the equivalent of Bane (Batman) in the Dragonball universe (at this point). <br/><br/>The way the Red Ribbon Army is defeated, after all the buildup, is so satisfying to watch. The leader of the Red Ribbon Army, Commander Red's intention with the Dragon balls is something that I dare not spoil because I honestly think you should watch it for yourselves; and for those who have seen the anime, then I say that it was definitely something that took me completely by surprise. <br/><br/>To watch Goku's main objective in the Red Ribbon Army ark be completed is very much one of the most emotionally satisfying moments of the show.<br/><br/>The fortuneteller Baba saga is mostly entertaining filler with the exception of the final duel, in which, Goku is fighting someone, without spoiling who it is, familiar. Needless to say, the fight leads into an emotionally heartwarming moment that wraps up one of many character arks Goku goes through throughout the anime. <br/><br/>The next tournament is thrilling and keeps you guessing but is only a prelude to the most dramatic, serious and saddening saga in the entire anime. <br/><br/>WARNING: FULL ON MAJOR SPOILERS! I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WATCHING THE SHOW BEFORE READING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!<br/><br/>I am referring to the King Piccolo saga, in which the first thing we see of this saga is the death of Krillin, one of the main characters of the show. What's even more shocking is that an old enemy of Roshi's is responsible for Krillin's death. King Piccolo, who is essentially the Devil in this show (Yes I know there was a Devil Man in the previous saga, but really, Evil incarnated would be Piccolo). <br/><br/>Not only that, King Piccolo and his children have temporarily defeated Goku, and exterminating Martial Artists left and right. Roshi also sacrifices his life for a failed attempt to capture King Piccolo. <br/><br/>Jaw doesn't stop dropping yet, as King Piccolo wants to reclaim his former strength by wishing for the Eternal Dragon to wish his youth back. He succeeds. Not only that, after her succeeds, he uses his newly restored power to kill the Dragon, the only one who could possibly reverse this. <br/><br/>With the exception of filler at the end, the rest of the remaining sagas are basically about how Goku deals with the death of his friends, the threat of King Piccolo (and his legacy), the origins of Piccolo, and the objective of salvation. Needless to say, it is all handled wonderfully with great execution. <br/><br/>One great aspect about the show is that it keeps you guessing on how the conflict will be resolved; and every time it is resolved, it is very satisfying. I love this show and I cannot wait to see Dragonball Z Kai. <br/><br/>GRADE: Classic LETTER GRADE: A NUMERICAL GRADE: 10 OVERALL OPINION: This anime has great characters, fantastic character and story arks that keep you guessing endlessly until it is resolved in a satisfactory manner. I highly recommend it.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,17 August 2013

Sure there are some amazing moments in it but I feel like they did the same thing OVER AND OVER! Bad guy comes, bad guy kills literally everyone, goku takes 20 episodes to get back to fight the bad guy, goku beats the bad guy, and finally, goku wishes everyone back with the dragon balls. The show is over hyped and fans only like it because of nostalgia, it does not hold the test of time.",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,4.0,20 July 2019
1369,Dragon Ball," As good as DBZ, if not better.","When I first saw the add for this, I didn't know what to think, I mean Dragonball Z was one of the greatest animes of all time, but Dragonball GT just spoiled the whole thing, so I didn't know if this show was going to be any different.<br/><br/>This was a big mistake as Dragonball is an awesome show. It tells the tale of Goku, a boy with a monkey/sayian (if you've seen DBZ) tail, who has lived alone in the woods after his grandfather died. He then meets Bulma a young girl searching for the mysterious Dragonballs, seven orange stones that when brought together, can grant any wish asked of it. At first these episodes don't appeal very much at first, but when Goku meets master Roshi and learns the Turtle Hermit style of martial arts and enters the tournaments...that's when the show gets REALLY good.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are fantastic and well animated, the show marks a another time when as a child Goku didn't restort to continuously using mountain destroying fireballs and his opponents were slightly more realistic, in fact he has a whole bag of techniques we never even saw in DBZ. Also if you saw DBZ first (which I recommend to get used to the DB universe) then you'll feel right at home as all the plot twists and Soap opera style cliff hangers are here at their roots, and the show always drops little hints about what's going to happen next.<br/><br/>So in conclusion I'd say if you want a slightly more realistic martial arts anime, then go with Dragonball...but see DBZ first otherwise you may find it a bit bizarre.",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,,24 June 2004

The emotional impact of the deaths of some characters in the first arc of Dragon Ball Z is largely connected with the original series.<br/><br/>Piccolo's transition from villain to hero is not as good without having the chance of seeing how he firstly appeared in the series as the main antagonist. (And honestly, is the most convincing redemption arc from Dragon Ball, along with the change of heart Tenshinhan had)<br/><br/>Some people dismiss the series simply because of its whimsical nature, focusing mostly in the ""serious"" parts (Like the Frieza and Cell saga), but honestly being fun and whimsical is one of the biggest charms Dragon Ball as whole has, opposed to other, more dramatic fighting anime, including those series inspired by Dragon Ball.<br/><br/>Dragon Ball GT and Dragon Ball Super have tried to capture the same kind of charm the original series had, without success.",1 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,12 February 2021

1376,Gargoyles, Disney TV at its Best,"""Gargoyles"" was a series released during the ""Disney Afternoon"" block of the mid-nineties. What makes it so unique is that it's still the only dramatic animated series Disney TV has ever produced. It stunned people at the time with its tragic plots, realistic weapons, and clear consequences to characters' actions. It's definitely not for young children (the Y7 rating is a good guideline), but don't think it's just another brainless afternoon shoot-'em-up designed to sell action figures. The backbone of this saga is what all timeless fiction must contain: plot and character development. The writing is taut, the acting fantastic, and the animation beautiful, but they are all mere servants to the story, which stays interesting and moderately serialized throughout the entire series (just the first season has been released on DVD, 13 of 65 episodes).<br/><br/>Overall, I think this is the best animated television series to ever come out of this country. If you at all appreciate the art form, you'll wonder where this show has been all your life. In a time when comedies are saturating both the primetime and daytime cartoon markets, it's nice to find a gripping animated drama without needing to set your sights to the other side of the Pacific. Highly recommended.",81 out of 85 found this helpful.,10.0,15 December 2004

1378,Gargoyles, Awesome!!,"Having lived in the New York metropolitan area my entire life, Gargoyles was even more fun to watch since many of the landmarkings were places I've hung out at) The animation in itself is mindblowing.  The sights and sounds of the show are true to life of Manhattan, even if you've never been there, it makes you feel like you're there.<br/><br/>The storylines were great.  Mythology, elves, sorcery, and modern day New York, London, Japan, and Scotland (and even gay Paris!) come together to form a wonderful series that would have made Walt Disney proud.  While many former Disney creations had very obvious morals (and quite a few ""And they lived happily ever afters ...""), Gargoyles is the first to show a distinctiveness I've never seen, from Disney or otherwise.  The emotions are real, the stories realistic (as far as you can see realistic about elves, anyway), and storylines reappear again and again.  The animation and the gargoyles draw the kiddies, while the history, mythology, and more mature storylines will definitely keep the adults glued to the TV.<br/><br/>The show gives lessons on gun control, dealing with blindness, death, family, love, and life, without the artificial and often unrealistic way of going about it (examples including Cinderella, Barney, and lots of other shows and movies I can mention).  It's not just for kids.  Disney has done for Gargoyles what Warner Bros. did for the Batman Animated Series. I could watch this show with my grandmother (who doesn't like ANYTHING made after 1960) and she enjoyed it thoroughly and is now a die-hard fan.  Watch it with your kids.<br/><br/>Sad to see the show having been canceled though.  Maybe if enough people email Disney or write letters, it can be brought back.

1379,Gargoyles," The most unique and original TV series ever produced--there has never been anything like it, and there never will be.","I have just one question:  How can Disney Television Animation produce such a wonderful show as ""Gargoyles"" for a couple of seasons and then go back to being Disney Television Animation?  I simply cannot understand it, and if anyone has any thoughts, PLEASE share them with me!  This show was a breath of fresh air on every level.  If this wasn't a groundbreaking show, it certainly raised the bar sky high.<br/><br/>Voices--Many's the time I have thought that they could have chosen a better actor for a part in animation.  Not here.  The voice cast was so good that to this day I cannot imagine anyone else filling the bill.  In the role of Goliath, Keith David demonstrated that he possesses one of the greatest speaking voices of any actor in the business.  Jeff Bennett was also great as Brooklyn, my favorite character.  (Loved the white hair!)<br/><br/>Music--Carl Johnson's scores were great.  They beautifully set the tone and underlined the action and the drama.  <br/><br/>Animation--Excellent.  Dark, moody and stylish.  The shots of the clan as stone statues are downright eerie at times.  To this day, I still can't believe Disney did this one.<br/><br/>Plot--Action, drama, technology, mythology, humor and a little Shakespeare on the side.  Folks, WHAT MORE COULD YOU POSSIBLY ASK FOR?  This series had the most tightly structured story lines ever--there was not a single moment of dead air anytime.<br/><br/>The best thing about the series, however, was the characters.  For being a clan of gargoyles (with a couple of humans), these characters were as real as you and I.  Things HAPPENED to them!  They actually got HURT as a result of violence.  They matured, sometimes in ways unexpected.  They found out the hard way who their friends and enemies were.  And they had to live with the consequences of their actions, which sometimes came back to haunt them in later episodes.<br/><br/>Here's hoping Disney will realize the error of their ways and bring this show back.  If you are already a fan, may you continue to enjoy the show. If you haven't seen it, give it a chance.  But be advised:  Once you have seen television and the world through the glowing eyes of a gargoyle, you will never want to settle for ""standard kiddie fare"" ever again.",68 out of 75 found this helpful.,,7 July 2000
1380,Gargoyles, Nothing can compare to Gargoyles. Ever.,"Quite simply, Gargoyles was wonderful. No other word could possibly describe it. A great plot that continued to grow; characters that matured, lost innocence, and grew up; simply beautiful animation, even better acting on the part of the voice actors; and, most important of all, an absolutely original idea. There will never be another one like Gargoyles, ever. There can be no dispute. I don't think I will ever run out of praise for Gargoyles, nor have anything but. Everything about it was pure genius on the part of the shows creator Greg Weisman. In fact, to this day, I am certain that Gargoyles do exist because of the sheer realness of the show. And believe me, Gargoyles was very real. People died, trust was betrayed, central characters were changed forever by events in the story. One example of this is the vengeful agenda of the main ""bad guy"" (quotes are around the term ""bad guy"" because in Gargoyles, no one was truly evil, with the possible exception of the non-Fox members of The Pack.) Demona. The former love of Goliath, the leader of the clan of gargoyles that forms most of the central characters, Demona is an immortal gargoyle who was deeply hurt when her entire clan, save Goliath and his five friends, were smashed during their daytime sleep, during which they are stone statues. Betrayed, hurt, and angry, Demona has dedicated her life to the destruction of humanity. This is but one example of how the characters were developed and changed by events in the entire chronology of the series. Gargoyles is no longer on TV anymore. It could not compete commercially with Power Rangers, may they endure a thousand torments, and had to be cancelled. But, it's legacy will always live on in the hearts of those of us whose lives were touched by it and who will always keep a special place in  our hearts for it. However, I may have mispoken myself. Gargoyles may be not be on TV any longer, but, they still thrive in the form of fan fiction. They are great stories, and they are written in such a way that you do not have to have seen the entire series to fully understand what is going on, although it helps slightly. And, if you wish to see Gargoyles in it's televised form, some of the very early episodes can be found in any video store in the cartoon section. Watch it. Trust me, you will never be the same once you've looked through the eyes of a gargoyle.",39 out of 42 found this helpful.,,21 May 1999
1381,Gargoyles, The best animated series ever!,"The plot of Gargoyles is like a well paved street: no holes.  The creators took exceptional care to ensure a growing and continuing plot line that involved all of the characters.  The idea was very innovative and inspiring. It involved a clan of Gargoyles, stone by day/flesh by night, that were betrayed by humans in 994.  They were frozen in stone by a magic curse for a millenium until a multi-billionaire broke the curse.  They awoke to a new world in a foreign land completely dominated by humans that were unaware of their existence.  After befriending a courageous police officer, Elisa Maza, and being betrayed by the man that broke their curse and a fellow clan member, they triumphed over their enemies and became Manhattan's guardian angels.  The rest of the series continued to be interesting. Incorporating Arthurian legends and mythological deities, the show always took fictional constructs and shaped them into tougher versions that were really cool. Most impressive, Gargoyles included Shakespearean characters, with a twist. Macbeth had been alive for over 900 years, and had a grudge for gargoyles. A Midsummer Night's Dream's Oberon and Titania were powerful beings that possessed powerful, and often destructive magic.  With a unique blend of villains and allies, and villains that became allies, the plot of Gargoyles was ever changing and continuous.  As for action scenes, I have never seen better ones.  Scenes of epic sword fights, aerial combat, and hand-to-hand fighting made the fight scenes exceptional.  I would like to describe the action better, but I find it hard to express in words how intense, creative, and simply awesome the scenes really are.  Ultimately, Gargoyles is the greatest animated series I have ever seen, and I advise any action lover to see it.

I actually didn't know that this was a Disney show until I saw it on a cover of Disney Magazine.  Most of the episodes in Gargoyles were well thought out, most of the characters have back-stories to them and there was historical accuracy in many flashbacks being truth or popular legendary.  Unfortunately Gargoyles didn't have a very long run and almost as soon as it ended it was pulled from most networks and had retreated to channels Disney owned.

1384,Gargoyles," Brilliant show, not just for kids","Gargoyles is the only kids' show I've ever seen that contained this much continuity, introducing the concept that actions have consequences that can last more than 30 minutes.  There were plot elements introduced in the first few episodes that became important as much as two full years later.  You had to pay attention to this one.<br/><br/>When Disney bought ABC, they moved this show from the ""Disney Afternoon"" to the new Saturday morning line-up.  However, they wanted to present it like a new show, so they re-titled it ""The Goliath Chronicles.""  This confused a lot of fans, for a rather pointless reason.  The show died that season, and I'm not surprised.  Some ABC affiliates didn't carry it at all that year.<br/><br/>""Gargoyles"" boasted a cast of voice talents that was truly beyond belief. For the Star Trek fan, the two main villains were Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis, but it didn't end there.  Voice talents from *every* Star Trek franchise were included: Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Nichelle Nichols, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Colm Meany, and Levar Burton all contributed.  Toss in other great voices like Tim Curry (I'd listen to him recite the phonebook!), Clancy Brown, David Warner and John Rhys-Davies, and you could enjoy this show with a busted picture tube.<br/><br/>And let us not forget: this show was educational.  It drew on elements of folklore and cultures from every corner of the globe, including Scottish, Japanese, British, Irish, Chezch, Native American, South American, Greek, Norse, African, Australian... the only continent they didn't hit was Antarctica.

1386,Gargoyles," Not your ordinary ""cartoon""","The show is what many consider Disney's greatest. The irony of this is that the Disney Company had little say in what went on with the show. Their...lack of attention (for lack of a better term)...gave the creators the freedom to make the show the way they wanted, without being under the thumb of what's ""acceptable"" in media.<br/><br/>It sparked something in people that weren't the target audience. Go to a convention or visit the fan site forums and you may find what looks to be more like a college discussion on anatomy or mythology than a bunch of fans talking about an animated TV show.<br/><br/>It was noticeable when Disney started taking control again. Whole episodes were kept off-air because some people missed the entire point of the message. The episode ""Deadly Force"" is the prime example of this, in the episode, Broadway accidentally shoots Elisa while playing with her gun. The message: don't play with guns (unlike other shows, it actually shows the consequences of doing so). Why it was pulled for a while: Elisa was shot because Broadway was playing with guns.<br/><br/>Most of the people that dislike the show feel as such because they've missed key items.<br/><br/>Take the names, for example. Gargoyles didn't originally have names, unless, like Goliath (named by the people inhabiting Castle Wyvern for his size and strength in battle) and Demona (named by Macbeth for her ferocity in battle - ""you fight like a demon!""), the names were given by humans. It was not part of their culture to name everything. When they did choose names in the 20th century, the names were based on what was around them. They lived in New York City, so their names were based on some of the sights they saw (Hudson for the river, Brooklyn and Bronx for the districts, Lexington and Broadway for the well-known streets; when the clones were introduced in Season 2, their names were based off west coast places). Because their culture was not the same as human culture, they did not initially understand the reason for names. ""Their ways are not our ways."" (Goliath) Other people find the literalness of the spells to be absurd. The magic in the show is very literal (though the spells are, in fact, Latin and truly translate), such is the way of the people of a millennium ago in the Gargoyles universe. David Xanatos makes a comment on this in ""The Price"" when he tries an immortality spell in which the spell states ""anyone who bathes in this will live as long as the mountain stones."" Quite possibly the only magic that isn't literal is Puck's, but he is, true to Shakespeare, a trickster and a Child of Oberon.<br/><br/>Which brings another factor in - the Shakespearian and mythological influences that were worked in. Oberon, Titania, Oberon's Children (including Puck and the Wyrd Sisters), Macbeth, King Arthur, Avalon, Odin, and even the David and Goliath reference. Gargoyles is what got me interested in Shakespeare's other works, aside from Romeo and Juliet that I was taught in school.<br/><br/>Another key point that people often miss is that there is no black and white, good guy and bad guy, straight right and wrong. That's part of what makes the show so intriguing. Is Xanatos a good guy, or is he a bad guy? The truth is, he's neither and he's both. He's a person with his own motives, and although the end may be ""good,"" the means are sometimes questionable. Money is his power, and although it's not usually his motive, it is often his means of getting what he wants. ""Pay a man enough and he'll walk barefoot into hell."" (Awakening) Demona and Macbeth seem like obvious ""bad guys,"" but what are they, really? Pawns, not even knowing what they do (though who's pawns?). Victims of time created by the magical pact they made in old Scotland, unable to die unless one kills the other. Or, for Demona, a victim of herself, a betrayer who's convinced she's the betrayed. The complexity of the relationships between characters simply adds to its appeal.<br/><br/>Some people also forget or do not know that the series was created in the mid-90s, since the DVDs were only recently released. This means pre-9/11, which in turn means the rules and ways that are in place now weren't when the show was created.<br/><br/>When the show was created, the audience had to see things from the different viewpoints and perspectives. The same is still true, if not even moreso, since the time-frame of the setting is now a decade ago. It forced people to see controversial topics such as guns and, to an extent, a form of terrorism (one episode showed a hostage situation), along with gangs and gang ""protection."" There's a uniqueness to the show that makes it not just any ""children's cartoon,"" but as some people put it, ""a living novel,"" and one everyone can enjoy...if they have an open mind to be able to understand the complexity and depth of the storyline.",11 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,10 May 2006

Every one of the characters embodied someone you could look up to. This is especially true for Goliath. He always stuck with what was best for everybody. Even when the whole clan was destroyed, he searched out the enemy to save those that were kidnapped. That is the true measure by which humanity should be measured, doing the right thing.

All characters are a shade of gray. Even the noble Gargoyles have done something evil sometime in the series even if it was for the greater good. All the characters and their corresponding actions have consequences. The characters feel and respond to those actions, develop accordingly. They all have a reason to do whatever they do. It's not just plain vigilant work.<br/><br/>The way the creators have mixed science and fantasy, hats off to them. They have also managed to keep the suspense built up across the first two seasons. It's not like they have dealt off all their aces at one go. The secrets and history of the characters are revealed slowly and nicely. The plots and the sub-plots, all make up a wonderful experience.<br/><br/>I agree that the third season was not up to the standard the first two reached, but in my opinion, it still is better than many shows being aired even today, be it animation or live action.<br/><br/>That being said, I have already recommended this fantastic series to many of my friends, would like to recommend the same to all the readers of this comment too. If you haven't already, please do watch this masterpiece.",6 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,11 March 2009
1390,Gargoyles, A real contender for the best animated show ever,"I cannot begin to detail how phenomenal this show is. I have seen plenty of exceptional animated shows, and some of them are very underrated, but Gargoyles has it all, mystery, complexity, depth, adventure and suspense, and one of those rarities where there is not a bad episode.<br/><br/>The animation is superb, very dark, moody and stylish. In fact, there are several animated sequences in Gargoyles that have a cinematic feel to it. The backgrounds especially are a wonder, and I loved the creative yet bold and dark use of colours. The music is outstanding, it is dark, atmospheric and mysterious constantly and adds to the mature tone of the show.<br/><br/>Another strong asset is the show's writing. No clichés, no wishy-washy moments. This writing can have a subtle humour to it, yet is also very intelligent, bold and thought-provoking. Then there are the story lines. They are filled with mystery and adventure, and I was really surprised at how incredibly deep Gargoyles was. I have seen some deep and complex animated shows, namely Peter Pan and the Pirates, to some extent ThunderCats and especially Batman:The Animated Series, and Gargoyles is just as deep as those. And the characters are wonderful, so unique and likable, while the voice work is top-notch from all involved especially from Keith David who is note-perfect in the title role of Goliath.<br/><br/>Overall, if you haven't seen Gargoyles, I suggest you do. 10/10 Bethany Cox",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,2 August 2010
1391,Gargoyles, The Best Animated Show Ever,"Gargoyles is, to me, unique- first, it's a Disney show that isn't all cutsey and cuddly, and secondly, it's got continuity, something most animated shows lack.<br/><br/>The strength of the show lies in the characters and the stories. There are many powerful characters, such as Goliath and Demona, as well as characters who are cloaked in mystery, such as Macbeth and Xanatos. You've got good ensemble characters such as Brooklyn, Broadway and Lexington, and depth is added to all the characters over the course of the show. The villains are not just one-dimensional madmen, they too are multi-faceted and they are not evil as such, they just have questionable agendas. Some of the villains change sides, and you have cause to question the wisdom of the heroes of the show too.<br/><br/>The show borrows from a wide variety of mythologies, including Camelot, as well as legends from Ireland, Japan and Africa, to create a tapestry that has yet to be equaled in any other animated show. It has unparalleled creativity and remains a great show, even now, some fourteen years after it was first made. It's a shame the Chronicles (Season Three) wasn't up to the same standard- you can thank Disney for that!",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,3 January 2009
1392,Gargoyles," Fantastic, if memory serves me","I just got nostalgic all of a sudden about this show, Gargoyles. From the excellently casted voices (Keith David RULES this cartoon!) to the intriguing story lines and character relationships, Gargoyles had it all. It was too bad it wasn't allowed to carry on further. <br/><br/>Jonathan Frakes was a great Villain, and the other baddies in the show were great as well. <br/><br/>Gargoyles had everything, from romance to comic relief, from magic to science fiction. Just a great Disney series. I hope it's on DVD so everyone who didn't catch it can rent it for themselves and their families.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,20 July 2004
1393,Gargoyles, Remarkable and genuinely interesting,"As a ten year old, Gargoyles was both entertaining and, in retrospect, genuinely edifying. From Macbeth to Puck and Oberon, the Shakespearean references were seamlessly worked into a show that, as other reviewers have remarked, was structured more like a novel than a disjointed kids' cartoon show. Yep, this show truly stoked my imagination.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just nostalgic but this show was great! It truly is a tragedy that the show only lasted two seasons. But even a decade later i can vaguely recall the plot outlines, which means something, at least to me.<br/><br/>
This was quality entertainment. Today's animation producers(disney included) should take a look at Gargoyles to see what a real animated series can accomplish.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,26 June 2003
1394,Gargoyles, A Great Novel,"Many have sung the praises of this truly exceptional show.  Calling it the greatest animated show of all time is not a statement I would argue with.  I would however comment that the way this story was told it felt like a fine crafted novel, not a TV show.  This a series with absolutely no plot holes.  Not one.  By the time the final episode aired all was explained and it made sense.( I'm not counting the awful Goliath Chronicles)<br/><br/>
In most modern cartoons, the creators get a feel for the most popular characters and shift the focus mainly to them.  In Gargoyles, every character was made important to the overall story arch.  It is astonishing that this was accomplished.  Also,  new characters were readily introduced and it didnt impede with the devolpment of the older characters.  An example of this is Angela.  While the main focus was on her relationship with her father, Goliath, she also developed a relationship with every other gargoyle in the clan.  This proves how well thought out the plots were.<br/><br/>This show really tapped into the emotions of its characters as well. You actually felt Goliaths sense of rage and betrayel in the original movie when he confronts the captain of the guard who sold them out.  ""You are the betrayer"",  Goliath exclaims and you feel it.  In his voice and in the words themselves, you feel his anger, his confusion, and his shock.<br/><br/>The villians as well had their motavations.  I dont think any of them were just evil for the sake of being evil.  Demona and Xanatos had some twisted psyches, which in turn made them better villians.<br/><br/>Gargoyles really was a groundbreaking show.  This show is proof of how good a cartoon can be when its first priorty is quality entertainment and not selling toys.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,22 January 2003
1395,Gargoyles, Those were the days...,"Oh, to have the Gargoyles back. One of the best animated series ever. Good for the kid in me: the fact that they're gargoyles and can fly (most of them) and generally kick butt. Good for the adult in me: there's actually a plot, and a really good one. The characters are not nauseating like the Power Rangers who defeated them. Except for the fact that the gargoyles are animated supernatural beings, they felt like real people. The show wasn't dumbed down for kids (ahem, Power Rangers and most Saturday morning cartoons since then), nor was it so adult that it was boring (i.e., the non-cartoon channels on Saturday mornings). Gargoyles was (still is, in my opinion) an excellent masterpiece of animated entertainment--scratch that--of entertainment period.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,31 August 2004
1396,Gargoyles, What a shame...,"I was just watching ""The Green,"" and can't help but miss this show. It was what every good cartoon/kids show should be, for it tried to make itself interesting not just to kids but to everyone. The characters, the plot, and everything in Gargoyles was memorable and it's a shame it lasted only 2 seasons. I love rewatching this show, yet I always end up feeling cheated afterwards because a show as good as Gargoyles deserved much better than what it got out of its TV shelf life. As well, I'll always be bothered by never knowing how things turned out for all the characters on the show, even the so-called bad guys. Simply put, Gargoyles is the type of TV show that makes a person proud of television in general.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,,8 June 2003
1397,Gargoyles, An Excellent animated series,"Greg Weisman's ""Gargoyles"", whilst only living a short life, really provides an excellent example of an animated series that can be aimed at older viewers.<br/><br/>The series offered an engaging, arching storyline which was full of surprises, twists and turns at every corner.  Full of enough action to keep younger children placated, but on the other hand mythological references and themes which enthralled much older people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the show was cancelled before its time - unable to compete with the commercial power of the 'Power Rangers'.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,17 November 1998
1398,Gargoyles, Excellent series,"""Gargoyles"" is one of the best cartoons (If not the best) produced by the Walt Disney company. This show wasn't like any other of the cartoons made by Disney before, being darker and targeted to a more mature audience than shows like ""DuckTales"" ""Drakwing Duck"" (Which are pretty good shows, by the way) ""Gargoyles"" was a serious, interesting action animated series, in the same line than the animated series of ""Batman"" made by Bruce Timm, being one of the best examples of the genre with intelligent, very well written stories, great animation, and the best of all, fascinating and realistic characters. <br/><br/>All about ""Gargoyles"" was excellent, as far I remember. Too bad that Disney doesn't make this kind of shows anymore.

1399,Gargoyles, One of the great misunderstood animated dramas...,"A classic in so many ways, that suffered an unfortunate and untimely death. For a ""children's"" show, had characters of incredible depth, who developed as the series went along. Xanatos is one of the great animated villains, who's motives are always ambiguous, and indeed changed as the series went along. He reached a point by the end of the series where it is hardly right to even refer to him as ""villian"" anymore. The gargoyles themselves matured as well, most notably Brooklyn.<br/><br/>The story lines and animation were outstanding, always catching the eye and leaving you wanting more. Characters developed even when they were not featured in episodes, and often changed (in an understandable and explainable way) the next time they were seen.<br/><br/>This is possibly the best American-made animated drama series out there. While it was geared towards children, there were things for all to enjoy. It didn't hit its peak till midway through the 2nd season, but from there never slowed down.<br/><br/>The sad flip side of this is the horrid 3rd season ""The Goliath Chronicles,"" made with mediocre animation and stories. I wouldn't wish that drivel onto anyone. But if you get a chance to watch the 1st and especially 2nd season, go for it and enjoy. Word of warning though, it's fairly involved and can be tough to pick up midway through.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,,23 November 2004

1404,Gang Related," Remember ""The Shield""? ""Gang Related"" might just be as good.","Fans of former FX show ""The Shield"" will love ""Gang Related"".<br/><br/>The show started off good and after the last few episodes, its reach GREAT status. Especially episode 7 (stealing back the Fish Scale). The acting is great, the story lines are somewhat believable. It does have a few faults -<br/><br/>No.1 - I love Javier Acosta (Cliff Curtis) and without him...perhaps this show is a dud. Yet when you have him speaking Spanish, you can tell he's not Mexican. This is especially evident when he's speaking with Los Metas member Miguel Salazar. It's not a deal breaker, just an observation.<br/><br/>No.2 - Gang Members don't wear bandannas across there forehead. I see this all the time and I just don't understand why Hollywood keeps making this mistake. If you have to have a bandanna on a gang member. Have it place around his throat, in the same manner someone might place it just before a robbery to partially cover there face. Just don't place it on there foreheads, it's not the 80's! Besides that, the rest of the gang members in the show, actually look like what you would see in the hood. I would suggest you have Carlos razor shave his head...we don't do fades.<br/><br/>Besides those small mistakes, I love this show. I've recommended it to my friends and all of them are now hook. Hopefully it gets picked up for a few more seasons.<br/><br/>PS. I've read news stories of Mexican's dislike how Gang Related portrays them. I'm Mexican and I have no issue at all. Would you rather be portrayed as a High School teacher who makes Meth? Or perhaps a leader of a Biker Gang? Both of these two shows give you a man who is good at heart and yet has to make some decisions that you may not understand. Yet, they do it for there FAMILY.

Also there are angles to the story other than the main one which is double agent for mob and the police. The action does not take over the drama and that is very good from famous action writer. The acting is good from the police squad and the gang especially the paralyze character.

All that network money and you can't get RZA to lose his Shaolin accent? Nortenos in LA? Give me a break. This show has so much potential but the casting and plot is beyond stupid. At least Kurt Sutter attempts to be some what accurate in California Gang politics. The creator of this show must be a real douche bag in real life. This is the first time I have ever sensed it from watching a show. All you are doing is glamorizing criminal behavior in a bullshit fantasy way.<br/><br/>I wonder if Cliff Curtis longs for the day he can play a Polynesian shot caller, instead of always being casted as a Cartel or Mexican Gang leader. Regardless, the show has potential. FOX needs to step it up and gut the writers and maybe the creator of the show. Put somebody who knows what he is doing in charge.<br/><br/>5/30 Update: I guess I spoke too soon. That last episode was entertaining. I guess I wasn't stoned enough when I watched the pilot.

1407,Gang Related, Finally a good show to watch.,"With the slew of terrible reality shows or unwatchable dramas, Gang Related is a breath of fresh air (especially on Fox). I know some people say something like this is impossible to believe or it's impractical. So what? It's entertaining and it's good. So many shows are cancelled before the have a possibility to show their true potential and for it being this early on it's unbelievably interesting. Also, has no one ever seen Donnie Brasco? It's just a reverse situation instead of cop infiltrating mob ,it's mob infiltrating police. Fighting to do good while protecting his own. The show has an amazing cast of actors and it shows in GR. I think the only mistake we could make with this show is letting it slip away without seeing it through. Is Ryan a pawn to the ones he loves or is he really family. Someone who is willing to do anything for the people closest to him despite being on the edge of what's right and what's wrong ,and where he stands as an officer and a family member. Is there more corruption than meets the eye? Will the mistakes of some cost lives of others,or jealousy? It's nice to get a show like this that feels like a movie every time I watch it.

1409,Gang Related," Character drive, great cast! Awesome show.","Gang Related offers tremendous promise; well cast, stylistic in design, emotional and character driven, by the second episode, I was already hooked. The show takes place in Los Angeles, and follows Ryan Lopez, an esteemed detective of a gang task force, struggling to distance himself from his past (and current) connections to a notorious Latino gang. Ryan's story feels very well-crafted, and it's easy to sympathize with his position, being a double agent who truly wants to do the right thing. As a devoted fan of Sons of Anarchy and Breaking Bad (the later of which is similar in story-line), I think Gang Related could become one of the more stimulating, edgier shows on the Fox network. Some viewers complain about the lack of vulgar language coming from the gang members. I think this is purely idiotic. Yes, we know networks are limited in certain ways, but slighting a show based on lack of profanity says more about the viewer than it does the creators. The show also has a great soundtrack, and the cinematography and set-design is fantastic. But above all, there is a great story to be told, so if you're into that kind of thing, you know, TV shows that actually tell stories and delve into dimensional characters, then give Gang Related a chance.",10 out of 14 found this helpful.,,2 June 2014

1413,Gang Related, Good first episode,"I know that it's just TV, but the premise that the LAPD would hire any gang member without knowing about it is false on its face. Absent political misdirection and interference, background investigations on potential new hires, working gang units and intelligence files would have early-on identified and disqualified a gang affiliate for police service.<br/><br/>What's missing in this somewhat naive story about the LAPD and gang influence, are the truer underlying facts that had helped destroy the full credibility of a once incorruptible LAPD.<br/><br/>The Department had been forced by the City's liberal and politically correct politicians to hire some police recruits who had criminal records, including a few who were documented gang members. <br/><br/>One of the results was ""The Rampart Scandal."" Look it up. The core cause was the City's so-called ""diversifying"" hiring standards. These are the same standards that hired the likes of convicted Officer Rafael Perez, the core cause of the ""Rampart Scandal"" and subsequent public distrust of the underlying culture of the Los Angeles Police Department.<br/><br/>The L.A. Times reported in May of 2003 that Ruben Palomares, a former Rampart Division officer awaiting sentencing on drug trafficking charges in San Diego, was being investigated for allegedly overseeing a ring of drug and robbery suspects suspected of committing dozens of robberies in Southern California over several years. Current or former officers of the LAPD, Long Beach Police Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department were also involved. Other members of the ring, which was believed to number more than a dozen people, included security guards and a professional female boxer. Also named was a prison guard and former Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy Rodrigo Duran.<br/><br/>Another alleged member of the ring was LAPD Officer William Ferguson, ""who had been arrested five times before he was hired by the department."" Ferguson had also worked at Rampart during the same time as Perez, and had a string of disciplinary problems at the LAPD. This is further concrete evidence that the liberal hiring standards that accompanied affirmative action programs instilled in Los Angeles and elsewhere, continue to be directly responsible for the degrading of both the reputation and effectiveness of law enforcement everywhere.<br/><br/>But watch it. Very entertaining. Even for me.<br/><br/>Okay, I watched the next episode. Getting harder to watch. Far too unrealistic. Gangs don't have that much power to operate in LA. <br/><br/>Richard M.

You examine the issues honestly. You don't get that here. You get a stupid car chase where gang members are trying to hijack a brinks truck but then attach an explosive mine to it? WTF? Oh..and the kid that gets his arm broken one scene but is okay just a few moments later? <br/><br/>The producers of this show should be embarrassed.,12 out of 30 found this helpful.,1.0,24 May 2014

1420,Gang Related, Big holes...,"Contains spoilers about plot points up to the 5th episode.<br/><br/>There is some charm in this show and a pretty good premise that hasn't been seen that much on TV. The actors are pretty good, but the characters are almost all one-dimensional and predictable along with the interaction between them. <br/><br/>But those are minor problems when compared to the plot holes that keep piling on, episode after episode. <br/><br/>The ones that bother me?<br/><br/>One Russian gang-leader is arrested for human trafficking and they refuse to distribute drugs for the main gang because he isn't released.<br/><br/>Why? Why would they expect that the Los Angelicos could get some human trafficker and baby seller out of jail? They have no idea that the LA's have an undercover operative in the law enforcement so why would they even ask somebody to do this and even less make the slave traders release a requirement to do business?<br/><br/>The second major problem is that when RZA's character has the cleanest shooting ever in police history and he is suspended for it because lawsuits...<br/><br/>It's like they have to keep the police officer spotless for us to care about his problem all the while they want us to believe that this would be the reason for his trouble. <br/><br/>I mean, they have a kid that opened fire in a club while high on some tainted drug, who killed/wounded other civilians before opening fire on one police officer who took a hit in his vest BEFORE he was then shot by RZA's character with a single well aimed shot to the heart. Police have eyewitnesses against the kid. They have a bullet from the kids gun in a police officers vest and GSR on the kids hands. <br/><br/>And this is the case that the LAPD/FBI/DEA would be scared to get sued over, so scared that they would react the way that they did?<br/><br/>There are lot more problems like these in the writing, making me think that they have a general idea about a cop show but they lack the skill to make any sense in the interaction of the characters and making the problems they face seem even remotely realistic.<br/><br/>But hey, what the hell would i know...",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,4.0,20 June 2014
1421,Gang Related," The Departed, but in L.A","The show opens with a historical background of the main character. From there, it goes to in your face police car chase action. A good opening that sets the tone of the pilot and reveals just enough to keep you wanting more.<br/><br/>The show, if it's anything like the pilot, has many good qualities to it in terms of plot. The premise is that a cross-agency Gang Task Force has been put together by the L.A.P.D, under the leadership of the L.A.P.D. This in itself is already an interesting plot point, and on top of that more intrigue is inserted later in the pilot.<br/><br/>As far as casting goes, Cliff Curtis does his good old Cartel/Gang leader bid as well as he always does. Terry 'O Quinn is still a bit difficult to buy as a Police Captain. People will complain about RZA's accent, or even his very presence. I honestly do not have an issue with it. He plays the role aptly, and so does every one in the show. For the most part.<br/><br/>This show has potential, but can easily go wrong, as with all Cop Dramas. But seeing as it isn't that entirely, perhaps there is a place in the TV world for this one.",4 out of 10 found this helpful.,7.0,23 May 2014

I think the show will be exciting either way. I kept waiting for Ryan to spill his guts to Chapel as to what he had been doing all along. Another promising spin, especially if Javier lives, is the relationship between the DA and Javier. The show has set up several stories lines outside of Ryan.

1425,Even Stevens, One of the funniest shows ever made,"Even Stevens is one of my top 10 shows of all time. The characters are great. A lot of people don't like Beans, but I think he can be hilarious. The supporting cast is excellent, but the show belongs to Shia. He's a superb actor (everyone on the show is, in my opinion). The writing is witty, clever, and original, and some episodes literally have me laughing for over half an hour (and most shows are unable to elicit more than a chuckle from me). It's too bad there's a 65-episode limit, 'cause I'd definitely like to see some new episodes (although most of 'em I haven't seen). Anyway, if you have Disney Channel, give it a try.

1427,Even Stevens, Top Notch,"Let's face it the Disney Channel has never been a place for high quality TV that enlightens as well as entertains, the exception being ""Avonlea"". Still, the show ""Even Stevens"" is one of the best shows on the network. The family dynamics really make the show work. Whether, it's the antagonistic relationship of Ren and Louis or the nurturing one between Eileen and Ren. However, when the show shifts to the school things become a lot less realistic and harder to swallow. No principal would play favorites with his/her students! No cafeteria serves food that completely gross, and I'm only 19 so I do remember what cafeteria food looks like. Still, the home life makes the school life easier to take. The actors are wonderful and I wouldn't be surprised to see Shia LaBoeuf in the movies, actual movies not the Disney Channel ones, and becoming very famous.",24 out of 25 found this helpful.,,15 May 2002
1428,Even Stevens, I can't stop laughing!,"I can't stop laughing during this show! watching Even Stevens is the most hilarious 30 minutes of my day.  Shia and A.J. make the show fun for the girls to watch.  In an extreme sense, it allows an insight to the inner workings of the teenage boys' mind.  Christy Carlson-Romano adds a fun flair as well, because her character Ren often foils the boys' plans.  Her love life is often a mess, and Louis seems to sense that.  He initially seeks to rub more salt in the wound, but ends up consoling Ren in the end.  He has a huge heart, that is often misunderstood until the very end of the episode, and we are left loving Louis (until the next time).",30 out of 32 found this helpful.,,10 December 2003

The casting was perfect and the acting was spectacular. I'm disappointed that Disney dwells so much on Lizzie McGuire, though. Even Stevens is just as funny, only from a boy AND girls point of view, not just a 13 year old girl.

1432,Even Stevens, Even Stevens is the best show on Disney Channel,I loved Even Stevens! I think I was in high school when I first started watching it and I believe it was in its 3rd season. I was actually sad when I realized the show was over. This was truly a missed opportunity that Disney goofed on. This show was going somewhere. It should have at least had 1 or 2 more seasons. Happy to see all the hype around it now... it shows i wasn't the only one who felt this way.<br/><br/>The comedy was also different.. it had something for everyone to enjoy.<br/><br/>I've been watching it nonstop on Disney+,5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,14 November 2019
1433,Even Stevens, Pretty Darn Good,"Even Stevens is an exception for Disney shows.  Most of the time Disney pops out shows that are too teeny bopper(Lizzie McGuire), too corny(The Jersey), too boring(The Proud Family), or too dumb(So Weird).  So when I watched Even Stevens for the first time, I expected the worst.  What I got was the exact opposite.  I think Shia Labouef is a GREAT actor.  He has wit, charm, and doesn't come off as if he's trying too hard to make you laugh.  Christy Romano is a perfect example of the too perfect teen.  I relate to her which even makes her never-ending quest to be too perfect not seem annoying. Plus she isn't a Britney Spears wannabe showing her midriff every chance she gets.  Nick Spano is just there for girls to lust over(he is pretty hot), but when he gets a chance to act(not just lift weights without a shirt on, or prance around in a sports uniform) he amazes me.  He is cute but not in an overwhelming boy band way, and he acts like a normal guy.  He isn't too dumb(calling Ethan Craft from Lizzie McGuire) and isn't too jock.  Donna Pescow is a GREAT actress.  She pulls off the part of Mom without being too preachy or mushy or hard-core.  Tom Virtue reminds me so much of my dad that it scares me. A. J. Trauth is a perfect accomplice to Shia Labouef, leveling out Shia's craziness with a dose of normal pre-teen.  Teens and kids will like this show.  Parents may be a little bored, but my mom laughs each time Coach Tugnutt says a line.  This is the Disney channel charm, and, believe it or not, Disney actually made it.",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,,5 August 2002
1434,Even Stevens, The beginnings of hyper-absurdity comedy sitcoms. (minor spoilers),"Even Stevens, surprisingly only on the air for three years, was great entertainment for teenage audiences (and younger ones, too) for the simple fact that Shia La Beouf can really make you laugh.<br/><br/>The Stevens are your typical Disney-esquire family arrangement. Concerned mother, sometimes doofus father, stupid older son, brainy over achieving daughter, and the cooky youngest son, Louis (La Beouf). Over time, many members of the family receded from the spotlight as the plots eventually came to revolve more and more around the trials and tribulations of Ren, the older sister, and Louis. Often, their individual adventures and misadventures conflicted with one another. Somehow, Louis's wild, happy-go-lucky plans for fun and mischief often got in the way of Ren's quest for perfection and all the honest values her character consistently espouses. So often, they would butt heads, but in a way that ended in those moralistic endings with sister and brother getting along in the end.<br/><br/>But, really, despite a more dominant presence of Christy Romano, who played Ren, Shia La Beouf was the pure gem of the show, and probably the biggest catch for audiences, particularly among young girls who would love the goofy mischief of Louis and his equally goofy friend, Twitty (AJ Trauth). Beouf has a natural ability to really make you laugh, even though you're just watching a silly and albeit, corny, Disney television series for younger kids. Especially, during the shows when Louis and Twitty were trying to buy brand name shoes to fit in with the fleeting fashion tastes of their fellow classmates; when they formed the band and had a real superficial rock n' roll experience with the full rise and fall of success and friendship; when they made the student film; or when Twitty and Louis took over the janitor's closet to create their own authentic Mexican fiesta lounge. These kids really knew how to make you laugh, and the writers took advantage of that, by creating some bizarre and funny situations for the young actors.<br/><br/>Even Stevens is a funny show because it doesn't hang on to the tired obsessions that other young characters on television may do like Lizzy Macguire or the terrible range of sitcoms on the WB where it is all a high school drama over boyfriends and girlfriends. Even Stevens offered a lot more and was more of a show about camaraderie.<br/><br/>I suspect the show came to an end when it's young stars really got too old to play their respective parts, what with La Beouf and Trauth both approaching their late teens and Romano approaching her early twenties (and Donny, the eldest, approaching his forties, no less). But it was an innocent, funny show that I recommend younger audiences trying out. Unfortunately, Disney reruns the same ones over and over. But check it out. La Beouf won't disappoint you.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,,27 August 2004
1435,Even Stevens, Pretty Cool...,"This show is pretty cool. I wouldn't jump in right away and say it's the best show in the world, but I like it.

I was upset to hear this show is ending and I think Disney is making a horrible mistake canceling it's two best shows (Even Stevens and Lizzie McGuire), and bringing in these new not so good shows(That's So Raven, The Proud Family and Kim Possible).

1436,Even Stevens, One of Disney's Bests,"I LOVED Even Stevens when I was in my late preteens/early teens. I thought it was hilarious and I was a huge Shia LaBeouf fan and wannabe at the time. I'm in my early '30s now and I've gone back and rewatched it on Disney+ and I still think it's hilarious (though to be fair, part of it is because of the nostalgia). Like Heavyweights and (animated) Aladdin, it's one of those rare Disney projects that's less cute and cuddly and more cool and confident. I think what makes the show work is that it's one of those things in the entertainment world that takes a plot that is very real and relatable and it simply exaggerates it for comical purposes, but still manages to keep its feet on the ground which, I think, places it in the vein of Mean Girls (which I've also really liked since I was a teen). Shia LaBeouf (who won an Emmy for his performance) and Christy Carlson Romano are the real MVPs with their performances as bro and sis, Louis and Ren. LaBeouf, delivers a nonstop hilarious performance while still making Louis someone more than just ""the annoying little brother"". Romano delivers a pristine performance that is both sophisticated and comical that makes Ren more than just ""the overachieving big sister"". The entire Stevens family is brought to life effortlessly by a company of actors who bring an hyperbolically funny yet down-to-earth ambiance to the family. They very much look and feel like a family you could know, like and identify with. The humor is very diverse because it contains humor in all comical facets: Quips, Visuals, Audios, Physicals and Situations. The cast and crew treat all the characters with fairness and parity. Fairness, because they let the boys be boys and the girls be girls. Parity, because they find a lot of common ground between all the characters, such as such as the humor, situations and music, regardless of their gender and other differences. If you remembered and loved ES like I did almost 20 years ago or you've never heard of it, add it to your Disney+ watchlist and have fun. It's cool, confident and sadly underrated.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,3 January 2020

Of all the Disney show offering in the Disney channel, this is the only one that I watch the full 30mins. Shia Lebouf is a true highlight for the show, same goes Christy Carlson-Romano in many ways. Other than the two mentioned (Shia and Christy), there are other unforgettable characters (in which I'm gonna mention their screen names) like Tawnee, Twitty, Coach Tugnut, Principal Rumsfield, Bean, and many more. Even the weird musicals they throw in sometimes sounds great(thanks to Christy's voice, since most of the musical scenes star her), fits the show's theme well, and is unusually well choreographed for a TV show.<br/><br/>The only thing I don't like much in the show is the claymation intro (in which I find looking very old), since that didn't attract me to the show when I first saw it. EVENtually (pardon the pun), I did get into the show. The first one I watched is the one where Shia thought that Twitty's ex-GF has a crush on her.

LOL Interesting in the manner that makes people slow down to view the details of a car wreck, Nightmares often provides an uplifting story of a group of people getting it together to run their business properly for the very first time. Sadly, there are those that are so stubborn, and/or so inept, that they fail despite Gordon's intervention.<br/><br/>There is a lot of bad language and bad food, so this is not for small children.

And Kitchen Nightmares is proof that sometimes, one voice IS enough to stop a restaurant from serving crap.<br/><br/>This is an American version of his original British program, which is just as much a guilty pleasure as the Yankee version. Essentially the rundown is this: A restaurant, somewhere in America, is struggling. It could be due to shitty food or shitty management/service... or maybe even both. After tasting their cheapjack food, Ramsay observes what goes on in the kitchen, and then does what it takes to get the restaurant back on it's feet, for once and for all.<br/><br/>Ramsay is brutal as frack. A seasoned tongue, it's just so fun to watch him suffer dealing with morons and bad food, one couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy! His brilliance just doesn't end. I'll admit one of the reasons I love this show is I'm. A world traveler, and one of the things I keep an active interest in is cuisine.

It is excellent. I don't want to see a bunch of staged drama (Similar to the fake drama in Cake Boss). I want reality, something that is missing from reality TV! I want to watch Gordon identify the problems, and fix the problems. Along the way, show me how the food is made and improved upon. And by the way, does Gordon really hate every single first meal he has at these restaurants? The chefs can't be that bad, at least not some of them anyway.",21 out of 27 found this helpful.,6.0,24 May 2011

1453,Kitchen Nightmares, An enjoyable reality series,"After my wife got me addicted to Hell's Kitchen (US) during its first season, we've jumped at the opportunity to watch every show or series we could with Gordon in it.<br/><br/>We had previously watched several episodes of his show ""The F Word"" before eventually getting bored with it. This show, however, seems to be much more entertaining and worth watching. If you enjoy documentaries and/or reality shows, this series might be worth watching. To me, this series is to the restaurant industry as The Biggest Loser is to the obese. Although Kitchen Nightmares is not in any way a competitive series, its ultimate goal is very similar to that of The Biggest Loser. Where TBL takes several fat people (some of whom are heart attacks waiting to happen) and ""saves"" them by whipping them into shape and making them skinny again, Kitchen Nightmares each week showcases a single restaurant on the verge of shutting down due to any number of reasons (food quality, service, management, organization, etc) and attempts to transform the business into one that is popular and profitable.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of Gordon's ""consultant"" skills. He does bring out some of his brutally honest mannerisms in this series, but he doesn't take it to extremes like he's some drill sergeant constantly yelling at recruits. Although he does occasionally get in face-to-face jawing matches with some of the people involved, he does often show a more human side, being very professional and down to earth with the owner(s) of each restaurant and telling them what he thinks needs to change. He helps them by giving their dining area a makeover and occasionally replaces old, run down kitchen equipment with new and fancy ones. He's also good about complementing the restaurants and individuals on any positive changes he observes.<br/><br/>While one of the other posters wrote about the US version lacking some features present in the UK version of the show (which I don't see as a problem because Americans and Britons often have different tastes anyway), I will agree that the series could be improved by including a segment on how each showcased restaurant is doing several months after Gordon's visit. Such an inclusion would certainly be nice to see, but it might have been deliberately left out for a good reason - why cut out other dramatic details that are definitely worth leaving in the show when they can always throw in 1-2 episodes dedicated specifically to the ""how are they now"" questions later in the season (or even 1 at the mid-point and another at the end of the season)?",32 out of 47 found this helpful.,8.0,12 October 2007
1454,Kitchen Nightmares, Ramsay makes the show.,"Hell's Kitchen introduced me to Gordon Ramsay. The commercials for that show portray him as a harsh tyrant in a chef's jacket. This is not the case on Hell's Kitchen or on Kitchen Nightmares. Kitchen Nightmares is an enjoyable show that allows the viewer to better understand what goes on behind the scenes of the restaurant business. Part of the the show's entertainment though lies in the incompetence and arrogance of those working in the restaurants Gordon Ramsay sets out to rescue. Without Gordon Ramsay, this show would find itself on The Food Network or TLC. He truly makes the show great as he is hard but fair. He seeks to raise the bar to improve skills, decor and ultimately business. As he does this, it makes for a fairly entertaining reality show.",25 out of 37 found this helpful.,7.0,21 November 2007

1457,Kitchen Nightmares, Total Trash TV,"It's sad to see what has happened to this show in its American incarnation.<br/><br/>Typical of American television, and of Fox in particular, the wonderful BBC original ""Kitchen Nightmares"" has been Jerry Springer-ized for the U.S. market.<br/><br/>Let's review each show, shall we? There's the:<br/><br/>1. short intro of troubled restaurant <br/><br/>2. Gordon arrives, eats, makes catty remarks about the food <br/><br/>3. confronts chef/owner, initiates shouting match <br/><br/>4. more shouting in the kitchen (""it's rotten!"".""the kitchen is closed!""..""you're going to kill people!"") <br/><br/>5 Totally phony ""drama"" as Gordon morphs into Dr. Phil and holds a family therapy session for the beleaguered owners. Lots of phony tears, lots of phony ""concern"" from Gordon.<br/><br/>6. chef/owner resists Gordon's changes, more shouting <br/><br/>7. Gordon's people remodel restaurant, Gordon introduces new menu <br/><br/>(repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 here, then cue the...)<br/><br/>8. happy ending, chef/owner admits how right Gordon was and they were wrong<br/><br/>The change in tone from the British version is jarring -- in the BBC incarnation, Gordon's critiques of the food are exactly what you'd expect from a professional chef who genuinely wants to help get a troubled eating establishment back on its feet.<br/><br/>In the American version, his comments are rude, crass, and boorish -- obviously meant to elicit the kind of hooting and howling reaction that you see from an audience on the Jerry Springer Show. Would any true professional, when tasting a not-so-great meal, call it ""a big pile of pubic hair""? But at least it gets the mouth-breathers who watch Fox hooting, right on cue. Add to that, it now seems every restaurant is now family owned, which gives the dullards at Fox the chance to give us fake, phony, staged family therapy sessions. Anyone who really thinks they're seeing anything ""real"" on this show needs to have their head examined.<br/><br/>And EVERY show has him saying ""this is the worst meal I've ever had in my entire life!"" Yeah, right. Phony.<br/><br/>There seems to be a conscious effort to get people screaming at each other as quickly as possible (this way, the idiot narrator can say ""next week's show is Gordon's biggest...challenge...YET!""). His favorite method is to call the chef/manager/owner ""a fake"", and that usually does the trick (which is kind or ironic, since that's exactly what this show is), then when the person gets angry and argues back (or storms off), Gordon acts shocked (shocked! that there's gambling in Casablanca).<br/><br/>The British version was informative and entertaining.<br/><br/>This American version is absolute garbage.

Absolutely, this is television! All in all, it is refreshing to see a renowned chef come into a location and turn it around with his expertise as well as improve the decor. I would guess they pick locations where the owners are sure to clash with Gordon, but he can handle himself just fine. Some of the owners and chef's at these restaurants need a good kick in the pants to show them that just because you can own a restaurant or that you can cook, doesn't mean that you should. It is all about passion for what you do. I love the British TV version as well.

He shows compassion and respect when they work super hard and are only days away from failing and he gets so into it he almost cries. He's brought with joy when he reunites with old restaurant employees and you can see how much he's just trying to help. He's always making sure the chefs and employees are okay before he starts trying to change things. He asks for opinions and he tries to make everyone as comfortable as possible and he even goes through metaphorical and symbolic ways to help the health of the employees. The only reasons the businesses sometimes end up failing is because 1. They resort back to their old ways or 2. They can't handle it financially. One of my favorite shows to watch especially to see how hard it is behind the scenes. After learning about how much Gordon went through filming that show, I show so much respect. He ate so much raw meat he got food poisoning for a month, he's eaten moldy food, old food and all to figure out what he was dealing with in the kitchen. He's sacrificed his own health for the better health of the others around him. Nothing but respect for him.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,9.0,7 March 2021

No Management would EVER tolerate a chef like Ramsey, no matter how talented he may be. At the end of the day it's about coaching, guidance, mentoring and motivation. Not nervous breakdowns, strain, stress, aggression and vitriol. Sure these places have problems, but the solutions do not lie in a 7 day fix. Clean Kitchens and stores require training, education of hygiene practices, process analysis and much more.

Ramsey's punch-to-the-face constructive criticism never gets old.<br/><br/>What makes this show work is the fact Ramsey is a 16 michelin star chef and the restaurant chefs are regional. So the dynamic of how they will respond to Ramsey builds up for the chaotic drama.<br/><br/>Watch this because no one dishes constructive criticism like Gordan.

1468,Kitchen Nightmares, Entertaining and Action-Packed,"In Kitchen Nightmares, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay performs restaurant makeovers.<br/><br/>Ramsay visits restaurants that are losing money and about to close. He investigates problems, cleans up kitchens, updates menus, redecorates dining rooms.<br/><br/>This TV show isn't educational. It's mainly just entertainment. It isn't really about food; it's about people. Although it might be described as reality TV, much of what's presented isn't entirely true.<br/><br/>The recurring theme is that restaurants are failing, and they're failing because the owners or managers are delusional. Their food's perfect. It's the best. Customers aren't returning and the restaurants are losing money. No idea why, but it can't be the food. The food's terrible. No, it's the best. No, it's disgusting. No, people love it.<br/><br/>Of course, the food is always the problem, or at least that's the way Ramsay tells it.<br/><br/>Many restaurants have complained, after the their episodes aired, that they were misrepresented. Some have even sued. So who's right and who's wrong?<br/><br/>Kitchen Nightmares is not a documentary. It's about entertainment. The events shouldn't be taken as literally true, because in many cases, they aren't. Statements are taken out of context. Snippets of video are pieced together to create fights that never happened. Crucial details are intentionally suppressed.<br/><br/>One episode shows a cook dropping a piece of chicken on the floor, picking it up, and placing it back in a fryer. What they left off the show: the cook wasn't an employee at the restaurant. He was hired by the producers of Kitchen Nightmares to work there temporarily, while they were filming.<br/><br/>That the events are sensationalized is self-evident. In nearly every episode preview, the narrator proclaims that the next restaurant to be helped is 'the worst restaurant ever' on the show, or 'the most disgusting kitchen', or the episode is 'the most explosive'.<br/><br/>While Kitchen Nightmares is not literally accurate, it does effectively convey what Ramsay feels. Restaurant owners don't want to face reality, don't listen to feedback, and won't change. The steak's undercooked. No, it's good. The onions are burnt. No, they're correct. The customers are unhappy. Well, they're wrong. Customers aren't coming back. My food's the best. We have to fix these problems. No, we don't need to change anything. So Ramsay resorts to yelling, swearing, drama, and over-the-top theatrics. Explaining calmly didn't work, so maybe something else will.<br/><br/>Having been to hundreds of restaurants myself, I'm fairly sure Ramsay is right about this point. Whether they are ultimately good or not, the vast majority of restaurants refuse to listen to criticism and can't fix mistakes.<br/><br/>And this is where Kitchen Nightmares is brilliant. It takes a fairly complex industry and makes it accessible. We see what Ramsay sees. We face challenges as he faces them. We experience his vocation.<br/><br/>Kitchen Nightmares glorifies Gordon Ramsay. Nearly all episodes end on a happy note. Ramsay has turned things around. He's their savior. They can be proud of their food again. Does Ramsay deserve such high praise?<br/><br/>The real numbers are grim. About two-thirds of restaurants on Kitchen Nightmares closed within a few years. 80 percent have now closed. Maybe Ramsay's method of screaming at people doesn't teach them anything. Maybe most people simply aren't capable of learning. Maybe the TV show was just about money. Maybe people aren't willing to change.<br/><br/>It's unclear how much Ramsay has helped these restaurants. Different viewers will come to different conclusions. What isn't controversial is this: it was a fast-paced, eventful, provocative attempt.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,8.0,20 December 2020

1470,Kitchen Nightmares, This is the best reality TV series.,"Every episode of Kitchen Nightmares is the same. There's a failing restaurant, and we get an overview of the restaurant and why it's failing. The problems vary from a stubborn chef, a spineless owner, a clueless staff, or some mix of the above, but one thing is common: the food is terrible, but the owners don't seem to believe that. Gordon comes in, sees the restaurant, tries the food (big shock, he doesn't like the food) and he tells the owners that the food is not good, and the owners disagree and insist that their food is good, which leaves Chef Ramsay speechless. Later that night, he observes a terrible dinner service and then later inspects a more than filthy kitchen and Ramsay is furious. After getting the owners on board with change (which takes some time), they relaunch the menu (and most of the time, the decor), and the relaunch is a success, with the exception of a minor hiccup. That is your average Kitchen Nightmares episode........and I love it! There's something hypnotic about watching stubborn people so deep in denial getting yelled at by a decorated chef over how terrible their service and food are. My only concern with this show is how dramatized it is. They seem to focus more on drama between family and coworkers than they do on how a restaurant operates. In addition, some of the exercises Gordon Ramsay does with the owners seemed pointless. There was one episode that took place in a courtroom halfway through and two episodes had the owners boxing their feelings out. Those felt bizarre, like it was purely for theatrics. Other than that, I enjoyed this show.

1472,Kitchen Nightmares, What do restaurants must do to be part of that show?,"Restaurants who take part of that show will receive a huge advertising boost: they become ""endorsed"" by a 3 Stars Chef; that same Chef always organizes a special night where, oh coincidence, a local food celebrity just decides to come; and as a bonus, the restaurant receives a free overnight complete re-modeling (new furniture, new paintings, new roof, new lighting, etc...). So I guess that a few thousands are queuing up. What must they do to become the lucky ones? 1) Pay money to Fox or Ramsey Inc? 2) Look as miserable as possible.... The show will only work if the kitchen is in disarray, and there is a juicy familial or management problem. I suppose that some restaurants must brainstorm about how to arrange a total mess so that they have a chance to appear. Now the recipes of Gordon are as simple as the problem: father MUST delegate to son, simple menu, fresh ingredients, stop using microwave, taste the food, fire some unmotivated staff. Well, if life were that easy, there would be much more Michelin starred restaurants that there are now.... What about the logistical nightmare about keeping quality suppliers, minimize stock food to keep it fresh, trying new recipes for hours until the cook finds the perfect combination... this is what kitchen is all about, and you learn in with years of practice, now with a magician shouting common sense advice.

1474,Camelot, Morgen Steals the Show,"This series was amazing...except for Arthur. It was so enjoyable because it was so true to Sir Thomas Mallory's work while still retaining its own interpretation. I actually appreciated some of the changes to the story they made because it helped to drive the characters more. Eva Green's Morgen was stunning and powerful; she was possibly the best and truest Morgen ever portrayed on the screen. The character was so well rounded and had so much depth left out of previous Morgens. She wasn't just a villain; all of her actions had an understandable justification and the watch can really feel sorry for her (especially when her brother was portrayed as such a irritating jerk). Joseph Fiennes' Merlin was equally as stunning and interesting, bring a delightful, more youthful yet old-aged soul interpretation to a well known character.<br/><br/>But the casting directors did a horrendous job of casting Arthur. I understand they were attempting to make a point that Arthur did not start out as the great king he became known as, but they failed to recognize that despite his initial youth Arthur still had something about him that made people follow him. This Arthur is simply whiny, childish, and truly disappointing. Had a stronger Arthur been cast, I think this show would have enjoyed at least a second season.<br/><br/>Despite the weakness in Arthur though, I really loved this series.

1475,Camelot, Camelot for wimps,"The biggest problem Camelot has is the lead Actor Jamie Bower, he looks like a feminine underwear model, he has no muscle tone at all and looks like a complete wimp. The only reason I can see casting him is to attract girls who are 14-17 (due to his roles in Potter and Twilight), the problem is, this is not a show for that age group.<br/><br/>Jame Bower brings no charisma or charm to the character Arthur, I find myself rooting for Morgana then I do Arthur. Mr. Bower has such a feminine look to him you can't even tell him apart from Guenevere when they do there sex scene.<br/><br/>He was a major miscast for the role. If the producers wanted to show Arthur as a spoiled self-centered 16 year old then they should of gotten an appropriate actor. The script for Arthur is definitely written for a 16 year old so I'm not sure why they would get someone who doesn't even look the right age, so basically you have someone who looks like there in there 20's but acts like someone who is 16. It all comes off as very annoying.<br/><br/>Other issues the show has is sloppy writing, they don't setup a foundation for the new lore and there scripts are kind of all over the place story wise, they leave a lot of plot holes that never get explained and it seems there trying to cram to much into each episode.<br/><br/>The show would probably be a hit on the CW Network for a much younger audience (remove the nudity), but with Spartacus and Game of Thrones setting the bar very high for premium cable shows, Camelot falls short.",212 out of 333 found this helpful.,4.0,22 April 2011

I love the rest of the cast though. Eva Green and Joseph Fiennes are fantastic as well as the rest of the supporting cast. Fiennes giving a more gritty, realistic feeling to Merlin than just an all powerful wizard is also refreshing.

Most obvious miscast character is that of Arthur, who not only doesn't look the part but acts as unkingly as is humanly possible, which to be fair is more a consequence of the lamentable screenplays as it is a measure of his inability to pull off a convincing performance.<br/><br/>And this brings me to the script. God forbid the producers of this execrable pile of horse droppings might have deigned it worthwhile to peruse the various medieval writings, or even contemporary re-workings, of the Arthurian Legend for suitable source material but how on earth could they imagine that seemingly making it up as they go along would in any way convince the viewers that the tale is in anyway believable or inspiring.<br/><br/>I have read a few excellent contemporary novels set in the Dark Ages, the best of which is most definitely Bernard Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles series, so it isn't true that there is nothing new to say about Arthur et al. It is a continual disappointment that there are still producers out there who think throwing in a few breasts and pretty faces is all it needs to make a winning production. It does not. We know it so why don't the producers? It takes the sort of source material that is winning fans of Game of Thrones, which though not without it's flaws has a great story, great scripts and great believable performances.<br/><br/>Sadly another missed opportunity.",91 out of 138 found this helpful.,4.0,5 June 2011
1479,Camelot, Truly Dire,"Plot: Blah blah blah King Arthur blah dreadful soap opera blah pseudo- historical rubbish.<br/><br/>King Arthur is the most enduring British myth and the only positive that can be taken from this truly dreadful series is that the myth will survive it and go on to better things. Camelot is a perfect example of how not to make a King Arthur TV series. Arthur and his knights are all played by effeminate looking metrosexuals without an ounce of charisma or testosterone between them (but with plenty of whining). The women all look like they've come from an MTV reality TV show. Guinevere and Arthur both have such long blonde hair that in the (laughable) sex scenes it is difficult to tell them apart. It is set in some pseudo-historical period which means that everyone wears the sort of boring pseudo-medieval clothes worn in every dreadful fantasy film since the 1980s. The script is supposed to be a mix of adventure, intrigue and relationships but it comes off as a bad soap opera instead. The saving graces are James Purefoy (rough, tough, helluva lot of fun) and Eva Green (beautiful) but even they can't save this turkey. Ignore this and read the High Medieval knight errant stories instead.",25 out of 35 found this helpful.,,7 July 2011
1480,Camelot, Why is King Arthur such a dick?,"I can't stand this version of Arthur. Sure I wondered like many reviewers whether the casting was appropriate, and it's probably not. However, it's not so much the acting that makes him bad, but the writing. I've always been under the impression that Arthur was meant to be the embodiment of chivalry. Obviously I was wrong. It seems that the legend that inspired the beliefs of an overwhelming number of European monarchs and noblemen over the last 1500 years or so was simply an utter tool. It makes you wonder what the various reformists and visionaries were aspiring too. Did Edward I think to himself ""how could I possibly be a better king? Oh I know, I shall embody all the dickery of King Arthur and then everyone'll think I'm well good."" Did Henry V decide ""I know how to inspire my men before Agincourt, act like the once and future prick."" I highly doubt it. Wasn't Arthur raised by Ector so he wasn't completely loathable once he ascended? <br/><br/>Sucky lead character aside there's still very little to take many positives from. The knights are more than underdeveloped. One of the great things about the Arthurian legend is that his knights have intriguing and profound stories of their own, enabling strong rounded characters. Not here though. All 5 of his knights (yeah that's right 5, he's running the whole of Britain with 5 men) may as well be turd stuffed marionettes. There's more depth on Sesame Street. If you don't believe me you tube James Blunt's My Triangle. Comparatively it's touching and emotionally fulfilling. Plus, who the hell is Leontes? They just made him up. Really, they weren't able to pick any other name associated with the knights of the round table? And who's Ulfius? He couldn't be more of a stereotype token. He has about one line in the whole season only to be killed. If they had to fill an employment quota regarding ethnic minorities there are about three Arabian knights associated with the Arthurian legend.<br/><br/>Obviously there are conflicting sources so I expected liberties to be taken with the story line. The problem is they've over done it. Certain story elements need to stay canonical, but they've been completely changed. By doing this it makes the story no more about the Arthurian legend than Arthur 2: On the Rocks. Otherwise just make it a sword and sorcery show that's influenced by source material. And if the shows makers claim it's their version of what is essentially a made up story, then I say their version's rubbish. It looks and feels like a children's programme, only with boobs.<br/><br/>Which is really the shows only saving grace, boobs, boobs and more boobs. Tons of them, swinging boobs, pert boobs, groped boobs, big boobs, little boobs, medium boobs and the occasional muff. Actually it's totally possible to play Where's Wally when it comes to lady pubes. They're not in every episode, but if you spot them in amongst the lallies it feels like you deserve a prize.<br/><br/>Well, I've given it 4 stars as I managed to watch every episode and I'm not saying don't watch it. I'm a sucker for sub-par programming, and to an extent it did entertain me. Ultimately it was a strange emotional ride, I detested a great deal, but Eva Green nude simply polished over the cracks.",46 out of 69 found this helpful.,4.0,12 June 2011
1481,Camelot, Worth Watching,"When I first watched Camelot, I went in with doubts. Like many critics have said, Bower is much too feminine a role to play the legendary King Arthur. Putting this into consideration I thought that Camelot would be a pointless show aimed at the same crowd as the Twilight fans. After watching the first episode, I felt myself drawn and completely absorbed into the story. Starz adds a new perspective to the old King Arthur tales. We get a detailed look at how Camelot comes to be and we see how the founding characters influence it's creation. If looked at without bias, I feel Bower does a good job as Arthur as we see a care free boy transform into a fearless leader. Joseph Fiennes does a fantastic Merlin, one I've never seen before, and Eva Green gets ""exposed"" multiple times in the season for you perverted men out there. Camelot is a show with lots of potential, a good cast, and a strong plot (especially because of a huge twist in the season finale). All in all, if watched without a preformed bias towards Jamie Bower, Camelot is a show definitely worth watching.",54 out of 84 found this helpful.,10.0,16 June 2011

I really couldn't wait for this.<br/><br/>And boy was I disappointed. What were the producers thinking??? Arthur is horrible. Completely miscast, Bower is too feminine, too wimpy, and a wholly ungifted actor. His performance is tedious, two dimensional and draining. In scenes with Eva Green he is getting cooked alive. It made for some very uncomfortable viewing. Chanel 4 what were you thinking buying this.<br/><br/>The writing, too simplistic, more suited to a child's version of the Arthurian legend. Flat, flawed, 2 dimensional and hammy to the bone. <br/><br/>Even Joseph Fiennes performance is lacking, he is too intense, trying to portray this mysterious Merlin but just ends up coming across as a ham.<br/><br/>Eva Green is the best thing in it, although the over acting bug seems to have affected her too, but not as much as the rest of the cast. Although she does come across as playing it too evil.<br/><br/>It looks good, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Not a patch on Game of Thrones, which has solid acting, believable characters and strong writing.

1484,Camelot, And through the field the road runs by to many-towered Camelot. -Tennyson,"""Camelot"" is literally a feast for the eyes, complete with multi-layers of cosmopolitan benefactions. There is also the absolutely breathtaking countryside cinematography, as well as an occasional glimpse of a dalliance unveiled, exposed, and vulnerable in more than one sense and all in context, of course. Moreover, as far as action, drama, plot structure and pacing is concerned, ""Camelot"" certainly works. I was interested, drawn in and found it very hard to leave my position on the couch for any reason, until it was over.<br/><br/>With his shaved head, expressive eyes and mercurial intensity, Joseph Fiennes is arguably the finest Merlin I have witnessed in my #$ years on this earth. The persona seems to possess him, or, possibly he has possessed it. Eva Green, as Morgan is simply begirded in the essence and romanticism of that which currently attracts young people to the Goth lifestyle. She is beautiful and mesmerizing in her character. I am a fan of James Purefoy, and as usual, this man can be anybody he wishes. He is a bad boy and carries it very well in ""Camelot."" Claire Forlani is exquisite and gives us Queen Igraine with a surprising core strength, rather than the pretty little one who must merely be saved. Jamie Campbell Bower, as Arthur, and Peter Mooney, as Kay, are delightful as two young cubs at play who must grow into great men of responsibility.<br/><br/>Between the two creators, Michael Hirst and Chris Chibnall, ""Elizabeth"", ""Tudor"", ""Spooks"", and/or ""Torchwood"" is firmly tucked under one or the other's belt. I find this impressive! I so look forward to watching the rest of this season knowing their combined genius will guide my viewing experience.<br/><br/>All things considered: the huge body of talent and accomplishment involved, this program being ""Camelot"" - the story of all stories - now being done on a quality series, along with the fact that we can easily access it on a couple of venues, I find myself looking forward to one, of a very few, exciting shows on the tele this year.

1485,Camelot, Could they have destroyed the story line any more?,"The only reason I gave it one star was for the costuming and the cinematography. The only thing the makers of this travesty stayed true to was the NAMES of the characters. Merlin doesn't seem to be a wizard through most of the first 3 parts - he's scared to use his powers because he can't control his dark side, and he's always getting the snot beat out of him. Arthur looks like he'd be more at ease in a skateboarding competition than in armor. Dude! Guinevere marries someone no one ever heard of in the Arthurian legends- Leontes (who was a character in Shakespeare's ""A Winter's Tale"") and Arthur acts a spoiled brat because he can't have her. Morgan is the only one who acts even close to the legends as an evil sorceress obsessed with power. Excalibur is not the sword in the stone after all, but Merlin has to have it made for Arthur.

Camelot is nothing compare to Game of Thrones.<br/><br/>There's nothing about Camelot that sets it apart as being very original or unpredicted; it's just a competent retelling with a few twists. There's no excitement. The plot is slow. This show is a complete waste of time. Merlin is also a rubbish actor,overacting in every scene. Where is his MAGIC anyway, he could of saved so many lives??

1488,Camelot," Arthur, Merlin and Excalibur. The immortal saga in new robes.","I have always liked watching movies and television shows that involve lost kings and magic and the sort. Call it a Lord of the Rings effect but I do enjoy them.<br/><br/>As for this show, I have seen the first 2 episodes and I have to say it is not riveting, but, sure is enjoyable. The story, well, everybody knows. Arthur is king, Morgan doesn't like it and will stop at nothing to get Camelot, Merlin can not let that happen and somewhere along the way there are knights in battles, bits of magic and the legendary Excalibur.<br/><br/>The characters are well cast. The young Arthur is believable as a boy who is thrust into kingship and battle, except for his few outbursts of ""kingliness"". Morgan, played by the gorgeous Eva Green, is the definition of Goth. Her acting may not be top notch but, she certainly is sensual. And Merlin , played by Joseph Fiennes, is way over the top. The words sinister and bad ass come to mind. It is a Merlin that we are not used to and it works for me. The rest of the cast is also pretty good and do their job well.<br/><br/>I am currently watching another series with the same background story, called ""Merlin"", so comparing the two is almost inevitable. I won't dispute the historical detail either of them use, because a bit of literary freedom doesn't hurt anyone. Anyways, where ""Merlin"" is light hearted, fun, easy paced and bursting at the seams with magic, ""Camelot"" is dark, sinister, fast paced and only hints at magic being involved.<br/><br/>Final words. There is lot on TV to choose these days. But, if you enjoy old legends or fantasy plots based on historical settings, I suggest you watch Camelot.

1490,Camelot, Not worth it,"I really wanted to like this show. Really, i tried, but watching it became too painful. The writing is bad, almost every scene is overacted, and the show gets bogged down by its many attempts to seem ""edgy"". I can't really blame them, though. This show was produced and developed by the same studio responsible for the modern Spartacus, and it was launched alongside Game of Thrones. I'm sure they got the memo on the importance of blood and boobs.<br/><br/>i was all ready to get into this show, i'm a fan of the Arthurian mythology, and I've been re- watching its various film incarnations for study. In this series, many elements of the Arthur myth are addressed, but never in the way the myth actually goes. The show goes out of its way to take the details of the original story, and make them more complicated. Much of this is done, quite obviously, to fill screen time. <br/><br/>What really bothered me was this show's interpretation of the classic Arthur/Gwenivere/Lancelot love triangle. In this version, Arthur is the other man, while Gwenivere is engaged to sir Leon. It becomes a major plot point: Arthur and Gwenivere have to hide their love, and the nature of jealousy is explored. I have two huge problems with this:<br/><br/>1) The king can't be blamed for being the other man in a love triangle. He's the king. He could demand sex from sir Kay, and everyone would just have to go with it. If this fantasy universe is supposed to be so dark and edgy, then they could have at least addressed this. 2) It weakens the Arthur character to make him the initiator of a sordid affair. His story represents chivalry in European society, and the element of betrayal in the legends liken him to Christ. It definitely goes against the original story to make Arthur a predatory womanizer.<br/><br/>Also, i couldn't help but notice how much this show ripped off famous fantasy franchises. Within the few episodes I could sit through, I saw this show blatantly copy visual elements from Excalibur (1981) and The Lord of the rings (2001).<br/><br/>If you've never heard the story of King Arthur, or don't know what good writing sounds like, you might be able to enjoy Camelot.

1491,Camelot, It's a good start !,The first two episodes are promising. So far the setting and clothing promises a nice foundation for a realistic representation of the time. In my opinion these kind of series depend on that the most ( when special effects or big battles look fake because of budget it loses credibility ) The nudity people discuss isn't to much in my opinion as long as it is there to strengthen the story and the characters.<br/><br/>The cast is good with some well known names and with a nice mysterious part for merlin so far. Arthur has yet to convince me since he's young and in my eyes not yet 'The King Arthur' you'd expect.<br/><br/>All in all a promising start.

Firstly, Jamie Campbell Bower ( who looks uncannily like Anneka Rice from British TV's ""Treasure Hunt"", complete with wispy beard!), has to be TV and cinema's worst ever King Arthur. His acting and character portrayal is so weak that that alone would ruin the show but it has to be said there are other factors here that make the series so abysmal. The plots are so simplistic and childish; some of them remind me of pantomimes where the characters are looking for the villains and the audience shout out, ""He's behind you!"" The dastardly Morgan Pendragon hatches scheme after scheme and always gets foiled only to fawn and scrape before Arthur and swear loyalty and live to plot anew. Episode 9 was particularly laughable; Arthur's forces creep up to Bardon Pass and occupy a tumbled down keep and then run away!<br/><br/>I can't see the film company that produce this series letting it run for another season, other, more worthy series have had the plug pulled on them.",22 out of 39 found this helpful.,1.0,5 June 2011
1493,Camelot, The Beginning of a New Series Based on Camelot,"Sturdy as the tale of Camelot is and despite both cinematic versions as well as the now famous musical based on the story, television has now taken on the tale and the results as seen by a solitary episode appear to be entertaining as well as a darker and more earthbound version of the dream kingdom of Camelot. As is usually the case with miniseries the writers vary from episode to episode (Michael Hirst, Thomas Malory, Louise Fox, Steve Lightfoot and Chris Chibnall) as well as the directors (Mikael Salomon, Ciaran Donnelly, Jeremy Podeswa, and Stefan Schwartz), but the cast remains the same and the overall feeling of the series is one that is seductively dark and has a real sense of a mixture of history and legend. <br/><br/>So far we have met King Uther as he dies passing on the crown to the King's unknown son Arthur (Jamie Campbell Bower), heretofore known as a commoner. Arthur's half sister Morgan (a sinister and beautiful Eva Green) is put in place as Arthur's nemesis, Arthur's journey to kingship is nurtured by Merlin (Joseph Fiennes), and weaving in and out of the opening episode are Queen Igraine (Claire Forlani) and the glowing Guinevere (Tamsin Egerton). Thus far the story is focused on a tough battle ahead for the charming young Arthur against the evil vixen Morgan. It seems to be developing well, but time will reveal whether it will be a worthy successor to the many other versions of the story.

To see him on the screen trying to act with someone like James Purefoy or Eva Green is like comedy - except it's like hearing the same joke over and over and over and eventually it becomes pure torture.<br/><br/>In the end I had to give up.

1507,Perfume, I love this surreal world,"I binge watched all 6 episodes and i forgot time by loosing myself in this lonesome Fargo-like area somewhere in Germany, where two (true)-detectives try to solve a peculiar murder.
It is surely different to the streaming material what we are used to and served today, but for me it was a welcome change. I got distracted so much by its strange atmosphere, perfectly designed and shot, that i sometimes forgot about following the subtitles. Moreover i really liked transfering the idea of scent and its obsession to modern times, being undercut with nostalgic 90ies scenes from the characters' youth.

Props for atmosphere and acting here. I watched it with subtitles and heard it with English dubbing. At times, the subtitles and dubbing were using rather different ways of saying the same thing. Kind of fascinating.
It was a good mystery/crime story and the writers made use of the multi-episodes to gradually reveal a bit more of the mystery.
I found it difficult to tell the boys apart when they were younger (exception being Toothless) and couldn't quite figure out who was really Elena's boyfriend back in the day.

1522,Perfume, Perfume is a deliciously dark,"Germany has been steadily producing some of the best, and least categorizable, shows on Netflix . Parfume (Perfume) Beautiful shot in UHD HDR .<br/><br/>Perfume, adapted from the 1985 best-selling novel by Patrick Süskind, is a German production that updates Süskind's story from 18th-century France to the present-day Lower Rhine. Its six episodes are hauntingly macabre. A beautiful singer slips into her swimming pool for a naked nighttime swim and turns up grotesquely mutilated the next day. A murderous fetishist is on the loose, one who obsesses, apparently, over scent (her body hair and accompanying tissue have been removed). The lead detective (Friederike Becht: moody, gorgeous) suspects the victim's former prep school friends, an ill-tempered bunch who are harboring secrets. One of them is a world-class perfume maker, and plausibly a psychopath. The show is lavishly shot and gleefully twisted; sexy, and dark !<br/><br/>Real and flawed characters . While the characters might challenge you, it all works thanks to a brilliant cast. We get to know these characters and while we might not grow to like them more, we do understand them better. The twisted character study of the cast is profound . There reality and truthfulness is gripping addicting and pulls you in to the darkness of the story .

1525,The Innocents," Based on a so touching, heart warming real story","This psychological drama is based on a true story. Cast is marvelous as well as screen writing. Everything is on top level. From the first episode its makes you easily addicted to it. Makes you think deeply about close relations and after effects which comes out through years. I am looking forward to watch new episodes. This is a healing story. Because while you are watching to see how they find a ways to heal each others, also gives you hope, most probably in someways it heals you too.<br/><br/>Briefly what impressed me about this TV series, I guess mostly sincerity of each cast. Think about a woman who could not find maternal love in her childhood, trying to internalize her mother's love by imitating her, even by wearing her clothes, but eventually becomes as her mother in time who resembles her mother as much as she is angry at her. A younger brother who is calmly, patiently trying to cope with huge family problems. At some point finds a support, he meets with an angel who cures him with her huge smile but now he has no clue how he can manage to handle all under the same roof.

It's funny, romantic af and the chemistry between the leads is off the charts. The male lead is fantastic, the female lead is super cute and the supporting cast is awesome too. <br/><br/>Basically, Secretary Kim has been working for nine years as the assistant of the Vice Chairman of a company and now she's resigning. Why? She's paid off the debts of her father and sisters, and is ready to have a life of her own. For nine years, she's been at the Vice Chairman's beck and call, at night, in the weekend and even during holidays. On top of that, her boss is self-absorbed to the point of narcissism. So, she's done.<br/><br/>The Vice Chairman is shocked when she announces her decision to quit - because he thinks he is the best boss and most perfect guy ever - and immediately starts to come up with schemes to get her to stay. Somehow he gets it into his pretty little head that Secretary Kim is in love with him, so he starts to woo her. With hilarious results, because she hates his guts.<br/><br/>Seriously, just watch this series! It's so good and so satisfying. You'll laugh and cry and sigh (mostly laugh and sigh, though, at how adorable the main couple is). The male lead is gorgeous and hilarious, the female lead has got a great evil smirk, the sound effects are the best and the side stories of the other characters are absolutely worth your time too.

This show gets really high reviews and I will never understand why there are lots of other dramas that are worth your time. Most episodes were very boring. Young-joon (leading male)'s narcissism was funny at first but it became annoying very fast and it made him unlikable, Mi-so (leading female) was also unlikable and kind of annoying which is what made it hard to continue. Honestly the side characters like Ji-Ah saved the show, I never would've gotten through it without them. I'm also seeing a lot of people that they had amazing chemistry but I don't feel the chemistry at all.<br/><br/>Okay, now the good things. As I said earlier the side characters are what encouraged me to finish the show, I liked that the show also focused on the side couples which a lot of dramas don't really do. And I'll admit I enjoyed the first 3 episodes but it honestly went downhill from there. Park Seo-Joon did a great job with his role, although the character was unlikable he is really an amazing actor, watching this show after Itaewon Class really showed how he can tackle any role. This is the first drama I've watched with Park Min-Young (I've watched Busted though) and I think she also did an amazing job, the actors in this show are amazing.

1565,What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, A Bit Overrated,"What's Wrong with Secretary Kim was on my watch-list for a very long time, and I initially didn't really have an interest. Then I saw Park Seo-Joon in Itaewon Class and fell in love with his shy character and amazing acting skills. So I gave this a shot.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel that this show is quite overrated. Based on reviews I was expecting a lot, and perhaps that's why I felt underwhelmed. I liked the kidnapping subplot - I think it was done well, made sense, and added a tragic undertone to our couple. But this subplot was resolved rather early, and it felt like the will-they/won't-they aspect also reached it's climax too early. I got bored and skipped through the last two episodes. The fatal flaw for me was the lack of chemistry between our couple - in my opinion Min-Young felt very stiff towards Seo-Joon. Every time they kissed it seemed like she just wasn't into it. Seo-Joon was always very sweet and into her, so I'm not sure if she just didn't like him in real life and that translated onto the screen, or if she just felt awkward filming those types of scenes - I haven't seen her in anything else so I'm not sure what to make of it.

1566,What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, Tragic for a realistic love story,"If it wasn't for my friend's deal of treating me to a free dinner for watching this show, I would have stopped at the early episodes.<br/><br/>I get why some girls like the show, well for starters, they found the guy (vice chairman) cute. The whole ambience of the show is light and funny but along the way, I kept feeling that something is just off about it. Usually with rom-com movies, you expect a nice plot where you get to witness how both characters fall in love with each other (in a cute way) but this one seemed forced. The leading man was introduced as a narcissist and in real life, its honestly damn hard to fall in love with one, not to mention, he, being your boss. Another thing that I dont like about the love story is that the leading lady, as the secretary, planned resigning so she can finally taste freedom from work and to find herself along the way as she reaches her dreams in life. She has been in the industry for 9 years as his secretary and now being told that she wants to resign prompted him to stop that because of the mere fact that he has this childhood promise of marrying her. Its confusing in the very start and it makes you hate him even more as to why would you attempt to discourage a person youre in love with from living her life and be free. I mean you can always court someone and start love in a better way, rather than keeping them chained with you forever. And if youre gonna reason out that trauma he had in the past, well thats just bull$hiz.<br/><br/>Now, talking about the girl, at first I was proud of her for taking a stand and be firm of her decisions in resigning but as the show progressed, it seems as if she is being tolerant of the narcissist to step beyond bounderies like holding her hand or to even kiss her. That first date with the fireworks is not at all romantic because the intention was to make her feel 'hangover' for him. Its all about him and it makes me feel nausious; not to mention his constant boasting and self praise. The writers never gave justice to the love story as the whole thing just progressed to the secretary adapting and falling in love, proly due to pity from the past. Its unrealistic and an insult for strong females out there.<br/><br/>What made up for the movie though are the supporting characters of the show and a huge kudos for them for carrying their parts well. Like i said, if it wasnt for that dinner deal, i wouldnt be forcing myself to finish the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway thats my two cents, more than actually.",8 out of 13 found this helpful.,2.0,7 April 2020

Cause maybe that's what I was longing to watch. Watch a guy propose 5 times to his girl until she says yes. Watch a guy fulfill his girl's bucket list. Watch a guy convince the girl's family. Maybe I love a show off guy like Young Joon who wants to show the world the love of his life and not hide it.

1568,What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, Classic Romantic K-Drama with Lots of Payoff,"I thought this show had plenty of strong points, but since they have already been covered in other reviews, I will limit my comments to the aspects in which IMO this film stands out from its peers:<br/><br/>1) The main leads. There are plenty of other celebrities whom I personally find more attractive than PSJ and PMY. However, by the end of the first episode I was totally in love! Their couple chemistry was insane and their performances (both together and alone) were amazing. They are by far the best thing about this show.<br/><br/>2) A Truely Couple-Oriented Plot. Unlike many romance stories which focus on the complications of a love triangle, this one kept its focus firmly on the main pair, despite the potential for a triangle. Additionally, it realistically highlighted many of the struggles a normal couple would face in developing a new relationship (especially inexperienced first-timers), but kept the contrived angst to a refreshing minimum with (gasp!) actual communication.<br/><br/>3) Plenty of Adult Romantic Payoff! Most mainstream K-Dramas tend to stick to the ""G-Rated Love"" standard, with (sometimes frustratingly) limited romantic contact between the leads and little resolution to any sexual tension. This show, however, follows through on all the buildup, rewarding viewers with 6+ very invested kiss scenes, as well as (gasp!) a passionate bedroom scene.<br/><br/>If you are looking for something ""fresh"" or ""unique,"" this probably won't be your cup of tea. But if you are in the mood for a classic, RomCom K-Drama with an old school fairytale ending which pulls no punches in the physical contact department, you would be hard pressed to find one more satisfying than this.

I grew up watching the it daily . The new series was such a joyful surprise..and then there was season 8. This last chapter feels like it was forced and patched together with a bunch of random ideas. Throughout the whole season characters make the most illogical decisions just to drive the story somewhere. Everything starts well, but it quickly goes downhill from there. After some filler episode we get to the grand finale where despite the impossible odds the good guys win through...willpower. I don't know how else to describe it. Voltron is the most awesome force in the universe. That's what we are lead to believe, but I don't get that impression from watching season 8.

1575,Voltron: Legendary Defender, We could have had it all....,"What began as a beautifully written and gorgeously animated series ended in choppy edits and disaster.
I absolutely loved the first 6 seasons. It was absolutely amazing to behold. The action and mechanism, not to mention the characters were all phenomenal.
Things began to fall short starting around the middle of season 7. But I really held out hope that the final season would give us closure and wrap up the story in a good enough maybe even great way.
Spoiler: it did not.
The only salvageable episode is indeed the first of the season, Launch Date. The rest of it is ridiculously incohesive and falls completely flat
All of the storylines from the first 6, even 7 seasons seem to disappear in favor of Michael Bay-esque explosions that blow more holes in the plot (and there are A LOT). The editing was crude and although they have done work to cover some of, it, there is just so much.
None of the characters even seem like the same people, even my 9 year old son, commented that everyone seemed ""weird"" and he sure as hell didn't understand why Allura had to die and the bad guys got a pass.
And as bad as all that was, the epilogue was somehow worse.
My 13 year old sister AND my son joined me in absolute disappointment and just straight up confusion with those little gems.
It's like they saw an opportunity to monetize on exploiting the LGBTQAI+ community and really just went for it.

1576,Voltron: Legendary Defender, Started off great but is a major disappointment near the end that cannot redeem the good,"The last two seasons are a disappointment. Voltron's biggest weakness is that the plot drives the characters and not the other way around, which sadly makes for a rather sterile watch at times. This is further exacerbated by the last two seasons (I assume due to the writers and directors changeup). It felt meaningless to watch near the end because the main characters felt like a 13 year old's 'fanfiction' caricatures of what they have been established as in previous seasons. Voltron peaked in season 6 which highlighted its strength in characters like Keith, Shiro, Allura and Lotor, and unfortunately the final season did a disservice to all four of them.",45 out of 63 found this helpful.,1.0,21 December 2018

1578,Voltron: Legendary Defender, Falls flat at the end,"The first 7 seasons of Voltron:Legendary Defender are beautiful, awe-inspiring, and quality television. You celebrate the triumphs, cry for the losses, and feel what the characters feel.<br/><br/>From the moment you meet Shiro, whose dreams is to be in the stars though he suffers from PTSD and a hard life, to Keith who is an orphan lone-wolf with secrets to his past, to Lance, whose cocky exterior bellies a deep an multi-faceted character below, to Hunk, whose fear makes him all the stronger for it, to Pidge, whose love for her family keeps her going, to Allura, whose loss guides her to find her new family in the other members of Voltron, you fall in love with the characters.<br/><br/>Its unfortunate then to say that the final season falls flat. Relationships between the characters, ones that have been tantamount to the entire season, are broken. Depth is missing. Plot lines are dropped at random intervals. Characters are given shallow endings that feel more like DreamWorks wants to get a cookie for checking off boxes than the story we were supposed to get.

It's not as bad as other series, the PC culture is kept relative in check, but it does shine trough and kinda ends with the punch line, as it shows it as the only ending with any kind of personal relationship. Kinda wasted as it could just have been a subplot.<br/><br/>Actors are fine borderline great at sometimes, and the animation is for a western cartoon good. It's really only in the writing it lacks imagination and power. If you can watch it for free and have lots of time, then it's a okay watch for most of the seasons.

1581,Voltron: Legendary Defender, Too many logical holes,"I just finished binging the show and I need to let some steam off. Now, before I start criticizing everything it should be said I found the show entertaining enough to watch all of the episodes, but there are still major flaws in it that more or less ruined my experience.<br/><br/>First off, IMO the PG rating is hurting the show, it limits the grittiness of the war and the emotional weight of the Galra Empire conquering, enslaving and killing entire civilizations. As well as how many complex philosophies and ideas you can put into it. <br/><br/>Secondly, the villains and the Galra empire are mostly boring. It's a bland evil warrior race super empire. Most of the villain characters are arrogant and predictable. There is no philosophy or thought as to why the empire should expand as it does except ""For the glory of the empire"". <br/><br/>Thirdly, there are alot of logical holes in the way the world is built up. Especially considering scale, tactics and science. For example, the Galra, being and universe spanning empire, seems to mainly only use two types of ships; Cruisers and Fighters. In a flashback to the past 10 000 years ago, the Galra are shown to utilize the same type of ships and robot drones. Why has the empire been this technologically stagnant for 10 000 years, when on other occasions it is said that they have immensely improved their technology during that time?<br/><br/>Also, How in ANY way can Voltron realistically fight against the Galra empire if they own LARGE CHUNKS OF THE UNIVERSE? Just in ONE galaxy there can be up to 1 billion habitable planets. So even if Voltron could win every battle for every planet in 1 minute with no downtime or travel time it would still take 1902 years to free them all, and that's not to mention the rate of Galra spreading while they liberate the planets. You could say that rebels would help, but that would only happen on a large scale after atleast a percentage of planets were liberated. Also the rebels never use any ships other than refitted freighters(which are all identical btw), nor do they commandeer captured Galra ships, which would be the logical choice of an oppressed race rising up against their overlords. <br/><br/>Voltron the robot is also super boring, it always gets its ass kicked and then suddenly a team member activate a hidden ability, or they use the power of heart and friendship to solve it. The whole magical aspect just takes away alot of the tension. When the writers put the heroes in a ""certain death"" situation, you know they will survive because they're the heroes, but instead of inventing a creative way for them to win, they just throw in magic and Voltron suddenly turning super OP.<br/><br/>All in all, alot of flaws, but then again it is rated PG and maybe I was expecting a bit too much from a children's show.",36 out of 52 found this helpful.,6.0,22 September 2018
1582,Voltron: Legendary Defender," Enjoyable, but it has LOTS of issues","Overall, I would say that I enjoy this show. It has great animation, excellent voice acting, and characters with potential. Unfortunately, my attachment to this show seems to be relying solely on potential I see that has yet to be met, even after 2 seasons. <br/><br/>The main issue with this show is that it has no idea what its strengths and weaknesses are. It tries to do a TON of different things, just trying to see what sticks. Another big issue is the conveniences. Many characters are capable of or learn special abilities in the show, yet they seem to only work once and NOT when they're most needed. <br/><br/>The series has arguably 7 main characters. While I didn't enjoy Keith or Shiro in the first season, they were virtually the only characters that had any sort of...well, CHARACTER in Season 2. Everyone else is abruptly shoved to the sideline and shoehorned into a single defining trait, making them dull and repetitive. Hunk is the food-obsessed fat guy. Pidge is the tech geek. Lance is the comedy guy. That's all they are, nothing more. The villains are also about as compelling as a cardboard box, as we are given nearly no backstory or decent motivation for them at all.<br/><br/>It's overall pretty disappointing to see people who worked on such great shows like Avatar: The Last Airbender, Justice League Unlimited, and The Legend of Korra write such a sloppy show with so much unused potential. What could be episodes focused on developing characters and working towards the plot are spent on pointless side quests with more-miss-than-hit comedy, most of which having to do with fueling their ship. None of the character balance, consistent pacing, compelling story, atmosphere, or depth from the staff's prior work seems to be fully realized in this project.<br/><br/>That being said, the show is not completely doomed. It still has a lot of potential. If the next season(s) spend more time making the characters interesting and creating a more compelling story, it could definitely live up to the hype. I don't want this show to be bad, and I'm going to continue watching it in hopes that it realizes exactly how great it could be.",40 out of 59 found this helpful.,5.0,3 April 2017

1585,Voltron: Legendary Defender," Fun, fast paced action that forget it's own strengths","The action is fast paced and ever present, sometimes so much it feels overwhelming. The main characters are all lovable and funny with distinct personalities and their own time to shine.<br/><br/>The storyline about saving the universe takes the main focus and does it (mostly) well. The aliens are interesting and diverse and there's a lot of hidden references to pop culture which are always a joy to pick up on. The animation on the action sequences are top notch and will leave you clutching your seat, granted you take a couple breaks inbetween to catch your breath and process. We have one character who is basically an deux ex machina in and of herself, being the solution to each otherwise unsolvable riddle. This still works, mostly, due to the mystery of alien magic.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this makes little time for the show's absolute strong point - the characters. The character development is splotchy at best and storylines built up by one character are anticlimactically ended by another. Relationships are failed to be clearly established, creating confusion.<br/><br/>Even in spite of this issue, more characters and side plots seems to be introduced each season while what would be important scenes seems to be routinely cut. At first I expected this to be to leave room for a fandom to explore, but after a while it got clear it's more likely a flaw in the writing. More than once you're left waiting for a scene that never comes or faced with crucial development apparently happening away from the camera. You get the feeling the show wanted to include a hundred storylines at once, but didn't have the necessary idea of how to make the stories fit into the greater one. It leaves you as an involved viewer with a lot of unsatisfactory endings.<br/><br/>In conclusion; If you want a show to every-now-and-then and in-the-background watch about some people saving the universe, battling and working with cool aliens - you'll love Voltron: Legendary Defender. If you want to watch a show about just people or because you've heard there's some kind of representation to be found - despite it quickly growing a mighty fandom, this show is not for you.

1586,Voltron: Legendary Defender, I never knew it was possible to like a show so much only to hate it even more after watching the final season. 2/5,"Part 2 of 5. Long Review.<br/><br/>Allura's Motivation<br/><br/>An interesting question is what did the show runners intend Allura's deepest desire in life to be? One possibility is that it was always to sacrifice herself in order to learn the secret of life as evident by her words and actions when facing the White Lion on Oriande and by the fact that she is resurrected as some sort of god. If this were case, then why did she enter into a relationship with Lance in the first place? (Recall that this was the reason for Yue's hesitation towards Sokka in the sense that Yue knew she would have sacrifice herself at some point.) Assuming, Allura genuinely cares for Lance she would have had, in the very least, a serious conversation with him about the potential future of their relationship, but this is something that is conspicuously absent from the show. Romantically, people who are ISFJ take dating seriously and only enter into relationships that have a real chance of lasting a lifetime. Given the uncertainty of war and the assumption that Allura wanted to sacrifice herself, then their relationship did not have a real chance of lasting a lifetime, which contradicts Allura's personality.<br/><br/>Another possibility is that her deepest desire was to go back to Altea and be with her parents and people before the war started, but Allura knows that this not possible, at least not in the physical world. Perhaps it is possible on the infinite void/astral plane/connected consciousness of all reality, but Shiro's consciousness existed there because of the Black Lion and Alfor's consciousness existed in Honerva's mind, a living person. It is possible that the Red Lion holds Alfor's consciousness, but that is something never explicitly stated; furthermore, neither her mother's consciousness nor her people's consciousnesses are shown to exist on the infinite void/astral plane/connected consciousness of all reality. It seems to me the show runners intended the infinite void/astral plane/connected consciousness of all reality to be something like a manifestation of the Force from Star Wars, but did not fully flesh out the concept. Lastly and most importantly, there is not an immediate need for her to join the astral plane. Her father's consciousness can not die, and Allura would be able to enter the astral plane after her natural life ends.<br/><br/>Another possibility, which I think is the most realistic case, is that her deepest desire in the end is to experience peace and happiness with her new found family but that she was always willing to sacrifice herself to protect others since she saw it as her duty to do so and took her duty seriously. At the very end, Allura says to Honerva, ""I lost my father, my mother, my planet to this war, but I've gained a new family and a purpose stronger than any I could ever imagine."" In this case, it does not make sense that she is resurrected into some sort of god as her reward for saving all realities. Mechanically, perhaps Bob rewards Allura or the mystical universe or even Allura rewards herself - apparently, she is all-powerful at this point. Either way, it would make more sense that Allura is resurrected back into her physical form and then ascends into the heavens as a god after all those closest to her have passed away. Lastly, I am assuming that Allura restores all living creatures back to life when she saves all realities, so logically she could recreate herself as well. Magic that's powerful enough to restore countless realities, full of countless planets and innumerable amounts of life, surely is powerful enough to save one's self. But with 5 minutes left in the entire series, who has time for that annoying thing called logic?<br/><br/>I suppose the show runners intended that Allura's self-sacrifice symbolizes that a great victory must come at a great cost or that the greatest expression of love is to sacrifice yourself to save another. Not that these are necessarily bad themes, they are good themes in fact and today's society could benefit from more people helping each other out, but Allura's self-sacrifice at the end of the show feels extremely forced, and I can not help but feel it is simply done for shock value. It is as if the show runners were thinking, well we have to end this show in a big way, so let us kill off one of the main characters. Allura sacrifices herself with 15 minutes remaining in the final episode - not much time to debate or explore other alternatives to restoring all realities, such as somehow using Voltron. After all, it is not like Voltron is a semi-sentient robot that is the most powerful machine ever created, can travel to other realities, can store the consciousness of its pilots, is full of quintessence, i.e. space magic, and something that Allura successfully used in season 6 to transfer quintessence while fighting Lotor. In season 6, sacrificing the Castle of Lions worked to close all the unstable rifts Lotor created, so it would have been reasonable to sacrifice Voltron to solve this even bigger problem of restoring all realities. Plus, it makes sense in that it achieves victory at the lowest cost possible. Further adding to the contrived nature of Allura's self-sacrifice is that Voltron could not stop Honerva in the reality with a perfect Altea and then surprisingly (or not) all realities are strands emerging from a single point, which of course makes them easy for Honerva to destroy. (As an aside, for someone angry enough to destroy all realities, Honerva gave up rather easily at the very end. Some happy memories from her youth were enough to convince her to stop fighting. Honerva is apparently powerful enough to kill Allura and the paladins. Why would Honerva not do that and then destroy the last remaining reality? End of all existence. No more pain and suffering as Honerva wanted. I would have preferred this bleak ending to the one the show gave us.) Lastly, there is the Blue Lion. The Blue Lion has Allura's consciousness, and Pidge states on at least two occasion that we are all made of the same cosmic dust. So the Blue Lion could have transformed itself into Allura as the final scene of the show or even better yet the lions could have formed Voltron and then Voltron transforms into Allura. Then she literally is the defender of all universes.<br/><br/>Grading Voltron (Critical Analysis)<br/><br/>Animation - A+
Visual Effects - A+
Music - A+<br/><br/>On a positive note, the animation, visual effects and musical score are outstanding. Seriously, some of the best and coolest animation I have seen in awhile. Studio Mir and the Voltron design team did an outstanding job in these areas. The lions look sleek yet powerful. Voltron has an air of steadfast resolve - really everything looks and sounds awesome.<br/><br/>Voice Actors - A<br/><br/>The voice actors bring their characters to life and each does a great job. A.J. hits a home run as Lotor. He nails the mix of authority and mystery that Lotor has. Kimberly Brooks' voice as Allura is royal with sweet and caring undertones. Josh Keaton gives Shiro a commanding yet compassionate air. Jeremy Shada has so much range. Great job by all of the voice actors.<br/><br/>Humor - A<br/><br/>I like the jokes. I grew up when hanging out at the mall was a thing so I enjoyed the space mall episode. Lance's line, ""No way that was blazzle hooches!"" will be stuck in my head for awhile. Tim Hedrick's background in comedy serves Voltron well.",26 out of 38 found this helpful.,4.0,7 January 2019

1589,Voltron: Legendary Defender, Could've been better,"As someone whose watched Beast King GoLion when it reran in TV, I always been skeptical when they announced it will be rebooted and admittedly, saw it as nothing more than a nostalgia cash cow used for toy sales which true maybe was the case for it's original. I never gave it a chance but 1 year later I decided to finally watch it.<br/><br/>Season 1-3 were rather decent, generally a story that somewhat grabbed my attention but as the remaining later seasons it became lost and had a hard time figuring out what it really was about. A band of found family brought by the princess and her adviser to save the universe from the Galra Empire? Or is it just about war? I need clarification on what the main story is about because as the seasons go by it gets boring and the action gets duller and duller. There could've been a few episodes where all the characters had a fun moment for a while without having another character fight the monster of the week. A break from time to time. Or dedicate some episodes where they explore more alien planets; peaceful, discovery of ancient times, or sometimes a monster of the week. That would make things interesting. Some of the plots gets reused like Keith has to go from loner to a great friend and back to loner which is distasteful and waste of development.<br/><br/>In terms of rating, this would've been better for teens and young adults. As GoLion was design for that audience because they weren't afraid to show a little violence and tragedy that made sense. But it showed good chemistry between the characters and each character shines in their own moments, something that Legendary Defender had but tosses it out the window as they only focus on the two main characters. Sure there are six main ones and its a lot to do but it could've worked if you separated each episode dedicated to each character and slowly build it up that ends in satisfaction. Have the main five have an enemy that compliments or counters them. Have them intertwine can actually work for team ups or lead these episodes. It's a suggestion but gives enough time for the audience to care for each character.<br/><br/>For the characters... Pidge should've had someone to lose (her brother or father), she never experiences great loss like the rest of the characters and personally, she would understand how the others felt like Allura and Coran who lost their family and people. It could've parallel to her being insensitive and realize her error of judgement. She could've been a great character. It's rather unrealistic for her to be the only one who never lost anyone in a war.<br/><br/>As stated before, Keith's character development felt wasted because he went back to not learning. What happened to him saying Voltron is his family and found his rightful place? He firmly set himself he will never leave Voltron just to find his long lost mom and learn more about being half Galra. Isn't that what he established? It was perfect because family doesn't need to be blood related. Plus him being stuck on the time whale to be leader, isn't how it works because you need the team to help him grow as a leader. Like actually see him grow.<br/><br/>Hunk didn't have much to add and that's unfortunate because I want to care about him but the show didn't give me the time to care. Actually, it did when they focused on him in season 1 to 2 but eventually got lost as it progresses.<br/><br/>Lance's development does grow from a flirtatious guy to a respectful paladin which I'll give them that but I always get this sense he could've been greater. He does qualify the leadership because out of all of the paladins besides Shiro, he actually cares for his team. Which probably ended up being a favorite. His relationship with Allura isn't the best because the show established he is letting her go due to unrequited feelings and instead sees her as a friend but suddenly goes back when they start dating by 7 and 8. Not a good message to kids.<br/><br/>Shiro is the greatest leader to be made, not only does the show established he's disabled and have PTSD but also shows despite these hardships he's gone through gives the audience a sense of hope they too can achieve big things. And I admire that. But as the story progresses, it became clear to me he was suppose to die and never came back, similar to GoLion, DOTU, and others. This would've affected more to the characters early on. The issue is that, why make a great hero die to be used as a stepping stone for another character? Maybe he should've been the decoy protagonist if you really planned on not having stay for the rest of the seasons. He's also the only one we never got a backstory such as family. I can't deny what Shiro was written felt off to me especially when he ended up as a side character.<br/><br/>Why have Allura die when the lions are right there? It could've been poetic because in the end, they don't need Voltron anymore. Symbolic even when they first where created, and then save everyone in the end.<br/><br/>I do enjoy some designs of the characters, the lions sort of have a distinct appearance. Green Lion is actually the wind one and Black Lion is the thunder one if it were from GoLion so that mostly a personal irk. I do think it was somewhat pointless for them to switch pilots because the show established a bond between a lion and paladin cannot be broken. Sure it's a nice homage but eh, it would work better they only did a one time switch for a bit in the same episode where both paladins and lions get separated from each other. Like Lance ends up with Red, Keith ends up with Black, Allura ends up with Blue and all three have a hard time getting the lion to work because they're not their paladins. Hilarious but serious points if that really happened.<br/><br/>The animation is beautiful for the past 6 seasons but up until season 7 and 8, the colors de-saturated and immediately pulled me out cuz to me, it look more dream like than anything. The acting is good and does carry emotion.<br/><br/>Overall thoughts, it's decent but wouldn't make me recommend to a friend.",17 out of 24 found this helpful.,4.0,27 February 2019

1592,Voltron: Legendary Defender, Honest with this review!!,"As a fan of the original, I was very cautious with this remake, most definitely with remakes being horrible this day and age. I gave it a shot &amp; that is it!! They have tried too hard to change it up from the original by moving characters around from what they were!! They have ruined the look of voltron &amp; the lions!! The lions &amp; voltron used to look like they mean business, had a way about them that was like, let me think before I mess with these guys. Now they just look stupid!! Can't put it any clearer than that!! The original was straight from Japan with some clean up for America viewers because it was a little too violent for kids then, where as this one just misses the mark, PERIOD!! So at all cost if you are a fan of the great 80's version, skip this!! One more thing, Netflix is losing customers everyday because of original content &amp; this ""remake"" of an original!!! One last thing, they have the wrong person voicing the princess!!! They went PC with the this!!

1594,Voltron: Legendary Defender, never knew it was possible to like a show so much only to hate it even more after watching the final season. - 1/5,"Allura is a Messianic Archetype<br/><br/>In hindsight, there are several indications well before season 8 that, more than likely, Allura will sacrifice herself. In the episode White Lion from season 5, before the white lion strikes, Allura relaxes her body, exposes her neck and says, ""I seek the secret of life. I give my own."" In season 1, in the episode Rebirth, Allura offers to reinfuse the Balmera with quintessence to which Coran warns Allura that that could require more energy than she has, possibly killing her. Another clear indicator is that Allura is only person in the show capable of using magic to heal life. Given the immense destruction wrought by Zarkon, Lotor, Honerva and the Galara, this places Allura in a unique position that gives the show runners the option to kill her as a dramatic and emotionally tragic way to undo the damage the Galra caused. Allura is also an extreme version of the ISFJ personality type. If Allura could be summarized in a word, ""defender"" or ""protector"" would more than suffice. She begins the show as seeing herself as the defender of all innocent life, which means everyone except the Galra. As the show progresses, her belief that all Galra are bad is challenged, most notably in the form of Keith and the Blades of Marmora. In the final season, Allura completes her transformation to an all-loving messiah when she redeems Zarkon by accepting Zarkon's information about Honerva's deepest desires and when she redeems Honvera by saying ""but I can not do it alone"" in regards to transferring the quintessence from Honerva's robot. Allura's final sacrifice to restore all realities followed by her resurrection as some sort of god confirms her status as a messianic archetype.<br/><br/>Outside the show, there is even more evidence for Allura's eventual self-sacrifice. In numerous interviews the show runners state they were creatively influenced by Japanese anime, which is much darker than American animation. Death or self-sacrifice is a common element in Japanese anime. In particular, they mention Robotech/Macross and Gurren Lagann as influences on Voltron. In a Den of Geek interview, Joaquim Dos Santos states, referring to Robotech, ""People died and stayed dead. That was really important. It sounds cheesy, almost hokey now, but that was a life lesson for me as a kid. That was something I had to deal with and come to terms with."" Lastly, in another interview they state that they wanted to incorporate the more mature and darker nature from Beast King GoLion into their remake of Voltron. Other influences from Beast King GoLion abound as well, from the names of planets to plot lines such as Haggar being Altean and Lotor's mother. In summary, there is more than enough evidence in the show and outside the show by the end of season 5 that Allura's arc could end with a heroic or messianic sacrifice.<br/><br/>Dramatizing Allura's Self-Sacrifice<br/><br/>So what is there left to do with three more seasons to go? Apparently, the answer is to build the audience's connection with Allura so as to make her death as emotionally tragic as possible. How? One powerful way is to use romance. (Suzanne Collins did not want any romance in the Hunger Games novels, but her editor told her to add romance to capture more readers.) Lance is the character that the majority of viewers identify with because he is the most relatable of the main characters, and he plays into the fantasy that the everyday guy can win the princess's heart. (I admit it, I thought the slow-burn between Allura and Lance was well done, slowly transitioning from Lance immaturely hitting on Allura, to friends who deeply care for each other, to finally a couple. For example, Allura tells Lance that he reminds her of her father, there is the flirtatious moment with the Altean broad sword and so on.) Thus, the show runners further build up the relationship between Lance and Allura in seasons 6, 7 and 8. They are careful not to do it too fast; otherwise, Allura's sacrifice would not have as much gravitas. For example, compare Allura telling Lance that she loves him immediately before she sacrifices herself to Allura telling Lance she loves him earlier in season 8, say during their first date. By Allura waiting, the show runners create suspense. Allura finally telling Lance she loves him only to immediately sacrifice herself is sad, much sadder than had she said it earlier in season 8 because as viewers we are left hanging. We do not have the chance to see a wedding, children or even lighter moments between them sharing in their love.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the show runners try to keep Allura's eventual sacrifice in suspense up until the last minute. Two main alternatives are presented to maintain suspense: the power of teamwork and found family and Lance's love for Allura. While in Honvera's mind, Gyrgan tells Hunk that true power is born from unity and that true unity is born from love. At this point, the paladins should be more than friends - a family united by love and so should have true power. Thus, the paladins could use their true power to save all realities. There is also the possibility that Lance's love might save Allura. In season 8 episode 11, Lance's pleading wakes Allura from the coma Honerva places Allura in by connecting to the dark entity in Allura's mind and using it to attack Allura. Lance says to Allura, ""And most of all, I need you. I can't imagine this world without you. Come back to me."" Then Allura's eyes reopen. Pleading is a common theme throughout Voltron. In addition to Lance's pleading, Keith's pleading wakes Shiro from near death in season 7 and Haggar's pleading wakes Zarkon from near death in season 3. In addition, there is always the possibility that a literary trope is subverted. Ultimately though, neither teamwork nor romantic love is the answer to saving all realities - having Jesus on your side is.",18 out of 26 found this helpful.,4.0,6 January 2019
1595,Voltron: Legendary Defender, Not well done,"They copied legend of korra: didn't bother to develop interesting base characters, utilized annoying ones for garbage dialogue and those with the most potential were wasted eg. Noatak and Tarrlok wtf = Allura and Lance. You get strung along on an indecisive, emotional tantrum and it's all tidied up quickly with a shock value ending (very cowardly done considering the themes were introduced sooo late) that feels like some of the script has been cut off in the same style as one of the 'clash/wrath of the titans' movies. So many potentially awesome avenues and new ideas to explore were squandered in both T.V. shows. I've seen Big Ted, Little Ted and Jemima act out more interesting stories (with satisfying endings) whilst still leaving me baffled at the mystery of their interpersonal relationships. Big Ted is so strong, yet Little Ted is closer in size to Jemima... Do Teddy Bears even date Dolls?!?!?!

With these dvds, you get the uncensored version whose continuity is not broken up by commercial breaks. This adds quite a bit to the enjoyment of the series.

1599,Cracker, Cracking stuff (sorry!).,"It's impossible to overstate how classy this programme is. The cast are uniformly superb, Jimmy Mc Govern's writing is by times disturbing and violent, by times deeply compassionate, and the overall tone of the piece is dark and moody, but with just enough ascerbic humour to lighten the weight.<br/><br/>Coltrane is excellent here, but he's spoiled also; he's been given one of the best-written roles in TV history, but he portrays Fitz with effortless panache. No easy thing given the complexity of the character. He's an almost supernaturally gifted psychologist, but he can't understand his wife and son; he's capable of real understanding and compassion, but is an inveterate user of people despite himself.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are excellent, and those actors brought in to play ""villains of the week"" almost always hold their own. You'll cry when, at the end of ""To Say I Love You"", the young stutterer realises he'll never be able to say the things to his girlfriend that he wants to say. Robert Carlyle's Albie in ""To Be Somebody"" is one of the standout characters of the entire series. Fitz's final chat with the put-upon Catholic housewife in ""Brotherly Love"" is truly disturbing, but heartbreaking too. You'll feel for each of these characters, which is an amazing feat by all concerned in the making, considering their crimes are so graphically portrayed, and the show is so unflinching about revealing the kinds of effects violent crime has on survivors, and the families of the victims. This is classy television.<br/><br/>It's not without it's faults, of course. The standard does tend to take a nose-dive when Jimmy Mc Govern's not writing (not by much, sometimes, but always perceptibly) and the quite graphic nature of most of the episodes means this won't be to everyone's taste, but these are small flaws. This is wonderful stuff. It's impossible to overstate this fact, so i'll say it again: this is really classy television.",52 out of 56 found this helpful.,,31 July 2003
1600,Cracker, The finest drama series ever created,"I cannot recommend this highly enough. A fiercely intelligent, disturbing, powerful, funny masterwork by a writer and cast at their peak. The main character, Dr Fitzgerald, a lecturing psychologist who assists the police was originally envisaged by the writer (Jimmy McGovern) as a small, wiry character. Then some genius decided on one of the greatest pieces of stunt casting ever and suggested the massive actor Robbie Coltrane who was better known for comedy (appearing in Blackadder as Doctor Johnson, and the Young Ones, amongst many other appearance, both in TV and film).<br/><br/>He nailed the character totally. A chain smoking, gambling, alcoholic, 'Fitz' can talk to someone for 30 seconds and know what drives them, but he can't control his own domestic life. Nor does he ever seem totally to want to. ""You don't want to be helped"" says his wife ""Because only normal people need help. And you think you're special, unique"".<br/><br/>His gift of analysing people makes him almost despicable arrogant, yet we are always on his side. He is charming, extremely sarcastic and amusing, and always up for a trip to the pub. But the challenge of analysing the criminally insane gives him wings to stretch himself in ways everyday life can't.<br/><br/>I won't give away any of the plots, but each one would make a fantastic film on its own. However that would diminish the power of the story arc that runs throughout - and that pushes the series up to a perfect 10/10. Harrowing, touching, powerful - when will TV companies make something this good again.<br/><br/>(NB if you can only watch one episode watch 'To be a somebody' - an excellent encapsulation of all the programme's best qualities)",41 out of 44 found this helpful.,10.0,18 July 2003
1601,Cracker, Simply the best television drama series yet produced,"We've had the whodunnit and even the howdunnit but Cracker is something else - its the definitive whydunnit, a superb cocktail of wit,grit and human frailty, perfectly pitched and performed - in short: It's marvellous. If you've never seen it (and this is something you should rectify immediately) the 'cracker' of the title is no less than 19 stone of chain smoking, hard drinking, gambling addicted psychologist whose skills become invaluable to the Manchester police. This set up is established in the opening story 'the mad woman in the attic' in which Fitz (Coltrane) offer's his help to the police when one of his students becomes the latest victim of brutal murderer. The train based killing set-up is based on a real murder that took place on route to London in the early 90's and it's this borrowing from the headlines that gives the series it's sense of reality, often making for uncomfortable viewing. McGovern's character's are never allowed to stand still - they have real emotional and psychological density and the fallout from events in one story (and they're are many particularly in the first two series) are carried through into the next. Fitz is perversely selfish and flawed but is also in possession of penetrative intellect and cutting wit which makes both his domestic scenes in which he attempts to reconcile himself with the wishes of his long suffering wife Judith and the inevitable showdowns with his criminal adversaries equally captivating. It's the later you look forward to the most but there's also a terrific supporting cast to enjoy including Christopher Eccleston, Geraldine Sommrevile and the superb Ricky Tomlinson. It would be unfair to new viewers to spoil the intricate layers of each story by going into them too deeply, simply to say that Cracker was and is occasionally gruelling, always challenging television, the uniquely British sensibility of which lends it a weight (no pun on Robbie Coltrane intended) that would be impossible to replicate elsewhere. McGovern, if you had to lay one criticism at his door, tends to underwrite or caricature middle class characters but when writing about what he knows he's unbeatable. Those Cracker stories not penned by him tend not to have quite as much impact though Ted Whitehead's the Big Crunch has some memorable exchanges between Fitz and arrogant sect leader Kenneth Trant but Paul Abbot's stories, though good, aren't a patch on McGovern's best perhaps betraying his relative lack of experience in the genre at the time. This is all mere nick-picking though; Cracker is superb stuff and if you don't think so then you genuinely need to see a psychologist.",33 out of 36 found this helpful.,,4 June 2005

When the Americans decided to remake the show almost word for word with Robert Pastorelli in the lead, it was a pretty fruitless attempt to sell a great series to a wider audience. <br/><br/>Although not bad, the star was lighter in more ways than one and the whole thing gave many fans a nagging sense of deja vu.",26 out of 28 found this helpful.,,14 December 2000

This is truly the real Magoo. I am amazed that I have not seen this series written up everywhere. Hate to build it up to others, because I came upon it relatively unbuilt up and it just knocked me out. Sorry for all the hyperbole, but this deserves it.

1604,Cracker, Robbie Coltrane is brilliant,"In my opinion, the little I've seen of the American version of Cracker was actually a noble effort, but the crucial difference between the two was the presence of Robbie Coltrane.<br/><br/>Coltrane is one of the world's best actors.  He fills the character of Fitz so well that this unlikely character, who drinks hard, gambles, and is full of rage but is also compassionate and incredibly intelligent, is completely believable.  He is one of the few unattractive leading men who can convincingly flirt with attractive women, so that when they are suddenly interested in him, you believe it.<br/><br/>Cracker is harsh stuff sometimes.  Every killer on the show, it seems, has a psychological angle that is positively disturbing (hence, I suppose, the need for a police psychologist).  The series also has humor, though.  The scene in which Fitz, seeking revenge on a fellow therapist who's fooling around with his wife, turns a ""gamblers anonymous"" group into a card game is the sort of harsh but banned-in-America dark humor that Jimmy McGovern (author of the film Priest) excels at.",23 out of 26 found this helpful.,,17 June 1999

Cracker is immensely ""UNDERRATED"".<br/><br/>As you may have read in the other reviews it is the storyline that's highly praised. EXACTLY MY OPINION! The main writer, Jimmy McGovern is just simply an intelligent storyteller. Now this series wouldn't be as great as it is if Robbie Coltrane's portrayals of a hard drinking, chain smoking, overweight gambling addict wasn't as talented. However even with such a dramatic acting performance it is Jimmy McGovern with his fantastically ingenious way of sucking you into his story lines, where you can't go on living the rest of your life not knowing how the story ends, that steals the show. <br/><br/>Why this series isn't praised to the same degree as Prime Suspect or Trial &amp; Retribution are, nor as well known is just beyond me.

1609,Cracker," Incredible in every way, one of the best of the detective/mystery genre and also one of the best shows ever made","Despite being a great fan of detective/mystery shows, from Agatha Christie, 'Inspector Morse', 'Midsommer Murders', 'A Touch of Frost', 'Taggart' and 'Foyle's War' to 'New Tricks', 'Monk', 'Columbo' and 'Murder She Wrote' and others {also found myself really liking 'Messiah', apart from the mess that was the fifth and last series), it took a while for me to get round to seeing 'Cracker'.<br/><br/>When being introduced to 'Cracker' quite late- in the past six years to be exact- this reviewer found the show every bit as great as the best of the above shows, in fact on par and perhaps even better, coming from someone who has loved Miss Marple, Poirot and 'Inspector Morse' since eleven years old this is incredibly high praise.<br/><br/>'Cracker' is made and photographed with supreme atmosphere and classy style. It is also scored understatedly but never in a way that takes away from the full impact of the drama, the main theme is memorable, while the direction is controlled and creates tension, horror and suspense wonderfully.<br/><br/>It is a brilliantly written show too, one of the best written of the detective/mystery genre and an example for any good TV show regardless of whether it's comedy, animated, mystery, drama etc. It's violent, and unflinchingly but always effectively and never gratuitously so (not for those easily disturbed), but also with its fair share of poignant emotion and grimly dark and deliciously acerbic humour. It's not just the quality of these individual elements though that bowls one over, but also how they are all balanced, never too much of one or too little of another.<br/><br/>Also present in 'Cracker' is an absolute mastery of storytelling. Story lines that could easily have been clichéd, too safe or not covered new ground are intricate, layered, complex, harrowing (""To Be Somebody"" really wrenches the gut in a way that few individual episodes of any TV show in existence have managed), touching (the end of ""To Say I Love You"") and weren't afraid to take balls that many shows before and during wouldn't have had the balls to attempt, like the psychological effects of a key female character's rape, killing off key characters and giving the good characters strengths and flaws and not making the villains irredeemably bad. Instead of being so much a whodunit like 'Morse', 'Lewis' or 'Poirot' for examples or a howdunit like 'Monk', 'Columbo' and some episodes of 'Diagnosis Murder', 'Cracker' is sort of a whydunit and a psychology of the villains' minds, which it deals with so intelligently and often powerfully.<br/><br/>The characters are also incredibly well written, Fitz being one of the best-written and most fascinating characters ever to grace television in my opinion. 'Cracker' is superbly acted too. Robbie Coltrane is just extraordinary and to me, despite being a departure for him at the time, Fitz is his best role (no offence Hagrid fans, love that character too but Fitz is a much more interesting character). Barbara Flynn, Christopher Eccleston, Geraldine Somerville, Ricky Tomlinson and Lorcan Crannitch support him impeccably, while out of the villains Robert Carlyle's spine-chilling Albie Kinsella (some of his best ever acting) stands out by a landslide.<br/><br/>Overall, incredible in every way. 10/10 Bethany Cox",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,9 June 2016
1610,Cracker, Cracker –The Last Truly Great British TV Drama Series?,"Take an obese, alcoholic, chain-smoking, gambling addict; a sarcastic, pompous, belligerent, egotistical, selfish, self-absorbed, middle-aged Scottish psychologist and slap him in the middle of the Manchester Crime Squad as a free-lance criminal profiler. Make this Manchester a city besieged by a string of serial-killers, racist murderers, Bonnie and Clyde wannabes, rapists, perverts, prostitutes, deviants, cultists and general run-of–the-mill malcontents and terminally irredeemable weirdos. And there is the heady formula for one of the greatest TV drama series ever produced in the UK.<br/><br/>The plot lines for the main narratives alone, however, are not what made it great. The stories ranged from the achingly powerful to the more pedestrian, the artistic to the faintly autistic, but that is of little concern. What made this series so downright great were the characters and their relationships and interaction with one another and their environment. Never was a show so character-driven and in such an emotionally affecting way.<br/><br/>Coltrane's Fitz is, on the surface, an anti-hero who should be on the negative side of despicable. The epitome of selfishness, stuck in an eternal mid-life crisis of his own imagining, he flounders into debt, sucks up booze, blows out smoke and has a body that looks as if it has never seen a salad in its entire existence. Yet he is so human, so gifted with razor sharp wit and talented by means of his rare insight into the human condition, that he automatically has the audience on his side. <br/><br/>His treatment of his wife, his children, his mother, his brother and almost anyone he meets, is often appalling and in some cases unforgivable. His moral compass is broken beyond belief, yet he manages to appeal as a heroic figure and we root for him despite all. Coltrane projects him so charismatically that we even accept that the young, willowy and coldly sensual Jane Penhaligon can fall in love with him and take him to bed. Yep, the performance is that good.<br/><br/>That said, just about every performance by every player is pitch-perfect.<br/><br/>Of special note is Lorcan Cranitch as DS Jimmy Beck. Beck is the flip-side to Fitz's insightful and confident smart-ass persona. He too drinks, smokes and revels in macho egotism. But his bluster fails to hide that he is an incompetent copper, a bigot, a misogynist, a man promoted to a level set way out of his depth, whose barely concealed contempt for women and hero-worship for his superior, Bilborough (Clive Eccleston), proves to be his undoing. The difference is, Fitz doesn't hero-worship anyone and at the end of the day he knows the real score. Beck, though, is too stupid, pig-thick and mentally disturbed to get it.<br/><br/>Beck's unravelling psyche is brilliantly depicted by Cranitch, his mindset conflicted by his hatred for Fitz and a jealous desire to be more like him on the one hand and his rigidly repressed latently homosexual adulation of Bilborough – whose death he unwittingly orchestrates through his own ineptitude. Beck's descent from moderately dumb and big-headed flatfoot to guilt-ridden, psychosomatic, suicidal sexual deviant is masterfully written and portrayed.<br/><br/>Although it's Jimmy McGovern's baby, it should not be forgotten that other writers contributed some superb work to this chronicle.<br/><br/>Cracker was a series brave enough to unflinchingly kill-off key players and make drama from the fall-out. To let the pivotal female character be raped by a trusted colleague and then examine the devastation of that act at close range. To depict murderers and perverts as human beings, rather than just token cyphers of evil. And to actually dare to give TV audiences something deliberately thought-provoking and of a rare and undeniable quality and worth for a change.<br/><br/>The last truly great British TV drama series? Yeah, probably it is.",7 out of 8 found this helpful.,9.0,31 October 2010
1611,Cracker, Best thing on TV since the remake of Battlestar Galactica,"...except that the Battlestar remake came 10 years after Cracker. But you get the point.<br/><br/>The British series ""Cracker"" is a gritty, tense and often humorous psychological crime drama about a misfit human being (""Fitz"" played by Robbie Coltrane) who happens to be a genius at reading human nature. Even though he can't seem to get a grip on his own failing life, he is the police force's best asset when it comes to solving grisly murders.<br/><br/>Bringing to the TV screens a new and quite disturbing sort of realism that had never been seen before, at least nothing I'd ever seen, Cracker was one of the first shows that boldly dove into the concept of the anti-hero. You won't find any lily-white heroes here. There's no John Wayne (although on occasion Robbie Coltrane's character does a pretty good job of impersonating him, along with Humphrey Bogart &amp; Columbo). The good guy doesn't always win, the good guy isn't always right, and most notably sometimes there isn't even a good guy.<br/><br/>Shows today have embraced this realism very well, but back in the late 80s-early 90s you have to remember TV screens were still dominated by the likes of Baywatch &amp; Walker Texas Ranger. Entertaining stuff, but very clearcut good vs. evil type stuff where good always wins with a joke &amp; freeze frame at the end.<br/><br/>Here in Cracker you're more likely to get an ending where the wrong person goes to jail, or someone gets blown up, fade to black, roll credits. Yes folks, this is a far cry from Columbo... although Columbo fans (like me) will be thrilled at the idea of a brilliant criminologist who usually--not always but usually--seems to be just 1 step behind the criminal and 1 step ahead of the audience. This, coupled with the aforementioned moral ambiguity of all the characters, ensures that NOTHING is predictable.<br/><br/>Robbie Coltrane is now famous for his Harry Potter role, but this is the first time I saw him and I was instantly hooked by his funny, self-deprecating arrogance, his cool intelligence on the job while, at home, being too crass &amp; hot headed to hold a 2 sentence conversation with his family, and of course his very anti-heroic vices of alcohol and gambling... which, by the way aren't just thrown in for color; his character actually explains the logic in a lucid way that makes me want to saddle up to the nearest bar and order a tub of whiskey.<br/><br/>Seriously, though, while his uncontrolled addictions are far from charming, there is a certain glamor in it, similar to Bogart's whiskey swilling ""Rick"" in Casablanca. So if you are possibly offended by a hero who's not just an alcoholic gambler but quite proud of it, then you might want to avoid this. But like I said, this sort of realism is what broke the Baywatch mold.<br/><br/>As my title suggests, the only show I can really compare this to is the excellent 2003 remake of Battlestar Galactica which took the same approach of challenging our preconceptions of good &amp; evil. Both of these shows begin with the premise of a ""good guy"" (the detective, or in Battlestar the human), and then turning everything on its head to the point where you may often find yourself rooting for the ""bad guy"" (the accused, or in Battlestar the cylons). Maybe it took 1000 years for storytellers to get it right, but I'm reminded of the ancient poem by Omar Khayyam with the greatest line ever written about the human species: ""I myself am heaven and hell.""",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,9.0,17 March 2015

And Robert Carlisle was never better than he was in this. Still sends shivers down my spine watching some of his scenes in this.

1617,Cracker," A superb drama, with wit and great acting **character spoilers, if there is such a thing**","When I first heard about ""Cracker"" (in the Video Movie Guide), I'd only seen one thing with Robbie Coltraine in it (""Ink and Incapability"", the episode of BA III with Dr. Johnson's dictionary).  By the time I finally got around to actually watching the show, however, Coltraine had become one of my favorite actors, and after viewing several episodes of this show, that place has been cemented.<br/><br/>   Coltraine's Edward Fitzgerald is one of the most compelling television characters ever.  He's a gambler, and a chronic smoker and drinker (6 or 7 bottles a week, and 50-60 cigarettes a day), so he is hardly an admirable figure.  He also comes off to me as something of a misogynist (sp.?), given his treatment of his wife (during the midst of an argument with her, he continues saying, ""Come to bed with me"" until she finally relents) and fooling around with other women, and is very sarcastic (most of the show's humor comes from him).  And yet, he is a brilliant psychologist who can smell a rat a mile a way and is usually, despite all his domestic and personal problems, a step ahead of the criminals - and always a step ahead of his colleagues in the police, who are Fitz's archenemies, and yet continue asking for his help when the chips are down (""He's havin' fits, Fitz!""/""Yeah, well I'm still in custody, Custody!"").  Coltraine's superb performance is to be commended.<br/><br/>   The villains are a mixed bag; I found the couple from ""To Say I Love You"" quite annoying; but the murderer from ""To Be A Somebody"", played by the brilliant Robert Carlyle (""The Full Monty"", ""The World Is Not Enough"" [which, incidentally, co-starred Coltraine]), is a quite human character who gains more confidence the more he kills (though his motives aren't really clear as far as I'm concerned).  <br/><br/>   The supporting cast (I'm not looking up any names right now, lest my comment be erased when I return) is equally superb.<br/><br/>   Nine stars.

1620,Cracker, McGovern in his prime,"It's now impossible to imagine anyone other than Robbie Coltrane as the rather eccentric psychologist Fitz.

Jimmy McGovern's absence can be felt around the third series, (especially in Best Boys, though it's still a good piece of TV in its own right) but along with all previous series of the show, maintains the right pacing and excellent performances. I may have only discovered this show within the last number of years, but I have no regrets. It was bold, unique, even controversial at times, but all the better for it.

Yaw-dropping story lines, real characters and the ultimate escape from this real world to another real world. More than a spectator, you are drawn into the story as an active participant. Although not all episodes are equally strong, even the weakest episode is better than anything on TV in recent years. Besides that, the overall level is the highest I saw in years. Think Sopranos but better. Coltrane gives the best performance of his life, he doesn't play Fitz, he IS Fitz. Supporting cast is elevated to the same level of expertise, you feel like you're looking at a cast who worked together for years and years. Never boring, always riveting.

1623,Teachers, Top Class Television minus a couple of Seasons.,"This is great stuff. Really great. I fell in love with Teachers after being forced to watch it. Truly wonderful television at it's best. All the characters are a joy to watch and I mean ALL. Simon Casey, played superbly by Andrew Lincoln, seems to be the main focus point. Supported very well by characters Susan, Jenny, Kurt and Brian along with The Head Mistress, Bob, Liz and Carol. Kurt and Brian seem to be the main comedy and Susan the rational one. Jenny is like a split personality of good and bad and Liz is the local gossip queen.<br/><br/>The characters play so well off of each other that it's an actual joy to watch. What is even greater about this show is the things you notice when you watch it again. The little things. Like a sheep on the school grounds or maybe teachers fighting on the grounds why the pupils look on. Brilliant stuff.<br/><br/>Season 2 was also fantastic. At first I didn't warm to JP but over time, I actually like him in this. Penny's okay, possibly the weakest character of the second series but not really flawed if you know what I mean. The music was also well chosen. Totally fantastic.<br/><br/>Now, like with a lot of good things, they have to come to an end and with teachers, for me, it came in Season 3. Three characters were gone and replacements were inserted. The female replacement was a pointless effort and a boring character. What were they thinking!!! Simon, being one of the actors to part with the show, does return for a few episodes and does lift the morale of the show. However, no matter how good he is, there is still a void from the other two characters which hurts deeply.<br/><br/>Season 4, now what was going on here. They should have just not bothered. I hate to say this but I have finally come to terms with it. This Season is thew worst and most pointless effort ever. I watched it over and over again to try a like it. Sorry but no way.

Although it's better that we don't get sick of his idiot character Simon, otherwise it won't be great for his career. His storyline (out of about 9) in Love Actually was probably the most interesting, so it shows that he's not limited to whiny and bitter characters. The music used in Teachers is great - especially stuff like using a bit of Stravinsky as Carol's 'theme' when Kurt is trying to avoid her. And Carol herself, what a freak. Very funny stuff.

1625,Teachers, a cult show for the 00's,"The First time Andrew Lincoln came to British Screens, was in the cult TV show ""This Life"" in which he played a quirky, neurotic and often confused lawyer. The reason the two series of ""This life"" were so good was due to the rich array of characters who played off one another so nicely, and a strong story line that was fast paced, witty and realistic.<br/><br/>Teacher's feels like it was written as a vehicle to show case the strongest characteristics of Lincoln's character in ""This life"". His character, Simon, in teachers is even more neurotic and confused about life than Egg was. On paper this sounds like it runs the risk of type-casting Lincoln and ruining the show from the out set. In reality Lincoln manages to pull it off; in fact he does so, so superbly that he avoids all the clichés and pitfalls and really shines.<br/><br/>While Andrew Lincoln twinkles his socks off, the rest of the cast refuse to be out done, Raquel Cassidy and nina Sosanya who play susan and jenny Respectively, do so subtly if not sublimely again avoiding the clichés, and Simon's two slobby mates (also teachers) Brian and Kurt played by Adrian Bower and Navin Chowdhry, provide the perfect foil for Simons ever growing neurosis. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, Teachers again has a strong storyline with a lot of fast paced humour and wit, while maintaining a degree of realism and showing teaching from both sides of the black board, teachers has all the potential and as I'm sure time will show has all the makings of a cult show in it's own right.",15 out of 17 found this helpful.,,3 May 2001

And that's the thing that is so great about this show; it doesn't glamorize anything. Its Protagonist, 26- year old Simon, is a shallow minded antihero, selfish to the core. He's using people to fulfill his own desperate needs, trying to avoid every responsibility if something goes wrong. Then there is Susan, his emotional female buddy, trying to be strict and decisive but with the tendency to have a turbulent inner life. Add Brian and Kurt, two teachers that behave as a pair of 13-year olds, to the mix and you have a very funny show. I also adored the at the surface ice cold Jenny Page. She has that kind of cool and distant beauty that some women have.

I've seen only a few episodes from series 3 and 4 so this review is focused on the first two series.<br/><br/>Simon and Susan were great characters. I could easily identify with them 'cause I work in school and I share some of Simon's attitudes towards students and my colleagues often come to me with their problems - that makes me feel overwhelmed at times, just like Susan.<br/><br/>The relationship between colleagues is warm and close. I like the fact that they could talk about a lot of topics, including silly conversations. They hang out after work, get involved in pranks and some of them are flatmates. The only character I didn't like from the beginning was Jenny, but eventually she warmed up to me.

1629,Teachers, Teachers- a work of genius,"I first saw teachers when i was unable to sleep one night, and i was watching random programmes on the box. The character of Simon, played by Andrew Lincoln had me hooked straight away. Here was a character who was entirely believable, and who's situation was also recognisable as commonplace. I have followed the show ever since, and purchased the DVD box-sets. Series One was good in its own right but was perhaps more useful in creating and explaining the characters before the masterful series two, which is possibly my favourite series of any TV show ever, despite Simon's decision to go travelling. However, i have to say that the effect of his departure was what kept the show fresh for series three. Getting rid of Simon made it necessary to remove Susan, and create a new double act in Matt and Lindsay. It also served the purpose of allowing the other characters to develop, turning it from a one-man-show into a series with several strong characters, and thus while Simon's departure is a shame, it is also the only way to keep the series fresh. However, by the time the fourth series came around, all the strong characters were gone- Simon, Jenny, Matt, and the Brian-Kurt double-act. The new characters lacked focus, and the attempt to bring Bob into the group as an equal-footing teacher was frankly risible. I think the programme-makers know this as well, which explains why series 1,2, and 3 are available as a single box-set and 4 is only available separately. However, Series 1,2 and 3 combine to make possibly the best British comedy series since Blackadder.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,,15 November 2005

It is probably too conscious of the fact that viewers have their own favourite characters because it ensures that those remaining at the end have all had at least one shag so everyone watching will be happy...<br/><br/>Alas, there will be a third series, if it begins with JP's murder then there's still hope for this programme.",9 out of 14 found this helpful.,,22 October 2002

As well as being incredibly funny, this show is realistic.<br/><br/>It shows the everyday life of a twenty -something secondary school teacher, Simon, who everyone would love as their teacher as he doesn't seem to want to grow up. We see how he copes with teaching his rowdy class and how he gets on with his workmates. There's Jenny, the teacher who has a reputation for being a bit of a dragon and shows obvious contempt for Simon, which he returns equally (although he has a secret crush on her). There's his two slobby mates who are also teachers and there's his friend Susan who is the head of year and who he consults for advice on his personal life.

1632,Teachers, Wonderful for first series,"The first couple of series of Teachers are wonderful. The third is so-so.<br/><br/>The fourth is dire, and I'm honestly surprised the cast agreed to many of the story lines.<br/><br/>Many other reviewers have commented on character changes being problematic in the later series. The loss of lead characters is a problem, but it's not the real reason that Series 4 is an unmitigated horror. Let's detail why:<br/><br/>1. Three new characters are introduced. The first is a ""hot guy"" to effectively replace Andrew Lincoln/James Lance. His character works okay, or would have done if they tried to establish more chemistry with established characters (as with Lindsay/Matt in Series 3). The other two characters are mystifyingly awful in how they are written. One (the ""hypochondriac"") is simply never funny. The other should be on TVTropes as the ultimate ""token"" hire. The poor actor is literally given no personality at all and nothing interesting to work with. Even straight men (in the comedy usage of the term) are supposed to be funny.<br/><br/>2. The themes and story lines are puerile, gross-out and frequently offensive, without being funny. In the earlier series the joke was having puerile characters in adult situations (teaching). In the last series, the situations are puerile. I feel particularly sorry for Vicky Hall (Lindsay) having to act the ""fat episode"". As for the ""Ping"" storyline, words simply fail.

1633,Teachers, A refreshing view on school life from a teacher's perspective,"Contrary to other theme-based shows, such as hospitals (E.R., Scrubs more importantly), hotels (Jamie Foxx Show) and crime scenes (CSI + spin-offs), ""Teachers"" is situated mostly in and around an fictional school and gives us a realistic view on how school life is from the eye of a teacher. While this element might be a bit overdone at some points (it is unlikely that all teachers go to the pub, every night, with their colleagues - not to mention the excessive smoking by all staff members), it does not raise doubts about the reliability of how situations are coped with. If we compare this to far from the truth patient-doctor relationships in Scrubs, miraculous survivals in E.R. and questionable research methods in Crime Scene Investigation, the impression is accurate at least.<br/><br/>Themes in this show vary from teacher-student problems, (the lack of) a sex and/or love life, school events, alcohol, smoking, relationships with colleagues (even cheating with them), maturity and the choice of be(com)ing a teacher. Simon for example, constantly struggles whether he has made the right decision to be a teacher, whereas Matt definitely seems to be having trouble with being faithful and Kurt and Brian have relationship issues -- most relations are purely sexual and usually end up in a catastrophe and are therefor even rumored to have a homosexual relationship.<br/><br/>The teachers are portrayed as very normal human beings, something that a student may forget at that age, or not even think of. But we're all humans after all - teachers cope with sometimes even the same problems as their students; including hangovers and love. You might even say that teachers are not as adult and grown-up as they should be theoretically. From an educational aspect only, it looks as if they are all quite in the wrong business. Though this changes through the course of the episodes, where the actual teaching seems to be educationally correct.<br/><br/>The balance between humor and serious issues seems to be fair and quite random. This is not the sort of show I would stay home for, but definitely to watch when I bump into it. The jokes are mostly unpredictable, while some others lean on clichés and easy puns, for instance; the mispronunciation of 'Mr. Dong' instead of 'Mr. Chong', after the school principle has been looking below Bob's belt and then directs herself at Mr. Chong, an Asian man who is presumably visiting or inspecting the school that day.<br/><br/>The changing of the cast in every season may be frustrating at times, but on the other hand is a realistic view on how things happen at a school. After all, teachers tend to get fired, get promoted, or (take a) leave. Every cast member has their own personality, with the problems that come along with it, including divorce, cheating on your partner, obesity, homosexuality, height, problems with several body features (it is for instance suggested that the size of Kurt's penis is below average) and so on. They might not be all be very detailed, but they give one the feeling you can relate to (at least one of) the teachers.<br/><br/>A definitive plus and highly recommended.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,8.0,26 April 2008
1634,Teachers, Sex in someplace very uncomfortable,"Teachers made a welcome return for a third season this week on channel 4.<br/><br/>I think Andrew Lincoln was wise to take a brake from the starring role this series, as his character had become whiney and his mannerisms beginning to grate.  Although he did direct some this season and returns towards the end.<br/><br/>The first episode was business as usual with the new characters from last season plus a couple of others grown into their roles.  Susan is gone and will be missed as the mentor in the group, but with Simon gone there would have been little for her to do.<br/><br/>The main ingredients remain such as the great humour at the expense of anyone the script sees fit, including some very unfair jokes at the expense of a little fat kid thats going bald, that are hilarious, and the excellent soundtrack (Feeder rock)<br/><br/>Adrian bower handles his new job as lead well, evolving from the confused teacher that thought maybe he could do more that was the butt of so many jokes previously.<br/><br/>All in all the show is still going strong, the storylines, while not earthshattering are still strong and I hope this goes on for a while longer.",4 out of 8 found this helpful.,,8 August 2003

But, the fact is once there is a protagonist you can't just alter the dynamic so radically. Sure in season 1 it had strong ensemble elements, but things needed to keep on that path. Simon then Susan as the second lead should've stayed the primary focus. A genuine wasted opportunity as Simon Casey, what a character. You can really see the making of Andrew Lincoln in this role. And it's a real shame that (I suspect, anyway) that the producers gave up on his character. Once the focus stops being on Simon (as he leaves at the end of season 2) the quality begins nose diving, rapidly.<br/><br/>Season 3. Average. Simon's brief return causes the show to soar once more, albeit very briefly. But his reappearance only underlines that two of the other leads (Jenny and Susan) just disappeared at the end of season 2 without any explanation, or without *any* of the other characters seeming to notice or even mention it.

1638,Teachers, Teachers gets better and better,"David Clayton is WRONG!  I loved series 1 of Teachers, but by the end I did feel a little bit ""Simon""-ed out, and was worried how the show would sustain itself.  I shouldn't have worried - because what we got was an infinitely better Series 2.  Where characters who we'd got to know in relationship to Simon, slowly through Series 1, really came into their own - and facets of their characters that were only touched on were really allowed to flourish.<br/><br/>
I liked the way Andrew Lincoln left the series (not your usual cliched stuff, but nicely underplayed) - I found it moving, but not over-cooked. You were sad to see him go, but knew that the world (and the series) would survive without him.  Contrary to what David said, I got the impression that it had been really well built to.  And it seems much more true to life to me this way.  People do drift in and out of our lives - and whilst the idea is always horrible, it's amazing how the gaps they leave heal up.<br/><br/>

1640,Teachers, Stop After Series 2,"Series 1-2
A great and refreshing series following the lives of a few close-knit teachers. The main characters have great chemistry which keeps the storylines interesting and the arcs progressive. These are supplemented with a decent backdrop of context, setting, and supporting characters, but most of all a brilliant soundtrack that really sets the scene of the early-2000s.<br/><br/>Characters are diverse whilst having a single tie bringing with it a multitude of stories to follow. Whilst not side-splittingly hilarious it is witty and occasionally there are big laughs.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Series 3
Although the general quality of the show lessens, the real downfall is what happens off-screen. The main character leaves a few episodes prior to the end of series 2, but this is fine as the finale follows arcs following the remaining characters, keeping a similar vibe, and weening you off Andrew Lincoln. What isn't fine is then dropping half of the main cast between series without any explanation. Seemingly half of the school's staff either drop dead of move away, and the result is being left with just two of the former main characters and a supporting cast that no-one really cares about.<br/><br/>Matt, the new English teacher, has the personality of a spoon, Penny continues to be annoying without the foil of the previous characters, Lindsay doesn't really do anything wrong but doesn't have a strong enough chemistry with anyone to be a compelling character. Kurt and Brian continue with their juvenile conversations, but it doesn't really come off without others there to call them up on it. Carol is shoehorned with a new circumstance but again with no explanation nor purpose.<br/><br/>The likes of Liz and Bob get a bit more screen time, but they were never anyone's favourites, they added well to the first two series as side characters, on their own they're just boring. And that's the thing, series 3 has no progression, no interest, no actual funny moments really, it's just a bit dull.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10<br/><br/>Series 4
It gets worse, particularly at the beginning. The only remaining main characters are killed off-screen, which isn't really a spoiler because it isn't part of any story, the actors are just suddenly replaced by graves. This leaves a few dwindling supporting characters fully taking the lead for the series and this being a pathetic continuation of what was originally a good series. New characters are supplemented in with similar traits, but most are dislikeable, bar Matthew Horne's neurotic addition, and Bob becomes a lead role, much to the joy of no one. The latter half of the series is far better than the opening episodes, but still it isn't particularly funny at any point, not engaging to the new storylines. By this time you just feel cheated, the draw to Teachers wasn't the particular school they were in, it was the original cast.

1648,Manhunt, Very solid dramatisation of a real-life murder investigation,"Manhunt is a dramatisation of the hunt for the real-life murder of Amelie de la Grange on London's Twickenham Green in 2004. If I didn't know that the events which took place in Manhunt were real history, I'd still have been impressed by the production. We've all seen a load of police procedurals before, but I've never seen one that felt so true before, probably because the drama is derived from the memoirs of the detective who led the investigation. The process, then, is surely as close to what really happened, the behaviour of officers and the unfolding of the investigation as true as possible.
The cast did an excellent job of portraying people who felt real, the dialogue didn't come across as being overly affected or dramatised. Yet it gripped me throughout. Martin Clunes, in particular, shone as the down-to-earth, no-nonsense DCI Colin Sutton; a million miles away from his very well known Doc Martin persona. I hope the same level of dramatic tension and immersion in the story is maintained through the other episodes, but hats off to the production team for the first installment in any case.",73 out of 82 found this helpful.,9.0,6 January 2019

1650,Manhunt," Competent, assured dramatisation, sensitively and accurately handled","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In 2004, the body of a young woman found on Twickenham Common in London was the catalyst for a major, nationwide investigation to find her killer. This true life dramatization depicts the inquiry, led by DCI Colin Sutton (Martin Clunes), who is assigned as the Chief Investigating Officer on what will prove to be the case of his career. His relentless, thorough determination to track down the killer causes him to link the case to two other unsolved murders, which bear striking similarities.<br/><br/>Early into the new year, and we've certainly been treated to a barrage of interesting, original productions on the terrestrial TV channels, including this ITV drama, about the hunt for serial killer Levi Bellfield. Although not produced with any direct consultation with the victim's families, it appears to play out with a convincing degree of accuracy, and sensitivity for the feelings of those affected. It also captures the obligatory 'mood' of the serial killer drama perfectly, creating a bleak, drained backdrop for the events to convey themselves in.<br/><br/>Although he may feel typecast by some in comedies like Doc Martin and Men Behaving Badly, Clunes is perfectly capable of handling more serious, dramatic roles, of which this is ample proof. One of those actors who's always had to prove himself, here he carries the lead role with a fine amount of charisma and depth, as a man whose devotion to his work and achieving a result even comes at the expense of his home life, causing his marriage and relationship with his daughter to suffer, and even pulling out of a family holiday to Italy to be at a family wedding in order to chase up a new lead. It's a telling revelation of the sacrifices some must make to punish the guilty and keep us safe.<br/><br/>Overall, an absorbing and gripping dramatization of the crimes of one of the more recent serial killers, which respectfully never forgets the true to life nature of its subject matter and end up trivialising the crimes in any way. ****",21 out of 23 found this helpful.,9.0,10 January 2019

I very much appreciated the no nonsense, factual production. No sexy actors in ridiculous outfits, no superfluous car chases or violence on screen. It accurately showed what police work is - the methodical tracking down of evidence until the parts become a whole. It's professional team work, with all the frustration that entails, and it can mean bucking the system. I recall this investigation was one of the first that relied almost entirely on CCTV.
Hollywood could take a few lessons from this series. BBC could as well. Except that BBB does formulaic better than Hollywood. At least on BBC there's a chance the actors will look and dress like normal people. I admit I am a Martin Clunes fan - going back to his pre Doc Martin days.<br/><br/>Anyhow, I felt so sorry for the random victims of the very violent offender and their grief stricken families.

1653,Manhunt, A sensitive telling of a real life killing.,"This three part dramatisation focuses on recent tragedies, notably the killing of Amelie de la Grange back in 2004. It feels at times like a documentary, as it focuses more so on the telling of the story, the procedures, obstacles and facts of the case, never at any point does it deliver any moments of drama, nor offer up any sensationalism of the crimes. Personally I think it could have been delivered over two episodes, the second part is very padded out, and lacks any true impact. Saying that it's a sensitive telling of a harrowing case. Martin Clunes is fantastic as the unshakeable Colin Sutton, it's good that Sutton had involvement in the telling of the story.<br/><br/>I am so glad that people can make a TV show like this in a way that makes you feel like you've been informed as opposed to cheaply shocked.<br/><br/>Well made drama. 8/10",20 out of 24 found this helpful.,8.0,23 February 2019

1655,Manhunt, The devil and the detail,"A tense and convincing three part dramatisation of the events leading up to the arrest of serial killer Levi Bellfield in 2004. Bellfield, a hulking, aggressive, mood-swinging brute of a guy with a fetish for young girls and a hatred of blondes was eventually caught after his savage murder of a young French girl Amélie De La Grange who had only been in the U.K. for a couple of months, although he'd killed twice before, almost killed another and otherwise had a history of violence. The first major homicide case of a newly appointed DSI Colin Sutton, on whose new book the programmes are based, his old-school, meticulous approach to the evidence seemed to upset his results-driven boss and one or two young Turks in his own team but eventually paid dividends in a life-means-life conviction for the monster murderer.<br/><br/>The series has been justifiably commended for its non-sensationalist approach to its subject matter so that none of the killings are re-enacted, the Bellfield character gets no chance to defend or justify his actions and while there are one or two eureka moments and other tense dramatic situations like when the team await the CPS go-ahead to arrest him and then when they finally raid Bellfield's house, these are played out in a low-key, unspectacular way as befits the seriousness of the subject matter.<br/><br/>I guess we'll never know the dramatic licence taken with the events, such as who's real and did that actually happen but this is usually the case with sensitive true-life situations and it looked to me as if sufficient respect was paid to the parties most affected by Bellfield's actions. In particular we see this with the sympathetic treatment of Amelie's grieving parents especially when they are given the heartbreaking news that better policing after Bellfield's previous attacks might have prevented their daughter's murder.<br/><br/>My main criticism of the series was the usual one I find in these TV dramas, the playing up of the lead detective's family life. I could care less that he wasn't getting on with his profiler wife, missed a family wedding trip to Spain with her or that he forgot his daughter's birthday. It was very obvious without these domestic dramas to see that Colin Sutton was a driven policeman, consumed by the case.<br/><br/>I don't think I've seen Martin Clunes in anything since ""Men Behaving Badly"" even as I'm aware that he appears to be being set up as the new David Jason as he goes into his older age. He was solid in the lead part however and had good support from the rest of the cast, some of them recognisable from other TV dramas of the recent past.<br/><br/>This was an important story, soberly told as it should have been and a good example of how to portray tough subject matter such as this.",22 out of 29 found this helpful.,7.0,10 January 2019

My TV viewing is diminished without them. I've been waiting for something to take their place.<br/><br/>""Manhunt"" has many of the qualities that made those series so watchable. A difference is that it is based on a real case: the hunt in London for the killer of a young French woman that uncovers something far more.<br/><br/>Like those shows I loved, ""Manhunt"" concentrates more on methodical police procedure than on over-the-top shootouts or squealing tyres. But more significantly, it has depth of character. Martin Clunes as DCI Colin Sutton heads the task force hunting the killer. He is no-nonsense, but nowhere near as abrupt as his Aspergerish character in ""Doc Martin"".<br/><br/>Colin Sutton has a heart, he's a dad; he gets the pain the parents of the victim must be feeling. He demands they be informed face to face that their daughter is dead - not told over the phone as the French police plan to do.<br/><br/>There are other little touches that show his compassion. Here is the key ingredient that makes the best series work. The main character has empathy. No matter how tough the exterior, they can relate to what people are going through - although in his dedication to the job Colin does neglect his family a bit too much.<br/><br/>""Manhunt"" ticks another box. Colin has a colleague who has his back - the buddy if you like. In this case it's Katie Lyons as DS Jo Blunt. She stands up for her boss when other members of the team doubt his methods<br/><br/>The series has an authentic look. Shot on the streets as weary men and women spend hours searching for clues. But it's the relentless combing through miles of CCTV footage and supermarket dockets that finally pays off.<br/><br/>It's a classy effort all round with a low-key background score by Niall Byrne setting an ominous mood.<br/><br/>There is another series coming in 2020.

1658,Manhunt," Poignant, Honest &amp; Thorough English Police Docudrama","Martin Clunes performance was convincing although outside of his more recently usual genre. I believed his portrayal &amp; I have increased respect for his acting talent since viewing this story.<br/><br/>The story itself I found interesting, especially since it reflects true events and, because of that aspect, I felt free to expect &amp; tolerate a bit more of the day-to-day grind which happens behind a working police force. It kept my attention and I viewed all three episodes within the span of 24 hours.<br/><br/>It introduced an aspect of police work which I had not previously considered, that being the stressors of the job not related to fear of being injured or that of dealing with injury &amp; loss of life because of crime, however the impact of the profession on Clune's portrayed daughter was as per usual, cop parent never home enough, and cop parent worries more about family because they know what goes on out there. The program did a good job on the stressors in the second marriage of the detective, but also of the wife, also in a relatively similar field of work and was impacted because of her marriage to him (not just because of being the wife of a cop). It demonstrated how her professional life was impacted as well, and as an analyst, perhaps how the forces behind crime solving can be underappreciated by not only the public, but by the front line cops who deal with the public. It also, sadly, showed that corroboration between this married pair might have enhanced expedience in results, but was impeded by not only the husbands initial singular-minded stance but by the competing district. It also reflected her just concerns about her detective spouse's impact on coworkers which may affect her own job. I enjoyed her portrayal here and had appreciated her in her another genre, also, (the only other thing I remember her from), which I believe I am correct that she played Emma Timmons in the series Larkrise to Candleford, which was originally available here in the States provided to us by PBS. We are limited by what's available here, but her talent leads me to expect she is quite well-known in the UK.<br/><br/>Perhaps others looking toward the excitement of the usual fictional crime drama, which can be built into a script with car chases and such, might find the going a little slow, but as a docudrama with all this going on underneath the actual crime, and the honesty in which this case was portrayed, showing the pimples of a working police department. People do go on holiday, there can be miscommunication with it which can delay outcomes and cost lives, a bungled search, etc. think the story was very well done, and I can do without car chases and bullets flying.. the attic scene showed enough suspense about possible police injury for my taste. This shows only some of the difficulties in police work and how the job affects the lives of those working it, as well as being a good portrayal of the actual story of how this disturbing psychopath interacted with those in his life and how he was cought. It shows how law and order may be interfered with and manipulated by tge press. It demonstrated the stressors &amp; resistance any professional must endure to effect a more responsible job, but particularly the resistance a detective, who fights resistance to being thorough, both higher and lower in rank, which is costly, and speaks to the to the dedicated diligence that is needed to make an effective arrest... one which will actually take the bad guy off the streets and effect a conviction, which is the result we all want in real life, not just an exciting story.

The show's best feature is how it ramps up the excitement as the show progresses, so bear with the slow pace of the first episode, as this is an easily binged watch and you'll love the conclusion.

1663,Manhunt, True-life stories are often a difficult transition to film - this one made it,"This is just a quick review, or more apt a few quick comments, because others will provide plenty of story info. I gave a rating of 9 because I've watched many detective shows (along with others) and I sometimes use the fast forward on time wasting scenes. I never touched the fast forward on Manhunt. I was totally immersed and never lost interest in this gripping story. Seeing Martin Clunes in a very non Doc Martin part was most illuminating. Any actor who can nail performances from basically both ends of the spectrum, is a very good actor. So hats off to Mr. Clunes and well done, which also shines a light of appreciation on the dedication of real life DCI Colin Sutton. In addition to the starring parts I also like to look for supporting players who stick in the mind so tip of the hat to Katie Lyons, Stephen Wight and what a scary villain played by Celyn Jones (probably a teddy bear in real life).

1664,Manhunt, Excellent. Explained so much.,"I recall the news about Milly Dowler, but Amelie and the other poor girl (whose name temporarily escapes me) were so quickly glossed over.
Were it not for the sheer doggedness of DCI Colin Sutton, and his demand for thoroughness and respect from his team, that evil man would never have been caught. The travesty of the force who let evidence go ignored makes one wonder just how much the force really can be bothered once the budget masters start poking about.
I've been watching a lot of true crime dramas from itv, and one thing's for certain - the committed detective gets little support from his superior these days. You've only got to watch Des and compare it to year 2000+ murders to see how much the government has cut police funding.
Acting superb from all concerned - especially Martin Clunes - who I usually avoid!
Brilliant explanation of the whole investigation and the roadblocks that poor detective faced at almost every step of the way.

1667,Manhunt, Good Drama Exposes The Deplorable Met and Surrey Police,It's ironic that a cast of actors mainly known for comedy roles should be performing in this drama. The whole disgraceful episode in policing would be comedic if it wasn't so tragic. The investigations into these terrible events was utterly incompetent and shambolic. It exposed the mistrust between English Police forces and their gross mismanagement. I can't believe they were about to leave a house where they'd searched for a murder suspect without having checked the attic and having to be told (luckily) by his wife that he was up there. Missing a statement of incredible significance right at the start and failing to do a CCTV review of a pertinent tape defies belief. Mistakes can be made as we are all human.

1669,Manhunt, It's always hard to review a real-life crime drama.,"Yes, it is - it is always hard and rightly so.<br/><br/>Martin Clunes heads up a cast of usual TV faces to paint a picture of the hunt for Levi Bellfield.<br/><br/>ITV have always produced solid dramas of this type and all the usual tropes are there - the pre-amble states that this is a dramatisation and some scenes and characters are fabricated in order to shortcut a number of ties within the plot.<br/><br/>This is fine and all, but at times, it feels as though the drama is serving the purposes of the Met and not he public. ITV isn't a public-owned broadcaster and therefore do not answer to the public; I'm not saying that this programme is intended to mask the many faults of the investigation, but something along those lines.<br/><br/>It appears to focus on the good things that the Met did and it also focuses on the SIO Colin Sutton. The plot and story is devised by the said officer and it is clearly stated that this is a result of his memoirs of the case.<br/><br/>I'm sure that his accounts are backed up by the Met, but in a case which was widely criticised and questioned, I question the wisdom in allowing the 'Guv' to devise this piece. Maybe there is an element of laziness on ITV's part, or some ulterior motive, either way, perhaps he's the best person to tell the story, perhaps he isn't - who knows?<br/><br/>The point that I'm trying to make is that it is mostly centered on the 'Guv' and while this is the norm nowadays, it kind of makes him out to be some kind of Sherlock Holmes.<br/><br/>But not only this, it drags the 'Guv's' personal life into the equation as if to give him some humanity and while he is, of course, human, the 15-20+ minutes we are offered into the personal life of Sutton, could easily be better used on some of the more poignant points of the case.<br/><br/>The scenes with the wife also appear to give specific focus on how bureaucracy played its part in the whole investigation. Okay, that might be true, but does it really warrant a complete dramatic exposition on the matter?<br/><br/>Furthermore, in order to get a clear overview of the passing of time, it is important to keep an eye on the small time ticker that passes. The cretinous scum who committed these grotesque crimes went unnoticed for such a long time, and you can't help but ask - what took them so long? Well, they paint him as some kind of lucky and crafty serial killer who eluded capture; when in fact, it was down to incompetence and inter-force bureaucracy.<br/><br/>But this isn't what is infuriating - what is infuriating is that this drama did not focus on the complete mess that was the 'investigation' of Milly Dowler. Okay, it could be argued that this was not the focus of the programme and that ITV could only work with what they had.<br/><br/>But rather than commission a serial which focused on all the crimes (and the tragically misguided investigation into Milly's disappearance), ITV produced what looked like a rushed drama from a book (sorry, memoirs) written years after the fact.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but ITV have took a shortcut here and told the wrong story - between his two ex's and Colin Sutton squabbling over who really caught him, there was a family who went through years of agony and suffering, only to have a serial created which focuses on the wrong story in this whole torrid affair.<br/><br/>Whoever commissioned this at ITV really should take a long hard look in the mirror and wobble their collective heads a bit.<br/><br/>Rather than create a half-baked drama on all the great things that the Police force (in general) did do right, perhaps create something that is critical and poignant in order to better serve the public viewers.<br/><br/>Furthermore, I would love to see what scenes were 'dramatic' and what scenes weren't, as there are one or two that are surely questionable.<br/><br/>The editing looks standard ITV M.O, the photography is as expected and the sound and music design are decent. The acting and direction are okay, if a little forced at the conflict points, but you can't fault the acting, it is quite good.<br/><br/>Give this one a miss - if you want entertainment, go for it; if you want to get pure facts and draw up your own conclusion, spend the three or so hours researching the cases from point-A to point-B.<br/><br/>How shockingly tired and same-old, same-old ITV drama's have become.<br/><br/>The source for this review is a video review I am producing for Youtube - feel free to search for it where you may give me your thoughts or if you would like to retort.",12 out of 30 found this helpful.,5.0,11 January 2019
1670,Manhunt, Excellent In Every Respect!!!,"""Doc Martin"" star Martin Clunes stars in this adaptation of the grisly real-life homicides of several blond women in England in 2004 as he plays a London Metropolitan police detective who struggles against long odds to not only arrest but also convict a serial killer. Clunes' wife ""Sliding Doors"" producer Philippa Braithwaite was one of the four executive producers of the show. Cast as the detective who broke the case, Clunes plays a part that is nothing like his Doc Martin protagonist. Instead of rude and abrupt, Clunes is helpful and dedicated. When an innocent bystander stumbles upon the body of a girl sprawled out in death on London's Twickenham Green in 2004, our hero is given the case. The actual detective on the case Colin Sutton apparently provided the story and may even has co-written the teleplay for three Acorn episodes with Ed Whitmore, who had earlier co-wrote the television drama ""Rillington Place"" about serial killer John Christie. Methodical and straightforward are adjectives that aptly describe the way that Marc Evans has staged the police procedural nail-biter. This three episode drama never tries to be sensational, but it delivers in terms of acting and drama. At the heart of the plot is a mistake that London police made when they had enough evidence to arrest a serial killer, but never reviewed because it was logged in their files in an awkward manner that nobody noticed.

1673,I Love Dick, Really got into it - surprised by bad reviews!,"I didn't look at the reviews before watching the show, because I'd heard an interview on it on the radio and really liked the concept. I haven't read the book yet, so I can make no comparison there.<br/><br/>It took me a couple of episodes but then I was really hooked. It's off beat and unusual -- the protagonist is for the most part unlikeable, but that's part of the point I think. Her awkwardness and self-involvement are cringeworthy, but you can't help but see yourself reflected, at least in small percentages, in her. It's an interesting exploration of various female voices, of the women that surround Dick with Dick as an object and and very rarely a subject in the series, taking instead the women to always embody the role of the subjects rather than the men (turning the television /film industry on its head). <br/><br/>One post here wrote ""feminism gone awry,"" but I completely disagree. I loved for instance that they show the viewer various works by female artists throughout the series, in a way that's seamless, thoughtful, and stimulating. I didn't feel that this show was overly political or something like that -- it doesn't have an agenda, but is itself an expression of various crises, struggles, small triumphs and losses, of identity and relationships, growth and personhood, marriage and single- ness (and the bounds of each) with the female perspective at the center of these queries. It doesn't fit in the normal bounds of genre - it's darkly funny, but you'll probably never laugh out loud. Nor is it plot driven. It's it's own thing, but at no point did I find it boring.<br/><br/>The show is interesting and different and genuinely held my attention. And I thought the acting was superb, from all involved and particularly from Kathryn Hahn (not only Kevin Bacon!). It's bizarre and kind of wonderful and I'd be excited for a second season.",59 out of 71 found this helpful.,9.0,23 July 2017

1675,I Love Dick, Loved,"The only reason I give this 9 stars is because I wasn't quite compelled to watch the entire season in one sitting (was two episodes shy), but that doesn't take away from how much I loved it. Also, I haven't texted everyone I know about it, because it's not a series for everyone, which also puts it in the 9 stars category.<br/><br/>Until now I've been a lukewarm Kathryn Hahn fan, but she was great in this, and changed my opinion of her acting completely.<br/><br/>Ditto with Kevin Bacon. I never saw him as a sex symbol before (and I grew up during the Footloose era), but hot damn, he was smokin' in this.<br/><br/>This is a series for feminist womyn. I do believe plenty of men would like it, but I doubt your rough and tumble beer-swigging, crotch-scratchers would find one second of it interesting. It's full of liberal-minded characters, some who smoke pot, some who are lesbians, some who experienced same-sex sex in 70's drug-induced states.<br/><br/>Take-away: If you're a right-winged Republican Christian, take a pass. Everyone else with an open mind who enjoys artsy pieces with lots of sex and nudity, as well as dialog that makes you pause the show so you can absorb the multitude of ""lightbulb moments"" it triggers within your own life, I highly recommend it.",32 out of 45 found this helpful.,9.0,12 July 2017

Kathryn Hahn, especially, is fascinating to follow through her journey of changes. And Kevin Bacon is more interesting, vulnerable, and funny to watch than ever before. Just a fantastic set of actors throughout this series.<br/><br/>Finally, the show tells a simple story that brings up a ton of complex issues. It is a pro- woman meditation on marriage, art, feminism, gender, and becoming your next self.<br/><br/>I sure hope we get a second season with all these people!!!!",30 out of 43 found this helpful.,,20 June 2017
1677,I Love Dick," I Love Dick starting with its wink-wink title, rubs its fingers together in your face.","I didn't much care for I Love Dick. Great writing, superb photography, tour-de-force acting - what's not to like? For one thing I couldn't stand the husband and wife - I shudder to imagine that at my next art event I might find myself sitting next to that duo at dinner. I'm sorry, you have to have some empathy for the main characters even if they are diabolically evil. We loved Tony Soprano; we loved the Chicken Man in Breaking Bad. I also thought Kevin Bacon was miscast. He was the opposite of charismatic, and his love scenes seemed robotic instead of comedic. <br/><br/>But those are minor issues. What I viscerally disliked about I Love Dick was its snide cynicism. The creators not only know what buttons to push, they revel in their knowledge. Not only do they manipulate you they make sure you know you're being manipulated. Like Transparent which I also didn't like, they trot out every trendy social issue and eviscerate whatever's meaningful about those issues with their pandering. This kind of sour cynicism lurking beneath a bright veneer of virtuoso craft is the bane of many an American visual production. You notice it when you see a foreign film or video comparable in quality. Real values emerge; instead of cynicism you get sincerity and a passionate belief in the validity of what they are attempting. Last on their list is the potential audience, the numbers, or the box office and it shows. And that is also true of the very best American 'extended film' videos like The Wire, The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, True Detective and Fargo. These series are cinematic art at its best. They say important things about the human condition. For all their surface brilliance I love Dick and Transparent are mostly concerned with profit and manipulation.

Some people might not like the themes explored about women, sex, feminism, art and existential ideas. I do.

1686,I Love Dick, Recommend it to your Mama,"I loved this series. I loved it so much I watched it twice in a row so I could catch the little things I missed the first time around. Is it ""arty""? Probably. Is it ready for large-scale, commercial consumption? Probably not, but oh, if it could just reach Gen-Xers, they would find it to be a fantastic, unflinching look through a female gaze in a way that matches an aesthetic they will recognize (and appreciate).<br/><br/>Great art allows participants to experience emotion within the (safe) confines of its boundaries. Sometimes narratives evoke emotion through exaggeration, and when we see unfamiliar perspectives this way, we sometimes find them uncanny, grotesque, or awkward because they are so new. I suspect this is why the ""best"" reviews for this series on IMDb are a series of ""one"" star tirades. I get it. Female desire is rarely given this kind of freedom to be explored. Films are directed by, what, 92% men in Hollywood? I'm not saying that men don't know or portray narratives about women authentically, but 8% is just not a big enough sampling to speculate about the spectrum of perspectives that might be missed. Luckily, Jill Soloway doesn't miss.<br/><br/>I have to admit that recommending this series is slightly hard to do linguistically. The announcement of the title is difficult to get out without a chuckle or an immediate explanation about how it is not pornography or a parody featuring lascivious babes who are trained to please voyeurs. The title tests us! We only accept female desire one way in pop culture. But I digress. I love Kathryn Hahn in this. She is hilarious and awkward and authentic. I love Griffin Dunne as Sylvere, and empathize with his horrors--adore him for his character's willingness to reevaluate what it means to *be* a muse. I loved Roberta Colindrez so much-- another artistic representation that truly broke free from its box. And Kevin Bacon is so wonderful--masculine and vulnerable and cruel and desirable.<br/><br/>The end is what makes this series so incredible.

1693,I Love Dick, Horrible Waste Of Time,"I agree with the viewers on here who talk much about the unlikeability of all these characters. One person said they watched about 17 minutes of the pilot and turned it off due to not one character being likeable. Believe it or not, this is a very valid point.<br/><br/>I must tell you that I fast forwarded over many, many minutes of this TV show. I did manage to watch this thing to the very end. Unfortunately, I have to say that as a woman the final scene in this TV show was unsettling to say the least. I I'm so disgusted that I can't unsee what I saw in that final scene between Kathryn Hahn and Kevin Bacon. People, people, people do not watch this TV show. I'm not being an alarmist.<br/><br/>A few years ago I decided to watch Louie CK's TV show on Netflix. There was a scene in one of his episodes that was so disturbing and disgusting that to this day I regret having seen what I saw. I won't even repeat what he wrote in that episode.

1695,I Love Dick, Meh.. Could've been better.,"I'm not a big fan of Jill Soloway's work. I don't get the fascination and hype surrounding the success of *Transparent*. That show is horribly overrated. Not funny at all. It only serves one purpose - promoting tolerance and pushing a certain agenda, which is fine, but there's a lot missing. Good writing for one. It's the same with most of Solloway's work. To me, it falls short most of the time. I Love Dick is pretty much the same. It's defined as a comedy, but it's not funny at all. Not even in the intellectual sense. Seems more like a character study. In one scene, Dunne's character says: *What the hell is wrong with these women?* That kinda sums it up.<br/><br/>I watched the pilot like a year ago (AmazonPilotSeason) and it was the only pilot that didn't suck. Obviously, not-sucking is not the same as being great, but back then it seemed to me that this had some potential. After reading a little bit about the author of the novel this is based on, Chris Krauss (played by Kathryn Hahn), I learned that the Dick character is actually a real-life person, a sociologist (Dick Hebdige). incidentally, not much older than Kevin Bacon. Also, Kevin Bacon is 58 years old. Who knew? <br/><br/>I do like Kathryn Hahn in most of her roles, but in this she's playing an overly dramatic, at times unnecessarily psychotic character, obsessing about almost everything, not only Bacon's character, which I don't quite like. Normally, she does this by adding a comedic component to the role. Not here. The main character seems profoundly unhappy with her marriage, profession, life in general. Her obsession with Dick seems arbitrary. If Dick weren't there, fueled by her anger and dissatisfaction for herself, she'd find something or someone else to freak out about. The use of the opposite or same sex as a source for inspiration for different kinds of expression, artful or otherwise, is a factor in this. In my opinion, a rather boring topic. Overdiscussed and redundant in western civilization.<br/><br/>One review here described the characters as being unpleasant. Accurate. I'd even go as far as calling them uninteresting, broken and lost. Also, if this is about feminism, it's more of a step back than forward. Imo, feminism, as a political and social movement has gone off the rails, which isn't surprising, since most ideologies, systems and everything man (or woman) creates may seem great and perfect at first (or in theory), but eventually leads to overuse and counterproductive extremes.<br/><br/>To sum it up: Not a comedy. A couple of nice points and moments, but ultimately not that interesting. 5.7/10",11 out of 20 found this helpful.,6.0,13 May 2017

Work it out for yourself.<br/><br/>There is lots of full frontal nudity, both male and female, but it is not over the top in my opinion and fits with the story.<br/><br/>Some would say the series is very artsy, but I found it not so.

1700,Shades of Blue, SHADES of BLUE: 2nd Review 2017,"Sunday, 14 May 2017: I initially reviewed this show after watching the first few episodes and I realized what a great show it is. This is a great dirty cop drama that keeps getting better with each episode. Beautiful, sexy and talented Jennifer Lopez, but the Emmy and SAG awards goes to the brilliant actor, Ray Liotta. He is the powerhouse actor on the show. I like that Ray's character Woz does not blink an eye when he has to kill somebody who is more dirtier than he is. <br/><br/>I sure hope Ray gets an Emmy for best male actor in a drama series and the show itself win an Emmy. Watching Jenny Lopez, she is just a naturally sexy and beautiful Latina to watch.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast of actors/actresses fill out the show very well. I hope this show has a long successful run on television for many years. I hope they hurry up and get rid of mobster Bianchi and his crew.",28 out of 42 found this helpful.,,26 January 2016
1701,Shades of Blue, Shades of becoming a very good crime/drama television series,"As momma always said,... when you tell the truth you can always repeat the same story since you don't have to remember any of the lies you may have otherwise told. In Shades of Blue you have an entire team of a police division involved in police corruption. The two lead characters on this corrupt police team are Harlee Santos played by super star Jennifer Lopez and Detective Matt Wozniak, played by Ray Liotta. Harlee plays a veteran cop who is also a single mom raising her 16 year old daughter. Her daughter Cristina Santos (played by Sarah Jeffery) who is a cellist prodigy requires a substantial financial contribution to enrol in a private school for music prodigies. This is the main reason that mom and police woman Harlee Santos is part of a corrupt team of police officers. The team leader is Detective Matt Wozniak, played superbly by the legendary crime genre star Ray Liotta. Ray Liotta is one of my guaranteed good performance actors. Just think of the starring role he had in the crime films Goodfellas, Identity, Cop Land and/or Narc which were all good performances by Ray.<br/><br/>With only the first episode televised at the time of my review it is a tad bit early to tell how the main characters roles will evolve, and if the television series writers will lean more in developing the main characters in the direction of a television crime series like The Shield, or more in mind with the strategic crime series and multiple Emmy winning series The Wire.<br/><br/>I will say though the director of the pilot series is the seasoned director and producer Barry Levinson who has ensured we understand that Harlee Santos is a very busy cop and mom. Within the first 60 minutes in no particular order, we witness Harlee run down and handcuff single handedly a very quick and agile street thug, set up an alibi for a rookie cop who kills a low life drug dealer without thinking first, deliberately smash her daughters car up to back up an alibi she created (remember what momma said about lies versus telling the truth?) earlier with Detective Matt Wozniak, gets caught by the FBI trying to take a bribe form a bookie (who is an FBI agent) and Harlee still finds time to work out in a boxing gym both in and out of the ring with her boy toy (no surprise here) trainer boyfriend. Whewww, Harlee accomplished all that in less than 60 minutes.<br/><br/>So now we see we have a team of corrupt cops trying to do their job of protecting the good citizens of New York City and at the same time make a few bucks off the backs of the bad guys by skimming a little kick back in protection money. We have the FBI closing in on this team of corrupt cops who are now under surveillance, and we have the corrupt team leader Matt Wozniak trying to figure out who the snitch is in his own unit before the FBI can close in on them all and break up this happy little family of close knit corrupt cops.<br/><br/>There is a lot going on in Shades Of Blue and I remain optimistic with this stellar cast of Grade 1 movie and television stars such as Jennifer Lopez, Ray Liotta, Drea de Matteo (The Sopranos), Warren Kole and Lolita Davidovich the series will have a strong first season performance. Mrs Shullivan and I were impressed with the pilot episode. So far I will give the series a positive 9 out of 10 rating for the stellar cast, and the excellent directing and cinematography of the series pilot.",55 out of 89 found this helpful.,9.0,8 January 2016

The story line is presented from a different point of view and I find that very refreshing. The weekly crimes they investigate are more of the subplot while their everyday hassles are the main story.

1705,Shades of Blue," tries to be The Shield, fails.","it's hard to say what's worse, the casting of Jenny Lopez in the lead or the terrible script. jenny? seriously? This show desperately wants to be The Shield, but instead of developing characters and a story over a season, Jenny and Ray break world records for most crimes committed by TV police officers in a single episode. <br/><br/>Lets recap the first episode: 1. 3 minutes in Jenny fakes a crime scene to make a bad shoot look good (her partner thinks an xbox controller looks like a gun and so shoots someone dead. sure why not. sounds plausible)<br/><br/>2. After 9 minutes in Jenny and her cop buddies share cash they have shaken down/stolen from other bad guys (just in case you didn't realise this is a show about corrupt cops at the 3 minute mark)<br/><br/>3. After 20 minutes in Ray makes deal with drug dealer, then beats him up. Vic Mackey policing chapter 1. <br/><br/>4. After 22 minutes Jenny tries to shakedown a bookie for cash. Oops, too bad he's under cover FBI. busted. worst corrupt cop ever. Couldn't even last 23 minutes. <br/><br/>5. After 30 minutes in Ray and Jenny run down a suspect with their car. He gets up and starts running....but 48 year old Jenny manages to run faster in heels and tackles him for the arrest. Girl Power!<br/><br/>6. After 33 minutes Jenny deliberately crashes her car - to cover up a lie she told earlier about the car being in a crash. Unfortunately she survives. <br/><br/>7. After 34 minutes, Ray drinks and drives on the job. Because being a corrupt cop isn't enough of a cliché. he has to be an alcoholic too. <br/><br/>8.

1706,Shades of Blue," The execution can be sketchy and cliché, but its core characters and cast seem to hold up decently.","Jennifer Lopez is really donning the moniker ""Jenny from the Block"". Her acting works have gained mixed reception and Shades of Blue will continue that tradition. The leading actors give a presentable performance and the drama appears to be in working shape, however some of the police works are following frigid formula of crime drama, not to mention a couple of angles are shady and unconvincing.<br/><br/>Female leads in cop series admittedly look like models, for example leads of Castle or Quantico, which is not entirely a bad and might even be appealing, but it doesn't enhance the reliability aspect of the series. What Jennifer brings is the occasional moments where her character is approachable. At these times she can shed the celebrity persona and delves into the character, although there's still inconsistency in this regard.<br/><br/>Harlee Santos (Jennifer Lopez) is a single mother and corrupt cop who is also being chased by FBI. The character can be appealing as the movie plays out the family and camaraderie cards, but it often transitions into intentionally excessively independent woman stereotype or simply become too melodramatic. Fortunately, the supporting cast helps alleviate these few sloppy instances.<br/><br/>Ray Liotta as Wozniak, the patriarch in the police squad, this is a role he's comfortable with. He plays the crude mentor and protector who harbor secret vices presentably well. Warren Kole as Stahl, the FBI agent is charming in creepy kind of way. There's a solid foundation for character development here, although it's not without a lingering inkling that these are crime drama clichés. Furthermore, this translates into some of the police works that just look too outlandishly crafted.<br/><br/>The premise holds together sufficiently, ""Shades of Blue"" has a decent start and relatively suspenseful set-up. If it follows these core directions instead of trails from other shows, it should find some degree of success.",27 out of 44 found this helpful.,7.0,9 January 2016

Yet, it has a lot of soft and tender moments from people that you would not expect. There are also several love connections that also add to the drama. Ray Liotta is outrageously good! But then he is a great actor. I would watch this show just to see him. Jennifer Lopez, I feel is doing an excellent job, although her character can frustrate one..... The FBI agent that has Jennifer tied up is also doing a great job and in addition he is easy on the eye!! The way the entire police group interacts gives you a feeling of wanting them to cheat and steal, although it's wrong but they seem to really feel and have a solidarity that makes you want them to get away with whatever they are doing as long as they get the bad guys.",20 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,22 February 2016
1708,Shades of Blue," A Good Start For ""Shades of Blue""","Jennifer Lopez plays Harlee Santos, a police woman who cares about justice, her teenage daughter, and the officers on her team. She describes them as a ""family"". It's a close family, bound by trust. They have each others' backs when an operation goes bad. And they rely upon each other to keep the secrets they share.<br/><br/>The team, which is lead by Matt Wozniak (Ray Liotta), operates on the premise that the ""ends justify the means."" Of course the law doesn't operate that way. It depends upon legal procedures, i.e. procedures which are legal.<br/><br/>The result is a complex character. Harlee is a devoted mother and she really cares about reducing crime. As citizens, viewers must decide how they feel about a woman who is paid to enforce laws yet routinely violates them. Especially in a time when the term ""hero"" is so easily attached to first responders, this is a challenging premise.<br/><br/>The good news is that Jennifer Lopez is up to it. Within the first hour, she is asked to be motherly, athletic, sexy, confident, and emotionally torn. She handles the role easily and provides a central core for the series.<br/><br/>As she begins to realize the destructive consequences of a web of lies, she will have to sacrifice her inner peace and maybe everything she values. It is the writing that will make this show or break it. These characters deserve emotional honesty and depth. It's worth watching to see what follows.<br/><br/>I do have one complaint about the pilot. At one point, Harlee fires a shot through a door with no regard for what's on the other side. That feels contrary to her nature.<br/><br/>Update 1/20/15: After two episodes, I am raising my grade to ""8"". As I have always known, Jennifer Lopez is the most under-rated actress on TV or film. Episode 2 included plenty of drama. If the writing can continue with this level of quality, higher grades will follow.<br/><br/>Update 4/2/16: After watching the final episode of the season, all I can say is wow! I am upping my grade to ""10"".",42 out of 80 found this helpful.,10.0,7 January 2016
1709,Shades of Blue," nothing new, save the J.Lo stamp","One of the people reviewing on the board thought this was an original idea. She never saw The Shield, I guess.<br/><br/>Like Shades of Blue, The Shield was about a group of crooked cops, led by Michael Chiklis. Here, it's Ray Liotta as Matt Wozniak, working with a group made up of Harlee (J. Lo), Tess (Drea DeMatteo), Michael (Dayo Okenyi), Marcus (Hampton Fluker) and others.<br/><br/>Harlee is a single mother with a daughter (Cristina Santos). She is having some financial problems. She is approached by the FBI in the person of Robert Stahl (Warren Kole). She can cooperate and help them get Wozniak or she can go to prison given what they have on her. She reluctantly cooperates, but Wozniak is so paranoid and nervous, she has to be extra-careful. Plus she is torn because of her loyalty to Wozniak.<br/><br/>This isn't a bad show. I think people are hard on Jennifer Lopez and here's why: She's a high-profile celebrity who has a lot written about her personal life, she shows up to awards shows in some flimsy fashions, and she's a singer and dancer. When people look at her, they see Jennifer Lopez, diva.<br/><br/>None of that means that she can't act. I thought she was wonderful as Selena, and she's good in this.<br/><br/>The problem with the show is that because it's Jennifer Lopez, we constantly see her taking off her clothes, working out at the gym, having sex, showing cleavage and then being a tough-as-nails cop, all the while with perfect hair and make-up. And did I mention she's 46 years old. Also, all the guys want her. It's too much, and as a result, the show is criticized.<br/><br/>Lopez needs to lose herself in this role a little more and be a female cop and less dishy - a little less makeup, some unstyled hair, a few less love scenes and a few less times she strips down should do it. She would still be beautiful but a little more human. Then I think people might be more receptive.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is very good -- Ray Liotta is terrific - he looks and is terrifying; Drea DeMatteo from ""The Sopranos"" is very believable as a policewoman with personal problems; Warren Kole seems young for his job but he's okay. A good cast has been assembled.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with being a derivative show - most shows are.

The plot seems like the end is going to come any minute, and I just don't want to hang to find out which way it' going to go. There is also something wrong with the character development. A few of them seem out of sorts, like they are not sure how they are supposed to play it. Keep the cast, change the plot and the writers, just lower the intensity of Lopez's makeup.

1716,Shades of Blue, BEST CRIME/DRAMA TV Show I Have Ever Seen (READ THIS REVIEW To Find Out WHY),"I couldn't help but read many other reviews of this show, but I WAS surprised to find many people saying they didn't like it or it wasn't worth the time. THEY ARE SOOOOOOOOO WRONG!!! This show is one of the best put together crime dramas probably of my lifetime. The First Thing I like about this show is how it is everything that a true crime/drama should have, There are many moments while your eyes are glued to the TV and you think you know what is going to happen, but then something completely unexpected happens, The Second Reason I Liked it is the first time I watched the first episode I wasn't sure what to even think about it, but I watched it about 3 times and then I started to understand. Even After that I watched the following episodes 2-4 times each and I started to discover things that I hadn't seen the first time around. This is the 2nd thing I liked about the show, its how they put little things that maybe you have to watch twice to fully understand, just like if you were solving a crime in real life, you would have to check twice to see if everything adds up, so it almost puts you in the spot of them when you notice things you didn't at first. The third thing that instantly made me love this is when the episode ends and you literally want to scream because you have to wait until the following week to see what happens next, you probably just read that and thought wait, did I read that correctly?

Lastly I'm going to summarize the 3 MAIN REASONS this show is worth giving a chance to (1) You will think you know exactly what's gonna happen next, but most of the time something totally different happens. (2)They put little details in it where if you watch only once you may not understand, and if you watch it 2-4 times you'll find something you didn't see the first few, you have to double check everything like you'd do if you truly were solving a crime (3)by making you wait for the best part until the following week keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat to wait and see what happens.",20 out of 41 found this helpful.,10.0,20 February 2016

We already have enough of it in Chicago PD and others, but it is at least balanced out among the characters and overall storyline. Not so with Shades of Blue! Aside from the anything-but-original story structure of this pilot episode, both Ray Liotta and Jennfer Lopez are terrific actors and deserve better. I like good crime dramas -- but this JUNK is the kind of thing to fuel an already lit fire! Our men, women &amp; K9's ""in BLUE"" are already targets.

1721,Shades of Blue, Oh dear!,"Before typing this, I took a look at the reviews, to see if my comments are justifiable, it's quite clear from them that it is in deed!<br/><br/>Firstly, I am 7 episodes into this show, if you are at episode 1 or maybe even 2, then you won't agree with the review and will think it's a welcome change and different take on the usual cop drama...That's OK, stick with it, then type a review after a few more!<br/><br/>I couldn't care less for Jennifer Lopez, I don't consider her a good actor, in fact in my opinion she should stick to singing. It is quite clear from the outset she has been added to the show as the female draw for male viewers, she does little else to dissuade you from that given she is at it from early on, and I cannot recall anything I have watched and enjoyed that she has been in! Ray Liotta however is one of the best actors to grace our screens, however as per other ageing actors, in recent years they seem to compromise quality for quantity, it is the kind of throw enough mud and something will stick mentality, the desperate knowledge that your career is coming to an end and you either want to prolong it, or want a big pay day, that seems to have trapped Mr Liotta into this show. The script just doesn't work, it isn't that it is poor, it's absolutely terrible. That said Mr Liotta does act well, but like in any situation, if you do your job and everyone around you doesn't, then it isn't going to be pretty!<br/><br/>I would draw out all the reasons this show sucks by examples, but that is easily covered by all the other reviews pointing out the issues, the simple issues for me are Jennifer Lopez is truly an awful actor, the script is poorly written and quite frankly absurd, there is no grit to it, it has tried to balance good with bad to lead a viewer to a logical conclusion these rogue cops are good people, it doesn't work!",16 out of 35 found this helpful.,2.0,19 February 2016
1722,Shades of Blue, One Of The Best Series of 2016,"I've decided to write this review after the Emmy Awards Of 2016 and my question was ( what they were thinking when they gave nomination and Awards!) I think that the world is coming to an end when such great series such as (Shades of Blue) and (BlindSpot) don't get at least a single nomination in Famous ceremony such as the Emmy. This is by far one of the most strong crime series of the year the plot,the suspense the story line all were great. And as for Jennifer Lopez and Ray Liotta they were both excellent. Lopez really brought to the screen another great role which is equal to her marvelous performance in Selena . And Liotta performance was really superb he brought to the character everything that no one else could do,and although he had done a lot of evil characters this was his best and not like anyone of them. As for the rest of the cast each one from the biggest role to the small part gave us their best for example : Warren Kole indeed gave us a mean character as it should be presented, Dayo Okeniyi also gave us how the good cop should be like and what he feels when he is surrounded by people who are totally different from him. What is so special and interesting about this show is what it delivers (which is a powerful message) that in this life there is no such a thing called a bad guy or a good guy , there is on each one of us a mix of these two elements.",8 out of 15 found this helpful.,8.0,25 November 2016
1723,Inuyasha, Pretty Darn Cool,"With Pokemon, Beyblade and Yu-Gi-Oh gracing the small screen, it has become difficult to take Japanese Anime seriously. Thankfully, Cartoon Network has put a block of Japan's finest in their red-eye time slot, spearheaded by Inuyasha.<br/><br/>The general gist of the plot is Kagome, a modern schoolgirl, winds up in feudal times and must help a half-demon(Inyasha) recover the shards of a jewel of ultimate power. <br/><br/>One might say that Inuyasha combines the best of both Shonen and Shojo stylings. The world of feudal Japan is laced with ghosts, demons and other critters who roar, slash, dash, slice, splat and snarl, and at least one of these beasts duke it out with the title character per episode. On the other hand, there is romance, guilt, past betrayals and secrets to be discovered, not to mention sight gags and running jokes. <br/><br/>The visual quality is a step above pocket monsters and moon princesses as well. The show is thankfully devoid of giant sweat-drops, fountain tears and misplaced mouths. <br/><br/>It takes patience to watch the series, with 100+ episodes and long-running character development, it would take a fortune of DVD purchases or steadfast loyalty to the television at 1:00 am (as of this writing)to get the entire story down.<br/><br/>But even so, I highly recommend this show to anybody yearning for more than just flaming mesomorphs and pocket monsters.",54 out of 62 found this helpful.,,24 December 2004
1724,Inuyasha," Strongly recommended to those who enjoy a rich, entertaining fantasy tale.","It's a shame that viewers outside of Asia tend to shun anime as ""kid's stuff"". Though the Inuyasha anime series seems to be directed at a predominantly teen aged audience even in Japan, Rumiko Takahashi is a master storyteller and Inuyasha nonetheless appeals to people of all different ages, genders and backgrounds. Nobody spins a tale like Takahashi and Inuyasha is a brilliant example of her skill. Weaving a complex storyline interspersed with action, fantasy, the innocence of young love, and a cast of endearing though fallible characters, Inuyasha is a rich fantasy tale drawn from Japanese mythology and set in feudal Japan. Names and references to actual Japanese historical and mythological characters interwoven into the story gives this series added texture and richness not readily found in most graphic novels. Takahashi lightens the serious tone at times with uniquely Takahashi humor (often imitated, never duplicated) and creates credible, flawed characters whose shortcomings become endearing over time. If the animation is too childish for you, try reading the original graphic novel series, which is even more outstanding since the anime doesn't do Takahashi's comic timing any justice. Strongly recommended to those who enjoy a rich, entertaining fantasy tale.",43 out of 50 found this helpful.,,16 April 2005
1725,Inuyasha, Awesome show!,"If you liked Ranma 1/2, it is safe to say that you'd most likely enjoy InuYasha. Based off of the manga of the same title by Takahashi Rumiko, this is the tale of the half-demon Inuyasha and his companions Kagome, Miroku (aka: Houshi-sama), Sango, Shippou, and sometimes Myouga the youkai flea (more in the earlier season than later ones) as they search for the shards of the Shikon no Tama (Jewel of Four Souls), then hunt for the demon Naraku.<br/><br/>The series is a juvenile one, but not offensively so. I really enjoy the epic nature of the series. There are the standard ""filler"" episodes, but there are long stretches where the story just presses on. The writers often don't feel pressed to end the story withing the 30-minute format and so a certain tale can go on for a few episodes. Filler episodes are used to allow the viewers (and the writers) to catch their breath before plunging in again. But in recent episodes (starting at the late 90's into the 110's), the stories have dragged much longer than they should, just to extend things (IMO). However, things have improved with the current season in Japan. The fun filler episodes are back, but then the action episodes are more like the early season's in nature rather than last season. So my enjoyment has gone back up this year (2004). <br/><br/>Characters are another nice touch to this series. Characters are allowed to grow to a certain degree though relationships don't grow beyond a certain point. I would have liked to have seen Sango and Miroku do more at being a couple rather than just eyeing each other. That may have been fixed in episode 132. Also, I would like the writers to advance the Kagome/Inuyasha romance and we may see that this season. The other problem is that after a while, Inuyasha becomes the only character to do anything. Everyone else just stands around looking stupid rather than jump in and try to help. I hear that it will get better (based on the manga apparently) so I keep my fingers crossed.<br/><br/>The English dub is pretty well done, though the show felt a tad more juvenile in English than it did in Japanese. The DVD subtitles aren't to great, so if you are used to the excellent job done by the fansubbers (Anime-Kraze), you'll be in for some disappointments. <br/><br/>Bottom line: Nicely drawn and interesting characters &amp; good (and sometimes humorous) writing make this otherwise juvenile series very enjoyable to watch.",20 out of 23 found this helpful.,,13 November 2004
1726,Inuyasha, One of the greatest anime I've ever seen,"""Inuyasha"" is one of the greatest anime that I have ever had the fortune to see. Despite not seeing the very first episodes, reading the manga brought me up to speed since the anime mirrors it very closely. I know there are a few detractors out there, but thankfully they went to the trouble of actually watching it before they started bashing. Hopefully, they'll either warm up to ""Inuyasha"" or find an anime capable of satisfying their exacting standards.<br/><br/>The characters are what make ""Inuyasha"" so awesome. Without the characters, the show wouldn't be the success that it is. We start with Kagome Higurashi, a typical Japanese teenage girl --- until she stumbles into an ancient well that transports her back into Japan's Warring States Era. There, she meets a canine-based half-demon named Inuyasha and after shattering the Shikon Jewel, or the Jewel of Four Souls, they have to work together to find the fragments before demons can use those fragments to enhance their own abilities and use them for evil. They largely fail in the whole ""stopping demons from using the Shikon Jewel shards"" deal, because by the time they find a jewel shard, a demon already has custody of it and is using it for evil. So they have little choice but to fight the aforementioned demon and take the shard from him or her once they achieve victory. The funny thing is that Inuyasha initially hates Kagome, as she is the reincarnation of Kikyo, a priestess he loved (until she pinned him to a tree with a sacred arrow). However, he grows fond of Kagome and obviously comes to love her, but he won't admit it to anyone. Things don't get any easier when a portion of Kagome's soul is stolen and used to animate a facsimile of Kikyo's body made from clay, resulting in a rather disturbing love triangle.<br/><br/>Then there are the supporting characters, which I'll name in order of appearance. There's Shippo, a kitsune (fox spirit/demon) whose father was killed by a duo of demons called the Thunder Brothers. Next, there's Miroku, a monk who's overly fond of women and has a ""wind tunnel"" in his hand, a void that can consume demons but will eventually consume him. Then there's Sango, a tough-as-nails demon slayer whose family and tribe were slaughtered by Naraku's demons. To add cruel insult to already-grievous injury, Naraku has reanimated Sango's brother's body with a shard of the Shikon Jewel and placed him under his control.<br/><br/>Now I have to explain the villains of ""Inuyasha."" The two main villains of ""Inuyasha"" are Sesshomaru and Naraku. Sesshomaru is Inuyasha's half brother and a full demon, as Sesshomaru's mother was a demon woman and Inuyasha's mother was human. Their father gave each brother a sword; Inuyasha received Tetsusaiga, a sword that can slay a hundred demons in one swing, while Sesshomaru received Tenseiga, a sword that can save a hundred lives in one swing. However, it is only in later episodes that Inuyasha learns how to use Tetsusaiga's powers. Sesshomaru hates Tenseiga, as it is a sword of life and thus he cannot kill anyone with it. He especially doesn't want to save human lives, as he has no respect for humanity at all. Ironically, he uses Tenseiga to restore the life of a little girl named Rin when she's killed by wolves. For being a villain, Sesshomaru is very complex; he's not pure evil so much as semi-evil.<br/><br/>Naraku, on the other hand, is undeniably and unforgivably evil. He is the fusion of hundreds of demons and the soul of a human bandit named Onigumo who lusted after Kikyo. He apparently desires the Shikon Jewel, but he may have other reasons beyond the obvious. Naraku's primary skill lies in twisted schemes designed to make Inuyasha and his allies suffer. He started by turning Inuyasha and Kikyo against each other, continued by cursing Miroku's grandfather with the wind tunnel (a curse that would ultimately be passed on to Miroku), and recently orchestrated the slaughter of Sango's tribe. As another person who commented on this anime said, Naraku is the consummate ""supervillain.""<br/><br/>Besides the obvious action, there are also elements of romance-comedy to be found in ""Inuyasha."" For example, the Inuyasha/Kagome/Koga triangle. Koga is a wolf demon that falls in love with Kagome and declares her ""his woman."" Inuyasha gets extremely jealous, especially when Kagome is nice to Koga, and yet he cannot figure out why he's so jealous. Then there's the interaction between Miroku and Sango. Miroku constantly gropes Sango and she constantly slaps him for it, but if you read into their actions, it's fairly obvious that they care deeply for each other. If only Miroku would stop groping her so much . . .<br/><br/>These are the reasons why ""Inuyasha"" is awesome and if you haven't figured that out by now, then read the manga or rent one of the DVDs. You won't regret it, and if you do, it's your own fault.",53 out of 68 found this helpful.,,13 October 2004
1727,Inuyasha, One of my favorite Animes,"I love Inu Yasha, it has to be one of my favorite animes, it's one of the shows that got me into anime in the first place.  And I adore Rumiko Takahashi, heh.  But Inu Yasha is an anime with just the right mix in it. Both girls and guys can like it, it isn't leaned towards one gender, it's has just the right mix of action, comedy, and romance.  It's just great!<br/><br/> Anyway, here's a summary.  A girl named Kagome is pulled down her family's well and she ends up in feudal times Japan in the same location that she lives in modern-day Tokyo, except of course it's feudal times.  In feudal times she meets a half dog demon, Inu Yasha.  She finds this magic jewel, but ends up shattering it into hundreds of tiny jewel shards.  So that's one of the main points of the show, the quest for the sacred jewel shards which are extremely powerful.  Some of the other characters include: Miroku, a kind but somewhat perverted young monk(my favorite character, that's why I put him first ^_^);  Sango, a butt-kicking girl whose village was destroyed by the evil demon Naraku; Shippou, a cute little fox demon with the ability to shape-shift; Kikyo, a whacked out priestess (seriously, she has major problems) of whom they think Kagome is the reincarnation of; Sesshomaru, Inu Yasha's evil demon brother who happens to be quite good looking; Naraku who is an evil demon person who's out to get the sacred jewel shards; and there are tons of other people too, who either aren't as important, or just show up a few times.

1728,Inuyasha, Shining anime,"Kagome, a modern girl from Tokyo, accidentally finds a portal which leads her to the medieval Japan where she meets the half-demon Inuyasha. She decides to help him find a magic crystal and fight the evil demon Naraku...<br/><br/>""Inuyasha"" is an anime I was 95 % sure it wouldn't work, but it did. With it's virtuous mix of romance, comedy, action, adventure, fantasy and horror (causing some of it's episodes to be censored in some countries) this is simply a great show that sucked me in. Although it's too long (the only major flaw, since the 160 episodes watered down the story) and has some weak episodes, ""Inuyasha"" is nothing short of brilliant, and it seems it's characters will never become boring: from Miroku, who is always touching woman's butts and asking them if they will have a baby with him up to Kagome who is trying to maintain her good grades in school while fighting in medieval Japan. This is what ""Dragonball"" should have been, but wasn't. Also, some sequences stand out: <br/><br/>1) Sesshomaru, the bad guy, was exhausted in the woods. Rin, a little orphan girl, saw him and wanted to help him. She went to her village to get him some food but the cruel villager's beat her up. She still managed to get Sesshmoaru some food but he declined. Yet he asked her where she got those bruises and she was happy he noticed her effort. Later on Rin was killed in the forest and Sesshomaru accidentally found her dead body. After a little thinking he took his magic sword and, despite being evil, brought her back to life. From there on, they had a mutual bond.<br/><br/>2) In the episode with those demon bats who terrorized a village a young mother gave birth to a half-demon bat girl, Shiori. Shiori was molested by ""normal"", human kids, who kicked her. Before she entered her house she wiped away her tears and pretended to be happy so that her mother wouldn't notice she couldn't fit in.<br/><br/>3) When Kagome finds out Inuyasha is alive she runs towards him, passing by Kouga, all the while her tears are falling on his sad face.<br/><br/>These situations stand out because they look as if taken from real life. I know I will never forget at least those three precious moments mentioned above. After these very emotional and powerful scenes one might ask yourself if the ""Inuyasha"" authors are not making this for commercial sake but for real, for a deeper statement and inter sociological and racial messages.<br/><br/>Grade: 9/10",27 out of 33 found this helpful.,9.0,7 October 2005

This is one of the rare stories where evil really corrupts and is cunning and elusive rather than just big strong dumb creatures.<br/><br/>Even if it has some characteristics of soap opera, it goes well beyond that, as the animation and the plot go very well together.

1736,Inuyasha, Rumiko Takahashi at her best,"Once more, the manga artist Rumiko Takahashi has stolen my breath away with her works.<br/><br/>I can honestly say I haven't been this taken with another anime since I fell in love with Ranma 1/2, yet another of her famous works.<br/><br/>I think what gives Inuyasha its charm is the fact that it isn't just good versus evil or another Ranma 1/2. Yes, it has elements of both, but it's the depth and concentration of the personalities of each and every character (even the ones that are only there for one episode) that makes it truly unique. And at the same time, with all this detail and concentration, the show still manages to move at a rather fast pace. Something interesting is always happening!<br/><br/>The most appealing aspect of this show, however, is the fact that it has the action necessary for male fans and the romance for the female fans. I'm sure there's even a few guys out there who will appreciate the strained and somewhat awkward relationship between Inuyasha and Kagome. Throw in a dash of comedy, the kind that makes you burst out laughing unexpectedly, and this becomes an A+ anime.<br/><br/>Definitely a must-see.

1737,Inuyasha, Clever and original series that unfortunately has little to offer,"Let me state this right from the start. I do NOT hate this show. I actually quite like some aspects of it. In fact, when i first started to watch it, I quickly became hooked. I was just starting to come out of the whole ""anime is for kids"" stereotype, and the mature elements of the show had me intrigued.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after seeing the whole series through and a few of the films, I can say that my overall disposition has changed, and it falls into almost all of the pitfalls that plague ""bad"" anime. Seven or eight friends and myself started watching this series on TV. By the end, only one friend and I were still watching and neither of us liked it.<br/><br/>Allow me to explain the plot for you. You can skip this paragraph if you don't want to know. Kagome is an average high school student, who one day falls into a magical well near her family run shrine. When kagome comes out of the well again, she has been transported back in time to the feudal era of japan. She meets up with many other characters and they form a group of five or so companions who set off on a journey of revenge/justice/groping in one characters case =). Overall, they are trying to recover the pieces of the sacred jewel shard which enhances the power of demons who use it.<br/><br/>While there are many, MANY side stories and story arcs, there is no were near enough material to occupy 167 episodes. The only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull (the band of seven). After the half way mark in the series or maybe even before, it becomes painfully obvious that the plot is frozen in place and whoever made the series decided instead to put in dozens and dozens of filler episodes. <br/><br/>These episodes have little to no impact on the story, and rarely even on the characters. In some cases, some characters who had an important role in the story will disappear for dozens of episodes at a time. Many episodes follow the exact same cookie cutter patterns as the stories before it. Inuyasha shoots wind-scar at enemy. Windscar deflects. Characters gasp in horror. Enemy turns out to have barrier. Characters spent three episodes trying to kill enemy before Kagome finally fires sacred arrow at him and he turns to dust. <br/><br/>Also **MAJOR SPOILER: THE CONCLUSION WILL BE REVEALED** the lack of any conclusion makes it seem like you have waisted 83 hours. <br/><br/>**MAJOR SPOILER OVER**<br/><br/>The animation itself is above average, and in some cases excellent. Even so, reused animation cells plague most action scenes, and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row.<br/><br/>On the brighter side however, all of the characters are very well developed and the romances between some of the characters were truly captivating. Also, the character designs (appearences) were brilliant and at times among the best I have seen, particularly with the band of seven. There is definitely no shortage of Cosplay opportunities here. Even so, I found myself hoping that a character would die just so there would be some sort of movement in the plot. And some of the humour in the show between characters is used again and again. One particular joke (sit boy) is found within the first five episodes, and you can literally expect it to be used again and again for the remaining 162 episodes.<br/><br/>Although there are some good aspects of the show and it is easy to see why it has a huge following, the series seems to be dominated by obsessed fan girls who drool over Sesshomiru and InuYasha.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Definitely worth checking out, but not worth watching the whole series. The first 30 episodes are very clever, original and enjoyable for anybody. But after that, it simply becomes dull and tedious. Watching a TV show should never feel like a chore, but somehow this series accomplishes just that. Don't expect much from ""InuYasha"", because you will only feel let down.",11 out of 23 found this helpful.,3.0,31 December 2006
1738,Inuyasha," We don't need to ""change the world..."" this show's perfect!","INU-YASHA'S ONE OF THE BEST ANIMES EVER!  Sorry, for that outburst, but it's true.  With the possibly the best leading cast of any anime ever(except for Yu Yu Hakusho), and an excellent mixture of genres, you have yet another sure-fire hit spawned from the brilliant mind of Rumiko Takahashi's work.<br/><br/>Inu-Yasha is the main character, who is voiced to perfection by Kappei Yamaguchi.  His Inu-Yasha sounds really believeable.  It's perfect.  I also like his English voice, which is by Richard Cox(who also does the English-dubbed voice of another Yamaguchi-voiced character, Ranma Saotome). He does a really good job of expressing the same emotion and force Yamaguchi-san did, which is probably why he was selected to do Inu-Yasha's dub voice.  We have Kagome, Shippo, Miroku, and Sango.  Then there's Sesshomaru, Inu-Yasha's brother.  He's another one of my favorites, because he's really complex even though he's a villain.  Then, we have main villain Naraku, who is just impossible to not hate.  Believe me, some of the things he does will make you wish you could climb into the TV and clobber him.<br/><br/>The music is also great, and always reflects the mood the show is currently in.  It's definitely worth getting the CD soundtrack.  In fact, maybe you should do it right now if you know a place where you can find it.  Believe me, my review will still be here.  Oh, and the animation, it's topnotch. THIS CAME OUT THREE YEARS AGO!?  The people who made this could have fooled me.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE:  This is one of the best anime to come out ever.  With the DVDs out, and the series on Cartoon Network, you have no excuse to not see this beautiful masterpiece of a show.  Gotta go now, for I fear I could be getting a crush on Sango or Kagome...",7 out of 13 found this helpful.,,4 July 2003
1739,Inuyasha, Bland and drawn out.,"I used to be really into this series. But when it got to around fifty episodes, the characters, plot lines, music, and fight scenes all start to get a little repetitive. I can't imagine what watching all the way through to episode 167 (and what is it, four movies?) would be like.<br/><br/>My big beef with this series is that it's so drawn out. The plot line (that a modern day Japanese school girl-how original-has to help a feudal era Japan half demon collect shards of an ancient jewel) is all right, but it gets rather dry with all the filler episodes. The random episodes I watch on Cartoon Network on Saturday nights after Samurai Champloo are almost always filler where nothing relevant to the main plot line happens.<br/><br/>The characters all seem extremely one-dimensional, stereotypical, unoriginal, and predictable. All Inuyasha does is talk big and carry a sword. All Kagome does is pathetically run around in a short skirt and cry out for Inuyasha to save her. Sango, the female demon hunter and Miroku, the pervy monk are slightly less annoying supporting characters, but still remain predictable.<br/><br/>The music is repetitive and mediocre. Besically what you'd expect from video game music. Nothing comparable to music by anime music greats like Yoko Kanno.<br/><br/>And even the episode titles began to bug me after a while. One I saw the other night was entitled, ""Miroku Falls Into A Dangerous Trap."" Gee, that doesn't reveal any major plot details at all. I mean, what's the point in watching the episode?<br/><br/>I base most of my judgments by my favorite anime series Cowboy Bebop. It has multi-layered characters, episodes with their own musical themes, fantastic and visual action scenes, memorable secondary characters, and virtually no filler episodes, depending on how you look at it.<br/><br/>Then again, Inuyasha's target audience tends to be the tweens to mid teens group, so you can't really expect big intellectual, deep observations to be made.<br/><br/>To sum it all up. I think of Inuyasha as simply bland fluff. Good for something to watch while you're waiting for something better to come on. Nothing epic and certainly not the ""greatest anime ever."" It's small-time entertainment. Which is why it ticks me off to see so many people singing such great praises to this show as if it were the second coming. Especially when there are much better series out there that have much better emotional and intellectual depth, action, and yes, romance, but might not have as ""attractive"" characters.",9 out of 18 found this helpful.,,20 August 2005
1740,Inuyasha, And Now For A Different Opinion,"As is common with much of American main stream entertainment there are celebrities who are worshipped solely on the basis of there aesthetics dispite their lack of talent.  I see Inuyasha as fitting into that group.<br/><br/>Now I know if you're already one of the thousands of InuYasha fans out there you're just going to completely ignore this review so go ahead.  I'm trying to appeal to people who really look for quality rather than ""cute"" characters.  One of the first problems I noticed is that it is just a pidge podge of tired story elements.  We have an outsider pulled into a strange and different world, we have a quest for scattered jewels, and of course the requisite tacked-on love story.  Snore.  I know Takahashi can and has (several times) done better than this.<br/><br/>Characters in the show unfortunately fall into the same line.  It's a virtual parade of cliches.  Kagome, who is the firey schoo girl of course, seems like nothing more than a generic filler for the girl that the main character has to hate/love.  She's more like a cursor that guides us from plont point to plot point than a real person that we can care about.  Nice legs though (and isn't that what matters?).  InuYasha is a ""demon"" whose trying to be good.  This could have left lot's of room for character development as he tried to cope with the feelings that accompanied having to help those that, by nature, he should want to destroy.  But no... he's just a tough guy.  A very PRETTY tough guy.  The other heroes are pretty simple. Miroku is a perverted but kind priest.  Sango is the strong female who is there so Miroko can constantly try to grope her.  Shippo is fox.  A bratty little fox.  Yeah.<br/><br/>The villains are absolutely laughable.  Naraku, admittadly a pretty bad guy. Or at least he would be if the only other villain you knew before were the pollution guys from captain planet.  But he has a cool costume so I'll let him off the hook.  My real problem is with InuYasha's brother Sesshômaru. He's basically there just to bark and never bite.  Teasing Inuyasha all the way but never doing anything really bad.  I just want to know right now why ever villain in this type of anime must look like a woman.  It's always been my opinion that a demon should be doing terrible things like eating babies rather than putting on make up.<br/><br/>So the bottom line is this:  InuYasha fails on both levels - as a serious drama and as a light hearted comedy.  It's uneven, unentemotional, and unoriginal.  This is what makes all these stereotypes about anime.  If you want real quality check out Takahashi's older works like Ranma or Mermaid's Scar.  And if you want some more modern entertainment look for Noir or Excel Saga.  However if your one of those folks who use cute little emoticons in every sentence or still use -San to refer to Japanese names, then this show will be right up your alley.",10 out of 21 found this helpful.,,21 February 2004
1741,Inuyasha, Some wonderful moments...and some awful quarter seasons,"Rossini once described rival composer Wagner's work as having ""some wonderful moments...and some awful quarter-hours"". Inuyasha, it seems, can also be described this way. It has many great episodes, but in between them are countless filler episodes. The entire series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I'd say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot (I didn't bother to count and I wouldn't be surprised if that number were in fact higher, though).<br/><br/>Some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable, though many are quite silly or dull. Nonetheless, the constant digressions start to wear thin after the first few seasons as the plot ends up progressing at a labored crawl for most of the series. Character development, too, slows down greatly and by the later seasons, the cast has become quite unchanging, resulting in increasingly stale jokes (particularly those concerning the monk, who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly).<br/><br/>However, all of that isn't to say that Inuyasha is a bad series. It just isn't a great series the way Neon Genesis Evangelion, for example, is generally considered to be. As something to watch at the end of a hard day, it is nice, but it could never be confused with high art.",9 out of 19 found this helpful.,3.0,18 April 2006
1742,Inuyasha, It had a good start... but lost its originality early on.,"Oh man! This series has to be the worst possible anime I've ever seen in a while.<br/><br/>It started out new, exciting and fresh. And I really liked it then. Kagome was a good female role model for the show. And Inu-Yasha was funny and hot-headed.<br/><br/>Then, it just kept falling more and more downhill as the series progressed... and I'll tell y'all the reasons why. (Warning: SPOILER ALERT!!)<br/><br/>Okay, they basically destroy Inu-Yasha's relationship with Kagome early on, by reviving his 50 year old dead girlfriend, who's drippy, sappy, and a total waste of time.<br/><br/>They introduce a pervert named Miroku, who's supposed to be a sort of religious figure for the show. (Which really bugged me,'cause it was out of place and stupid.) Then, they introduce a demon slayer named Sango, whose only purpose in life is to try (and fail) to save her brainwashed brother.<br/><br/>The big bad of the show, Naraku, while starting out as a really good bad guy, lost his touch after a while. (He got pretty old pretty fast. And it bothered me that he was the only baddie in the show who did anything.)<br/><br/>The characters all became wooden, and unemotional. And then, the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there. Nothing happened. Naraku never got killed or defeated. Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fully fell in love ('cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick.) Plot holes were left open. The animation got worse and worse as the series progressed. And nothing changed in the plot. (I mean,they dragged it out to over 150 episodes, and nothing changed in the plot... at all.) And they expected me (as well as other fans of the show) to be satisfied?? I was disenchanted, disgusted, and annoyed as crap. I at least had high hopes that there'd be a good ending to the series. Instead, all I got was a dragged out commercial for the manga.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you wanna see a good anime about swords and stuff like that, I strongly recommend ""Rurouni Kenshin"". That show progresses and goes somewhere, plus it has really good animation too.<br/><br/>But stay far away from this bland excuse for anime, as best as you can.",14 out of 33 found this helpful.,1.0,4 February 2007
1743,Inuyasha, This is the best show ever!!!!!!!,"This show i must admit is very good. The best cartoon i have ever seen. This show introduced me to anime. So, i watched a lot of other animes. But, i have to admit, this was the best!!! And, this is coming from a 15 year old who thought would /never/ like cartoon related shows. xD I loved to relate to the characters. The drawings were so cool. The song at the end of every show, is also good. One thing i like about it, is that it really doesn't have a theme song/clip at the beginning. It just said what the shows title was and you didn't have to sit for 2 minutes watching some clip for 1-2 minutes every single show! I also like how it had everything you want in a TV show! Like love, romance, suspense, fighting, crying, etc... And the detail is amazing!!!! And that its suited for guys and girls too. I was hooked on this show the first 10 minutes i ever saw it! If you are looking for a new TV show to become your favorite, you should try this one! Especially if your one of those people who simple love anime!!! But if your one of those people who are 12 years and under, make sure your parents say OK before watching this. This show does have some cursing, lots of violence that shows blood, and /some/ nudity. I barley see nudity on it, but it will occur sometimes.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,4 September 2005
1744,Inuyasha, Truly the Affection Across Time,"My friend introduced to me this anime about a year ago but I neglected it, now I feel like i have lost a year's time while not knowing this series.<br/><br/>lol, that maybe toward the extremes, but this is like the Lord of the Rings of the anime world. I would rated InuYasha as an equal to Saint Seiya for the depth, and Dragon Ball(the original and Z series) on the entertaining and funny side.<br/><br/>So the story starts with the female-protagonist Kagome Higurashi finding a worm-hole that links the present with feudal Japan from 500 years ago. There she meets and rescues the half human half demon boy named InuYasha.<br/><br/>With that and a few other details their advantures begin in recovering the Shikon Jewel which was shattered into many pieces. Together they meet many characters who either joins them on their quest or oppose them for personal reasons. As a side plot, the feelings each character have for one another grows and almost every one find their respective person of interest for support, comfort and affection.<br/><br/>Great story in any judgment, and excellent animation qualities, not to mention how extremely hilarious it is.<br/><br/>At least a 10 out of 10, highly recommended, especially if you are stuck at home during winter times, this show will cheer you up AND probably strengthen your understanding of relationships.<br/><br/>O ya, even tho this is an anime, the musics created for the TV series and the movies are simply breath-taking, one more reason to enjoy such a fine creation. Definitely a classic to be remembered.<br/><br/>Mike.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,13 December 2004
1745,Inuyasha, Entertaining series,"Rumiko Takahashi is known for her long running manga series, Ranma ½, Maison Ikkoku (my personal favorite), and Urusei Yatsura. These series have started the genre for almost any comedy romantic anime that is released today. But Talahashi's also has more of a darker side, as can be seen in the horror manga Mermaids series (ie Mermaids Scar is an example). Inuyasha is a surprising mix of both of these qualities. Anime translations of her series are some of the most popular series of all time, although they have some problems. This series also follows this formula. I have seen 51 episodes of the series, subtitled by fans into English.<br/><br/>Good Inuyasha's premise is very familiar and could have easily degraded into a horrible magical girl/monster of the week series. Kagome is a normal Japanese high school student who's family lives at an ancient shrine. She falls into a sacred well and ends up falling into the feudalistic past of Japan. She runs into the half-Youkai (Japanese demon/spirits)  Inuyasha impaled onto a tree by a sacred arrow and finds out she is the reincarnation of the village priestess Kikyo who sealed him up after he stole the Shikon no Tama, a magical pearl that gives Youkai tremendous powers. She was killed because of injuries that she sustained sealing Inuyasha, and the artifact was laid on her funeral pier. Kagome then finds when a giant centipede attacks that the Shikon no Toma was also brought along with her soul inside of her body. After some interesting events the Pearl is shattered into hundreds of pieces that are spread throughout Japan. It is now up to Kagome and Inuyasha to collect the pieces that are still capable of great evil (this all happens is the first 3 episodes). As they start on their journey there seems to be a very dark, powerful Youkai also collecting the shards. This could have easily been a cheap magical girl/monster of the week series but it has some notable differences.  For the first 10 or so episodes it is a generic find monster with shikon shard but the series then starts to become more complex with back story and some great villains. There is CGI that is actually integrated quite nicely, used sparingly and usually for supernatural creatures or attacks<br/><br/>The characters are one of the things that make the series great, these are some of the more important reoccurring characters.<br/><br/>Kagome: Strong willed although she is more typical then the average Takahashi female (like Akane) but is a great character that grows throughout the series and is a strong emotional center for the story. She can sense when a shard is nearby and fire charged up arrows.<br/><br/>Inuyasha: A half Youkai that has yellow eyes and dog-ears. Interesting character, seems to have some sort of a connection with Kikyo. He seems to have some feelings for Kagome. Is the generic bad ass anime hero at first glance but is much more complex, showing some smart decisions and a surprisingly strong mind-set. He is trying to get the shards so he can become a full Youkai. Originally controlled by Kagome by having a magical rosary that smashed his face into the ground when she says `sit.'<br/><br/>Shippou: Little fox Youkai that is comic relief, sort of forgotten as the series goes on. Follows the group along. He is a hyper little kid and is like another little brother for Kagome. Appears around episode 10.<br/><br/>Miroku: A Buddhist priest whose family line is cursed to have what basically is a black hole in their hands that slowly devours them. Very powerful funny character, he can be very lecherous and sneaky sometimes, appears somewhere around episode 15 or so.<br/><br/>Sango: Youkai exterminator that uses a huge boomerang as a weapon. Gives the group information about what they are fighting. Has a pet Youkai named Kirara who is a two tailed cat that can be used as transportation. Has a bad habit of getting injured throughout the series. Although she is figured prominently in the intro of the series but doesn't appear until episode 23.<br/><br/>The villains are very interesting. They are much stronger then Takahashi's other villains. There are also many random Youkai that are either sent by the other villains or are found while looking for Shikon shards, they almost always have unusual powers and character designs.<br/><br/>Sesshoumaru: Inu-Yasha's bishounen half brother, a full Youkai. Doesn't appear too much, but when he does there always are interesting battles and storylines. Followed by the very annoying Jaken and later on the little girl Rin.<br/><br/>Naraku: Very powerful Youkai also after the shikon shards. Very evil and manipulative, causes great pain to almost every character. Ruthlessly kills people to his own gain. Spends a lot of time hiding his form in a white baboon skin. He is one of the better anime villains I have seen in a series.<br/><br/>
There is a third villain who I will not bring up. All I am going to say is this character is surprising and shows amazing depth.<br/><br/>The bad I mentioned some problems earlier (ie Shippou forgotten, some annoying characters) but the series has some other flaws. The dialog sometimes can get very annoying, characters describing the obvious or spending lots of time on flashbacks to the episode from before, this is common in anime series but Inuyasha seems to have a lot of it. Another problem is involved with Kagome being able to go between her world and the past, this usually isn't a problem but sometimes it hurts the series. There are strange plot points like her getting medicine from the future to cure poison from magical bees. Also Inuyasha has come up the well a couple of times and has almost no reaction to the changes in Japan.<br/><br/>All in all it is an entertaining series a solid 8.5 out of 10. Should be coming out in America in a year or two.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,22 December 2001
1746,Inuyasha, One of my all-time favourites,"""Inuyasha"" follows Kagome, a modern Tokyo teenager who accidentally discovers a time portal to Japan's feudal era. Besides warring clans, she encounters magic and demons, including the half-demon Inuyasha of the title.<br/><br/>I discovered this show in my local TV listing. There was no summary or description but it was on YTV and had a Japanese title so I wondered if it were a new anime series. I went and checked YTV's website and saw one picture, a group shot of the main characters. I looked at it and said, ""I will love this show"" - I was right.<br/><br/>I don't think there's one aspect of the series that I don't like. I love Inuyasha's insensitivity and when he pretends not to care when he really does. I enjoy Kagome's boldness in the face of danger, while still keeping her modern teenage awkwardness. Miroku, a monk with a weakness for attractive women, whose ""wind tunnel"" (a void in his hand that sucks in anything nearby) is a powerful weapon that may some day kill him. Sango, a skilled female demon hunter with Kilala, her cat-like companion who, when needed, can grow to a sabre-toothed cat larger than a horse, breathe fire and run on air with flaming paws (if that doesn't sound interesting to you, you might have come to the wrong place!). I even like Shippo, the goofy little fox demon.<br/><br/>The villains have depth as well, Naraku seems only to want power but he may have other things on his mind. Sesshomaru (Inuyasha's half-brother) is one of the more suave villains I've come across. Seemingly ruthless, he's really quite honourable, with a well-hidden soft side.<br/><br/>I love the frequent humour, like Kagome's family making up various diseases and afflictions to explain her absence from school, Inuyasha and Kagome's fiery friendship, and Shippo's smart-aleck remarks. The music is excellent and I like the English-language voice actors. Some of the actors, newer to anime, sometimes pronounce names wrong (but it's not too bad) while anime veterans like Kirby Morrow and Kelly Sheridan do a better job. The only voice I was unsure of was Jillian Michaels as Shippo but I got over that quickly. I now love the way Shippo says ""Kagome"", ""Inuyasha"" and especially ""Kilala"".<br/><br/>If you're a fan of animation, fantasy, action-adventure and humour, you may want to give it a try.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,22 September 2004

1759,Sydney to the Max, Keep up the good work Disney!,"Honestly, it gave me nostalgia of Disney shows like Jessie or Zack and Cody. All of the new shows from Disney are either trying to be ""cool and trendy"", the actors give off over-reacted expressions (which does go together with a few shows but sometimes comes off as forced and incompetent) or they bombard the show with laugh tracks. I like this show since..
1. There are no laugh tracks
2. At times, there are over-reactions but it actually comes of as funny
3. There isn't like idk a ""modern-ish language"" where they say ""cray"" or ""literally"" etc.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,11 January 2021

adult father played by Ian Reed Kessler trying to to raise his daughter Sydney
played by Ruth Righi. But he can't do it very well since his mother Caroline
Rhea lives with them. She's an indulgent grandma who spoils Righi a bit and
tells of her own experiences with Kessler as a child.<br/><br/>As a child Jackson Dollinger is seen in flashback sequences with Rhea handling
similar situations as a single parent. With grandma there to be a constant reminder this dad hasn't got a chance.<br/><br/>This is a pleasant enough show, I'm sure it will have its allotted three years

It feels like a Nickelodeon show not a Disney one! Which is a great thing! The humor has a lot of double meanings which is great for grown ups! I really love how this show is for both sexes! Showing a mother when she was a single parent and now a grandma &amp; how you grow as a person! Now her son is a single parent(They flash from present to the 80s always connecting the story lines)! No sob story's here of death! It's DIVORCE which so many kids deal w/ including me! Seeing constant solid family's &amp; how perfect they are on tv can b exhausting! Me &amp; my mom did great! But the Episode about shaving! My father didn't want to teach me let alone be around me. So my mom bought me a practice shaving kit without a blade so I could learn the angles! Seeing the girls father in the tub shaving was great. They do a wonderful job showing kids how hard it can be for parents &amp; reminds parents what it was like to be kids. But my favorite part was when the grandma comes in and says why do you care. Which try telling a kid that! My mom would always say ""It's Not your business what someone else thinks about you. Trust me it's there own insecurities"" which now makes perfect sense to me! But then the grandma says women don't have to shave there legs a lot of them don't. It's up to you if you want to do that. Which is so true a lot of my friends only shave in the summer &amp; a couple times throughout the winter. Society tells women to look beautiful you need to do this &amp; this &amp; this! Well there wrong &amp; this is the kind of thing kids should be watching! Something that is actually funny &amp; subtly teaches kids things! Doesn't beat you over the head w/ it! Also the Cast is fantastic! Especially the dad &amp; grandma &amp; two best friends. Great comedic timing at such young ages! Disney should b proud of this show!

1770,Sydney to the Max, It was OK,"I think Disney was trying to do too many things with this show. They tried to touch on too many things without going into detail.<br/><br/>One episode I thats stands out was where Sydney got her first period, and they told the audience what to do when you get your period but not what a period is. I'm not at all saying the show should be a child's health class, but they dropped the ball with that episode for sure.<br/><br/>There was another episode where Syd wanted to shave her legs for a party over the summer, but didn't know how. So her dad tried to shave his own legs and cut himself everywhere in the process. This was meant to be a joke, but I think it would scare kids to think they would hurt themselves shaving when in reality you can really only cut around your ankles and knees while shaving.<br/><br/>My last critique is that Sydney always gets what she wants in the end. Every episode went ""Sdy wants something, something stops her from getting that said thing, Syd finds a way to get what she wanted"" and throw in a flashback or two. So after the first season the episodes started to get really repetitive.<br/><br/>It's definitely a better show then most Disney has made recently, but it's not without its flaws.

1772,Sydney to the Max, Terrible Show With Unlikable Lead and Bad Messages,"Sydney to the Max focuses on 13 year old Sydney Reynolds, her single father, best friend Olive, and her Grandma who lives with the family. The show goes back and forth with flashbacks of the dad as a kid in the 90's.<br/><br/>Another bland Disney Channel sitcom with a stupid laugh track centering around two annoying teenage girls. Yeah, we haven't seen that before. Rolls eyes. The lead girl Sydney is awful. She is a rude unlikable brat. The way her character speaks to the father is disrespectful and way out of line.<br/><br/>The first episode she yells at her dad that he's a hypocrite for doing the same thing he did when he was a kid.<br/><br/>Syndey ask for a dog her father says no and still goes and gets one anyway. Sydney wants to go to a concert with Olive, her father says no. And you guess it, Syndey and Olive sneak out anyway.<br/><br/>Syndey gets her period at school and needs a change of pants. Her father brings her the wrong pants and she gets an attitude and walks off.<br/><br/>Sydney dodges her curfew and gets grounded and can't go to an event with her friends. She's pesters her Dad to unground her and he finally snaps and says his decision is final. She scoffs at him ""Your're the worst dad in the world"" rolls her eyes and stomps upstairs to her room.<br/><br/>We're supposed to like this spoiled snotty little brat? Ugh....<br/><br/>The flashbacks feel like a cheap gimmick to cash in on 90s nostalgia and frankly add nothing to the show. You can cut out the flashbacks and the show would be exactly the same. And sometimes the flashbacks have nothing to to do with the main plot.<br/><br/>Anyway, not a fan of this show. It's bland, it's not funny, the lead is unlikable, characters aren't interesting, the plots generic, lack of chemistry with the father and Syndey. Just an overall boring show with a lame gimmick.",3 out of 9 found this helpful.,,31 March 2020
1773,Magic City, Magic City Cancellation Extremely Disappointing,"As an author of several books I can declare with absolute certainty all movies, TV shows, plays, etc., start with the writing. These venues either have good writing or they don't. The good writers are able to draw memorable characters and plots. The STARZ presentation of MAGIC CITY was a show that had the best writing on TV. The writing was consistently good. In essence the writers wrote a movie that ran about 24 hours (run over two seasons). This is nearly an impossible task, yet the writers of MAGIC CITY did so with great creative craft and skill. They maintained consistency in the storyline and the character development. The incredibly gifted actors who gave life to the written words were a compilation of some of the greatest acting on television. The acting top to bottom was great: Jeffrey Dean Morton, Danny Houston, Steven Straight, and all the rest was a dream cast. Unfortunately, television is a great wasteland. So when a great show like MAGIC CITY gets canceled the wasteland becomes even more barren. But let's get to the real point of the matter. The viewer ship for MAGIC CITY (as well as other shows like BOSS) is not down because the show(s) was not good. The viewer ship for MAGIC CITY as well as all premium cable stations is low because the cost of subscriptions is too damn high. The economic struggles of people in America are deeper than the empty talking heads of CNN, CNBC and FOX are permitted to talk about. The proof is premium channel viewer ship since 1984 is down 58%. Compounding the issue is the viewer base is going more toward shopping and music channels. Consequently, it's no wonder great written shows like MAGIC CITY are lost to poor tastes of viewers and the inability of STARZ executives to know how to grow viewer ship for a great show like MAGIC CITY. All this is very unfortunate, primarily because the executives of STARZ originally had the intelligence and good taste to allow MAGIC CITY on the channel. Is it too much to expect then that the executives have the courage to continue to air it and see the show through to its proper conclusion? On the other hand, what should I really expect from people who are, in reality, only bean counters? You show me a great show, I get drawn into a wonderfully written drama with brilliant characters, and outstanding performances and then you close down production. Why then should I invest my time, and money, in any programing STARZ offers? The decrease of premium cable viewer ship is not lost on companies such as Viacom, MGM and Lionsgate. That's why those companies eased out of their cable network projects. I know there's no changing the minds of STARZ executives; MAGIC CITY will be canceled. How terribly unfortunate for those of us who knew we were watching entertainment at it's best. And those discerning, loyal fans of MAGIC CITY are thankful that for two brief seasons we were given. We shared in the great pleasure to hear the written words of the writers of MAGIC CITY spoken by the great cast. I wish all the actors on MAGIC CITY the best success in any future endeavors. For a brief time you were my best source of entertainment on television. And to some degree you all became people I cared about. For that I am grateful. All the best. P.S. now that MAGIC CITY is canceled there's no reason for me to scribe to STARZ.",58 out of 66 found this helpful.,10.0,11 August 2013
1774,Magic City, Magic City is like heroin.,"Magic City is as addicting as any TV show can possibly get. If you think it's going to be the same old crime drama, or a Miami Beach version of the Soprano's, you may be right...but only about the latter. And only because this show is just as good.<br/><br/>Magic City's characters are so good and so well acted, you find yourself rooting for everyone in the show. You feel connected to each one. Even the Butcher, Ben Diamond. You may not 'root' for The Butcher, but in his almighty evilness lies an extremely flawed human being. You don't even need to know his back story, you just know the man has issues. <br/><br/>I live in Fort Lauderdale and travel to Miami Beach often. Magic City accurately depicts what Mimai Beach looks like minus 54 years. The shows creative team are true to their 1950's early 60's version of Miami. No anachronisms to bust the mood. This as authentic as they get.<br/><br/>To the un-seen viewers: Take a few hours on the couch and relax. Watch a few episodes in a row, and you will go back in time. If you are having any personal difficulties in life; this is the heroin that will allow you a few hours respite. You will become a fly on the wall at the Miramar Hotel in Miami Beach in 1959. I doubt you will think of anything other than whats happening on the screen. You will however, want more.<br/><br/>This is five star stuff.<br/><br/>Mike I am just a normal no one that loves a good series. You will too.",43 out of 51 found this helpful.,10.0,23 May 2012

It moves at a slow, but steady pace, as if mimicking the slightly slower speed people adjust to when in the tropics. The pace is perfect though, as nothing is rushed, and the story seems to move at an appropriate speed without bogging itself down.<br/><br/>The acting is good, the characters quickly defined with a touch of slight touch of cliché personalities, but I think it helps to make the story move along by quickly separating the good from the bad and the mysterious.<br/><br/>Great period shots of cars, fashion, and the era of smoking abound, giving those of us old enough to remember a nostalgic look at a period that was wonderful, tumultuous, and tragic all at once. This show has the right cast, and it's future depends solely on where it's writers take it. Definitely worth a watch.",35 out of 42 found this helpful.,8.0,8 April 2012

1777,Magic City, Very Entertaining,"I have now watched all 7 episodes of this new series. My initial reaction to the first episode was that it was good but not compelling. This proved to be deceptive. By the end of the 2nd episode I was hooked. The shows strength is the juxtaposition of the control that Ike Evans, the shows clever lead character, exerts over himself while trying to ""do good"" by others, against the always simmering and ready to boil passion of the truly bad guy ""Ben Diamond"". The shows other characters are properly developed to provide fodder for the main characters' growth, confrontation and destruction. The setting in 1959 Miami is great and all the necessary detail to buildings, cars and props was made. I give the show a solid ""9"" but not quite a ten because it does for very short periods in most episodes come up a little short in a hard to describe way. Perhaps the clichés are a little to frequent, with all of the characters being a little too easily pigeonholed. But I digress, I enthusiastically recommend the show to and adult audience as very entertaining.

There is a lot of nude scenes, which I'm okay with.. but I wouldn't watch it as a family. <br/><br/>I already have a lot of questions that I can not wait to get the answers to.

For example, ""the butcher"" - he does seem like a very intimidating and scary guy! This was a good idea that the Starz channel had.

Jeffrey is hilarious off the camera as much as on the camera! He plays himself in every movie or TV show that he makes except he tweaked it to a darker self in Walking dead, God it was hard for me to see him act that evil in Walking Dead but man did he do very well.

1782,Magic City, A disappointment to someone who lived in that world,"That era of Miami Beach is a fantastic treasure trove of visuals and stories of all kinds of incredible characters. I grew up in it a few years closer to those years than Mitch Glazer, so maybe I just remember it better. Hey, he got the series made, whereas I've just had this stuff in my head for 50 years, so I'll definitely give him some credit for portraying the atmosphere. Unfortunately though, he's just objectively inaccurate on a number of points where he really didn't need to be. Those are probably things that only a nitpicker like me would care about, but, to me and other Miami Beach people of the era, those things might matter. The worst part, though, is just that the characters and the story are boring, just the opposite of the reality.<br/><br/>So, I watched episodes 1 &amp; 2 and then chucked it after the beginning of episode 3 which showed the girls at the 1959 beauty pageant dancing The Twist. Unfortunately, no one danced The Twist until mid-1960 when Hank Ballard's original version came out, and then it really became big with the Chubby Checker #1 version later in 1960. I spent a whole lot of time working on picking up tourist girls in teen dances in those hotels, and I screwed up my back twisting too much at one hotel bar mitzvah and had to miss a day of school. Also, my father had the first rock and roll club on The Beach, so maybe I'm a bit sensitive about the music stuff. <br/><br/>That's another thing- they talk about ""Miami"" in Magic City. Sorry, but people said ""Miami Beach"", not Miami. I'm serious, because Miami was this place across the water somewhere in the South of the US. It was another universe that people only visited for sports events. Miami Beach was its own world, and New York was really the next stop in those years before freeway exits. No big thing, but it just irked me, as did a bunch of things in the earlier episodes. <br/><br/>In episode 1, the restaurant in the hotel can't function pre-New Years 1958-59 because all of the Cuban kitchen staff are preoccupied with the events in Havana. Sorry, but the staff would definitely have been black, not Cuban, as hardly any Cubans had come across yet. I remember in 1958 when the first Cuban came into our school wearing a white suit, and I became his first friend. I used to go over to his house, one of the last houses still on the beach, and they had all kinds of weapons and adults arguing in Spanish. Although no one will ever know, his father, Eladio del Valle, was most likely key in the Kennedy assassination. He was found in his car with a bullet in his head on the same day as David Ferrie was found dead in New Orleans.<br/><br/>The owner's son, Stevie, has a build that only comes from weight-room workouts, and weight rooms didn't exist then. The only gyms then were places that boxers worked out, like the 5th Street Gym where I'd go to watch Cassius Clay. When my father took me to the spa at the Fontainebleau, there was no place to work out. The guys got a rubdown while getting their nails done with clear polish. The closest thing to exercise was walking into the steam room. No one in those pre-steroid, pre-workout days, except for a few very odd muscle guys, had developed lats or triceps. Even pro football players didn't use weights, as they thought that it would make you ""musclebound"". <br/><br/>The owner's wife talks about ""stress"". Not a concept yet. The Eames Management chairs in his office weren't commercially available yet. More importantly, Frank Sinatra opened cold, no warm-up act or big build-up! I remember sneaking into the Boom Boom Room to see Sinatra, and it just wasn't like that. Actually, when someone asks me where I grew up, I still often say, ""The Boom Boom Room"".<br/><br/>In episode 2, the guy orders ""extra-lean corned beef""!! Heresy! Now, maybe Glazer was just intending that to be some kind of joke, as the guy ordering wasn't Jewish? However, I don't think that anyone ordered extra-lean anything in those days, and especially not corned beef. Then they make a big thing about the daughter's bas mitzvah, and she says, ""Everybody I know has her bas mitzvah!"" Absolutely wrong. Not in 1959. I doubt if one Jewish girl in a hundred had a bas mitzvah. Then, grandpa tells the daughter that he'll take her on the rides at Fun Fair. Sorry, no rides at Fun Fair other than the mechanical horsie for 3-year-olds. <br/><br/>A somewhat less nitpicky thing is that the big mob guys didn't live in big mansions! Meyer Lansky and ""Trigger Mike"" Copolla, the Italian boss at the time, both lived in modest homes without gates. As I remember, Copolla's did have bullet-proof glass in the living room that faced the street right across from our junior high school, but it was just a normal 50's house. Miami Beach definitely had big fancy houses and cars, but the mob guys kept a low profile, although everyone knew who they were. My ""fraternity"", Knights, had the sons of the of some of those mob guys. The dads were nice enough to me, though they did things worse than anything shown in Magic City. My friends died early.<br/><br/>Well, enough of my kvetching for now. Maybe I will watch the rest of the season, just because it's playing in my head whether I watch it or not.",89 out of 138 found this helpful.,5.0,6 April 2013
1783,Magic City, Good Watch. Promising Future.,After hearing that there was going to be a show about the 1960s Miami this TV Series caught my attention. Myself as a Retro fan was pretty happy that shows like these are getting more common after Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire which were and still are amazing series.<br/><br/>First off its not possible to rate a whole TV Series off the first Episode so this will be about the first episode and how it is in my Opinion.<br/><br/>Magic City looks and feels authentic in many ways. The Quality of the set is really great some improvements could be made here and there but overall it looks fine. The story looks promising with hopefully a lot of future depth in it. I hope what i saw in the first Episode is the tip of the Iceberg. Another plus is that the music of the show is truly great and was picked carefully so it fitted to most of the parts. The important thing is to keep the music as a feature and not to overuse it.<br/><br/>Considering that the actors here are not that well known they are acting in a great manner that makes them look like professionals at times. So a big bravo to the Cast. One of the other points i liked is that the series took good care about the date it was set in showing the affects of real occurrences on the story minorly.<br/><br/>The Effects sometimes did look a bit too weak compared to the rest of the show. These can be improved of course but this doesn't change the fact that it looked a bit off and unrealistic. There were some scenes where the camera angles and the look of a room in a scene wasn't that well done compared to the other great rooms or environments they had showed beforehand.<br/><br/>So Overall. A good watch with a few mistakes here and there on the first episode. Hoping to see the true potential of the storyline and depth out of the following episodes.<br/><br/>If you didn't watch it check it out and see for yourself <br/><br/>8/10,39 out of 57 found this helpful.,8.0,1 April 2012

1785,Magic City, Magic City entertains with a historical slant,"I loved the period aura, the clothes, the cars, the projection of opulence with a hint of malevolence. All that, I'm sure was targeted by the writers and producers of the show. I congratulate them on their creation and its entertainment quotient. They succeeded on those obvious levels.<br/><br/>That said, and because I'm fascinated by the history of this period and that rotation of the earth that was the Cuban Revolution, as well as the history of Florida in general, I'm hoping that, going forward, the show concentrates a bit more on the actual history of the epoch weaving into the plot line those elements of change which impacted our country politically and culturally. If the creators and producers of the show do that, this show has the potential for real societal relevance. I have the feeling that historical relevance mixed with period accuracy in terms of setting, costumes, props, and dialog have the ability to make this show stand out as significant.

1786,Magic City," A show with great potential, which missed the mark","Miami Beach in 1959, a gorgeous resort hotel, glamour, sub tropical weather, supper clubs, Sinatra, gangsters, the Kennedy era, the Cuban revolution, Danny Houston - what could go wrong? This show had the potential to be a memorable seven season fixture, but instead it missed the mark. Although they got the dresses and style right, everyone drank liquor at all hours of the day and smoked like chimneys, Playboy Magazine style, like many shows with period settings made by people who were not born then, the errors stood out and spoiled the mood. Just one example: I was in my 20's then and it was an exciting time, but I do not recall EVER hearing anyone using F___ and definitely not C___ in mixed company. NEVER, NEVER, NEVER. It was absolutely not done, yet seems to crop up a lot in modern shows set in the mid 20th century. A woman using such language was fired from her job on the spot, deemed unfit company and ostracized from then on. Neither was sex ever talked about as frankly as depicted in today's shows. If it was discussed at all, and never in mixed company, euphemisms were used. In the era just before the contraceptive pill, unmarried couples were not very sexually active, but you would never guess that from today's TV. <br/><br/>Apart from that little gripe my biggest problem with the show is that it was boring and lacked humour. None of the one-note characters had any redeeming features which would have made them likable. It was one long depressing descent into depravity. Ike Evans was a shady character despite claiming to be straight. His wife eventually left him due to being disappointed with his shady side, but went to his son who was even worse. Ben Diamond was an unrelenting psychopath. Even Tony Soprano cracked a joke now and then and you felt sympathy for him. We never saw one one redeeming feature in Ben, no anonymous gift to a sick child whose mother could not afford life saving hospital treatment. Not one anonymous gift to an orphanage. Not even a pet cat or dog! Just an evil sexually perverted psychopath 24/7. Corny I know, but Danny Houston is an excellent actor and could have injected some sympathy for the devil. Everyone and his brother were corrupt and on the take, which is not the way it is in real life.<br/><br/>The other problem was that the show as a whole was too focused on the hotel at the cost of other juicy story lines. The Cuban revolution could have featured much more prominently as an ongoing secondary story line. Heck, it was THE major event of the decade with ongoing repercussions more than 50 years later, and we could have used scenes showing what led to the revolution, why it happened and why the new government was adamant that the gangsters running the casinos and corrupt businessmen would never be allowed back. To be sure American companies and gangsters were angered at the loss of their lucrative investments, but the Cuban people did not see it that way. We should have seen the revolution from both sides. The events in Cuba were briefly mentioned in passing, but that was it. The back story of Victor and Maria should have featured in at least two or three full episodes. All we got was a couple of sentences in passing and a brief night time scene of Maria's unsuccessful attempt to leave Cuba. Everyone's back story would have helped flesh out the characters. We could have learned a lot more about Vera and why she did not have the slightest Spanish accents despite being from Cuba. How did Victor end up in Miami Beach before the revolution? What had brought Judi Silver, the platinum blonde sex worker, to Miami Beach? Why did the hotel not have any black staff? Why were the staff predominantly Cuban BEFORE the exodus? So much wasted potential!",9 out of 14 found this helpful.,5.0,11 September 2016
1787,Magic City, Magic City is a thumbs up,"This series is a break away from the scripted ""reality"" TV shows. Magic City is a well balanced TV show depicted in 1959 with actors who seem real enough because they are not the trendy self absorbed Hollywood icons who steal attention from the plot. This show caught my attention right away from the previews. I think it will be better than the Sopranos as we knew how quirky that show ended.The premiere of Magic City was good I have seen 3 others that are upcoming and I am still impressed. Although there is sex and a bit shooting, Magic City doesn't get in to the bloody gory details in or out of bed. The life in 1959 is simple but it still has balanced action in this show unlike many over created over dramatized computer generated one man commandos with exploding world threatening plots.The story line has good continuity, I am not familiar with the story line as was in history,but I am very willing to take my chance on this show it is the first in a long time to capture my attention back to TV.

1789,Magic City," Flat, inane and boring","This show is a complete mess from top to bottom. But the thing that sticks out the most to me is the writing which lacks any cohesiveness, crispness or interest. I watched the first two episodes ( fell asleep during the 1st one and had to re-watch it) because I found it so boring. Time is wasted on needless details. There were several scenes where I had to repeat them to figure out their meaning or relevance, and I still couldn't do it. Lots of pointless scenes. Our lead Ike, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan ( an actor I have liked in just about every role he has performed) is so flat and one-dimensional. He has not guts, or smarts and I'm wondering how he came to run such an amazing place in mob-city central. Okay my itemized gripes: 1) If I hear the story about the scorpion and the frog one more time I'm going to throw up. 2) Topless shark shooting? Are you kidding me? 3) Sinatra played a room of about 150 people on New Year's Eve? And on that note, such a large venue and it only has that tiny banquet room for its shows? 4) Clichés Clichés Clichés of the mob variety. 5) Just because you CAN have nudity in your show doesn't obligate you to pointlessly abuse that. I swear the only one who hasn't been nude is Ik'es 12 year old daughter 6) Every woman, even the cleaning maids all look like runway models- really? 7) Anyone notice just how terrible the extras are? 8) I'm sure film composer Nino Rota is turning over in his grave with the blatant plagiarism of his Godfather score. There's really no excuse for this. 9) Stale and uninspiring directing and cinematography never fully takes advantage of the lavish sets and Miami sun.<br/><br/>The editors who put the trailers together for this show must have worked overtime to string together a show that looks far more interesting as a preview than it is in reality.

I was hoping for a thicker plot; but the era was so appealing, I was satisfied with the visuals in the first episode to hold me tight to the screen. I was taken by Kurylenko's beauty, a different take on Jeffrey Dean Morgan and the era in general. I was disappointed with the choice of Danny Huston to play the Jewish Mob Boss; but now that I've seen three episodes, I've decided he's the only one who can act on the show, besides the Kid who plays Morgan's son Steve. I've waited three episodes for the Pace, Script, Acting and Plot to catch up to the visuals. I've all but forgiven them for so many era errors because I really wanted to love this Series. They've left the words:""Neat"", ""Keen"" and ""Cool"" out of the show; perhaps because the show is none of those words. I'm sure the cast and crew is having a blast filming in Miami, chain smoking, and driving cars that look like Space Ships; however, for the viewer if that's all the show is capable of delivering, it will be a short lived visit back to the Glory Years.",15 out of 32 found this helpful.,6.0,2 April 2012
1796,Magic City, A standard of excellence in television rarely seen,"The writing for Magic City is some of the best you will find on television of any era, and the actors do justice to the material.

Rarely has an uncontrived character been this complex on television, even the legendary Tony Soprano. Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives the performance of his life.<br/><br/>There is beauty and ugliness everywhere, and the show delves into the duality of all. The locations, the people, the politics and the struggles are all given their time center stage. Not knowing Miami at the time I can't speak to the authenticity of the sets, but it feels right enough to forgive any minor sins.<br/><br/>It never feels rushed until midway through the second season when they must have been told there wouldn't be a third, and even then the obviously sped up plot and denouement are satisfying and artfully crafted.<br/><br/>Treat Magic City like a fine wine of which only a few bottles remain.

1798,Black Lagoon, Awesome!,"I just recently picked up this anime because I heard good things about it from some friends, and I am glad they told me about it. Its about a group of mercenaries, that remind me of modern day pirates. They take jobs from various organizations, including the Russian mob. Some of these tasks include robbery, and other mischievous things. The animation is very crisp and clean, and the gun fights are awesome. It makes numerous pop-culture references, which I found amusing, and it also has a touch of comedy, granted its dark comedy. The characters are all very interesting, with the main character,Rock, who joins the group out of circumstance. He is a very likable character and doesn't care for violence. Revy, the main female character is another favorite and a total opposite of Rock. She is tough, enjoys killing people, drinks, smokes and cusses more then anyone else in the show. Dutch who is a large African-American Vietnam veteran and the commander of their small boat, and Benny, a computer geek, and a non-violent person, much like Rock.

Every single episode feel like a fast paced action movie with unapologetic action scenes and dialogue, not to mention the memorable characters especially the female ones because they are no doubt the most baddest and the most dangerous woman I've come across in an anime. The animation may dated for today standard and the engrish skills of the VA kind of hard to get through but if you a newcomer to the world of anime and want to watch something hit close to home before you explore the more weirder side then Black Lagoon is the perfect choice",14 out of 15 found this helpful.,9.0,12 February 2019
1800,Black Lagoon, Fun anime action,"Watching an episode of Black Lagoon reminds me of an 1980s era action movie. There are fights, shootouts, car chases, explosions, and of course plenty of one-liners. Although the show's main aspiration is to be an action series, it has interesting characters and pretty good story lines, making it more than just a run of the mill action anime. The show is set in southeast Asia and centers around a mercenary group (Black Lagoon) whose members include the leader Dutch, mechanic Benny, Rokuro Okajima a.k.a. 'Rok' a businessman who gets shanghaied into Black Lagoon, and probably the best known, Revy, the group's best fighter who shoots up opponents with two pistols at once. Their ethics are of course flexible so they often take jobs from local criminal organizations, and unsurprisingly the Black Lagoon crew definitely qualify as 'anti-hero' types (except perhaps Rok). It could even be argued that they cross into outright 'bad-guy' territory from time to time. This is what makes this series interesting though, that the characters aren't trying to be good, and their only real code of conduct is their loyalty to each other and of course to turning a profit on their shady jobs (think Sam Peckinpah's Wild Bunch). As you may have guessed Black Lagoon is aimed squarely at an adult audience. There is occasional nudity (i.e. dancers in a topless bar), drug use, and killings and profanity are frequent. Although its concept may not be all that original, its execution is good, so if you like your action bloody and your 'anti-heroes' profane, Black Lagoon is definitely worth a look.",24 out of 28 found this helpful.,,13 April 2008

1802,Black Lagoon," Two thumbs up for ""Two-hands""!","Black Lagoon is one of those action-packed Animes where the blood flows thick and red, the guns and explosions are loud and when somebody dies...they die hard!!!<br/><br/>Along the same lines as ""Cowboy Bebop"" but more grounded in reality than space, Black Lagoon's frequent pop-culture references help keep the show current and believable in a ""this could be happening somewhere"" kind of way!<br/><br/>For those of you who enjoy a good story/ plot, the story definitely is there and really is not all that complicated to follow. However, this show is definitely more about the action scenes as they are fast, hard and over-the-top which is great for any action-adrenaline junkie!<br/><br/>The story in a way is just a series of events which links together a whole lot of action scenes but it is the way it is all done which truly makes this anime show brilliant.<br/><br/>The characters are another great point to the show as it really delves into peoples relationships with each other and why it is that they act the way the do or have such a dark view of the world. The interesting thing is that there really is no ""good guys"" in Black Lagoon. The good guys are in a way just as bad as the bad guys yet still manage to gain sympathy and laughs from the viewer.<br/><br/>Which leads to another great thing about the show, the humour! Brilliant...though very dark, it is still very funny!!!<br/><br/>Each season is short (12 episodes) but each episode runs so well into the next that it is hard not to watch another one straight after just to see what happens next. Same can be said about season 2 as it pretty much just continues right from where season one left off. I don't know the exact details but I'm sure the show must have just been one season that was split into 2 possible for DVD release purposes but I'm not 100% sure of that fact.<br/><br/>I will say that season 2 does take the action to a whole 'nother level and it is a lot more brutal than in the first season. There is also more bad language and adult/sexual themes in season 2 which is great but maybe not for all, especially people who found the first season a little bit much.<br/><br/>All up a great action series for fans of Anime or just action in general.<br/><br/>I hear rumours of a third season on the horizon which I hope is true as I'll be happy to watch another 12 episodes (or more) of Black Lagoon just to get another healthy does of non-stop action, guns, babes and bullets!!!<br/><br/>""Don't bother me, the door is locked!""<br/><br/><ul><li>Luke: 11 (apparently).</li></ul>",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,9.0,10 August 2009
1803,Black Lagoon," Black Lagoon, worth a dip into","A creation of eastern production team Madhouse and American Geneon from an original graphic novel by Rei Hiroe, this is an adult-aimed anime series which turns out well above average, even if not quite on the consistent level as such standalone Madhouse features as Millennium Actress (2001), or Tokyo Godfathers (2003).<br/><br/>Much of the particular flavour and interesting tensions within Black Lagoon can be put down to its split production origins, a dichotomy also reflected in dramatis personnel. Besides Dutch there's a Jewish-American (Benny) and Chinese-American (Revy), as well as Rock's Japanese presence. At the same time, set pieces familiar from American action cinema jostle for screen time with characterisation and some graphic styling typical of homegrown manga. As the varied team undertake a series of assignments (at least in First Barrage, the name of the series' initial half, reviewed here), it gradually leads to an escalating tension between Rock and Revy. The new recruit, out of the boardroom and now onboard, so to speak, seeks to establish himself in a new and bewildering world, where he has a chance of gaining the respect previously denied him.<br/><br/>Revy has issues and internal strife all of her own, increasingly aggravated by the new arrival. It's the relationship between these two that's at the heart of the series, and gives events a centre of gravity. As white-collar Rock gradually grows into his new relationships, so Revy has to face up to new emotions and truths. Confrontations will make her doubt the real strengths of her much vaunted self-reliance, and how much her troubled past still influences her. It becomes obvious that, despite her best efforts, a problematic relationship is forming between her and the new arrival. Meanwhile, Rock's corporate-inspired guile, outwardly conservative image, and sly negotiating skills gained in a past life prove an increasingly valuable asset, even as he assesses his past existence in the light of the new.<br/><br/>Operating out of the south Pacific city of Raonapur as the 'Lagoon Trading Company', Dutch's small professional team one held together by a quirky mixture of greed, bravado and camaraderie. Their main, continuous interaction is with a former Soviet military officer known as Balalaika, a big wheel in the crime world they inhabit and service. She quickly uses the Lagoon Company to help secure her ascendancy. In events after that, concerning a group of Nazis and a sunken submarine, she is largely absent, but comes to prominence again as events proceed, notably during the episodes of The Unstoppable Chambermaid. Here she helps to adjudicate at the finish, bringing to a climax stormy events between Revy and the murderous servant Roberta (a peculiarly enigmatic figure, demure but full of unstoppable violence), which have played out with a due nod to The Terminator. Towards the end of this first series Rock and Revy again provide the most interest from point of character until, at the close, we learn some more about her personal history from the CIA, which continues the process of humanising her, putting her life more in context.<br/><br/>It's no surprise then that the closing credits of each show are shown over a notably melancholic sequence, reflecting Revy's trademark emotional desolation. The viewer follows her feet and lower legs along a beach watching her slowly discard cartridges, shoes and trademark twin handguns into the sand. Then, with a final flourish, Revy turns abruptly and confronts us with another weapon, as if warning against any attempt at communication. In contrast to the interest generated by such handicapped and resentful psychology, other parts of Black Lagoon are less rich in character studies, as individuals too readily give up what secrets they have. For instance, the Nazis faced by the team in the three-episode Die Ruckkehr des Adlers sequence are stereotypes, cardboard fanatics with none of the originality we find elsewhere. Only the claustrophobic scenes set inside the sunken submarine, rife again with tension between Rock and Revy, give this section much interest.<br/><br/>A good deal of the show is taken up with violent set pieces that, typical of the genre, often bring an episode's climax. This is all orchestrated with some élan, but in matters of sex Black Lagoon remains surprisingly reticent. Some viewers will note the coded lesbianism of Balalaika, or the constant smoking and cigarettes, those small symbols of virility, which are passed round or enjoyed by characters during the film. There are the hot pants of the busty Revy, clearly geared towards the fantasies of a male audience even if her continuously sexualised character remains an erotic aspiration only. She even expresses a surprising innocence early on when accidentally confronted by Balalaika's pornography (""do you mean he is actually going to put that up her ass?""). Mostly, adult sexuality is confined to the background: mute whores in bar rooms, or the surrounding street life.<br/><br/>If the vividly realised experience of Black Lagoon can teach Revy - or us - anything more worthwhile, its the importance of establishing one's place in life with dignity, all the while discovering and valuing real friends. Worthwhile relationships are at a premium in a lawless city such as Raonapur. Those like Balalaika can only purchase the loyalty of associates; Nazis combine together through blind political obedience, Taiwanese assassins are necessarily hirelings, or servants like Roberta remain emotionally stunted. On Dutch's small, intimate boat however, people interrelate on a far more critical level. Here genuine loyalty and trust can quite literally mean matter of life and death.",21 out of 29 found this helpful.,7.0,30 July 2008

Ones i got the hang of the pace, i really started enjoying the dialogs. They are intelligent, funny and critical - very realistic. The main characters Rock and Revy change there attitude from having fun to being depressed, from being nice guys to being bad without remorse. Loved all the different characters and there are loads of them. This anime has many complicated bad-ass characters who have the presence of being the main protagonist. The detail going into each scene was awesome. One of the few animation were even the background seemed to be worked upon. Work was done on everything making them look very realistic and stylish. The Action is mind blowing and artistic. Its macho and all done by girls. Girls with balls of steel.

Revy the female protagonist she is Tough and she enjoys killing so the is the complete opposite of Rock although they get along well, Dutch the leader/Boss of Lagoon company and Benny the tech guy he is a non violent nice guy. So sub or dub I think all up the dub is more worth it not cutting to much and its kind of nice to see them all speak English is feels more natural.

1806,Black Lagoon, A great action anime,"This series follows Rokuro Okajima; a Japanese salaryman who finds himself taken hostage by a trio of pirates aboard an old torpedo boat. When he learns that his boss has no real interest in him he joins the pirates. The crew consists of Dutch the captain; Benny, a computer and communications expert and Revy, a woman with a bad temper and two guns that she uses expertly. Revy soon dubs Rokuro 'Rock' and this new name sticks. They are based in the lawless city of Roanapur where there must work with and fight against a number of dangerous organisations most notably 'Hotel Moscow' a Russian Mafia run by a woman called Balalaika. Over the course of the series they will have many scrapes and in every one the bullets will fly!<br/><br/>I've seen quite a few anime series and think this is one of the best of them. Rock is a great character to introduce the murky world of Rainapur; in many ways he represents the audience; an ordinary person taken into a world he struggles to come to terms with. Rock may bring us into this world but it is Revy who is the real protagonist; she is a great antihero she is nearly always angry and never ducks out of the opportunity for a fight. As you might have guessed there is a lot of action in this series and it is all pretty exciting; giving us a sense that the protagonists could be harmed. Inevitably this leads to a few downbeat moments including a couple of real tear-jerking moments. It isn't all bleakness though; there are some laughs to be had; especially in scenes between Revy and a gunslinging 'nun' from the Ripoff Church. This series isn't suitable for younger viewers because of the levels of violence, swearing and one case of extreme, but not graphic, sexual threat but older viewers who like plenty of action should love this.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,23 July 2013

The central best piece of entertainment, aside from the action, comes from the fun banter between characters especially the two most focused on throughout the series Rock and Revy. I could watch those two just sit and talk for hours, which is much of what the show is, and it entertained me every time. I recommend this to anyone and everyone who wants to have an adrenaline filled fun time, even if you're not an anime fan. But for someone like me who is, it was a treat.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,10 March 2018
1808,Black Lagoon, Occasionally ambitious action anime,"When it comes to Japanese anime there is always a question what exactly given show is trying to achieve and what genre it fits in - one obviously can't watch most anime shows as entertainment for kids. Judging by western genre conventions ""Black Lagoon"" is closest to action movies from 90s or to franchises like ""Transporter"" or ""Expendables"". It is full of improbable and highly entertaining action sequences and awesome characters written entirely as Rule of Cool instantiations. The plot can be shallow and at times is only an excuse for staging another shootout. And the whole show can be really cheesy. But instead of coming from western action movie formulas much of this cheesiness is of Japanese origin. As a result, if someone is not accustomed to anime quirks (e.g. underage gender-ambiguous incestuous insane killer twins! I'm not kidding..) one may find them quite refreshing. <br/><br/>But there are some differences which in my opinion make ""Black Lagoon"" a little bit better than standard action flicks. Firstly, it's the overwhelming atmosphere of moral ambiguity which pervades the whole show - the anime doesn't try to whitewash actions of the protagonists, it portrays them essentially as villains fighting other villains. Likable villains, one must give them that, but villains anyway. And, in contrast to many other similar movies, protagonists are often not even slightly more ethical than their enemies. As a result antagonists of the show tend to be better developed and much more interesting than expected (aforementioned twins and certain yakuza clan particularly shine here).<br/><br/>The world of the show is dark, nihilistic place inhabited by violent beings, fighting for money in criminal underworld. It happens all the time in all kind of shows, but here the series is aware to some point of its own shallow nihilism and manages to criticize it. Quite a feat for an action series, I'd say.<br/><br/>The other strong point of Black Lagoon is the duo of its main characters - Revy and Rock. Revy seems to be walking ""chick with guns"" stereotype. It's quite easy to overlook certain degree of complexity behind her sheer awesomeness and battle prowess. Below the surface she is much more flawed than typical action anti-hero which definitely makes her that much more interesting. Rock, on the other hand, as a stranger in the world of wickedness who was put there by accident, acts as a link of a viewer to the series' dark underworld and represents fading ethical ideals which contrast starkly with the place he was thrown into. The relationship between the two and its development fuels much of the series. OK one can see it through as some kind of Japanese male yuppies' collective escape fantasy. But it's really interesting fantasy, contains some serious traps and it's not as trivial as one can think.<br/><br/>Speaking of fantasies - one massive pitfall of the show is strongly sexualized portrayal of Revy. I wouldn't mind if she was strongly sexualized sometimes or even on a regular basis - it would be somehow justified by her character. But she is sexualized virtually always. Maybe it's just me but I really can't stand mild erotic fantasies pressed upon my face all the time. It's all the more frustrating when you notice that show is actually quite restrained when it comes to gratuitous nudity. OK, restrained at least relative to its setting.<br/><br/>The other flaws - the story can be at times confusing and sometimes doesn't make much sense - it concerns especially the plot of the longest arc of the show (concerning certain Latin maidservant). Additionally, some characters and events cross the border of ridiculousness by too many steps. I'm personally inclined to forgive the latter, however. <br/><br/>If you like action-packed movies and series but you find them formulaic and boring and you can tolerate small amount of anime peculiarities ""Black Lagoon"" is the ideal show for you. Exoticness and reasonable depth in both characters' development and antagonists' portrayal will come as a bonus.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,2 April 2015
1809,Black Lagoon, A fresh view of human dark side,"Anime compress a wide variety of themes. But, we are pretty accustomed to a lot of clichés (pretty, hot teenagers in school uniforms; swords and wings, the search for a stronger foe), not that we dislike them, only it's nice to explore new ways of story telling. Black Lagoon its a series that draws not only the standards of anime, but china movie flicks, spaghetti westerns and south American drug movies. Forget about the pretty girls and the ""tsundere/yandere/wherever-dere"" archetype (that is rather dull), who can't work without his ""oni-san/sempai/kun"": in here, women are strong, will-filled, completely independent and have a very, very bad mood. No swords/wings: in here is about guns, pistols, shotguns, bazookas, missiles...and machetes (well, a couple swords in last episodes, but absolutely no wings). Search of the stronger? Nah, forget it: this is about money...lots of money. Paying homage to great visionaries (sigh!) like Quentin Tarantino, John Woo,... we view the ways of living/survival of a ""delivery company"" in the eastern seas of Asia (no Japan? yeah: almost NO-JAPAN). From recovering lost art, to dealing with human trafficking, serial killers, we witness the drug wars in the eyes of former ""salaryman"", now turned mercenary/diplomatic/translator for the Black Lagoon company. It's in his eyes that we witness the low ranks of the human race. IN our screens wheel dance a lot of bizarre-dark characters, with twisted ways of living (the Chinese knife-fighter, the Venezuelan soldier turned maid, the Gun- dealer nuns...), and, our protagonist, we will try to understand them... but this not a humanist story, there are no answers here, just questions: How he/she has landed in rock bottom to be like that? But, the same characters will stop any questioning as they shoot each other... if you analyze beyond the action you'll find some very sinister and deep concepts. Some episodes can be hard to swallow (for example, the Vampire Twins episodes are extremely emotional, easily can put your faith in humanity at test). If you ignore this, and only focus on getting a good time, this anime will fulfill your expectedness: action, explosions, and lots of adrenaline...",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,,7 February 2014
1810,Black Lagoon, Action packed anime with substance,"""Black Lagoon"" is a team of mercenaries who are hired for all sorts of things! This anime is mostly about their adventures! The action used in this anime is similar to that of a hong kong movie! Mostly it is heroic bloodshed! With some martial arts in it! Although this show has a lot of action it also has some substance! There are some themes in the plot that will make you think! For example there are these twins (little children) who are coldblooded killers! But they are this way because they have been (sexually) abused and forced into this life of crime in a very brutal way! So these victims have become villains themselves! Maybe it is too far-fetched to believe,but in real life these things do happen! What makes this anime so special that there is no real evil and real good,all the characters are all villains! Even ""Rock"" the main character admits being a villain but one who observes! He is the one in the middle of all the things that happen! There are many interesting characters! There are gun blazing nuns, a ""terminating"" maid,killer twins and much much more! There is also ""Revy"", a very attractive Chinese-American woman who rolled into this life of crime with ease! Her nickname is ""Two Hand"" (what do you think she holds in these two hands??? Guns of course!) You will know very fast what makes her special! It is nice to see that among these characters most of them are also gun blazing women who are just as dangerous as the men! There are a lot of jokes in this anime who are actually really subtle! In very serious conversations people constantly are referring to famous movies and actors,which make it a feast for movie lovers!",24 out of 49 found this helpful.,9.0,24 February 2007
1811,Black Lagoon, One of the best anime shows...,"You can find Black Lagoon on Netflix and I'd easily recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good adult oriented anime. I've recently watched through episodes once more and I think even after almost 15 years it holds up perfectly.<br/><br/>The animation is really well done and I also enjoy the story lines a lot as well as the characters. The main cast is very likable even with their flaws. And quite often you can even feel sympathy for the antagonists.<br/><br/>Within the various stories you'll always find the dark themes of loss and tragedy. At the same time the show keeps it entertaining by adding amazing action scenes. They are quite often over the top in terms of what should be possible, but the show keeps it at a level where even though it is ridiculous it's still somewhat believable and also highly entertaining.<br/><br/>Most important lesson of this show - Don't mess with maids!",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,9.0,10 July 2020

1814,Black Lagoon, could've worked...,"I was tricked into this show after watching the pilot, and unfortunately spent the next 20 or so episodes grinding my teeth and hoping for things to get back to where they started. They did not. The basic premises of Black Lagoon is fairly exciting - a bland Tokyo office clerk gets mixed up with a bunch of modern day pirates, who gradually help him find his real self and enjoy life. Not a lot, but mixed with a neat amount of gore and sexuality it could have worked. Unfortunately the show's biggest problem is that never really figures out what it wants to be about. Themes such as coming of age, finding love, loss of innocence, brutality of crime and the hypocrisy of the modern world get tossed around, only to be abandoned yet again as the characters indulge in another outrageous prepubescent fantasy action sequence, ridiculous in its unbelievability. Don't get me wrong, I am all about silly. And all about realism. It's just that for me, the two don't ever work together in the same episode. Or the same show. I call this the ""Gungrave Syndrome"". It seems like the writers did not believe they can have a successful show that is based solely on real-life physics and multi-dimensional characters. So they throw the whole one-man-killing machine thing, evil vampire twins, blade throwing women, bullet splitting samurais etc. etc....I AM actually grateful there were no zombies. I mean if you are going to make an Anime about ridiculous gunfights right out start it up as one, and maybe place it in some alternative universe, or at least far far in the future. ""Trigun"" worked exactly because of that. And because it had characters. Black Lagoon has two - Revy and Rock, but they struggle between ridiculousness and determination in such a pathetic fashion that midway through the viewer finally abandons all hope that they will ever care if something happens with either of them. Unsurprisingly, nothing happens. The rest of the players are barely worth mentioning, because all they ever do is more of the same. Over, and over, and over again.<br/><br/>All in all, the way I see it, this is a kiddie show disguised as an adult one. It could have worked, had they kept it simple and realistic, but a failed opportunity is all it is in its current form.",36 out of 87 found this helpful.,4.0,13 December 2009
1815,Black Lagoon, Loved it!,"Originally I've found this anime years ago but i never gave it a chance, i saw a half naked girl for the cover and figured it was gonna be some stupid anime with lots of ass and boobs with no decent story line or plot. But this year i saw it went on toonami and gave it a chance, best thing i could of done! This show has so much action, violence, and action!! with the very subtlest of romance(it does have boobs n ass but theirs a lot more to it). If you like real life guns that look exactly like they were thrown into your TV screen from your lap then this could be something you'd like. To the contrary to the normal anime or TV series where the hero beats the villain and everything is all good and happy, then this will be a nice change for you. I don't want to spoil anything for but if you like things like the mafia, gangs, and money then this is a must. The main characters just pull you in and leave you wanting more, unlike most series where the back story of every character is just thrown at you one episode after another, Black Lagoon slowly gives you bits and pieces of everyone back story's leaving you to just wonder more and more in suspense!<br/><br/>Overall point: If you like action, guns, money, and violence, and detailed characters that make you learn to love there twisted ways, then this anime is definitely worth a watch!

It is so bad in fact that I was moved to write my first review on this site after like 10 years.<br/><br/>It takes only a few seconds to realize what a ripoff this was of Tosh.O, but hey, there are plenty of videos out there to make fun of.

1824,Ridiculousness, Painfully unfunny.,"I seriously cannot even describe how bad this show is and how uncomfortable I felt watching from my couch. The awkwardness and lack of originality is literally cringe-worthy. Rob throws out these unfunny comments about clips and it's hard to watch because he actually thinks he is being funny. His 2 co-hosts are completely useless, he tries to make one of them seem relevant but someone editing the show can do what this guy does. The other co-host plays the dumb blonde role of the show, and is incredibly stupid. Rob asks her what she thinks of when she hears the word ""double-whammy"" and she responds by saying... ""burgers?"" .... Absolutely stupid, right? Rob seems to think it was the funniest thing he's ever heard. It was one uncomfortable thing after another.<br/><br/>This show is everything you would expect it to be, AFV meets Tosh.0. The problem is, Rob is not funny enough to carry this mediocrity on his back. I actually think he was part of the awkwardness. Please Rob, leave the viral video stuff to Daniel Tosh. He is actually funny, you are as the summary to this review reads. I lost every bit of respect for Dyrdek after watching this. One of the worst, most unfunny shows I have ever seen. Nothing is original, and I did not even chuckle once. They go as far as ripping off ""What Happens Next?"" and a form of Web Redemption from Tosh.0.<br/><br/>Why MTV would green light this show is beyond me. I'm aware at how bad MTV is, how every show is for hipsters with no taste, but this brings them to a new low. I always felt that if you don't like Daniel Tosh then you are either way too sensitive or you simply have an awful sense of humor. That's my opinion. But if you like this show, you have a GOD AWFUL sense of humor, one that mirrors a 10 year old prepubescent little boy/girl. That's a FACT. Worst show to ever grace television.

1825,Ridiculousness," A douche, a stoner, and a bimbo. What could possibly go wrong~?","I only ever watched MTV for the Andy Milonakis show, Crank Yankers, Celebrity deathmatch, and some music videos here and there. As time went on, it seems they've been trying to make MTV more like all the other networks with their reality shows and web comedies. While I would LOVE to rant on about 16 and pregnant, this review is more towards an unfunny douche, a stoner black dude who gets paid to do nothing, and a bimbo who makes strangling a hyena sound like a better alternative than listening to her annoying cackle every five seconds an unfunny pun is forced.<br/><br/>That being said, I used to assume Rob did meth before each show since he tends to move around the set and laugh awkwardly to his own jokes when I first gave this show a shot. Now I'm just convinced he's naturally incapable of acting like a human. I never thought much of him even around the time of Rob &amp; Big, and seeing how butt-hurt he got over that Tosh.O skit portraying him and his dream factory as a pedophile stunt further lowered my opinion on him. At least Tosh can stand still on set and knows how to deliver a joke! What can you do, Dydrek, than dance around the stage like you're at a party with no music? In addition, hosts like Tosh and Hardwick don't need two useless ""Co-host""(if you can honestly consider them that) to back him up in his crusade to review clips that went through Tosh, and before that Chris Hardwick(until G4s closure of course). Anything Dydrek shows in an episode is essentially watered-down, and is only ruined more because we got that bimbo we all know as ""Chanel West Coast"". Why is she even here? Other than tits and a plastic face, she has no real personality other than to laugh every time Rob looks at her as if on-cue, she is to laugh like every joke is funny. Hell, he could fart in her face and look at her, and she'd laugh like she was being tickled roughly. Then comes ""Steelo"", some dude who just sits on a computer during the show. Hey buddy? You're not at your aunt's house trying to ignore your family by spending the time online checking your facebook status and playing Garry's mod! Close your damn laptop and actually act like you're on camera for once! Basically, you'd find more entertainment in assembling furniture for your living room than these two and Dydrek combined.<br/><br/>The skits and clips are one of my biggest problems next to talentless hacks who fill in what time MTV doesn't use for Pregnant southern girls with flaky boyfriends or werewolves(The latter is a bit biased, as I find werewolves and vampires overused by now). Anything I see here, I already watched not only Tosh or Web soup, but other people on Youtube who reviewed in a much more comedic and better-executed manner.<br/><br/>As I conclude this review, I want to compare this show to the bargain bin of DVDs you find while in line at the dollar store. You know not all of them are great, but it's cheap and you think you'll give it a chance. Then you realize it was the worst dollar you spent in your life, and regret not having given that dollar to hungry kids in Africa. The only difference is that this is one dollar you won't be getting back through a refund. Why MTV kept this show in their lineup for so long is beyond me.

There's definitely no doubt that co-host Chanel West Coast is a walking headache at times. Yes, I get it. But this show was not meant for wannabe critics to watch and pick apart. It was meant for people to get a quick laugh every now and then. <br/><br/>Rob, despite how unfunny he is at times, is just a really laid back guy, who is fun to watch and looks fun to be around. If you cared to watch any of his other shows like Rob 'n Big (I'll always miss you Big) or Fantasy Factory, you'd see that he just enjoys getting a good laugh. That laid-back attitude obviously carries over on the random formatting of Ridiculousness, but really, whoooooo cares? If it's not your thing, don't watch it.

1832,Ridiculousness," Worst show, embarrassing for Rob.","I had always been a fan of rob. Even before he got to MTV I followed his skating career. I loved Rob and Big. I've enjoyed Fantasy Factory which focuses on his pseudo- entrepreneurial incubator. So many reasons exist why I loved FF. Then MTV/Rob gets the bad idea of ripping off Tosh.<br/><br/>First-I'm not a big fan of tosh, yet his delivery on the show is spot on. He is funny, has had a long career at being funny, nothing else. I don't hate this show because he is trying to rip off Tosh or because he does a bad job at doing the rip off. Tosh is a rip off of a random late night VH1 show with the fat guy who died a cpl years back. That show was a rip off of Americas funniest videos. Everyone rips off everyone. I enjoy all things funny, regardless of rip off status. I hate it because it is BAD.<br/><br/>Rob is not funny. He is a self promoting skateboarder. That is how he got his contracts, stood out amongst the sea of other skateboarders. That is how he got Rob and Big made (as if he were so famous he needed a full-time body guard-no one outside of the hard core skating community really knew who he was before the show-tony hawk doesn't even have full time security). Rob and Big was good and funny because of the character dynamic. And likely the writers. This show seems to not have any writers.<br/><br/>This show tries but fails at being funny. Rob is so awkward, his jokes so lame, his disposition, his intention of being an authority on all things funny, has made me lose all respect for him. How doesn't he see how sad and lame his show is? Willfully ignorant I assume is his mindset. He just isn't funny. His comments are uninspired, juvenile, and frankly embarrassing. He reminds me of that big scary guy with a gun at a party making stupid jokes-no one dares tell him his jokes suck. But rob is a skinny white dude with a skateboard! Makes no sense.<br/><br/>Then, to attempt differentiation from Tosh so it wasn't such a blatant rip off, is the addition of ""co-hosts"" which serve to play the straight men. However, Rob uses these people with stupid, childish, ghetto ass names (even though the woman is white and from wealth) as fodder and support in his jokes. They never have anything remotely funny to say. The blonde bimbo is a living stereotype and embodies the worst a teenager can joke about blondes. Her character made it final in my mind to no longer respect Rob. She plays the dumb blonde hot chic. She is over the top ignorant. Over the top ""that dumb girl."" If Rib really is a producer, then he signs onto the misogynistic, sexist mindset that helps ruin the show. <br/><br/>All in all. I hate the show for many many many reasons. But simply put:it is never funny. Host is not natural or meant for pseudo stand up. Writing, if it exists, is damn poor. Co- hosts and guests do not help, but make it worse. No one is funny. Only this show can take a funny net clip unfunny. Cannot believe it is still on the air. They put a skateboarder to do Tosh's job. What would you expect if you put Tosh in a skating tourney? A bloody mess. Just like this show.",31 out of 58 found this helpful.,1.0,24 March 2013
1833,Ridiculousness, One of the worst shows on TV.,"I honestly do not understand how ANYBODY over the age of 10 could find this show funny. A show like this needs a comedian as the host, not a former skateboarder/businessman who's in his 40s and dresses like a 17 year-old. The clips that they show are basically just drunk people falling on their face or their behind, and then sometimes Rob will ask his friend ""Steelo"" to ""replay"" the clip in slow motion (something that could easily be done in post- production), and pauses it right before the fall, and then Rob points out something we can already see, and then he makes some lame joke about it. But the worst part of the show, by far, is Chanel West Coast. She sits on the stage and just laughs at the clips, she doesn't even talk! She adds NOTHING to the show.<br/><br/>Perhaps the show is okay in moderation, but the worst part about the show is the fact that MTV plays it almost 24/7. Nearly every day during the week, MTV will show a marathon for 6+ hours, and that's being lenient. Sometimes, they show it for over 12 hours. Meanwhile, they push their other shows to the side by showing zero reruns during the week, and for what reason? Who can possibly stand 10 hours of people being clumsy?",15 out of 25 found this helpful.,1.0,21 May 2015

1849,The Detour, An incredible trip!,"I ran across this title over the internet and thought it was a movie. I then saw it was a TBS original and had second thoughts about watching it. (I live outside the US and don't have TBS.) I reluctantly watched the pilot episode and trust me when I tell you this, if you have any sense of humor, you will love this show. <br/><br/>One critic who is Russian absolutely murdered this show. It just goes to show how some people watch TV/MOVIES and think that everything should be true to life. It's said that this story is based on the real life couple's own experience with family vacations. That makes it even better. <br/><br/>This is reminiscent of the VACATION movies, but I think it has a much better feel to it. The one liners are incredible! You'll have to watch it twice to catch everything, but it is SO worth it. <br/><br/>This is my first review because I feel it's completely merited. From the looks of it, it may have been scheduled for at least 2 seasons. I think this has a chance to go for at minimum 3. But, we should wait to see how the first season turns out. The promos look promising. <br/><br/>GIVE THIS SERIES A CHANCE, it's quite the laugh. I've watched the pilot 3 times and keep laughing. <br/><br/>The children in the series are spectacular. <br/><br/>I hope everyone jumps on board for this ride. So far, I give it two enthusiastic thumbs up. haha 8/10",47 out of 59 found this helpful.,9.0,9 April 2016
1850,The Detour, Funny if you are not offended by the raunchy humor.,"OK, this is basically a family SitCom, but a Raunchy one. It's about a family, a couple and their 2 kids on a road trip.<br/><br/>Many jokes are derived from the fact that the two kids (around 10-12 y.o.) are starting to have questions (and misunderstandings) about relationships and sex.<br/><br/>The 2 parents are not model parents. It seems like they are trying to be but they constantly fail. A goofy father and a progressive mother who likes to get high.<br/><br/>It is good that the comedy is taking place on the road and not in the same living room or kitchen. In every episode you are to meet new people and experience a different set. The possibilities in a road trip are endless and the creators seem willing to explore them. I doubt this series would be boring or repetitive.<br/><br/>So far (I watched the 2 first episodes) the comedic timing is good but keep in mind that the humor might not be for everyone. It is raunchy and vulgar and awkward. This is not a ""DR. Ken"" type of family sitcom.<br/><br/>Natalie Zea and the rest of the cast looks good, the script is OK, the pace quick without being hasty and (always a major plus) it doesn't have a fake laugh track.<br/><br/>Overall: It's funny so far, but maybe its humor isn't for everyone.

The level of crass and political incorrectness is similar to IASIP. The style is completely different however. (Nothing can really top Sunny for me). If you are a fan of IASIP, this will probably entertain you.<br/><br/>The kids in the show are very likable. I find most kids on TV to be ""white noise"" but not these two. However, I would not let kids watch this show. Watch first to make that call for yourself. And Jason and Natalie are really fun to watch!<br/><br/>I disagree with some opinions of S2.

I barely recognised Caroline Quentin.<br/><br/>I appreciate the subtle touches of humour too, it could have easily been grim viewing, but far from it.

1874,Dickensian, Thoroughly Enjoyable Serialization Inspired by Dickens's Novels,"Produced by Tony Jordan (who also wrote seven of the twenty episodes), formerly of EASTENDERS, DICKENSIAN could be superficially described as a nineteenth century transposition of the BBC's popular soap opera. The action takes place in an unspecified London street teeming with people - beggars, hawkers, sellers, pedestrians - and lined with shops. A pub (""The Three Cripples"") provides a focus for much of the action just like the Queen Vic in the soap. The protagonists originate from a variety of socio-economic backgrounds and interact with one another on cold winter days, where the snow mostly lies thick on the ground or falls lightly. The only thing missing from DICKENSIAN that would give it the authentic EASTENDERS touch is the familiar line of dialogue where one character wants to ""have a li'le talk (tawk)"" with another.<br/><br/>Frivolity apart, DICKENSIAN is a highly entertaining mélange of various plots, all moving outwards from the central incident taking place in episode one - the murder of Jacob Marley (Peter Firth). Inspector Bucket (Stephen Rea) of ""the Detective"" (Scotland Yard had not yet been created) pursues the case with relentless persistence, despite occasional misfortunes (such as putting his back out). With his Sarff Lundun accent and quiet manners, he has a knack of making people talk without resorting to violence.<br/><br/>In a subplot, Mr. Barbary (Adrian Rawlins) tries to maintain a facade of gentility despite being in considerable hock to Marley and Scrooge (Ned Dennehy). He has two daughters - one a perpetual spinster (Alexandra Moon), the other a flighty spendthrift (Sophie Rundle) in love with a penniless soldier (Ben Starr).<br/><br/>Miss Havisham (Tuppence Middleton) has inherited her father's fortune as well as control of the family brewery, leaving her brother Arthur (Joseph Quinn) with a small inheritance. Resentful of her power - which he believes is unjust - he collaborates with Meriwether Compeyson (Tom Weston-Jones) to try and recover it. Compeyson is a lip-smackingly convincing villain, able to turn on the charm where necessary as well as commit unspeakably evil deeds (such as drowning Miss Havisham's dog).<br/><br/>A galaxy of lesser characters revolve round these plots: Mrs. Gamp (Pauline Collins) sets her amorous sights on Silas Wegg (Christopher Fairbank); Mrs. Bumble (Caroline Quentin) tries to fulfill her social ambitions despite her husband's (Richard Ridings's) physical and mental inertia; and Fagin (Anton Lesser) tries every trick in the book to keep Bill Sikes (Mark Stanley) under control. Oh, and we must not forget the Cratchit family trying to continue an edenic existence under the most trying of circumstances.<br/><br/>Each one of the twenty half-hour episodes intertwines these plots, creating a world of perpetual motion wherein something always seems to be going on. It is a tribute to Jordan's production that he has managed to portray mid-nineteenth century London as a teeming city riddled with corruption, yet with some elements of kindness thrown in.<br/><br/>Purists might object to the series on the grounds that it is not ""faithful"" to Dickens's novels in the sense of reproducing the plots. Rather it could be described as a mash-up of all the most memorable characters from a variety of texts (GREAT EXPECTATIONS, OLIVER TWIST, PICKWICK PAPERS, and so on). Yet the series is very Dickensian in outlook: many of the novels were originally written in serial form, and Dickens's readers used to eagerly await the next installment to find out what happened to their favorite characters. This is precisely the feeling we get from DICKENSIAN.",29 out of 32 found this helpful.,8.0,28 January 2016

1877,Dickensian, Plot the Dickens!,"The idea of bringing together into one narrative different fictional characters has been done recently and brilliantly in the likes of ""Penny Dreadful"" but this new BBC series takes it up a few notches more, not only in the number of disparate characters but of course that they are all from the world of Charles Dickens.<br/><br/>I must admit I was concerned when I read that the series was devised by the producer of the Beeb's dreadful soap opera ""Eastenders"" but, five episodes in, these Londoners I can stand. It is slightly confusing to see some resurrected characters walking about like Nancy from ""Oliver Twist"", Little Nell from ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" and Miss Haversham from ""Great Expectations"" and one wonders if they are going to meet the same end as before, also in my reading of the former, I didn't have Nancy pegged as a call-girl as here and attending, shall we say, to Jacob Marley too.<br/><br/>The show is set up along the same lines as the channel's previously successful adaptation of ""Bleak House"", i.e. in thirty minute programmes, usually with a kind of cliff- hanging climax at the end of each episode, which of course ties in well with the weekly publication method that Dickens himself worked to. The main story of the many plot strands appears to be the death of Jacob Marley from ""A Christmas Carol"", with Inspector Bucket of ""Bleak House"" on the trail, but a close second appears to be the anticipated jilting of Miss Haversham too.<br/><br/>As you'd expect, the production values are high, the settings are superb, interiors and exteriors, the latter especially played out in the winter snow. I'd imagine the eyes of the various agencies for actors in the UK all lit up when they got wind of this production, so many of them are employed here, although not too many big names that I can see, perhaps Stephen Rea in another mannered portrayal of Bucket, Caroline Quentin as the domineering Mrs Bumble and Pauline Collins having fun as that old soak Mrs Gamp being the most identifiable. There's also a smattering of new characters too just to help the plots develop and to date these creations are fitting in seamlessly well.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm thoroughly enjoying it now that I'm familiar with the main characters and can see the plot coming nicely to the boil. I'm just wondering if some of the best known nicer characters like Pip from ""Great Expectations"", Nicholas Nickleby or David Copperfield might yet show up, but really there's more than enough to be going in with. With another fifteen episodes to go, there's plenty of time for surprises yet.<br/><br/>Some might see this interpretation of Dickens as manipulative or even sacrilegious but with modern writers devising authorised use of characters by say Charlotte Bronte and Ian Fleming to give two very different examples, personally I'm finding it fun and rather enjoying it so far.",44 out of 52 found this helpful.,7.0,2 January 2016

1879,Dickensian, Surprisingly good,"Given that I totally loathe Eastenders and its dreary premise, I was so surprised to find just how enjoyable Dickensian is. I recorded quite a few episodes but once I started watching I have fond it compulsive viewing. My only complaint is the casting of Stephen Rea as the detective, Bucket. Rea is not a great favourite of mine so I find it hard to be convinced by him. The other actors are, in my opinion, fantastically well cast. Pauline Collins is great as is Ned Dehenny as Scrooge. Everyone inhabits their parts very well. Production values are high and Victorian Britain is well portrayed here. The story is well written and plotted and makes a pleasant change from the dreadful Eastenders. It is interesting to see the show's take on Miss Havisham's fate which was never really fully explained in Great Expectations.

1884,Dickensian, Even better second time around,"I watched this series when it was first televised and loved it then. I have since binge watched it, having been shown again over the Christmas period.
This is a wonderful show and concept, following the characters before their tales in Dickens novels take off. Everything about it was of the highest quality, brilliant acting, fabulous sets and the right amount of tension. I particularly loved Amelia Havisham's story and found it quite heartbreaking; Tuppence Middleton played the character brilliantly. I also enjoyed Honaria and Frances Barbary's tale as the backstory for Bleak House. What thrilled me was how the series ended, neatly rounding off each of the characters journey's to the point where the books start - Amelia in her wedding gown, and the distant rattle of chains as Scrooge sits in his living room... just wonderful.

The script is fine and didn't need to be deliberately a Charles Dickens  what  satire  tribute  soap? Which just brings my current 2017 viewpoint back to this irritating problem. This show just stays home all the time. I found it claustrophobic. I am used to 19th Century movie and television treats such as Sherlock Holmes, Penny Dreadful, Dracula, and such, all of which leap to the country (or at least out of any given neighborhood) from time to time. Although I can only give Dickensian 7 out of 10 myself, I think there will be a big place for this experiment in future revisions of the genre, and this show will be remembered fondly.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,7.0,16 May 2017

First rate production values, excellent writing and superb performances (Stephen Rea's Bucket is just wonderful) made this one of the very few truly must-see series I've come across.
I could not figure out whether this was: A) intended to be a limited series, or B) only Season 1 of something that did not get renewed.

It superimposes an awful theme full of fear and treachery over these beloved charming characters. I can see there is a supposed 'happy ending' but it is merely the catching of a murderer. This new simplistic theme creates a shift in vision away from warmth and kindness to one of doubt and fear.

1896,Dickensian," ""Wot!? You mean?"" ""Yeah, Marley's Brown Bread! "" Duv, Duv, Duv-Duv-Duv-Duv","A newspaper reviewer of Dickensian wrote of Dickens' novels being ""much loved"". Indeed they were and are. But more than that they are enormously admired and respected. Dickens, also, was very much a popular entertainer. And all this with just words, without a flake of snow falling, atmospheric music or costume. His casts of characters are exactly that - individuals instantly memorable - some now immortal - and, typically Dickens, instantly recognisable by their manner of speaking. I am a great great admirer of Dickens' writing and it irks me to hear adaptations where additional (and usually inessential) dialogue is added - it's like driving along a smooth road and going over badly repaired noisy sections. It's not only that it doesn't sound like Dickens, but that it seems either like padding or plain exposition, and Dickens was never just plain. But I thoroughly enjoyed The Muppets' Christmas Carol - the characters were as per the book, quite a bit of the original dialogue used, an excellent Scrooge in Michael Caine and the moral message the same and undimmed - and, apart from being terrifically competent, it was thoroughly entertaining. Paradoxically it showed greater respect to Dickens than some ""serious"" adaptations. My feeling is that radio adaptations which keep close to the original are the most impressive. The BBC's radio adaptation of Bleak House was the very finest - the scenes between the haughty Lady Deadlock and lawyer Tulkinhorn (Anton Lesser) were if anything even more claustrophobic than in the book. When Dickens did a public reading of Oliver Twist some of the audience fainted at the dreadful scene where Bill Sykes, previously egged on by Fagin, bludgeons, the audience is encouraged to imagine, Nancy. There was a tradition of the Victorian stage monologue and nothing had a more powerful effect on an audience (A tearful audience at Simon Callow's rendering of Dickens ""Dr Marigold"" one case in point).<br/><br/>From the sublime to the scarcely credible. The problem for me with Dickensian is that it blithely dispensed with Dickens' genius, replacing it with the very humdrum, just sprinkling it with a coating of Dickensian-style flavouring. There is nothing to love, to admire and little to entertain. Dickens can rest in peace - while his name can be stolen, his genius cannot.",16 out of 43 found this helpful.,5.0,27 January 2016

1899,The Secret of Skinwalker Ranch," I Was Involved in the Skinwalker Project, and You Should Know:","I was involved in the Skinwalker project at an early stage of the Fugal regime, and you should be very skeptical: the sources here may not be trustworthy.<br/><br/>Insofar as they fabricate content, silence informed voices through intimidation, and moderate criticism through back door channels, this is a massive problem for an organization that makes money on sensational claims.<br/><br/>Just by way of context:<br/><br/>The ranch was previously owned by Robert Bigelow. The transaction between Brandon Fugal and Bigelow was such that Fugal purchased the property, but he did not acquire, nor did he gain access to, the research information that Bigelow had collected. So, I investigated the property in an effort to front-load Brandon with additional perspective in advance of a key meeting with former scientists from Bigelow's team. I spent a number of nights on the ranch and provided reports to Brandon directly. Finally, I presented a summary of these reports as a part of this key meeting.<br/><br/>While at this meeting, Bigelow's former scientific team made explicit claims that the investigation needed a new direction. They felt that they were not on a path to secure conclusive or satisfactory descriptions of the phenomenon with the particular methodologies that had been employed up to that point. That is not to say that they didn't observe strange phenomena or procure some results. They felt as though they did. But, if the project were to continue, there needed to be course changes based on what had been learned along the way.<br/><br/>For what it is worth, my impression was that the people involved in the Bigelow-era were exceptionally sober-minded. They were highly credentialed. No one who was eager to indulge in fantastic conversation for its own sake. In fact, I left the meeting shaken by their rigor. It seemed clear to me that their effort was to understand the phenomenon in a way that would garner respect from the larger scientific community--even if the phenomenon itself could not be approached in a strictly scientific way.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>1) Following the meeting, I was struck by how dismissive Fugal was of their insight. It was odd. And, he is on course to repeat the methodologies that the former scientific team attempted to wave off. With the exception of Eric, no other members of the original team are present--despite the fact that they were available at the time of the first meeting. Meanwhile, some of the new personalities do not convey the same level of credibility (and I am trying to be polite here). Given my perspective, this is a really tough pill to swallow. Fugal's enterprise seems out of sync with the purposes of a serious investigation. It feels like an attempt to draft a celebrity story far more than otherwise.<br/><br/>2) I posted a similar review to the Secrets of Skinwalker Ranch Facebook group following the first episode. Within a half hour, I received an extremely aggressive phone call from Brandon. This call lasted over 37 minutes, and it included language that I found to be very threatening. The result of this language was that I removed the post.<br/><br/>This is a problem for the ranch's credibility.<br/><br/>It is incredibly distasteful that an enterprise which trades in the most extraordinary claims attempts to control information at this level. (Granted, my comments aren't complimentary. But, they are also pretty benign in the grand scheme. Yet, Brandon was so quick to react.) It would appear that this isn't outside of his character, as others have reported similar things. Additionally, I seem to have been barred from posting to that site again.<br/><br/>It plays against the legitimacy and credibility of the project when information is manipulated by those who have a financial stake in the ranch. Beware.<br/><br/>Furthermore:<br/><br/>3) While I was involved in the ranch, Thomas Winterton and Jim Morse were staged in a photograph for the purposes of generating intrigue. A photograph was posted to the ""original"" Skinwalker Ranch forum (back when that was still a going affair) under the false pretenses. This post was made on June 15, 2016. The photograph showed Thomas Winterton and Jim Morse holding long guns (AR-15s) at the gate entrance. This photo and the associated narrative was a work of staged fiction.<br/><br/>These are not the hallmarks of credible organizations. My real experience on the ranch is somewhat limited.

They aren't actors so when they're forced to act it takes away from the credibility of the whole production...not because it's made up but because everything seems to be in the hands of amateurs. And speaking of...unless the bad acting really got to me...it seems like Brandon Fugal just hired a bunch of his buddies to do the research on the ranch. Except for Travis Taylor they really don't seem to be experts in anything. I mean I could have figured out that you have to put up surveillance cameras, monitor weather and air traffic! Maybe I should give the resident scientist more credit for that SATAN surveillance device he set up but they didn't explain enough about it for me to judge...but on the other hand, he didn't even have anything set up to systematically monitor and measure the obvious anomalies like the microwave readings etc they found. It honestly would love to know why Fugal chose these guys. I mean they didn't even want to dig on the ranch because it might activate the very anomaly they were sent there to study! What??? Please tell me that was just part of the really bad roll playing dialogue they were forced to have! Had to be, right?

The security guards are brandishing their M16's all over the place to the point of hilarity . The logic is not even close to being considered realistic and they don't even try to convince. The leader/owner of the ranch is supposed to be this Elon Musk elite type that owns various enterprises and drives a Lamborghini wherever he goes and has his own private helicopters.

The most exciting part of the whole series is when they launch a rocket with some measurement equipment and spot an ufo in the process.

1923,The Looney Tunes Show, Definitely worth a watch,"Right, where to start. After reading some recent reviews on this show I had to quickly create an IMDb account so I could stick up for it. One guy even said this show is horrible to look at and the animation sucks! He must be watching on a 9"" b/w TV. Watch this on an hd TV and your eyes will be glued. I always think how amazing shows animation like this and Adventure Time are compared to back in the days. I do get the comparison to Family Guy but that's purely because adults can laugh out loud to this; I do and I'm 21. One guy even stressed for like 2 paragraphs about how unintelligent some characters are. IT'S A KIDS SHOW ON A KIDS CHANNEL. If you want to learn something then watch the Discovery channel, fool. Yes Lola, for example is mad and annoyingly stupid but she's not that bad where you should rant about for 2 paragraphs!! I don't get the point to point comparison to the classic Looney Tunes. Just accept that it's a new show with new stories and concepts. The characters are still lovable (well, maybe not Daffy). What the hell is wrong with them living in houses?! Is this show meant to POINT TO POINT copy the classics? No! I think them living in houses makes them more relatable to us. Isn't that why most of the time we watch a programme. Seriously, some of the reviews I read were seriously corrupt and foolish. Now, time for MY actual review. Not a review of others STUPID reviews. This show is very funny. The only downside is that currently it only comes on once a day on Boomerang while other shows like Regular Show on CN come on way more. I really like this show.

The Show portrays more in depth personalities of our little heroes that makes you love them even more.

This is not the original Looney Tunes but that isn't necessarily a bad thing, because it still manages to stay witty and extremely funny. The only element of the show that I don't particularly like is the CGI Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner shorts. These should be even shorter.

1926,The Looney Tunes Show," Really, really good. But not for everyone.","First off, this is a really good cartoon. Looney Tunes or not. The Looney Tunes live in the real world and live among regular people. Bugs Bunny has a house, his roommate Daffy Duck, his neighbor Yosemite Sam, and he some-what girlfriend Lola. It plays out like a sitcom, but a good one. The jokes are funny, it's very entertaining, and the characters feel real. However, not everyone will like this. The Looney Tunes Show isn't supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy. I would consider the jokes more like the game Portal or the movie Hot Fuzz. It's not supposed to make you laugh like crazy, and in the end, the show is better. Watch the originals and notice how long each episode is, about 6-12 minutes the most. You can't have laugh out loud jokes go on for almost half an hour, which is why Regular Show and Mad are only about 11 minutes. Then watch a funny sitcom like the King of Queens, Seinfeld, Everybody loves Raymond, or Yes, Dear. There are funny, but not laugh out loud funny,<br/><br/>But how to the characters match up? Well, every character is interesting and every character has character. Personally, I think the characters that did change were for the better. Witch Hazel isn't a psychopathic witch, but the mother or a monster. This allows the character to open more and be more interesting, even if you don't think so. Gossamer is now an 8-year child. I was a little skeptical first, but once you remember that Gossamer was originally a monster, you soon realize that character doesn't work so well in a sitcom. Finally, Lola Bunny. Give her the voice of Kristen Wiig from Saturday Night Live, and you get a character that's fun to watch. She talks miles of dialogue at a time and at points made me laugh so much I had to rewatch to hear the joke again. Now, not every character will appeal to everybody, but from what they have, it's really good.<br/><br/>But faithful is it to the originals? Honestly, not really. If the only reason you wanted to watch this cartoon was because you really liked the originals and was hoping for the something similar, you won't like it. Look at the new Rambo movie, the new Rocky movie, Duke Nukem Forever, Indiana Jones, and the Expendables. Things that would be really cool back then, won't necessarily be good now. If the general public today who never heard who the Looney Tunes were would watch an episode of the originals against the newer version, the newer version would be the better.<br/><br/>Don't go into this cartoon hoping for something faithful. Go into it hoping to find something entertaining. You might end up liking this if you gave it a try.",57 out of 89 found this helpful.,9.0,7 July 2011

1928,The Looney Tunes Show, Funny Update!!,"First I'd like to state I'm a huge fan of the Golden Age of Cartoons, particularly Warner Bros. and Walter Lantz (Woody Woodpecker) studios. I've purchased all of the Golden Collection DVD's and both PLatinum Collection Blue Ray releases. That being said, I LOVE this update. We all should realize that nobody will EVER be able to come close to the genius of the originals. Those cartoons were created in a completely different time under completely different circumstances with completely different artists. If they tried to rehash the old style it just wouldn't work...<br/><br/>So...they did the smartest thing they could have which is to reset the franchise into a modern, sitcom style while paying homage to the original characters and the original spirit. If you read every venom-spewing review here you'll notice one common denominator: everyone complains that the new show is ""different"" than the original. I would bet my house that if the show tried to rehash the past and recreate the old style, these SAME haters wouldn't like it either. Well you can't please everyone and judging by the ratings more than enough of us ""get it"".

1931,The Looney Tunes Show, I wanted to like it...,"But it just didn't do much for me. Like everybody here, I am a big fan of Looney Tunes, the original cartoons were part of my childhood and I still love them now, and I liked the compilation films too despite complaints of shortening the original cartoons they feature.<br/><br/>The Looney Tunes Show isn't a complete waste though. I did like most of the voice acting, especially Maurice LaMarche as Yosemite Sam and Kristen Wiig as Lola, and Jeff Bergman does better than expected as Bugs and Foghorn, not so much Daffy. The background art and colours are colourful and smooth, and the theme tune is nice and memorable.<br/><br/>However, there are a number of assets that I don't like, starting with that I miss the droll wit in the dialogue. Some of it is funny, like with Lola, but some of it is lame and hindered further by some awkward pauses, almost as if they're expecting somebody or even an audience to laugh, hence the somewhat sit-com-like feel to it. I also felt there was too much dialogue, not enough of the physical comedy.<br/><br/>The stories are on the whole uninteresting and predictable, while in terms of characters Lola and Yosemite are fine, Bugs is likable enough with Freleng-like facial expressions and mannerisms but not witty or arrogant enough, but Daffy is often a complete moron(and in an unlikeable sense) and Porky has little to do and is very bland.<br/><br/>Character designs are a mixed bag. Some have a nice Chuck Jones-like style to them, like Elmer, but others are too fluffy for my tastes especially Bugs.

1937,The Looney Tunes Show, A Good way to ruin a classic,"I must admit, before I begin my hatred against TLTS and look forward to the next upcoming sellout, Change can be very good and beneficial when actual thought and passion is applied, but there's no change present here; just debauchery. They've taken timeless characters that nearly everyone has grown up loving and subjected them to the same lame, tasteless, crap-staining that has plagued newer characters that could never live up to the Looney Tunes on their best day.<br/><br/>The concept of funny with respects to Lola, is definitely different from what I perceive as funny. To me Lola's brand of ""comedy"" is highly akin to nails on a chalkboard. Once again I state that whoever did the ""writing"" for this show borrowed too heavily from Seth MacFarlane's treatment of Family Guy. This show's version of Lola might as well just be Peter Griffin wearing a rabbit suit, make-up, and a dress, for she's every bit as stupid and obnoxious as Peter, and frankly stupid characters alone are not funny. Laughing at a dumb character in a movie or cartoon is equivalent to laughing at the dumb kid in school who stuffs crayons up his nose and then makes fart noises.<br/><br/>To the position, about them being smarter than they at first seem, no they aren't, and even if you're going to argue about the so-called hidden level of intellect, they are still no where near the intelligent level of humor and character development that went into the original cartoons. The Looney Tunes are satirists, in addition to being universal and timeless. They should have at least played upon that characteristic that their original creators endowed them with. Instead of borrowing from the style of shows like Family Guy they should have borrowed more from shows like Duckman or Animaniacs including slapstick and zaniness along with the sitcom-style awkwardness.<br/><br/>People tend to think that the critics of this show are merely nostalgia-blinded, but firstly there is no such thing as nostalgia-blinded. Whenever studios try and do anything new using old characters and media they are trying to play the nostalgia card and draw in the appeal of the preexistence watchers, and one of the first rules when dealing with another artist's original characters and stories, is that you pay respect to the artist FIRST, then you deal with pleasing the fans. This show does neither. They spit in the original creators' faces while simultaneously ticking off a majority of the Looney Tune fans worldwide. That nonsense about appealing to a new generation is rubbish too. If kids weren't already fans of the Looney Tunes, they're not going to become fans by you making an unoriginal reinterpretation of them.

1938,The Looney Tunes Show, Unmaking history,"The Looney Tunes are one of the most important and innovative chapters, a ground breaking moment in the history of animated films. Each and every short of that golden era is filled with mind blowing inventions, both in matter of comedy (visual and spoken) and of animation. The Looney Tunes are ageless because they are archetypal. You can identify with the characters of the Looney Tunes not because they live in the same suburban house as you, but because they think and react in a way you think and react, or at least you wish you could react. Chuck Jones says in his autobiography: ""Why do we love great comedians? Not for what they look like, but for what they do... They are mirrors of what we do, or, in the case of the comic hero, what we would like to be able to do."" Setting them in a suburban house with a pool and bathrobes is limiting their universality. It takes away all their archetypal stature, deprives them of their metaphorical dimension and oversimplifies or even cancels their allegorical complexity.<br/><br/>Unlike today's animated pictures, in the Looney Tunes there were no moral lessons to be taught. There were no ""good messages"". They had no educative value whatsoever. Those films offered some moments of freedom from all this. Bugs and Daffy never were some docile, middle class sitcom characters. They were marginals with no values, making fun of everything, defying conventions. Those shows were pure comical anarchy, combining the great slapstick comedy of the 20s and the 30s and the dialectical wits of the Marx Brothers. They had no rules, no predetermined setups, no cuteness, no false kindness. The Looney Tunes consisted in the pure pleasure of a funny story told in movement, music, sound and color. Again, the great Chuck Jones talks about the stories an uncle used to tell him. He says: ""the ending was all a small boy could hope for: there was never a hint of morality, no overt heavy-handed effort to make us better children, better adults, or better at anything except learning the love of listening.""<br/><br/>""The Looney Tunes Show"" is oblivious of everything accomplished by the creators of the Looney Tunes. These polished, spineless, spiritless, witless excuses of characters are not the ones we know. The only thing that makes this show relate with the Looney Tunes is the fact that they use the same model sheets for the characters. That is all. This show has castrated Bugs and Daffy and made them docile and harmless. Bugs is now living in a suburban house, has a pool cleaned by a pool boy. He has a wallet and a credit card and does jokes about Daffy being unable to make a coffee. The plots are predetermined by this horrible sitcom set, making it impossible of any original invention (in comedy or in animation). This show is just another sitcom. Only, instead of Chandler and Joey, you have a rabbit and a duck -who are as gutless as the Friends. In the original Looney Tunes, Daffy could be an inspector in space, a cowboy, a robin hood-like buffoon -he could be all of that and yet he never ceased being Daffy Duck; he was not delimited by the role he was given. The Looney Tunes were put in situations that they completely turned around by being characters. In this confrontation between character and role (which reflects the real life confrontation between the individual and the situations in which he is constantly subdued and who constantly tend to shape him, break him and make him comply) the character was always the winner. The personality of Daffy could not be restrained by a role. And that's comedy: it's all about character, about personality dismantling the situation. ""(...)character is all that matters in the making of great comedians, in animation and in live action."" says, again, Chuck Jones. In this show Daffy and Bugs are trapped in the situation (it is a situational comedy, after all, not a character comedy). Now their role IS their character, thus making them unable to bent it, deny it, destroy it and make fun of it. They are no longer free of it, or free to defy it. The obey it and live with it. They are trapped in it.<br/><br/>Concerning the animation part, this show is a disgrace. And I think that even those who find it funny will agree with this. This is not an animation; it is an animated version of a TV sitcom. I can not understand how someone who has the intention of using the Looney Tunes characters can ignore in such a blatant way the fact that the Looney Tunes set bases for the art of animation and completely transformed it. If you want to bring the Looney Tunes back, you have to at least try to do something like that. But, what we have here is an animation who simply tries to mimic the visual layout of a stereotypical television sitcom. Who directs these stuff? What happened to the art of animation? When did it lose its aesthetic autonomy? When was it stripped of its own codes and given those of TV sitcoms? This show is irrelevant. It does not have and will never have any impact whatsoever in the history of comedy and surely not in the history of animation. In its best moments it vaguely reminds the real Looney Tunes just by copying and rehashing the real inventions that took place back then. The characters have been reduced in playing the roles of their character. There are no characters in this show, just roles played by empty drawings trying to imitate something they once were. This is a pitiful animated sitcom wasting some of the most amazing and beautiful characters ever created in animation history. Looney Tunes made history. This show is unmaking it.",48 out of 87 found this helpful.,1.0,1 January 2014
1939,The Looney Tunes Show, People are giving this show too much praise without realizing the real Mistakes.,"Let me start off by saying that this show is a very sad attempt at recreating the original Looney Tunes. For one thing, they make Daffy a mental *** who can't do anything. From watching the episode ""Best Friends"" i was shocked at how dumb he was. He got smarter as it went on, but not smart enough to outsmart Bugs in anyway. I should show you an example if you haven't seen this show yet.<br/><br/>Moving on. The worst part of it all is that they live in houses, which was a pretty stupid setting for the Looney Tunes. If you watched the originals, then you would know that Bugs is always in a different area in each cartoon. His hole is in just one place in this show, with it consisting of a chair and a lamp. He only visits it once though shortly after Daffy steals his automatic carrot peeler idea and ruins his house. Anyway, the character designs weren't exactly that good either.<br/><br/>I guess they are not bad enough to make you hurl, but they were sort of just plain dull. Bugs' feet are huge, well Granny (not in the image) just got a slight change. She is still voiced by June Foray which is good. Gossamer looked promising, though in the show he was a KID. That's right, he did not sound like a monster, but a kid. That was the stupidest idea ever to change Gossamer into a kid. Guess who voices him? The fish from The Amazing World of Gumball. Foghorn Leghorn is still funny though, and his voice sounds okay. Also, you would notice that the Coyote and the Roadrunner are in the characters, yet, they appear in CGI form the entire show. Whats up with that? Enough about designs, lets get on with the rest of the show.<br/><br/>Okay, this is a load of junk. They attempted to put in Merry Melodies into the show, and this is what happens. Well some of the songs were good, the rest of them sucked. We all enjoyed it when Bugs sang a random old folk song when he was walking, but in this show he doesn't even do that. Neither does Daffy either though, so that really sucks. I will say that the rhymes are really good though.<br/><br/>Finally, the Coyote and Roadrunner shorts. Well i will give them credit for the originality of them being exactly like the originals, they would be terrible only in title terms. Also, in some shorts, they reference internet memes (as do the titles, which can get quite annoying after a while). The memes sort of throw off the short a little, though its more of something just for today's teens and whatnot. The shorts use TNT, which is something i will give credit for also, though they won't use more violent things like canons or guns, which i find to be pretty stupid seeing as how the show is rated TV-PG after all and has already used both guns and has referenced Nazis in one episode before.<br/><br/>The shows title card wasn't that bad, though. It was certainly an original design. So if you are a person who likes the originals, stay away from this disaster. I advise that you watch the originals immediately if you haven't, and avoid this show as much as possible if you want to keep some IQ points. For those who are curious as to how the originals looked, here is a cartoon short dating back to the twentieth century. Bugs is significantly different here for those who saw The Looney Tunes Show as their first time seeing these characters. This is during their glory years.",50 out of 92 found this helpful.,1.0,23 April 2015
1940,The Looney Tunes Show, 7.8 out of 10?! Really? This show is mediocre!,"Why, Cartoon Network? Why tone down our favorite slapstick beat-em-up comedy show into a blatant answer to better 2D sitcoms like Family Guy? The jokes aren't that funny to begin with. The plots aren't too surprising, the art design and animation looks laughably bad, but I just don't like this show. To be fair, it's at least worthwhile if there's nothing better on TV, but if there's something better on that you happen to like, go ahead and change the channel.<br/><br/>I really hope the writers get the message that we're ALL trying to put out to them... we really do want the chance to enjoy this show, and it's not too late to fix.<br/><br/>Just please... don't let us potentially permanent fans down!<br/><br/>And if you have not seen this show yet, and are looking to the reviews to see if it's something you WOULD like to watch, keep an open mind to it being a once beloved cartoon, that's original was produced some 80 years ago... and the re-boot... is just that...

1941,The Looney Tunes Show, Looney Tunes in name only,"I, as a huge fan of Looney Tunes, was looking forward to the new Looney Tunes revival series when Cartoon Network advertised that the show would make its debut on May 2011. I saw the show and man I was very disappointed. The show is nothing like Looney Tunes. They aren't 'Looney'. They're too normal. Looney Tunes was best known for its slapstick comedy. Instead, its a bland dialog-oriented sitcom where the Looney Tunes are mature and do 'grown-up stuff' like working in the office and obeying societal norms, etc. I hated that. I wish to see them fight each other comically through shooting each other with shotguns, throwing grenades at each other, etc., not all that. Why? Why change a classic show instead of staying true to the originals?<br/><br/>I also hate how the characters are portrayed too. The characters are all wrong. Bugs is a boring, lifeless, no-nonsense everyman who is easily annoyed at insanity instead of the mischievous trickster of the olden days, Daffy is an annoyingly unfunny moron character instead of the greedy jerk or that crazy hyperactive duck back then. Lola Bunny from Space Jam is now a dumb blonde girl who Bugs often rejects, Elmer Fudd no longer hunts wild animals and instead is a bland news reporter, Yosemite Sam doesn't use his guns and isn't the angry Western robber we used to know, Pepe Le Pew is no longer a smelly lovesick skunk, Foghorn Leghorn no longer pulls pranks on Barnyard Dawg, Marvin the Martian no longer attempts to destroy Earth, Taz is now Bugs' dog and doesn't spin like a tornado of fury, Witch Hazel is now a 100% serious witch named Witch Lezah as opposed to the psychotic witch from back then, Gossamer is now a young child, and Speedy Gonzales is a dull pizza man who lives in Bugs' and Daffy's house? Seriously! What did u do to these characters? The only characters who are correctly portrayed in the show are Granny, Sylvester, Tweety, Wile E Coyote and Road Runner. Aside from bad casting, voice acting is terrible. Witch Hazel sounds so wrong (in this case she sounds like an African-American), Daffy and Speedy had deep voices, etc. Between every episode got 'Merrie Melodies' where our Looney Tunes character sing crappy songs that are so annoying. The only thing that is 'Looney' is the CGI Wile E Coyote/Road Runner cartoons.<br/><br/>Looney Tunes fans out there, please skip this awful crap and stick to the originals. If you're looking for good Looney Tunes revival TV shows, choose shows like 'Taz-Mania', 'Tiny Toon Adventures', 'The Sylvester And Tweety Mysteries' or 'Duck Dodgers' instead.",40 out of 72 found this helpful.,1.0,9 September 2013

1943,The Looney Tunes Show, Like something out of a bad dream!,"The original Looney Tunes had a whole set of recognizable elements that made them work.

The setting changed from one short sketch to the other, moving across the world and time periods.<br/><br/>It could be argued that they already threaded this path, that a change was needed to keep it fresh. Sure, why not.<br/><br/>But please, anything but a sitcom setting! The jokes, mostly contained in the dialogue, fall flat and the situations are all from the bag of rotting sitcom tropes.

1945,The Looney Tunes Show," While not perfect, there's so much unwarranted hate for this show","Let me preface this by saying I spent a large amount of my childhood watching television. A fair amount of that was spent on the Cartoon Network, where I watched a LOT of the old Looney Tunes cartoons. I loved and was absorbed by the universe. Bugs Bunny is one of my all-time favorite animated characters.<br/><br/>It seems like a lot of people don't realize the amount of times that the Looney Tunes characters were reworked to fit into a completely new world. Obviously they did it with Space Jam, and made cameos in Roger Rabbit. There's been countless commercials where they could be construed as 'out of character.' They were worked into icons of World War II. They were portrayed as actors in their own universe. They've been in animated Broadway plays and operas. There's been things like The Bugs Bunny Show, Duck Dodgers, and even Baby Looney Tunes.<br/><br/>So, why is it then that having them placed into an animated sitcom-style show seems so completely crazy? The short answer is: it's not.<br/><br/>The Looney Tunes Show actually does do a very good job working the source material of their characters and the slapstick cartoonish comedy into a 'real world' style setting. Again, being in the real world is not a new concept for the Looney Tunes. The writing is actually quite sharp and clever. Bugs and Daffy reprise their roles as the two figureheads of the Looney Tunes as a whole, with their characterizations mostly intact. Bugs plays the cool, calm and collected straight man to Daffy's over-the-top screwball ideas and antics. Daffy is as self-absorbed and greedy as ever, and lives with Bugs — who's made a comfortable living off his invention of the carrot peeler.<br/><br/>However, almost every other character in the show's depiction is hit-or-miss. Porky continues to be the unfortunate folly for Daffy's spiteful nature. He's a very proper, well-mannered pillar of society, yet severely lacking in self-confidence. Tina Russo, a new character, is a duck with a real name and Daffy's love interest. Tina was actually one of the well-made characters in the show. She has a no-nonsense, street-wise personality with a strong sense of self and keeps Daffy in line. She's got an enjoyable deadpan sense of humor and comes off as very relatable.<br/><br/>Then, we have  Lola. This was the biggest, most jarring change to any of the characters on the show and one that I felt was severely lacking. Lola herself knocks an entire star off of my rating for the show because of how often she appears. Lola's initial depiction in Space Jam was that of an attractive and seductive bunny who just so happens to be very good at playing basketball. While she wasn't the best conceived character in history, she still had some redeeming qualities in her exaggerated feminist nature and contempt for being degraded or disrespected. Lola in TLTS is not that at all.<br/><br/>Lola in this show is a bubbly, reckless, hyperactive airhead with a borderline psychotic personality and severe attachment issues when it comes to Bugs. She's unwanted and very abrasive, by both characters in the show and the fandom. I thought of a couple different ways they could've handled Lola's character. They are the following: <br/><br/>A) Lola Bunny is a stock market trader or a corporate CEO. She has a strong personality but can be short-tempered and explosive at times, which is more in line with her Space Jam portrayal. She is almost constantly on her cell phone chatting to business partners or investors, and has little time for anything or anyone else — namely Bugs. Bugs frequently tries to get her attention but typically goes unnoticed by the extremely busy Lola. There's quite a few gags I can think of with this sort of character.<br/><br/>B) Lola is similar to her TLTS character with a critical change. She is now a bubbly, energetic, *smart* young lady. Typically seen as calm and knowledgeable, she is the other characters' go-to person for advice or to simply act as a shoulder to cry on. She can have a relaxing hobby, like tending to a garden or does altruistic things like caring for injured animals. In this way, Bugs is a lot more smitten with her, but because of how virtuous she seems by comparison to him he's not sure how to go about telling her how he feels.<br/><br/>I really feel as though character shifts like these for Lola would've made the series much more enjoyable and perhaps more relatable.<br/><br/>As for the animation, I personally saw nothing wrong with the updated designs they made for season one. It helped to cement the Looney Tunes' presence in a whole new time period of 2011, versus how they looked in 1950. I liked it a lot — it gave the show a fresh, new take on the characters to enhance their new status as citizens of real world suburbia. At the same time, they were cute and never really lost the charm of their original designs. I couldn't believe it when they caved into the complaints (mostly from people that didn't even watch or care for the show to begin with) that the characters didn't look 'Looney Tunes' enough and changed back to the originals. It took a lot of value away from the show as a whole and a lot of its original, updated allure was gone.<br/><br/>All in all, The Looney Tunes Show is a fun twist on the standard Looney Tunes formula. Sure, not every episode is amazing and sometimes the 22-minute running time can feel a little long. However, it's still a severely under-appreciated show with glowing charm that's entertaining for both kids and adults. It's only a terrible shame what some people did to derail, damage, scorn and ultimately cancel this show. It ended far too soon and will be sorely missed.<br/><br/>That's all, folks.",8 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,16 October 2017
1946,The Looney Tunes Show, Heavily Flawed and Disgraceful,"The Looney tunes show, I hate it. Hate it, hate it, hate it. Some details in the animations felt really wrong (the design in general of Bugs, Lola, Porky, etc. like a creepy buffoons with big heads and big feet, but I agree the fact when they have their bad moments, it was the worse. Stupid just for the sake to be funny. The original humor was absurd sometimes, yes, but it make sense and doesnÂ't feel like this thing. I watched the show all my childhood and see this was an absolute torture.<br/><br/>The characters are OOC, Lola has become an annoying, stubborn, needy and clichéd, just like the others. None of the characters are likable neither is the plot. If you're watch this show just to past time, don't waste your time. There are much creative shows other than this garbage. What kind of a sitcom is that? A shitty sitcom, that's the right kind for this show. Hell it even makes Nick Jr and other PBS shows hell more entertaining! I'd rather watch mold grow than this crap! Taz is supposed to be vicious not a house pet, And look at Yosetmet Sam, he's supposed to destroy Bugs not harass Bug and Daffy at their own home! This show is the reason why I'm writing a story about them and how they failed! I won't be even surprised if Looney Tunes' popularity declines every show or segment made!<br/><br/>Don't know which is worst, the Looney Tunes dancing to Lisa Stanfield's you can't deny it or this show? I'd say both!<br/><br/>Plus despite the wacky appearance of the cartoon, it wasn't a stretch and squash type of show like it should be, but it instead it was lame-o sitcom.

1948,Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., Very detailed- Well cast and well researched. A TV series that puts the hollywood versions of these stories to shame.,"This is a very good investigative biopic. While most productions will focus on either Tupac or Biggie, this one takes on the daunting task of exploring both mudrers and tying them together, and really does a great job of it. With so many expose's in recent years in conjunction with the 20th anniversaries of the murders, from the Fox Tv special featuring Ice Cube, to the BET production focusing on the rise and fall of Death Row records, I wasnt expecting much going in, as it seems at this point that the angles of these murders have been explored ad nauseum. But as someone who was a fan of both artists who has closely followed the careers and investigations into their deaths, I must say the producers did an excellent job of taking a step back and looking at these murders from a fresh perspective. <br/><br/>Instead of trying to put forth any one prevailing theory as so many of the other investigative productions about Tupac and Biggie have done, this one really implores the viewer to think like an investigator and look at all possible angles and motives, even those that may seem far-fetched. I was expecting more of the same old Tupac and Biggie revisionist crap and thought it might be worthy of a quick laugh, but I was very pleasantly surprised. There is actually a great deal of substance here. This was excellently researched and there was clearly a lot of time, thought and effort put into this production, which in and of itself seems rare for productions today as so much tv and movies now operate from half baked premises and poorly thought out plot-lines, to the point that is condescending and insulting to the viewer's intelligence.<br/><br/>There is a lot of primary source word for word information here that is far more in depth than many of the other investigative documentaries about these subjects. It's so surprisingly detailed and accurate that the viewer forgets it is dramatization. This is almost to a fault because the casual viewer would assume that a USA miniseries would be mostly fake and embellished and won't realize just how authentic much of the story is to real life.<br/><br/>Beyond just the solid research and exploration of facts, the dramatizations here are also very detailed and very well executed. For example,it is obvious that they did not have the rights to Biggies music, so instead of having his character perform generic sounding hip hop, they actually took the time to create their own original music, writing and producing songs that incorporate many of his catchphrases and vocal inflections with very similar sounding beats. While this idea sounds cringe-worthy, they actually did such a good job that it sounds like you might actually be listening to authentic unreleased Biggie material. <br/><br/>The casting is impeccable. The character of Tupac is flawlessly executed, much better than in previous attempts such as all eyes on me. Biggie is also very well cast. But what is really amazing is how well some of the smaller characters were treated such as Suge and most especially Tupac's bodyguard Frank Alexander who is portrayed exceptionally well. The detail here can't be overstated as they really capture the mannerisms, speech patterns, physical appearance, build and wardrobe of these four characters to an absolute T. <br/><br/>The one character that seems to take a wide departure from his real life counterpart is that of Detective Russel Poole, upon whom the entire mini-series is based. I assume since he is the main focus, the producers wanted to spice this character up a bit, as when you see actual footage of him he looked and talked nothing like the way he is portrayed here. They give him a little bit of an edge and even an inter-department love interest which seems purely fictitious. To be honest, some of the exchanges between the cops are a bit overdramatized and slightly cliched and somewhat campy. They also portray Poole as having the full support and resources of the LAPD at his disposal, however he mentioned numerous times in real life interviews that he lacked support and was often stonewalled by his department which ultimately led to his investigations being closed inconclusively and his early retirement from the force. Even though this is not authentic, it is helpful because it causes the viewer to think how they might solve the cases if they had full resources and support of the LAPD. <br/><br/>And that ultimately is what makes this series so great, is that it causes the viewer to think. Instead of just regurgitating the often quoted popular narrative of the 'nothing to see here folks' simple gang retaliation story put forth by Greg Kading that has been the main focus of most Biggie and Tupac productions in recent years, Unsolved really lives up to it's title by exploring multiple viewpoints and raising some of the many important unanswered questions about these cases, underscoring the fact that even 20 years later they still remain unsolved.<br/><br/> It even touches on the often overlooked aspects of LAPD corruption and the officers who worked in deathrow records security, some of whom were also named in the infamous Rampart division scandal around the same time. They also touch on head of death row security Reggie Wright, whose father was head of the Compton gang unit before the Compton PD was disbanded for corruption, this angle alone providing enough material for it's own documentary. This is just one example of the many real life details explored in this in depth dramatization of real events. Many potential suspects full actual names are given, so much so, one wonders how some of this passed muster through the legal department. <br/><br/>There are so many interesting parallels and unanswered questions about these highly complex investigations, and Unsolved does a great job of incorporating them without relying on an oversimplified open and shut approach for the sake of wrapping things up in a nice neat package for the viewer. It simply poses the hard questions and allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions. The production values are incredible for a tv miniseries. The reenactment of Tupac's shooting is the most thorough and detailed I have seen, and there have been many attempts over the years. Overall this is an unexpectedly good series that will satisfy even the most hardcore and knowledgeable Tupac and Biggie fans. It also appeals to the non rap fan casual viewer who enjoys good crime investigation in the vein of first 48 or CSI. It's a shame that it will be overlooked by many simply because so many Tupac and biggie features have already been done, but this one is truly unique and rises near the top of the list.",74 out of 76 found this helpful.,9.0,12 March 2018

They'll like this.<br/><br/>First of all I was excited cause my friend advise me to watch this and then I found out Marcc Rose the actor who played Pac in the Straight Outta Compton movie is representing Pac again. I was hyped after this I even forgot about Like Cage Season II. <br/><br/>Secondly I was afraid about conspiracy theories. I didn't knew anything about the investigations and all the suspects around and the possibility that the LAPD was involved in both cases and they tried to deny it. So many views.

It's really based on the true story. <br/><br/>Thirdly I got a Faible for hiphop &amp; investigations ( True Detective ) both combined is really enjoyable for me. I can tell you guys I wasn't a big fan of Josh Duhamel and haven't seen more than 1 movie of him, but his acting was decent. Anyone who critizies the acting in Unsolved is way too harsh. And it's even more ridiculous when anyone argues about the looks of P Diddy &amp; Snoop Dogg representing actors. Suge, Pac &amp; Biggie, Russell Poole and many others were perfect so you can tell the cast was good chosen. <br/><br/>I can really text a lot, but you should watch it if you ever were interested in Biggie's and Pac's homicides.

1957,Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., Surprisingly Good,"I genuinely didn't know what to expect when I decided to give the first episode a look; I thought it'd be a documentary at first.<br/><br/>Of course, I quickly learned otherwise, and was soon gripped. I have no idea at how accurate it was, but simply focusing on it as though the story was pure fiction, I did find it very entertaining. Not everything was perfect, but it is definitely an enjoyable watch.

1966,Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., REALLY GOOD!,"So I'm a middle aged, white lady who only knew about Tupac &amp; Biggie from the news &amp; the papers when they were murdered. No idea about their music/politics, etc. But I like True Crime Stuff, so when this show came up from nowhere in my Netflix feed, I gave it a chance. Really glad I did. I ended up binging it in two days.
Josh Duhamel did an outstanding job here. As did the Jimmy Simpson, who played the tragic earlier detective on the case. The writing was well done &amp; the show really kept me interested, despite my not knowing much before this about the hip/hop world &amp; the gang politics that may have led to the murders.
I took a star off as it jumps around alot, time wise. You really have to watch it to be sure exactly in what time period the episode is at.
But I really liked it &amp; think if you like true crime stuff, you'll like it too. I'd love to see this show continue with some other murders being looked at.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,9.0,26 September 2019
1967,Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., Be Patient &amp; Wacth As It Weaves A Likely Conclusion In A Cluster,"The title is the thing here. Right away it's a disclaimer as in whatever the implied claims and people named there is only speculation as put forth here. But, is this really what this series is saying? After watching, and often being confused by the jumping timeline of the two major later day investigations, I think this film tells what is probably the closest thing to what went down. It basically implies that there were two shooters who between them killed the two rappers reagrdless if Suge Knight was the flashpoint and/or mastermind. The investigations seem to lead to this much and they were hamstrung by a wall of silence among any insiders who weren't talking as well as the stentch of the cross-polination of off-duty policemen working for the rappers. I may be wrong as I had pretty close to zero knowledge of this case prior to watching, but that is what I believe is here. The producers tell who they think are most responsible and as in the title leave it all as unproven.<br/><br/>So, is this drama based on facts? As far as one can cipher from the myriad other docs, movies, and articles it seems highly accurate. Accuracy, however, doesn't make a drama always compelling or entertaining. Furthermore, I'm guessing this particular drama will separate viewers just due to fact it is told back and forth with multiple timelines making it harder to follow if what one seeks is a fact based linear time line of a sensational crime. That said if, like I did, the viewer can just keep watching the confusion settles allowing the pieces to fit given time. This series requires a patient and committed viewer because it wants to tell the story of the investigations more so than simply entertain.<br/><br/>In sum this is the best look into these two most sensational music celebrity related murders. It sums up years of speculation and the related questionable police investigations. It does so with an excellent feel mostly punched home by the well chosen cast. Standouts include Jimmi Simpson as detective detective Russell Poole. Simpson nails the way this case literally took over his life, alienating him from his co-workers and superiors in the department. His dogged pursuit not only resulting in his dismissal from the case and subsequent strange early retirement (6-months before he would achieve a pension), but in the end causing his downward health spiral and death. I can only hope the real Poole wasn't as consumed as the riveting Poole Simpson portrays. Yes, he's that good. And what can you say about Marc Rose other than it is like watching the real Tupac. Bokeem Woodbine is also notable as federal task force assigned officer Daryl Dupree often stealing the scenes he appears in. All in all some care has been given to what the producers are showing us. You just have to work around the jumping timeline and go the full ten episodes. Unsolved cases are often the most frustrating kind for a viewer to watch since there's no payoff. If you stick with this though and see what the story is saying pretty much happened it's believable and credible...not really frustrating if you give it you time and attention. I'm sure it's the closest to the truth and the best of any production that will ever be made regarding this sensational ""Unsolved"" case.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,21 September 2019

1970,Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., Good series about the superstar murders with some ill advised PC pandering,"The unsolved murders of the two rappers Biggie and Tupac are familiar to most rap and non rap fans alike. The series is written in an entertaining way, good script and some good acting. It's strange, some of the acting is good, while in other scenes where they read lines more like porn players , as though there were good actors with a bad director, or vis versa.
Storyline shows an interesting mix of detective work mixed with office politics and family drama. However, it went from a great to a good show with the annoying pandering and PC insertion of kiddy birthday parties and cringe inducing family scenes complete with ubiquitous Dad groveling because he ""works too much"", forced laughter and the ever popular head pat hair scrunching.

1972,Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G., An excellent series,"I was surprised by how good this was.
I'm familiar with the cases, and several of the major players. I was a big fan of 2pac when I was a teenager, and I've appreciated Biggie's music as an adult. I also remember vividly when each of them died. Maybe this helped with my appreciation for this show.
I like the fact it's a one off series, rather than something that will be dragged out for years. 10 40 minute episodes is fine, not too much of a time investment. It also doesn't contain any obvious Netflix politics (except maybe one episode).
And the main police characters are portrayed positively, which is a good thing in my opinion.
This is based on fact, these are real people.
The acting is decent, the actors who played Pac and Biggie deserve a mention, they had a hard task and they did a good job. I will say Biggie comes off looking like a bit of a saint, I'm not sure if he was (that's not a criticism of him, just an observation).
I've read books and watched documentaries on this subject, so there's more out there if you find this an interesting topic.
And, and this isn't a spoiler, I got to find out how Russell Poole's story ended. I was not aware.

Fair enough if it's really not your thing, but they can't please everyone. <br/><br/>I appreciate that it's not historically accurate, but how can it be when it's based on a legend? I don't see why it has to be - it's a drama program, not a documentary. :-) <br/><br/>As for the comment in one post that anyone who enjoyed it must be either ignorant or from the BBC: I am neither.

1974,Robin Hood, Eventually won me over...,"After the first 15 minutes of the BBC's new drama 'Robin Hood', I was pretty much certain that I wouldn't go further than the first episode. Robin (Jonas Armstrong), back from the Crusades in Jerusalem is coming home to Locksley, along with is ex-servant and friend, Much (Sam Troughton). They make a pit-stop on their journey home, to help a blacksmith in return for food... and a roll in the hay with his bosomy daughter who looks like she just stepped out of a Justin Timberlake music video. Riiight. Then came a dodgy back-flip, some ridiculous one-liner and I was thoroughly unimpressed. <br/><br/>I know a thing or two about the legend of Robin Hood. As a kid the Disney version (yep the sing-along with the fox as Robin) was a favorite, and when I was about 6 and went on a trip to England, my family and I made a pit-stop in Nottingham, got a photo by the Robin Hood statue and even went on a little Robin Hood ride and walk through Sherwood forest. I was told the stories of Robin Hood, and have a soft spot for the Robin and Marian romance. I felt obligated to give this new BBC drama a try, since everything Robin Hood once fascinated me as a child. <br/><br/>The first episode, as I said, did not inspire confidence. Jonas Armstrong isn't who I picture as Robin Hood. One review described him as being the 'Orlando Bloom' type, one who ""hovers somewhere between boyhood and manhood"" (Daily Express, September 9, 2006). I had seen Armstrong in the fourth season of 'Teachers' and was not terribly taken by him. But in 'Robin Hood', Armstrong is initially hard to swallow as the hooded crusader, but this isn't entirely his fault. Robin initially comes across as a cocky, womanizing lad with a hefty ego, and it wasn't until about the third episode that I actually started to warm to him. What made sure I came back to watch the second, third and eventually entire series of this show was Lucy Griffiths as Maid Marian and Keith Allen as the deliciously ruthless Sheriff of Nottingham. <br/><br/>Newcomer, 19 year-old Lucy Griffith's Marian has dropped the 'maid' and follows the lead of 21st century female TV heroines such as Buffy, Veronica Mars and Rose Tyler... which isn't surprising, the show could not have worked with a wimpy and weak Marian. Griffiths and Armstrong do have a great chemistry as well, despite the fact that the dialogue between Marian and Robin is sometimes corny (""kiss it better?"") there is a spark, and that's enough to keep the Marian/Robin romance interesting for me. Even more so is the fact that in this updated version, Marian does not welcome Robin home with open arms. He left her 5 years ago to fight for glory and King Richard in the Holy lands, and she is still feeling the sting of his desertion. <br/><br/>Keith Allen plays a fantastically villainous Sheriff, who sometimes reminds me of Tim Curry, and is always entertaining. Richard Armitage plays Guy of Gisborne, the Sheriff's right hand man and the new lord of Robin's Locksley manor. To top it off, Gisborne is in tough pursuit of Marian, adding an extra layer of intensity to his dueling with Robin.<br/><br/>This show has been commissioned partly due to the huge success of the resurrected 'Doctor Who', and while it isn't quite on-par with the genius of Russell T. Davies's show, 'Robin Hood' is worth a try. At times the production value leaves you wanting, the stunts can be laughable and the acting a little wooden. It isn't really until the seventh episode ""Brothers in Arms"" that things really start to pick up with the drama and story lines, and from seven onwards it is a brilliant roller-coaster ride sure to make the previous six lack-luster episodes worth the watch.",86 out of 118 found this helpful.,7.0,31 December 2006

I stuck with it and with each passing week it got better and better. Now, I'm hooked. It's great entertainment. People who say that it is not historically correct are just being picky. Not many people care whether it is correct or not. As long as it is good drama and entertaining then it will be watched. Robin Hood has all of those things. Brilliant drama, occasionally funny and has got a hint of romance running through it. The actors, though not widely known are great and Robin Hood gets better as each week passes.

1976,Robin Hood, Absolutely Brilliant,"In my opinion, out of the vast majority of the Robin Hoods out there, this is by far the best. It is witty, enjoyable and fast paced. Its suitable for all ages hence the 7pm airing. The casting is just right, Robin is supposed to be young, he has just returned from the crusades, Jonas Armstrong is perfectly suited. Marian (played by Lucy Griffiths) is the model woman, she stands up for what she thinks is right and isn't afraid to put herself in the line of fire so to speak. The sheriff is suitably horrid and Robin is perfect as the young, charming and cheeky rebel.

Great verbal sparring between Robin and the Sheriff and a Robin and Marian. The sets were amazing, Locksley a bit sterile but the overall look was good. Did exactly what it said on the tin for me and what I expected for a programme in that time slot.

1978,Robin Hood, Continues its decline,"Season 1 was an enjoyable romp once it got the gang assembled, and Season 2 had an energetic Empire Strikes Back quality, but we're halfway through Season 3 and it's a turkey. New lackluster characters are being introduced into the gang, taking the focus off the old characters we actually like. The writers seem to have lost the thread of the story. At the end of Season 2 they set the audience up for a big showdown, but they deflated the tension in the very first episode. There are continuity issues every episode, such as, Why does Gisborne suddenly have a sister when he spent the first season moping about having no family? Did Gisborne's soldiers get eaten? Prince John was supposed to be angry about his tax money, but when Gisborne returns, it's to kill Robin Hood, not to squeeze money from the sheriff. With a few exceptions, most of the scripts feel as if they were hastily sketched out, without much care toward development of character or continuity. It's a shame.<br/><br/>The one exception to the lackluster season is Toby Stephens as Prince John. He's the perfect combination of insecurity, viciousness, and preening pomposity. He's very funny.",17 out of 22 found this helpful.,7.0,26 April 2009
1979,Robin Hood, This isn't about the twelfth century. It's about Britain now!,"Jonas Armstrong's Hood is possibly the smuggest character I've ever seen on TV drama. Makes me want to root for the sheriff except he's an equally tedious pantomine villain. Richard Armitage who plays Gisborne would have made a far better Hood, both physically and charisma wise. This show also takes a cue from the mediocre Herecules the Legendary Journeys with lukewarm comedy provided by boring buffoon like sidekicks. The biggest difference between this and the mid eighties series Robin of Sherwood is the twenty odd year time gap between them, because Britain has changed enormously in that time. I'm talking about the story lines not the lavishness/ special effects. In 1984 it was still OK to celebrate the indigenous British Saxon/ Celtc culture so you had episodes about the Swords of Weiland( the Mythical Saxon smith) and Herne the Hunter ( from Celtic myth) to the background of a heavily Celtic mystical soundtrack. It was gritty and serious. Fast forward twenty years and you've got Robin quoting the Koran, the English/ Welsh longbow takes a backseat to the 'Saracen' bow and multicultural Britain appears to be up and running in the twelfth century.Also the crusades being snidely linked by the script to the Iraq war. The crusades were a bad thing according to this show which English kids will watch. There's no show telling them that 400 years ago ships from the North African caliphate were raiding British coastal towns for slaves. No shows about the Muslim crusades in Spain and South west Europe. This is brainwashing. If they wanted a happy clappy series which all cultures in Britain can relate to, why not set it in a fantasy world instead of rewriting history.",46 out of 71 found this helpful.,1.0,22 March 2008
1980,Robin Hood, I thought it was great,"finally something to fill the gap left by 'Doctor Who'. A quirky, enjoyable, funny program which had me on the edge of my seat. This is what we've been waiting for, from the BBC, after such shows as 'Doctor Who' and 'Pride &amp; Prejudice'. The characters were already well structured even after the first episode. Jonas Armstrong is a great choice for Robin Hood, as he is a 'bad boy'. With his rugged features and lovely accent, he really makes the character of Robin come alive. Along with the other actors and actresses, he really makes the legend reality. A must-see for any fans of Action/Comedy and maybe romantics. It combines lots of genres to make it appeal to everyone.

1981,Robin Hood," Come on BBC, you can do better!","Recently the BBC has been delivering some much improved family drama and Robin Hood promised to be the latest blockbusting instalment. having missed the first series, I tuned in to see what all the hype was about but came away feeling very disappointed.<br/><br/>I'm all for using a bit of artistic licence in the name of entertainment but some of the detail, acting and direction leaves much to be desired. For example, how can Robin shoot an arrow to free the ropes on a tied up maiden if her wrists are pointing away from him on the other side of a big wooden post? And how is it that none of the sheriff's guards managed to spot the ample bosom on Maid Marion when she was in disguise and insisted on referring to her as a man? <br/><br/>Overall, the script was quite weak, much of the acting quite stiff, the costumes lacking and many of the key characters seemed to have been miscast. I just couldn't get on with the actress playing Maid Marion at all.<br/><br/>I never thought I'd hear myself say this but even Kevin Costner's mediocre version of the myth of Robin Hood was more believable and much more enjoyable.

There is nothing that rings true about any of it. There is a distinct feeling of end-of-the-pier pantomime about the entire venture. Why is Friar Tuck black now? (incidentally before the PC brigade jump all over me, I am black and think this is political correctness taken too far). This series is a lot of things but it is definitely not the Robin Hood story. I have no problem with artistic licence but whatever is done with it has to 1.be good and 2. has to work. The actors say their lines competently enough but I feel unconvinced by any of them.

1986,Robin Hood, Robin Hood - the Grunge Version,"When I saw that a new series of Robin Hood was coming to Prime TV, and that it was British, I found myself looking forward to seeing it, having fond memories of the 1980s series with its romance and mysticism.<br/><br/>The new series has disappointed me thus far (five episodes so far), despite having the Sheriff of Nottingham played by the deliciously OTT Keith Allen. Young Robin of Locksley (Jonas Armstrong), freshly returned from the Holy Land, looks as though he'd be more at home in Trainspotting than in Locksley Hall, his ancestral home  just as well, really, since it's been commandeered by Sir Guy of Gisborne in his absence. Guy (Richard Armitage) is, despite being one of the baddies, by far most attractive thing in the show  and he really can act.<br/><br/>Purely as an action adventure, it's not too bad, but there's a great deal in it to deplore.<br/><br/>The costuming, for a start. It's not as though, with the resources available to them, it would have been at all difficult to clothe the cast appropriately for England in the time of King Richard Coeur de Lion. But what do we get? Outlaws dressed like 21st-century street kids, complete with hooded jackets (and I could swear one of them was wearing a machine-sewn, knit-fabric tunic!), a Sheriff who dresses in what look like black polo jerseys and full-length coats with fur collars (a bit of bling and he could just about pass for a gangland pimp), and a Marian who looks as though she buys her clothes in some Seventies-revival boutique.<br/><br/>The dialogue is an uncomfortable mish-mash of stilted pseudo 'Olde Englishe' and gratingly modern expressions, and they've taken gross liberties with the story itself. Although I suppose it's possible that Friar Tuck might turn up at some stage in the proceedings, he's certainly missing so far. Little John seems to have been a victim of downsizing, and Marian comes across as the sort of sharp-tongued harridan who'd be more at home in Eastenders or Emmerdale. And I can't help but wonder why she spends so much time hanging around with the Sheriff and Sir Guy, rather than at home with her widowed father - especially as she (quite rightly!) despises both of them  or even under the greenwood tree with Robin and the boys, as in tales of yore. The makers of the series really don't seem to have thought things through at all.<br/><br/>The legend of Robin Hood, with its romance and adventure, its chivalry and championing of the common man, has well and truly stood the test of centuries, but this latest retelling might just manage to sink it. Presumably its makers wanted to present the tales afresh for today's young television viewer by morphing it into some sort of post-modern grunge drama.

We do not kill? what on earth, Robin Hood was a crusader of course he dam well killed. Another thing is why does he use Saracen swords and a bow? where is his English longbow gone, the thing which he most resembles, why has he got a composite bow?. All the questions possibly make this program one of the worst ever made by the BBC, which are extremely poor considering we have to pay TV licence.<br/><br/>Well overall this is not Robin Hood, because hardly any of it resembles anything to do with it.

1988,Robin Hood, Dumb but Strangely Entertaining,"Looking back, I don't know how I got through the entire series. I can only guess that the fact that it was Robin Hood kept me interested. Though this show is undoubtedly better than Kevin Costner's silly Prince of Thieves, the problems with this series are many and have been stated before: --Jonas Armstrong is hardly that. There's no way this guy could string a Saracen bow, let alone fire it properly. --Just about the middle 9 episodes or so are basically ""someone benevolent is captured by the Sheriff of Nottingham, Robin and his men are in a moral quandary, Robin enters Nottingham castle, saves the victim. Huzzah."" It gets old seeing Robin easily enter the castle again and again. --Ok, I understand that this is family entertainment and whatnot, but please, God, let some more people die, or change the script so deaths would never be a real possibility. This is the Middle Ages. The Sheriff should have been dead by episode 4 or 5. Didn't Robin swear to harm him if he harmed more people? Well? --Script and costumes . ..awful. These people do not know the Middle Ages. --Finally, the political correctness and the desperate attempts to relate Robin's struggles to Iraq, Guantanamo, or other modern issues are overt and dumb. All in all, I was looking for some realism, or at least original and witty scripts, instead of corny lines, and predictable endings with the Sheriff shaking his fist and yelling after his inefficient, elaborate plot to capture Robin fails. I'll probably watch the 2nd season though . . ..",18 out of 28 found this helpful.,3.0,17 June 2007
1989,Robin Hood, special effects for idiots,"What's with this Discovery-Channel-doco-show-thing where subtitles are now announced with a sort of scud-rocket kind of noise and then shot onto the screen.<br/><br/>I can't figure if it is because the audience is being played to be complete idiots - 'we think you won't notice there is a sign up on the screen unless we make A LOT of noise as well' - or whether it is just that special effect - 'hey, we can make a loud vulgar offensive noise AT THE SAME time as putting a subtitle up on the screen. WOW, we gotta do that'.<br/><br/>In fact one suspects the subtitles, (they inform us that there has been a chance of scene, like we couldn't figure that out for ourselves) are only there in order to permit the scud-missile sound effects which go with them.<br/><br/>And this special effect just about sums up the whole show.

1990,Robin Hood, Saturday night fun,This is perfect Saturday night viewing. Don't expect complicated plots and subtext. It is pure entertainment. Goodies wear white (or green in this case) and the baddies wear black. It is as simple as that. The costumes are a bit modern the dialogue also is more in the present day. <br/><br/>But the best bit that makes it worth watching is Kieth Allens Sheriff of Nottingham. He is pure am dram evil. An amoral creature who would turn over his own mother. the supporting cast are great and Jonas Armstrong puts in a great cocky performance for an unknown actor.<br/><br/>The back ground characters are a bit week but this is probably more due to the fact there grasp of English is limited as the series is filmed in Hungary,29 out of 51 found this helpful.,7.0,6 December 2006
1991,Robin Hood, The Worst Ever Robin Hood.,"Got to hand it to the BBC, take a well loved folk hero, with a cinematic pedigree of nearly a hundred years and then create the most awful version of the legend (and yes I am including the Noooo Adventures of Robin Hood). Must have taken some incredible talent to do that.<br/><br/>This show does not know what it wants to be. The script writers keep banging on about the Third Crusade, Pope Gregory (a really obscure reference) and the fact that it is 1192. However, the producers obviously never told that to the costume department, who thought they were designing for a very camp Flash Gordon TV show. I don't expect Kingdom of Heaven but that is a better reference than Ming the Merciless and Prince Baron.<br/><br/>It is hard to decide whether the casting is poor or that the scripts make the actors look bad. There is a sheriff who, if he twirls his moustache any more must kidnap Marian and tie her to some railway tracks. Gisbourne is good even though the make up department try to make him look like a reject from Siouxie and the Banshees. Robin has the mingiest looking beard in history, either shave it or grow it mate. Marian always looks scared when she is reciting her lines, yet she is supposed to be the brave Nightrider (cough, spin off series), eat your heart out Clark Kent. Robin now gets a new sidekick Much, who is just plain annoying and gay (in the Chris Moyles sense). The rest of his crew are bland and nondescript and just mumble their lines.<br/><br/>But the most appalling aspect of the series is the Political Correctness. The BBC is having a joke, just because you have to tick boxes on your diversity questioners, doesn't mean you can add rubbish characters and totally miscast parts. The most cynical example of this is the non gender specific Djaq, the man with a fanny, who talks like Tarzan, basically the Scrappy Doo/Adric of Sherwood forest. What next King Richard as an Australian Aborigine (wouldn't put it passed them)? <br/><br/>The BBC billed this version as appealing to 'a sophisticated contemporary audience' and that the 'producers have gone as far as they can to give the series an authentic late 12th century feel'. They must believe that the public are ill educated and ignorant.<br/><br/>To those who gave this series a good reviews either: <br/><br/>You have never been to the cinema, owned a DVD and actually believe that there be little people living inside the magical television.<br/><br/>Or you work for the BBC - the technical term for this is seeding.",29 out of 51 found this helpful.,2.0,19 November 2006
1992,Robin Hood, Kill off the Sheriff and move on!,"Annoying is how I would rate this show. The production values aren't great (I've seen some villages walking around in polo shirts), and the acting isn't top notch, but the most irritating aspect of this show is the stagnant plot. The Sheriff is the typical one dimensional evil character, killing off a few innocent villagers each episode. Yet Robin Hood refuses to kill him because ""Prince John will massacre everyone."" Ha! This was a satisfactory explanation for the first episode, but to persist this rubbish throughout the first two seasons is disrespectful to the viewers. I sometimes feel like I'm watching a cartoon, where everything returns to normal by the next episode. Move the plot forward.

1994,Robin Hood," It's fast, it's slick, but it's no better than a low budget cable show","This is a TV production with very high production values except where it counts: the script.<br/><br/>Robin Hood's message used to be rob from the rich and give to the poor. Not this version, it's all about the Crusades. It's firmly set in 1194AD makes numerous historical references to 1194AD but regularly makes it relevant to 2006AD in all moral respects. This is made worse by the fact that not one of the script writers seems to know about the medieval period and worse, in an effort to make this pertinent, the show tries to link in what miniscule knowledge they do know with the war in Iraq. This clumsy message is not helped by an effort to avoid difficult theological early evening discussions by wiping nearly all references to Christianity. This show seems to have replaced the word ""Christianity"" with ""Rome"". Therefore it's easy for all the characters to dismiss the Crusades as ""Romes war"". This appears to be the main reason why there is no Friar Tuck and seems doubly odd when the Koran is quoted by Robin and multiple Muslim characters are introduced. In fact in this version, Robin Hood uses a ""Saracen bow"", a curvy ""Saracen sword"" and eventually manages to get ""Saracen Bows"" for the rest of his Merry Men because they offer some sort of unspecified technological advantage. This, coupled with the shows love of attributing any scientific break though to Saracens, including at one point ""Greek Fire"" just reeks of, and I really hate this phrase, true Political Correctness Gone Mad. What happened to ""rob from the rich and give to the poor""?<br/><br/>Every week Robin and his Merry Men manage to stretch reality by gaining entry into Nottingham Castle via convenient hatches, holes and ladders and every one of the soldiers left guarding the place seem to go down after one punch. The costumes are a mish-mash of all sorts of historical paraphernalia which means despite being set in 1194AD, expect to see waistcoats, fedora hats, cardigans and trench coats. Also, Robin seems to be channelling Legolas the Elf from Lord of the Rings but before you get your hopes up expect what little realism there is to go out of the window and see arrows land like computer generated bullets. Now here's the shows major criticism: It's very, very poorly written. Each show offers one major plot hole which renders each episode ridiculous. Robin, with his God like bow skills could kill the sheriff in episode 1. He says he doesn't want to kill anyone after the Crusades and yet he frequently does without batting an eyelid. The sheriff continues to be immune which makes me think this show really is for children.<br/><br/>If the IMDb goofs section opens up expect to swamped, there are some true howlers (how about a character who buys stuff from the peasants and consequently gets robbed by Robin  he's public enemy number one during one show. Robin, tell the peasants not to sell their stuff in the first place!!!) It used to be that BBC drama productions were low budget but well written, this show seems to have reversed that. It's quick, it's glossy, it looks the business but really it's so rubbish expect it to be either a cult classic or quickly forgotten.",29 out of 53 found this helpful.,1.0,4 January 2007
1995,Robin Hood, Extremely Disappointing,"Firstly, this seems to be a show that everyone either loves or hates. I am definitely one of the latter people. I would normally just turn over and watch something else, but I am angry how the licence fee money has been wasted yet again on a well below par TV series. I was looking forward to it, but when even the BBC's own listing magazine gave it a lukewarm preview the alarm bells began to ring, and after watching several episodes to give it a chance enough is enough.<br/><br/>One of the main problems of this show is the poor casting. I am far from against using unknown actors, but when they are as bad at acting as this it beggars belief. Charisma-free Jonas Armstrong is woefully miscast as Robin Hood. Are we really expected to believe he has spent five years hard campaigning in the Holy Land? Despite proclamations from the BBC about the fight training it is clear from the camera angles and the constant slow motion that they barely know one end of a sword from the other. It is also apparent that Robin uses a stunt double for most if not all horse riding, so why was he chosen? He looks more the sort of person who goes around stealing hub caps and car stereos than being the noble outlaw he is usually portrayed as. As for the rest of the cast, only Keith Allen comes anywhere near to the mark. Richard Armitage as Guy of Gisburne looks like a motorcycle courier, and has all the menace of one. Maid Marian has so much make-up on I thought at first she had two black eyes. Much is just a poor version of Sam Gamgee from Lord of the Rings and the merry men show worse acting ability than the average school play, not helped by the cringe worthy script. <br/><br/>Perhaps it does make a good kids show, but in which case why isn't it put on the CBeebies channel and why does it have to be so childish? The writers seem to have their own political agenda, and are intent on forcing it down our throat, with no real attempt made to disguise this fact. They seem to have run out of story ideas already after only a few episodes, with one of Robin's men being captured virtually every week. This programme is very much like the US TV series Hercules or even Xena Warrior Princess, with the wobbly dialogue, acting and special effects except that the BBC probably spent far more per episode. Perhaps this was aimed at the American market like most of the BBC programming seems to be these days, forgetting they are funded by the British public. <br/><br/>Overall this adaption has none of the charm of the classic Richard Greene version, which even allowing for inflation probably cost about as much per 39 episode series as one episode of this drivel. Indeed it is hard to see where the money has been spent. The costumes are hardly authentic, the same few sets are used every week, and the extras are few indeed for a town the size of Nottingham. I have seen many different versions of the classic tale and I have to say this is the worst. Even the ever-wooden Kevin Costner was better than this.<br/><br/>Only the music is any good which is why I gave it more than 1/10. Even that sounds as if it has been copied from Superman.",26 out of 47 found this helpful.,,30 October 2006
1996,Robin Hood, Tedium exemplified,"I don't mind historical inaccuracy or updating of shows, but there should be some point to changing around stories and some thought to it as well; this one just alters things, chucks them on the screen and then hopes they will make sense. I have a hard time believing anyone would enjoy this: it's neither action packed, well-written, well-acted (with a couple of exceptions), nor fun to watch.<br/><br/>Robin's 'acting' is appalling and worst of all he has zero charisma: you can't imagine people following him to the nearest tavern for a pint of whatever ale they drank in ye olde Englande, let alone into the woods to live a life of outlawery. Marion has been reduced to a shrew who can only berate Robin while doing little of use due to her dear old dad, who only seems to exist to render her character particularly useless. The only one with charisma is Guy of Gisborne and while I love a good villain, it is a bit of a problem for a show called 'Robin Hood' when Guy is more interesting than Robin.<br/><br/>If they can't write they should at least throw more action on the screen to ensure we don't have to hear their excruciating dialogue.

1999,Mr. Show with Bob and David, Comedy has never been so funny,"The comparison to Monty Python is inevitable (both Bob Odenkirk and David Cross have acknowledged their debt to their predecessor in interviews), but make no mistake: ""Mr. Show with Bob &amp; David"" is refreshingly original and brilliantly funny. There have been so many hilarious moments on the show that it would be impossible for me to name a particular favorite. The sketches are so finely crafted that even when the jokes fall flat (which is extremely rare), they're still quite engrossing (""Coupon: The Movie"" is an example). I've been watching the show faithfully since its second season and each new episode only leaves me wanting more. The show's strong ensemble cast  featuring John Ennis, Jill Talley, Tom Kenny and especially Jay Johnston are part of what makes the show work so well.<br/><br/>Being on HBO, they're pretty much able to do what they please, but while there is plenty of profanity (not an issue for me at all), they are in no way reliant upon cussing for laughs. In fact, one of the more memorable sketches involved a take-off of ""Goodfellas"" being edited for television in which the cuss words were replaced with such phrases as ""mother-father"" and ""Chinese dentist"".<br/><br/>HBO deserves to be praised for recognizing the talent of Bob &amp; David and keeping the show on the air in spite of its small - albeit fiercely loyal - number of viewers.<br/><br/>The next time HBO airs a ""Mr. Show"" marathon, don't just watch it, tape it!",13 out of 13 found this helpful.,,23 May 1999

I now have seen all four seasons thanks to broadband internet (albeit at reduced quality). <br/><br/>Mr. Show is inventive and original but I found it wasn't quite as funny as the reviews claimed. Partly this is due to the humour being very late 90's and U.S. based; for example, if two infomercials, one called ""Amazing Discoveries"" and another (one or two) featuring an enthusiastic British presenter weren't on Australian late night TV in the late 90's, a sketch parodying these two would have gone completely over my head. Probably something like 50% of the show's humour refers to things only observant U.S. TV watchers of the late 90's would be aware of. But nonetheless Mr. Show did have some quite funny or memorable moments in each episode, amongst a lot more weird or chin-scratching ones. <br/><br/>The show kept me coming back for more, although it's probably not best to watch all the episodes in a short space of time. The performances are good all around, one notable feature being the commitment of all the cast members to the material. The tangential nature of the sketches keeps them from being drawn out or overstaying their welcome, and provides a more interesting way of going from sketch to sketch compared to other sketch shows (after reading other reviews I am now aware this was borrowed from Monty Python).<br/><br/>I think Mr. Show's strongest point is it has material that would never be seen on regular network television and despite being aimed at a narrow audience, is well worth watching.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,,11 February 2007

2015,Mr. Show with Bob and David, The most original sketch show ever,"And also, in my opinion, the funniest. Mr. Show cannot accurately be described to someone who has not seen it, but here goes; the show is a constant stream of ideas, one of which from each skit will bring you to the next. Sometimes, it is a character that shows up, sometimes it is just some vague statement that is used. The skits themselves are hilarious, very deviant (think Python), and often feature Bob and David in multiple roles. This show would be a hit for anyone who likes off-the-wall stuff like Shakes the Clown or Strangers with Candy. Love, Jason",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,12 July 2002
2016,Mr. Show with Bob and David, The funniest sketch show ever?,"It may be too early to tell.  Monty Python was a lot zanier, SCTV was a lot more deliberate and thoughtful, Kids in the Hall was more random (maybe). But I don't think I've ever laughed as hard a sketch show as i have at practically every episode of Mr. Show with Bob and David.  SNL and Mad TV? Please.. not even close.  Even the Ben Stiller Show which seemed so fresh and new in it's brief run seems kind of stale when compared with Mr. Show.<br/><br/>
Mr. Show is simply a totally different brand of humor than you will get anywhere else.  Yes, they do swear, but the swearing is always in the service of the comedy (it isn't South Park).  And it is *smart* comedy. They really go all out to be funny, and rarely does a joke fall flat.  And if it does, they move on very quickly to extend the uninterrupted half hour of insanity. (To give an example, a commercial for ""Rap: The Musical"" ... ""It's all the fun of rap, without all that rap!"")  I wish HBO would put it on every night, but then I might not miss it as much.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,,16 September 1999
2017,Mr. Show with Bob and David, some of the most clever and intelligent comedy to date,"I love this show. It's a shame so many people can't find the humor in it because it is a very clever show. If you like to USE YOUR BRAIN, especially with comedy, (i.e. Bill Hicks, Monty Python, arrested development) then this show is for you. I recommend it to those that don't die with laughter from the blue collar comedy group. They make fun of everyone and everything. morning shows, infomercials, the Beatles, rappers, Jesus Christ superstar, customs agency. they also have just all 'round funny sketches like the gay Nostradamus and wicked scepter. they make fun of the east/west coast rap wars but with ventriloquists, they make fun of televangelists and the show cops.

2018,Mr. Show with Bob and David, Funny but too close to the Flying Circus to be original...,"Yes there are some really funny characters and performances, but this is not an original format.  In the first season there are jokes that are directly lifted (they should have paid royalties) from Monty Python and the format where each skit leads in to the next was also device Python used. Personally, I find Mr. Show funny and amusing but fells like a combination of Greater Tuna and SNL heavily peppered with swearing.  Now if they had also borrowed from Python their dicipline to end a skit when it becomes old, it would be great, but often times (like SNL) the skits continue long after the joke is beaten into the ground and is simply working to fill time. Odenkirk can be briliant, but David Cross is the best thing in this show and makes it worth while viewing.",2 out of 4 found this helpful.,,6 September 2003

Bob is an eccentric genius (who is also a magician!)... he can't untangle leashes or string up Christmas lights but he created a robot dog that understands humans and speaks to animals, and he created the collars that amazingly hold everything the Puppies need on their adventures.

2070,The Trial, Looking forward to a Season 2.,"This Italian noir is crafted with the utmost finesse. Set against the palatial Renaissance backdrop of Mantova-a city still relatively untouched by tourists-Il Processo takes us on a ride through the Italian judiciary system without bogging us down in bureaucracy, detail and Amanda Knox.<br/><br/>A refreshing change from Neopolitan, mafia-led dramas, and all the cringe set in Venice and Rome, Il Processo breathes a breath of fresh air into Italy's TV exports. It steers clear of the path to pretentiousness (from which many of its contemporaries never return), instead prioritising character development and a slow-burning sense of unease over a quick, intense thrill, maintaining intrigue until the end.<br/><br/>Elena, the enigmatic main character-our new best friend and elusive partner in crime-solving-is expertly cast. True to her surname, the prosecutor wages a war against an increasingly desperate defendant and, in the process, lets us question her own motives. The director never leads us down the garden path, instead giving us objectivity with which we come to our own, likely erroneous, conclusions.<br/><br/>Saying bye to Vittoria Puccini's Elena in the sunset-based finale (a solitary dose of corniness to sign off an exceptional series) is genuinely quite sad.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,20 August 2020
2071,The Trial, A good series. Better than I expected.,"I started watching The Trial (Il Processo) out of curiosity because I was born in Mantova, the city where the story takes place. 30 minutes into the first episode I actually started buying into the story and I binge-watched the remaining episodes in just two days.
The plot is well written. There seem to be a few pitfalls here and there, a couple of episodes in the second half could have been avoided altogether, but I never lost interest in the story.
I must give particular credit to either the montage or the director for a specific reason: there are moment in a few episodes where the camera lingers on some details that ""give away"" a clue to what is about to come. While some people may think that they worked out everything and they ""saw it coming"", I believe that the technique is used intentionally to give the viewer the feeling to be actively taking part in solving the case.<br/><br/>A very good watch. I don't know if there will be a second season, I doubt so, but if they'll make it I'll be happy to watch it.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,7 June 2020

As the case gets deeper they realize they are digging deeper into something bigger than they thought. The prosecutor Elena, finds herself going deep into this case and will not leave it until she finds out who murdered Angelica. The lawyer of the defendant Ruggero is just as eager to prove his client is innocent and goes head on with elena, giving everything he has to prove it. It is very entertaining to see the thought process of both Elena and Rugerro, two very intelligent people who are good at what they do. The series is very intriguing and keeps you on edge wanting to see more. You see how everyone bends the rules for this case and what they give up for it.

2080,The Trial, No empathy possible for main character,"The angst that drives characters to take certain actions frequently helps entertain we viewers of television. It would certainly be difficult to maintain a viewing audience while depicting people going about a typical normal day doing everyday unexciting activities. Even ""reality shows"" do not do that. Main characters can and do exist in popular fiction without being good, right, noble, perfect, etc., but at some point, they must be worthy of empathy. There does come a time on occasion when the main character exceeds a certain level of questionable behavior and becomes another antagonist. That happened to me in this series called ""The Trial"" on Netflix. At some point, I turned against the main character who was the prosecutor. At that point, I started to hope she would lose her case. I started feeling empathy for the accused murderer to the point of hoping for her acquittal. (Please excuse any use of improper legal terms as I am not a lawyer in the USA or Italy.) Even near the end of season one where it was shown that the accused had actually pushed the victim to the ground and stomped her in the face with her high heeled shoe penetrating her eye and brain killing her, I still felt more for the killer than the prosecutor. It didn't help that the 17-year-old victim had accomplished her own lack of empathy by that time for her prostitution, pregnancy, attempted and accomplished destruction of a person and their marriage. The only two people I cared for at all in this show were the accused murderer and the husband of the main character and I was not that fond of them. For one thing, he was a bit too forgiving of his wife.<br/><br/>The main character is a terrible person. She lied through omission to her good and devoted husband of several years. She never told him of her youthful relationship that produced a daughter that was given up for adoption. She ""ghosted"" her husband when they had an amicable decision to move to New York and start a new life together. She just didn't show up and left him ""looking at an empty seat"" per the husband. She offered no excuse to him as to why she couldn't leave (when the victim turned out to be the daughter she had given away 17 years ago.) Again she lied through omission. She took the case which was stupid for something that would most likely be brought up eventually in the course of a trial (and it did.) A year later when her husband returned, he wanted to salvage their marriage which she agrees to do with a seldom seen smile. They then disappeared into his room to consummate their new-found relationship and start to work on having that child. Within a day she was in the bed of her old lover trashing that agreement and muddying the gene pool of any child that might be (and would be) conceived. She had to realize the importance of fidelity to her husband when trying to make a bay but apparently did not care. Within a day he had read the news coverage and seen pictures of her tryst. (Her opposition had her followed.) As he is leaving her, she for the very 1st time tells him of the daughter and the man she was photographed with being the father of that child, but it was much too late for him to hear that news. He left her of course. Good for him.<br/><br/>Much later during their official visit with lawyers to divorce, he noticed her hyperventilating. He had kind words for her in an effort to help. She offered no apology, accounting or explanation of her total disrespect for him for the previous year. She only said that she ""had been having panic attacks since he left"" placing blame on him for her current state. I again have no empathy for this awful person.<br/><br/>In the last episode of season 1 when she is dining with her father, she is so flippant about not knowing who is the father of her child. Her assessment of the despicable behavior of the last year is that it is not the ideal situation and she has no plans to tell the men.<br/><br/>
The plot holes do not help. Anyone who has spent a few years of their life in front of television identified the murder weapon during the 1st episode. It is so obvious that I thought for the longest time that it must be a ""Red Herring."" If two women are outside of a very public gathering and it is believed that one of them murdered the other by crushing something through her eye and into the brain of the other, what weapon did she have on her person at a party that would accomplish this goal? In an early scene, the assumed murderer is on-screen and the 1st thing she is asking her lawyer is the location of her ""lucky shoes"" that she was wearing. Why on Earth would the writer of this series spend the eternity of an entire minute of a TV show talking about the defendant's high heeled shoes if they were not important? Why would it not occur to this supposedly brilliant prosecutor or anyone else on her staff to not consider the shoes? Maybe Italian law schools should consider making the Perry Mason TV series a part of their curriculum. Check the shoes for blood sometime prior to her being acquitted! It is not rocket science.<br/><br/>
A timestamped receipt found by the prosecutor got the murderer acquitted. Timestamps are only as accurate as the people running the equipment. Why would she or anyone she gave the receipt to assume the timestamp on a receipt is accurate? Particularly since it was a year old! Anyone would assume this information needed to be verified. Could you even trust it from a year ago! This was so ridiculous.<br/><br/>
Lastly, in the final minutes of the final episode, she has found new evidence that could make a successful appeal for a new trial. She takes this evidence to the defense attorney rather than to her superiors. Instead of proper channels, she goes to the guy who got the defendant acquitted. This guy has been sleeping with his client since the acquittal. He is the guy who had her followed and had pictures taken and then published which ruined her marriage. He is the guy who illegally tested her DNA to see if she was the victim's mother. She may lose her license to practice on that issue alone. Now she is basically hiding evidence. Why would she do this? Why would she seek out this guy? The only reason I can think of is that since her husband left her and she broke up with the other guy, she must just be looking for Mr. Right. She was getting a bit flirty with him as the credits rolled. The poor guy doesn't know she is pregnant.<br/><br/>I hope there is no season two. As of the end of season one, she has lost the case, lost her husband, is suspended from her job, and may lose her license. A perfect ending to me!",4 out of 7 found this helpful.,4.0,23 July 2020

It has a timeline, a plot, and a multiverse of several different timelines and universes within the show's canon.<br/><br/>Why take out Wildmutt, a classic alien that has been there since the beginning, and replace him with a bootleg version of Water Hazard from Ultimate Alien?

Like take for example, Gwen. You know in the original Gwen and Ben's relationship didn't start off sunshine and flowers; but for some odd reason they made Gwen in the reboot seem too much of a doormat towards Ben? It's boring to see them just agreeing with each other without really seeing how their relationship mend from being two bickering cousins to good friends. <br/><br/>Then finally... the lazy design.

And I understand that Ben 10 has had a few reboots before (see my review on Omniverse) but this is an insult. Possibly worse than Omniverse.<br/><br/>Actually I can't compare it to Omniverse, because that at least has an original story-line, new likable characters and in some cases, acceptable animation. This is no excuse. Not only is this another reboot, but it's just a complete rehash of the original plot with maybe one or two new aliens thrown in. As if that's a good distraction...<br/><br/>This is just another bad reboot by Cartoon Network, which is not that surprising, that some how got lower scores than the two reboot shows before it.

2094,Ben 10, Umm... OK? Is CN running out of ideas or something?,"2 words that comes to my mind whenever I think of this show are ""Sigh"" and ""Hopeless"". I mean really is this the best they could come up with at Cartoon Network? While I have to admit that I wouldn't consider myself a big fan of the Original Ben 10 series, I thought it was decent in the beginning but later on became repetitive and a bit boring afterwards. Plus I didn't care so much for the other continuing series that came after either but when I found out about this reboot I thought; ""Again another Ben 10 series?""<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong I gave it a chance but with all honesty I can say that this is in my opinion one of the worst reboots I've ever seen. But just how bad is it? Is it ""Uncle Grandpa"" bad or ""Teen Titans Go!"" bad? I'd say it's sort of a combination of both, you'll have to excuse my bad joke but it's what I feel for this show in a nutshell. What happened? The show looks like a complete dumbed-down version of the original itself with childish designs, lame and uninspiring humor, lame stories with a cheesy moral at the end (I honestly think even Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog had better and clever morals than what this show has), simpler animation and overall even more childish and kind of more babyish than the original cartoon.<br/><br/>This reboot doesn't even bother to care about character development and story continuity it's just for the lame humor and the action which doesn't even help to save the badness of this unnecessary mess. Every episode is always the same where they can be summed up in these simple ways: 1. Our heroes goes on an activity. 2. Crazy things happen and it's up to Ben and Gwen yeah you guessed it. 3. Weird but uninteresting conflicts occur to our heroes. 4. Villain returns and Ben always finds a way to kick their butts. 5. Moral schmoral and some random twist from nowhere happens yeah you get the idea.<br/><br/>I wish CN could come up with newer and better ideas rather than creating dumbed-down version of their previous toons. This is basically the perfect example of why some cartoons are just made for money but what also worries me is how people (not all of them but it feels like it) will think that cartoons are just for kiddies again thanks to this excuse of a cartoon.

2099,Ben 10, A huge downgrade,"Ben 10 has been a series for a long time that has contributed a lot in many childhoods. Whether it was the original in 2005, the spin-offs in 2009, 2011, or 2013, it left some impact on its fans. These shows all gave something memorable and left companies giving out toys and merchandise. But recently, Cartoon Network decided to give this series a reboot and it follows the same route as ""Teen Titans Go!"" and ""Powerpuff Girls (2016)"". The animation is cute, bright, and it is more childish as ever. So childish, they might as well start another channel called ""Cartoon Network Jr"". Some problems with the animation is that nothing feels original or unique. It feels bland and boring. Even on the aliens, it feels lifeless. But perhaps the biggest sin of all is the voices. CN wisely reprises Tara Strong as Ben, but went with new actors for each new role, and it feels off and awful. Other Ben shows and animated movies kept the same actors and there were no problem, why change it? Anyway, the new voices for the characters are too generic and safe. There are no risks, no differences, just basic generic splooge. And the characters feel re-written. Defined characters that were established, now changed. Gwen is too nice and Grandpa Max is useless.

2103,Ben 10, Please stop ruining good shows and dumbing down great characters with bad reboots.,"I have loved Ben 10 ever since it came out when I was 10 years old. The classic Ben 10 taught kids great lessons about being brave, smart, having integrity, and doing the right thing. Ben and Gwen were both funny, adorable, and they taught kids about having fun, being a good person, helping others, and standing up for your family. Their rivalry also reminded me of my cousin and I when we were kids. Their grandfather was also a great figure in their lives, and the action and aliens were also the best! With the reboot, what happened? Why did they have to dumb down all the characters, including their grandfather? Why did they take away some of the original aliens, and why is the writing so cheap? The writing used to be so great. I still love Tara Strong, though. She's the only good part of the reboot. It's bad enough that CN made these reboots of Teen Titans and the Powerpuff Girls.

It does not fill the boots as a reboot, it is not good as a tv show in general else than a sad, desperate cash-in.<br/><br/>Skip this one at all costs.

Gwen agrees on everything with Ben which I don't like at all. I preferred it when they'd fight all the time because that was hilarious to watch.<br/><br/>Ben makes his fights extremely lame by always adding a comment when he's hit or if he hits an enemy. The new voices for the aliens we used to know and love are complete dog crap. The only plus I can really give to this show is that there's the occasional decent joke.

2107,Ben 10, We didn't need or want this abomination,"OK who asked for this I'm being honest here we just had omniverse 2 or 3 years ago which wasn't all that good now we have this which makes omniverse look like a diamond. The whole show is to demolish on the original series and just for merchandise. Don't let me forget that this reboot is incredibly lazy the show is a copy and paste to the original show except throw away all the drama, tension, and good character development and add more stupid comedy that makes a 3 year old laugh. The reason I say this is lazy and is a copy and paste is one of the episodes I watched was an episode on Ben going to a wrestling match cause Grandpa Max said that he isn't a wrestling champion cause he played a virtual game but I don't remember the plot but this episode was the exact same thing as another episode in the original that is why I call it a copy and paste show. Don't forget the characters are abominations Ben is a mindless bumbling dweeb Gwen is completely different. in the original she and ben fought a lot but now she agrees on everything ben says and don't you dare get me started with Grandpa Max. Also what was the villain in the original again a terrifying overpowered squid octopus liked creature that was frightening the main villain in the reboot a.. scientist with a... bugs body YOU KIDDING ME. However In my opinion my least favorite thing was the aliens back then they were awesome, disgusting, cool, and ETC. They ruined stinkfly the most I mean back then stinkfly was probably one of the most disgusting things that came from a cartoon which was the point but now he looks more like a kids Halloween costume. I also hated the alien transformations seeing ben with that stupid smile now correct me if I am incorrect but in the original Ben had a secret identity instead he goes to a water park and transforming into aliens going on water slides. The alien are more like Halloween costumes than something not from this planet I know there aiming it for kids to make them more stupid cause cartoons nowadays but come on these designs aren't good they are more human like and those aren't the ben 10 aliens that I knew were so great which was the design and character. Apparently they screwed the aliens abilities as well for example Upgrade can control things with technological component like for example a skateboard. Now this has been CNs trend do say screw you to the viewers and ruin the shows back then and of course make mindless cartoons for kids and I know they wont listen to us cause merchandise is more important to them but that's OK cartoon network show these stupid shows like TTG PPGR and you lose viewers your choice but you screw more viewers when you keep doing these things.",13 out of 18 found this helpful.,,6 June 2017
2108,Ben 10, Gotta pay the bills,"Listen, I grew up with Ben 10. It may even be my favorite cartoon series of all time. I've seen all of it of every series. So, when I saw this reboot, I was excited to see more Ben 10. But, one has to ask, when making a reboot, why? There has to be a reason for a reboot. A reboot should improve upon its source material in a unique way, setting it apart from the source while staying true enough to it to even be called a reboot. Now, I have to say, this show is funny. Not all the times and sometimes the joke isn't well placed or there's too much at one time but, most of the time, it's pretty comical. Alright, I like to give credit where credit is due. Ben 10 (2017) is bad. The characters are shells of what they used to be, they are all really dumb and all the episodes and characters are just flat and uninteresting. This show is another Teen Titans GO! It is funny because everything goes by fast. But that only amounts in quick laughs and a sense of unfulfillment.",13 out of 18 found this helpful.,,10 April 2017
2109,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Hero In An Old Straw Hat.,"A brilliantly entertaining series that ran for a single shining season in the 1970's, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" concerned a Chicago reporter whose investigations invariably lead him into dangerous encounters with the paranormal. <br/><br/>Starring the incomparable (and irreplaceable) Darren McGavin, this smartly written show has been described by some as being ""campy"", and while a couple of episodes (""The Youth Killer"" and the much more amusing ""The Trevi Collection"") may have strayed far enough into that territory to qualify as camp, this was actually a series with two distinct parts. Half of the show was a situation comedy (the scenes taking place in the INS office between Kolchak and Vincenzo were particularly amusing), and the other half was a straight-faced thriller that featured some genuinely frightening scenes of horror. <br/><br/>Quite a maverick among television shows of the day, ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" noticeably parted company with established convention regarding what qualifies a character to fill the role of a hero. Common practice dictates that your basic TV good guy will be conventionally handsome, good with his fists and fearless in the sight of danger. Some are rich and reside in fabulously appointed surroundings and often find themselves the focus of unflagging admiration from a cheering section of supporting characters. <br/><br/>Then there's Carl Kolchak. A far sight from the usual male model-type lead, this average-looking guy doesn't work for a big league paper, but instead pounds away at his typewriter in a somewhat rundown news bureau office. He has no family and the only people who seem even remotely close to him are a gray-haired advice columnist and a short-tempered managing editor who's usually bellowing at him to drop his latest crazy story. <br/><br/>Also rare for a TV hero: he doesn't even carry a gun. In fact, when faced with danger, Carl sometimes runs away in stark raving terror. <br/><br/>Furthermore, he's generally reviled by public officials, and after vanquishing something evil from our midst, he never even gets any credit for having risked his neck. <br/><br/>Armed only with a camera, a tape recorder and his wits, Carl Kolchak certainly doesn't sound very formidable. And yet, somehow, this cynical, middle-aged news hound in a seersucker suit and beat-up straw hat is the greatest foe any vampire or blood-thirsty creature of the night ever came up against. Sure, he may not get that Pulitzer prize, but for his uncanny abilities at ridding the world of one monster after another, this unlikely hero surely ranks as one of the most unique and marvelously ironic characters in the history of television.<br/><br/>If you're interested, have reviewed of all 20 episodes, too.",84 out of 87 found this helpful.,,18 August 2006
2110,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The Continuing Adventures of Carl Kolchak,"After the immense success of the made for t.v. movies ""The Night Stalker"" and ""The Night Strangler"", A.B.C. decided to finally make the adventures of everyones' favorite monster hunter Carl Kolchak into a weekly series. Unfortunately, it only lasted one season.  Too bad though.  This had to be one of the smartest series ever written for television.  It was definitely a perfect mix of both horror and comedy as it placed the a regular guy like Kolchak in several unbelievable situations.  Kolchak would begin by writing on stories on what he would think would be an ordinary murder and wind up finding the killer is either a werewolf or a vampire.  Darrin McGavin was perfect in the role and Simon Oakland was great as his editor Vincenzo.  Too bad that this show was up against the juggernaut that was the Friday night line up that was over on N.B.C..  In fact the night that it premiered, Friday September 13, 1974, was also the same night that another smartly written show premiered, ""The Rockford Files"".",40 out of 41 found this helpful.,,19 May 2004
2111,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, New TV series doesn't match the old...,"I was just looking over the new series made for ABC TV. Good god. I was just contemplating what a new series would be like, and then I find it...and I guessed right; watered down, fancy boy crud.<br/><br/>The old series of Night Stalker was a zeitgeist, about being a regular guy, trying to find the truth, which was always hidden by authorities. Much like the times, it had a soul that went to the heart of public feelings, while working in the frame genre of horror/suspense. But, instead of writing to connect the public to their inner feelings about society wrapped in entertainment, the new series is about black and white working together, hot and fancy, to find less then archetypal mysteries. Kolchak brought a pulpy sense of reality to light, and portrayed the seedy side of life without being moralistic. It was Columbo of the supernatural. It didn't create fanciful immorality, like the goth culture today, and it didn't put searing political statements all over. It tried to entertain. And it did. Hence the popularity through the years. Anyone, like myself, who saw this in their childhood remembers it today.<br/><br/>The new series is destined to be another watered down bastardization of brilliant TV.",58 out of 62 found this helpful.,,30 July 2005
2112,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Gotta Love that Carl Kolchack,"I was in junior high when this show premiered and I remember how funny and creepy it was. Darren McGavin, no matter what role he was in, was and still is, an excellent actor. He absolutely made the world weary Carl Kolchak believable. I loved the scenes with him and Simon Oakland as boss Tony Vincenzo. Kolchak always had a great comeback line when Vincenzo was outraged and appalled by Kolchak's supernatural interests. This show was cancelled way too soon, it was just hitting it's stride. Granted, some of the episodes were silly and the costumes (especially the Werewolf costume) were goofy, but some of the episodes were really scary and extremely well written. I wish they had made more of the episodes. My personal favorite is ""Horror in the Heights"", this one combined horror with social commentary about antisemitism and the plight of poor senior citizens. Ahead of it's time. If you are young and have never seen any of these wonderful shows, go to Ebay or Amazon and you can buy them. Well worth the money.",40 out of 42 found this helpful.,,14 April 2005
2113,Kolchak: The Night Stalker," Definitely deserves a place in TV's ""Hall of Fame""","One of my favorite shows back in the '70s. As I recall it went to air on Friday (or possibly Saturday)night on the Nine Network (?) here in Australia. Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together.<br/><br/>Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent. To their credit, the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible.<br/><br/>I remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient Indian Chief which/who 'came back' as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital. The final showdown saw Kolchack trying to short circuit the 'power beast' amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames. Oh well .... you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea.<br/><br/>McGavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best.<br/><br/>Definitely deserves a place in TV's ""Hall of Fame"".

I haven't seen but one or two episodes since I watched the originals in the 70s and would love to see them again. I might have to break down and actually buy the videos of the shows. Also, I hear ABC is going to remake the series and show it in the fall (2005). Not sure how it's going to go over and if they're going to capture that 70s atmosphere. If they don't have Darren McGavin in there or someone as superb and funny as he was/is, I'm not sure if the show will go over like it did when I was a youngster. That, and they'll be competing with all the latest gizmo-loaded, hi-tech, sci-fi shows and movies that have sprung up over the past few years. I won't go into detail about any of the episodes since other commenters have done so very eloquently.

2115,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Best Sci Fi/Horror of the 70's,"In a decade which gave us Battlestar Galactica, Buck Rogers, and...well, not much else, Night Stalker stands out as an oasis of quality horror/fantasy/science fiction in the 70's.  Darren McGavin is at the top of his form in a series that splits its time about evenly between humor and horror.  The only real problem with the series is the scripting, which varies from week to week in no perceivable pattern.  An incredibly wretched episode like ""The Energy Eater"" will be followed by the series' best, ""Horror in the Heights,"" the following week.  Still, McGavin and the supporting cast are fun to watch, and you get the chance to laugh along with the writers as they both pay homage to and parody all those old horror movies.",33 out of 37 found this helpful.,10.0,1 October 1998
2116,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Remains one of my all-time favorite TV shows,"Almost 30 years after its debut, ""The Night Stalker"" is warmly remembered by folks who likely saw the show as youngsters, during its original run on CBS, and who are willing to overlook its faults to simply swim in the experience.<br/><br/>Also key to that loyalty is the undeniable charm of Darren McGavin  one of this generation's most interesting character actors  and Simon Oakland, as Kolchak's long-suffering managing editor, Tony Vincenzo.<br/><br/>The majority of the series' 20 episodes owe more to comedy and camp than the matter-of-fact style of its two highly regarded made-for-TV movie predecessors. In my opinion, there are six episodes that truly stand out  weaving suspense, horror, a bit of gore and a healthy dose of comedy to create taut stories that are a helluva lot of fun.<br/><br/>No. 6 is ""The Ripper"" (original air date: 9-13-74). Penned by veteran television writer Rudolph Borchert, the series' debut is built around the premise the *real* Jack the Ripper  super-human in ways that go completely unexplained  is wreaking havoc in modern-day Chicago. There are some delicious moments and terrific performances by McGavin, Oakland, Ken Lynch, (as gruff police chief L.M. Warren) and Beatrice Colen (as reporter Jane Plumm). The conclusion is one of the few in the series that takes the necessary time to play out and creates remarkable tension as it draws to a spectacular finish.<br/><br/>No. 5 is ""The Vampire"" (10-4-74). Although it's never actually stated, the antagonist from this installment seems to have been a victim of Janos Skorzeny, the vampire from the 1972 ""Night Stalker"" TV movie. ""The Vampire"" is also one of only two Kolchaks that take place away from Carl's home base of Chicago, and the trip he finagles to Los Angeles, to surreptitiously follow a tip from an old Vegas friend, Jim ""Swede"" Brytowski (Larry Storch), is fraught with lively encounters, including with prickly L.A. police lieutenant, Jack Matteo (played by William Daniels). As with ""The Ripper,"" the closing sequence is spectacular and visually satisfying. It's interesting to note that ""Sopranos"" executive producer David Chase wrote this and seven other ""Stalker"" episodes.<br/><br/>No. 4 is ""Chopper"" (1-31-75). In some of their earliest work in Hollywood, Robert Zemeckis (Oscar-winning director of ""Forrest Gump"") and Bob Gale (who penned the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy) combined to write ""Chopper,"" and it flourishes despite some painfully weak visual effects. The story is just plain fun: ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" meets ""The Wild One."" After the grave of 1950s biker ""Swordman"" Baker is unwittingly disturbed, he returns  riding a vintage motorcycle  to seek vengeance on those who separated him from his noggin 19 years before. Following a creepy build-up, the pay-off is a bit of a letdown - but, overall, ""Chopper"" is spooky and entertaining. Jim Backus chips in with a marvelous stand-alone scene as WW II Navy pilot-turned motorcycle salesman, still dealing with the emotional complexities of hawking Japanese bikes. (Watch closely during the final scene, in which Kolchak weaves through stacks of tarpaulin-covered caskets stored in a warehouse, searching for the canister containing Baker's severed head. As Carl raises his flashlight to read the list of names on a tarp  to identify the remains in each group of coffins  ""BACKUS"" is clearly visible. An apparent wicked nod toward the great comedic actor.)<br/><br/>No. 3 is ""Horror In The Heights"" (12-20-74), a compelling story by veteran horror writer Jimmy Sangster of a flesh-eating Hindu demon  the Rakshasa  able to search the minds of its victims to disguise itself as the person he or she trusts most. It's one of the few shows that give McGavin a chance to get on the IL' soapbox, since the murders occur in neighborhood inhabited by poor and elderly. In a refreshingly understated performance, Phil Silvers plays Harry Starman, who Kolchak  usually a creature of necessity when it comes to cultivating relationships  befriends. Although the cops are stumped about a series of grisly murders (natch!), Kolchak eventually determines the swastikas seen everywhere in the neighborhood and an ancient Pakistani restaurateur play crucial roles. McGavin is marvelous in the final scene, in which he's confronted by who *he* trusts most.<br/><br/>No. 2 is ""The Spanish Moss Murders."" What sets this one apart is the originality of the story, created by Chase and Alvin Friedman: the dreams of a young, vagabond Southerner, taking part in a sleep research program, unintentionally summon a horrifying monster from his childhood. Add to it a series of priceless moments  including Keenan Wynn's hilarious performance as captain ""Mad Dog"" Siska; Carl's growing paranoia and some very eerie scenes in the sewers of Chicago  and this one is almost guaranteed to be a universal fan favorite. One of my favorite moments has almost nothing to do with the story: when Bruno, a janitor at the newspaper offices, asks Carl if he's ""gettin' any."" How'd that make it by the censors?<br/><br/>My best of the best is ""The Zombie"" (9-20-74). It could be I'm partial to it beyond the story itself, which involves a simmering race war between rival underworld organizations, incited by someone who  or something that  won't stay buried. I remember watching it the night it aired, scared out of my wits by the menacing zombie, Francois Edmonds (played by former San Diego Charger all-Pro, Earl Faison). I've only recently come to appreciate the performance of Charles Aidman, as the only ""crooked"" cop (the rest being either anal retentive or incompetent) Kolchak encountered, Leo Winwood. Written by Chase and Zekial Marko, ""The Zombie"" features a slew of familiar character actors: Antonio Fargas, Joseph Sirola, Scatman Crothers, Val Bisoglio, J. Pat O'Malley and John Fiedler, in the first of three memorable appearances as Gordy ""The Ghoul"" Spangler. The final scene is tremendous: Carl, in a ""place of the dead,"" perched uncomfortably next to the zombie he believes is dormant, readying a needle to sew its mouth shut. The tension is absolutely exhilarating.",30 out of 34 found this helpful.,,2 June 2004

2118,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, R.I.P Darrin McGavin,"I just learned today that Darrin McGavin has passed on. Which is a real pity, because he was such a great actor.<br/><br/>I never met the man, much to my regret, but I am doing a little tribute here, because this is the first place I recall see this fine, talented actor. To this day, his portrayal of Karl Kolchak (I hope I spelled it right) is a favorite of my, and one of my favorite television shows from the 70s.<br/><br/>The show aired on Friday nights for one season. But it was never forgotten by fans, and fortunately the Sci-Fi Channel runs it occasionally.<br/><br/>The show had great writing, was extremely moody, and some really great monsters and scary situations. But the high point of the show each week was McGavin's performance. He played Karl as a guy who'd rather use his brains as opposed to brawn to get the job done. Often when he fought and defeated the monster, it was from what he'd learned earlier in the show, as opposed to just hacking and slashing his way through.<br/><br/>McGavin also had a real nice sense of comic timing that worked well when bantering words with is boss Tony Vinchenzo (Simon Oakland). The two of them together generated some really entertaining chemistry.<br/><br/>My favorite episode of the series was ""Horror in the Heights"" (aka: The Rakshaka). It had it all -- a great performance by McGavin, a really great monster that you didn't see until the end, and a really, really great shock ending. (No I won't spoil it for you folks who haven't seen it. But I strongly recommended it to anyone who hasn't. It's a real dilly.) Well, Darrin McGavin is gone now. But he leaves behind a nice little legacy. Many of us also remember him as ""The Old Man"" in that wonderful season film ""A Christmas Story.""

2119,Kolchak: The Night Stalker," A series that has gotten to be more appreciated with time,","Kolchak was vastly under-appreciated in its day. In fact, I don't think I knew anyone else that watched the show in its first run - or at least would admit to watching it. Canceled after only twenty episodes in a Friday night time slot, it was pretty much forgotten until twenty years later when its basic format became the inspiration for the X-Files. Kolchak was a reporter on the trail of the supernatural. Like murders following Jessica Fletcher in ""Murder She Wrote"", the stories would sometimes find Kolchak rather than Kolchak always chasing the story. What made this series different from TV shows prior to it was that the government was shown to be suppressing attempts by Kolchak to get at the truth in just about every instance. This was a first in TV shows, and is possibly attributable to the fact that this show premiered about a month after Watergate blew wide open and the president was forced to resign. Although there are many similarities between this show and The X-Files, Carl Kolchak was no Fox Mulder in appearance or style. Like Peter Falk's Columbo, Kolchak wore crumpled attire and had an annoying way about him, but he did get results. Also, each episode of Kolchak was pretty much self-contained. There was no long-running story arc, such as Mulder's search for the truth in what he believed to be the alien abduction of his sister driving him to look for proof of alien existence. If you like shows about the supernatural and you can handle a little 1970's nostalgia and some cheesy special effects, I advise you give this series a try if you ever run across it.",10 out of 12 found this helpful.,8.0,25 June 2015

I think the shows success was due to Kolchaks ""weakness"" and his non-conformist ways. He wasn't good looking(couldn't sweet talk the ladies), no money(wore the same suit, drove the same crappy car), not athletic(I cant recall the number of times hes stumbled or tripped while being pursued) and he wasn't a young buck who could resort to a punch or a kick, no he was just a stumbling sometimes bumbling middle aged guy who thought outside of the box. My favorite episode was the one where the monster appeared as the person you trusted the most and Carl had to shot ""Miss Emily"" with the cross-bow.

2121,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, A Show That Never Had Time To 'Jump'....,"The only thing wrong with the 'Night Stalker' was that it was short-lived! ABC struck gold with the two pilot series based on Jeff Rice's novel ""The Kolchak Papers"". In ""The Night Stalker"", we are introduced to the character and treated to a new re-telling of the old vampire story. There's a vampire running amok in Vegas, and Kolchak is a crusty reporter who feels himself too limited by the type of stories he has to cover. Like many a reporter before him, he has the book-in-progress that he hopes to get published someday. Kolchak has a dislike of cops and authority in general. He's a crusty, difficult cynic, but that doesn't prevent him from having a great-looking girlfriend, played by Carol Lynley. <br/><br/>Incidentally, one of the series episodes does a variation on the vampire tale. The only difference is it's a female vampire running amok. Larry Storch (Corporal Agarn from 'F-Troop') puts in an appearance as an old acquaintance of Carl's who is giving him leads on that episode's happenings. Sequels, as a rule, are never as good as the first. Not so the case with 'Night Stalker', though. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the second pilot 'The Night Strangler' a lot more than the first. It blended the theme of the serial killer with the search for eternal youth.<br/><br/>A Civil War doctor - (from the Union side) - Richard Malcolm - keeps himself alive by an elixir of youth he perfected. Trouble is, the key ingredient is blood from women or people drained from the base of their skulls within moments of death. The darn potion doesn't last long enough, however - which is why he has to keep on killing in 21-year cycles(?) I won't go into more plot details here because I don't want to spoil it for anybody who has never seen it!<br/><br/>Suffice to say this is one of those features that have plenty of familiar favorites from television and film: John Carradine, Al Lewis ('Grandpa' from The Munsters), Wally Cox, and the wicked witch of the west herself Margaret Hamilton, who plays Dr. Crabwell in the anthropology department at a university where Kolchak goes for help and research. <br/><br/>Dr. Richard Malcolm is played by Richard Andersen, mostly known for his role as Oscar Goldman from the 'Six Million Dollar Man' series. Incidentally, before Darren McGavin hit pay dirt with 'The Night Stalker' he was the one who played Oscar Goldman in one of the pilot movies for 'Six Million Dollar Man'.

2122,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, One of the Greatest Characters Ever to Inhabit TV Land!,"In the mid-1970s, ""The X Files"" was called ""The Night Stalker"" (TNS). Now a show that far ahead of its time couldn't exist for long in the mediocre milieu of network television, but for one brief year, we were treated to one of the greatest characters ever to inhabit TV Land.<br/><br/>All week, I would wait for the night the show came on, and if my homework was finished and my chores completed, I could try to talk my way past my mom's objections that ""It'll give you nightmares!"" (Which it did, but they were a small price to pay.) Now if we're being honest, I'll have to admit that the quality of the scripts (not to mention the special affects) was wildly uneven. But when it was good, it was magical! And even when the episode's plot left something to be desired, the relationship between Kolchak and his boss, Anthony Vincenzo (played to perfection by Simon Oakland), made every minute worthwhile.<br/><br/>If ever a series revolved around an anti-leading man, TNS was that series. Carl Kolchak wasn't young, handsome, or suave, and he worked for a two-bit, perpetually broke news service. A real old-school reporter, he was cynical and hard-bitten, and his prose tended toward the florid. His suit was always rumpled, and his shoes were worn. He always seemed to be in a hurry, yet he always arrived late and out of breath. In any fight, he was sure to get the worst of it.<br/><br/>In other words, he was far from the glamorous, polished hero image usually found in TV's mystery shows. Which made him real! Every week I would root for him to find one--just one--person that would believe his incredible stories ... but just try to get someone to take you seriously when you're talking about vampires or werewolves! Even the cops, staring the evidence in the face, were loathe to admit to anything, even away from the public eye.<br/><br/>Mr. Vincenzo, Kolchak's boss, was always harried and hounded to the verge of a nervous breakdown by the stress of trying to keep his tiny bureau out of bankruptcy while simultaneously pleasing his bosses in New York. All Tony ever wanted was a little peace and quiet, a good night's sleep, and a smooth-running operation. With Kolchak on his staff, however, those were all as rare as high-quality photographs of an alien or the devil.<br/><br/>Long before Moonlighting's conflict-energized dialogues between Sybill and Bruce, Tony and Carl could go at it with the best of them--and always at the top of their lungs. Kolchak usually managed to get the best of his boss, who was always threatening to fire the troublesome reporter ""if that story isn't on my desk first thing in the morning!"" Instead, he was much more likely to get a 3 a.m. call from the local police precinct, pleading for him to come down and post bail. Because Kolchak's main characteristics were persistence, an open mind, and incredible curiosity--none of which endeared him to local law enforcement. The police brass was always trying to cover up the uncomfortable details that Kolchak was determined to unearth ... and he wanted them to admit things that would get them thrown in a loony bin.<br/><br/>Kolchak is a dying breed. On one hand, TV News was already outbidding print services for talent, and on the other Woodward and Bernstein were about to revolutionize reporting. Soon, reporters would no longer dream of a big scoop on the latest sensational murder; instead, it was to become all about politically themed exposes ... who can take down the biggest politician.<br/><br/>But Carl Kolchak was a great character, foibles and all, and Darren McGavin played him spot on, note for note. So it may have lasted a mere 20 episodes ... but what a show!",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,9.0,19 March 2011
2123,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, A priceless and very much missed series,"I see that The Night Stalker is being remade as a new series. I have only seen commercials, but it looks like it will be done seriously. I don't have any objection to the show - and how could I, I haven't seen it - but I have to quibble about ""remaking"" this wonderful series from the '70s. Because they're not. No Darren McGavin, no Simon Oakland, no show. So rename all the characters and rename the show. On the other hand, I suppose if they can remake Kojak, they can do just about anything.<br/><br/>Darren McGavin was fantastic as a reporter who was constantly digging up stories no one wanted to believe and getting run out of town or having his stories killed or his camera mysteriously not develop anything as a result. The narration by McGavin was perfect and hilarious. Oakland was great as his boss. All the shows seemed to have long-suffering bosses, but Oakland was one of my favorites.<br/><br/>I always loved this show as I have always loved McGavin, back to his early days in Riverboat. Everything he does for me is golden.<br/><br/>Though the Kolchak TV movies garnered big ratings, the series did not have a good run, which is a shame. However, it has its place now in history as the inspiration for the ""X-Files"" and those who saw the ""Night Stalker"" series have made it a cult classic. Great show.",9 out of 11 found this helpful.,,30 September 2005
2124,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, How Kolchak Inspired Carter,"When originally screened in America in 1972, 'The Night Stalker' became the highest rated made-for-T.V. movie in history. Based on Jeff Rice's unpublished novel, it told how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak ( the late Darren McGavin ) discovered the existence of a vampire in modern-day Las Vegas. When it arrived on British television four years later, it did not quite have the same impact, but my friends were talking about it at school on Monday morning, as indeed was I. We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen. <br/><br/>I did not know of the existence of 'The Night Strangler' until it turned up nearly a decade later. I.T.V., who screened the 'Kolchak' movies, had apparently decided to pass on the spin-off series; they felt 'Barnaby Jones' starring Buddy Ebsen to be more of a draw, and anyway, viewers might confuse 'Kolchak' with 'Kojak'! For years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in Fangoria magazine. I could not even purchase the Jeff Rice novels.<br/><br/>Then something wonderful happened. In 1990, B.B.C.-2 put out the show as part of a late-night Friday series devoted to the supernatural called 'Mystery Train', hosted by Richard O'Brian. 'Kolchak' found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of 'The Brain Eaters' and 'Earth Vs.The Spider'. The opening titles were trimmed, removing Kolchak's whistling, and the closing credits...well, there were none.<br/><br/>The first episode screened was 'Werewolf'. I cannot say I was overly impressed, but stuck with it, and am I glad that I did!<br/><br/>I really wish I'd seen it in 1974. My twelve year old self would have adored it. Creepy, humorous, exciting, no wonder it fired Chris Carter's imagination. <br/><br/>The show's biggest asset was, of course, McGavin. Unlike the recent Kolchak, the original was an everyman figure, eccentrically dressed, rather conservative. He was to the supernatural what 'Columbo' was to crime. The late Simon Oakland was great too as Kolchak's bad-tempered boss Tony Vincenzo. The scripts overflowed with wonderful, dry wit. I found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror. When the twenty episodes ended, I felt bereft.<br/><br/>'The X-Files' came along a few years later and filled the void - but only to an extent. I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo back. I am glad that the show was never revived though. Without Oakland it would not have been the same.<br/><br/>I have the Rice books now and have read them several times. I was very surprised when Stephen King slated the first ( in his book 'Danse Macabre' ) as it is as good as anything he has written. <br/><br/>Alright, so some of the monsters were hardly state-of-the-art, but so what? The new 'Kolchak' totally missed the point of the original. What you don't see is sometimes more frightening than what you do...<br/><br/>Best Episode - 'Horror In The Heights' Worst Episode - 'The Sentry'",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,29 September 2006
2125,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The Night Stalker!,"The Night Stalker was a very good series. Darrin McGavin was excellent here as the hilarious reporter Carl Kolchak! The video with episodes The Ripper and The Vampire is excellent! ""The Ripper"" is a very exciting episode and its awesome how cool the villain is here! Episode ""The Vampire"" is also a very good segment and its arguably the best of the two on the video. The Vampire is very neat and it was unusual that the character was a woman! All of the regular cast members and guest stars are all great. McGavin played his character very well. The theme music is also very good. There hasn't been a television show on TV as great and as exciting as this one in years in My opinion and the only that comes to mind is the X-Files and I feel that there needs to be a show on the box to bring back true excitement to television. If you can find this video rent it or even buy it from Amazon.com because its a classic and I strongly recommend it!",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,,15 December 2004
2126,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Man Up you guys this is a 10,"If IMDb allowed short reviews (they don't, they have rules) I would make this a one sentence review and simply point out that the producers and writers of the X-Files claimed their hit show was an ""homage"" to this incredible series. That is all you really need to know. If you are still with me, I will say that Darren McGavin, one of the great legends of early TV, was pushing 50 when he took on the role of a ""cub reporter"" that unintentionally ended up with all the really-really-really strange stories. His Kolchak is pitch-perfect, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine anyone else who could have pulled it off, his rumpled hat and suit make even Columbo look like a male model. And like any good reporter, he is always fighting with his boss and he always has one more question to ask, even if that last question means risking his life. The best series are not merely about stories, they are about characters that you cannot forget long after the set is turned off. McGavin made Kolchak a part of TV history. The series is timeless.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,17 January 2014
2127,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, great,"Some of the scariest bits on TV were delivered by Karl Kolchak for us. ""THe Vampire"" was one of the best non-Dracula vampire stories ever shown on television. This is the scenario: a victim of the vampire Janos Skozeny was never found and destroyed by Las Vages police. After some earth is moved by heavy equipment, she claws her way out of the dirt and frightens a woman. She makes her way to Los Angeles and gets a job as a high priced hooker. As a call girl, she wear huge amounts of pancake and rouge. She kills the sister and her sister's boyfriend, and then wreaks havoc on the Los Angeles's Rams offensive line. Kolchak arrives in time to get bit, but he shows her a cross and she cowers away. Of course, Kolchak has to dispatch the vampire without the help of skeptical police (Kolchak, people disappear every day, is Amelia Earhardt supposed to show up as a vampire?) This female vampire is the scariest, vicious, feral lady vampire this side of the Borgo Pass. Even Drac would not want to be on her bad side. Other memorable episodes are Jack the Ripper, RING, the alien, the headless motorcyclist, the immortal, the witch, the goddess, the satanic politician (not a redundancy) and the rakshasa. The best horror serial of TV. Comparable to the movie. Kolchak in Vincenzo are in Chicago for the series, having been driven out of Vegas by the authorities who knew that Kolchak killed the vampire Skorzeny.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,24 June 2010
2128,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Kolchak - the urban explorer,"As a forty-something urban explorer/photography and longtime fan of the original Kolchak: Night Stalker series since my early childhood, one aspect that hasn't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration Carl's character undertook during the series. He always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment, sewer or tunnel after another. Armed with only his trusty penlight (okay, so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel) and his camera, he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier.<br/><br/>Like many here, I recently purchased the DVD box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent TV episodes, and have been slowly revisiting all the shows. And although I remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired, its been over 30 years passed...so many of them seem new all over again. Campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining. They just don't make stuff like this these days. Now its all regurgitated spin-offs with predictable characters and plots.<br/><br/>Thankfully, my 16-yr-old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she enjoys the genre). It gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,3 June 2007
2129,Kolchak: The Night Stalker, The reason I think this show is so popular,"I loved KOLCHAK: THE NIGHT STALKER since I saw it on the night it premiered on September 13, 1974. I loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by Gil Melle (hey, where's the soundtrack guys?) and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple, important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level. When Darren McGavin's Carl Kolchak starts to discover odd situations, he reacts like most people would. He finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger, he is frightened, even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode. It's rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force. He's usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works. Sometimes, he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are. In one episode, he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it, he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly, he must go back and defend himself. He's heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn't do but that doesn't mean he probably wouldn't much rather someone else did it instead of him. He's a regular guy, doing a job, trying to make a buck, not a monster-hunter. He just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural, which he has an interest in but he doesn't want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do. If his plan to defeat the creature didn't work, you will often see him running for his life to get away from it, which is of course what I would do in the situation. That's why I was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid. Kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him. You were scared for him and for the other characters too. The producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit, scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it's all for naught if you don't care about the characters. Darren McGavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a ""monster of the week"" show and he decided not to continue. I can tell you I mourned when this show was canceled when I was a kid but, as an adult, I can see why it couldn't go on in that formula for very long. I still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred McGavin as the bumbling, determined and brusk but good-hearted reporter for the INS, known as Carl Kolchak. I seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why I loved the show. It's not the monsters, darkly-lit sets, creepy music or goofy guest stars, although they are all vital ingredients. The secret to it's success is right there in the title - ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"". Without McGavin's lovable, bumbling Carl Kolchak to root for and to care for, then it just ain't a Night Stalker.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,10.0,27 May 2007

The network, again screwed up in pulling this from the air, so that they could put what else in it's place? It should have gone at least 3 seasons. Why not, right? I think sometimes that the network executives think they are the 'gods' of the entertainment world. But they mis-guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time. Let it be said that, they have a lot more flops than 'hits'. This was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line-up.

However, considering the cult status of this series, I'm extremely disappointed that Universal didn't shell out the extra bucks for any extra features. Some interviews or episode commentary would have been greatly appreciated. There aren't even any cast bios. Nothing. I find this to be very sad and I shake a shaming finger at whoever is responsible for this. There really is no excuse for this.

2136,While You Were Sleeping, Maybe was I expecting too much?,"Korean drama never cease to amaze me. My first Korean drama being Goblin, it's with fascination that I continued to watch them. A lot of my friends were talking about While You Were Sleeping, and I think, along with my previous experiences with Korean drama, it kinda set the bar high. Don't get me wrong, this drama was bloody amazing!
I'd not say it was totally unpredictable, but my favorite part of this drama was Lee Yoo-bum. This character blew me away! Lee Sangyeob has to be one of the best actor I have seen in a Korean drama so far. No matter how much I hated him, I was still totally amazed at how complex, and rich in depth this character was! He's probably one of the best reason to watch this show. I wanted to know what was up with him? Where his evil comes from?<br/><br/>Only negative point in my opinion, was the chemistry between the two main characters. I know a lot of people mentioned it as a positive factor, but I didn't feel it. I preferred her relationship with Han Wootak, which I felt was authentic and flowing better.

2143,While You Were Sleeping, The most beautiful lead couple in the history of K Drama ?,"Phew ! I have just been whacked over the head with an emotional sledgehammer. Not once but twice !<br/><br/>And in terms of quality, think ""Breaking Bad"" followed by ""The Sopranos"".<br/><br/>Oh, the tears. So many tears, yet I love them. Think ""Tears Of Joy"".<br/><br/>Specifics ? Of course ! Having recently finished watching ""30 But 17"" and swooning over its brilliance, I decided to then watch ""While You Were Sleeping"" and entered the realm of ECSTASY once again.<br/><br/>Déjà vu rears its beautiful head as the same factors appear : great script, top acting and superb directing/visuals, plus the crying. I feel like a wrung-out dish rag !<br/><br/>The WYWS concept of people dreaming events and trying to change them in real life isn't original, yet the ""Back To The Future"" movies showed the value in putting a distinctive spin on a familiar idea.<br/><br/>Set in a Prosecutor's office where our hero works, the script deftly juggles the cases they tackle with the dream sharing between the 3 leads : hero, a former reporter and a cop. A romance, of course, is an important plot thread and I have to say the crime angle kept me rivetted, and I usually avoid shows in that category. There are twin tragedies which launch the story and also provide plenty of tears for the cast and me, and the general blending of these various plot strands is done really well. It all builds to a really satisfying climax so the writers should take a very long bow. And they also tackle domestic violence, so bravo for that too.<br/><br/>I really do need to single out Lee Jong Suk as the standout performer here and the pivot around which everything revolves. I've only seen him in W before this and thought him too passive. Yes, a pretty face but too reserved, so the intensity and the versatility here just blew me away. The serious stuff is handled with assurance, and he's also hilarious and playful in various comic scenes too. Even the final confrontation with his former mentor is enhanced by a tone of almost analytical restraint.<br/><br/>The Prosecutor's Office he works in is home to some other interesting characters, all nicely played. Kim Won Hae as the older investigator in LJS's office seems to be in every second K Drama and is in fine form. He has that interesting, lived-in face and the role escalates in importance towards the end. Jung Hae In is good as the dreamer cop, Min Sung Wook is terrific as an excitable prosecutor, Go Sung Hee is great as his ambitious colleague ( &amp; has a brilliant comic scene when the reporter is embedded with her at work ), Bae Hae Sun as an older prosecutor makes a unique impression ( &amp; has an interesting back-story ), Park Jin Joo is an adorable little bundle of charisma as a secretary ( &amp; steals most of the scenes she's in ) and Lee Sang Yeob is effectively slimy as the smirking defence lawyer you really want to punch in the face every time he slithers onto the screen.<br/><br/>Ah, but what of Suzy, the actress playing the female lead ? Well, she's very interesting. Formerly a K Popper ( check out her group Miss A on Youtube ), her pairing with LJS constitutes arguably the most beautiful lead couple in K Drama ( and the chem is good ). Suzy is definitely gorgeous, and the big eyes plus cute little overbite make her stand out from the crowd. I'm not saying she's in the ""Goddess"" category inhabited by Secretary Kim's Park Min Young, but she's close. Oh, and the acting ? Yes, she has talent and that crucial X factor. She manages the dramatic scenes well and ditto the lighter side, though I suspect she is naturally understated in real life. I can't recall a full-on laugh, for example, though perhaps the director decided that her character shouldn't be too jolly.<br/><br/>And speaking of directors, this is a perfectly paced series and obviously a great script helps too. Similar to 30 But 17, which also manages the tricky feat of combining the comic and the dramatic in the same episode. Special mention also to the DP, as the high-contrast lighting in some scenes is a treat for the eye. The editing is top notch too, with many shot transitions quite beautiful.<br/><br/>The perfect K Drama ? Hmm, well, despite the effective finale for the awful defence guy ( with both LJS and the director wisely opting for low-key ), it would've been fun to have LJS fantasising about punching his enemy repeatedly in the face, then doing a wrestling-style tag with Suzy; he then rests a bit while she take over &amp; slaps him five or ten times ( &amp; maybe jazz the fantasy up visually with some slo-mo, dutch angles and ECU's ). I'd also like the Slime to have more of a back story. We do get a little bit of guilt, but what about having him love beautiful/expensive things which his fees for defending monsters pay for ? And all because he grew up in a poor family so now he's obsessed with money ?<br/><br/>True, these are very minor quibbles which do not detract from an extremely formidable achievement. As with the best of any genre, there's a special joy which is created when you watch a high quality work of art; so in amongst the plentiful tears, there are many smiles too. Do try it !",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,5 May 2019

This series combines elements of all your favorite crime shows as a backdrop to an engaging story of friendships, family, and love. I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It is a legal drama/romance that is exciting and engaging the entire way through. It also has a paranormal aspect with the dream element. This one definitely moves to the top of my list and I would recommend anyone who is a crime show fan to watch this one. The romance in it was also heartwarming and believable. This is one of my new favorites.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,27 January 2020

2151,While You Were Sleeping," Lee Jong-Suk, Bae Suzy and Jung Hae-In how could it get any better","This fantasy, romantic-comedy with lots of drama was excellent. I loved it from start to finish: The writing was great, the actors were great, the musical soundtrack was excellent. It shows how people you meet throughout your past life may leave lasting effects and feelings that may play a large role in your future. It shows how your choices and actions can affect your life and those of your friends or family members, or even someone you pass on the street. Bae Suzy, Lee Jong-Suk, Jung Hae-In and Sin Jae-Ha were amazing as the cast and their portrayals of their dreamy characters were spot on. Lee Sang-Yoeb was so bad. And Kim Won-Hae was as always his best, I have seen him in several series and he never fails to bring laughter and tears to my eyes and he didn't disappoint this time. Loved it and recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh or a good cry.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,10.0,7 March 2021
2152,While You Were Sleeping, The best series of mine.,"First thing that I would like to tell all of you why I watch this series because of Bae Suzy lol. She's so pretty.
In my opinion, this series is the best of Kdrama it has many moods in every episode and very excited. I've no bored when I watch this series because story of this series is interesting. This series talks about a woman that can see the bad future and she want to fix it to be a happy ending.
The story of this series is exaggerated but that the reason why watcher like to watch it. If I have to comment a bad thing of this series, I want to talk about CG of this series that not so good some scenes were too obvious, but that is just a little things in this series. The main part of this series is emotional in the story that make me wanna cry in every episode. The mood in this series is performed very well because it has the best actor ex. Bae Suzy, Lee Jong-Suk, Jung Hae-In, etc. and best director, that make this series is the master piece.
Many people love this series and I'm the one that love this series too because of the story, character, actor, etc. The rating I give for ""Why you were sleeping"" is 9/10 that means this series is really good. If you are hesitant to watch this series, I want to tell you ""Watch it now!! It the best of the series.""",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,9.0,4 March 2021

2154,While You Were Sleeping, A Thriller Romance,"Interesting combo, isn't it? I've already consumed 3-4 Lee Jongsuk dramas before I watched While You Were Sleeping. From the poster and title alone, I was already drawn to the drama so when I started this, I had a mindblowing experience.<br/><br/>I love thrillers. I love mystery-solving dramas. It makes me more engaged in the work. While You Were Sleeping was an adventure. It had a slightly supernatural occurence that was the main plot device this drama.<br/><br/>The actors and actresses did so well everything felt so natural. And of course, Lee Jongsuk. You'll be charmed by him. Think along with the characters.

2156,While You Were Sleeping, Good enough,"Guess what?! I'm the unpopular opinion (again...). Anyway, ""While you were sleeping"" started so so strong, with beautiful cinematography and griping story, dreamy like. Unfortunately, the cinematography later on appeared here and there only, and I really, really wish that they had more of it, like Goblin. Another plus was the cast. Love the two leads, but Suzy wasn't at her best. Maybe it was her character that was kind of odd and annoying at some point, but it just didn't work. Not that her performance wasn't great, it just felt like the role wasn't for her... The love story and the couples chemistry, moreover, was okay and really good at first, but kind of felt weak towards the middle, picked up though towards the ending. In addition, the soundtrack was perfect! Really good indeed, Scarlet heart quality (you should check it out if you're interested in OSTs). Finally, the cases: they were interesting at first, but they got weaker and weaker, especially as the story focused on the couple rather than them. So, 5 out of 10, not too bad but not too good.",5 out of 16 found this helpful.,5.0,22 November 2017
2157,While You Were Sleeping, Lives Up to the Hype!,"I have often watched very popular k-drama series and felt rather disappointed afterwards, as the most popular ones tend to not be able to live up the large expectations. This one however did live up to the hype!
The story is original and well done, the pacing is steady and keeps the viewers interested, and the characters are well rounded and fully fleshed out. The acting was really great as well, with wonderful performances from our leads. I think this was the first time I had a bit of the infamous ""second lead syndrome,"" as I really loved Woo-Tak! I loved the soundtrack and the cinematography, and there were a few really gorgeous songs and beautiful shots sprinkled throughout the show.<br/><br/>I have to say the first two episodes were amazing and felt a bit better than the rest of the show, and if I was just rating those two episodes it would have been a 10 for sure. So why an 8? I found the tone to be a bit uneven throughout, with some really cute/sweet and funny episodes surrounded by much more dark and poignant episodes, and the tone never really matched. I was particularly thrown off in episode 3 when it slammed funky text on the screen next to our main characters labeling them as the ""good guy,"" the ""bad guy,"" and the ""weird one."" That was an odd, out of place moment that never sat right with me. So, my rating is an 8.<br/><br/>However it is well worth a watch and I loved the ending. This show had a few really amazing moments that make you think and that just stick with you after watching. Overall a great show!",1 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,11 November 2020
2158,Kyle XY, Terribly Endearing,"I recently had the chance to watch the pilot for Kyle XY, and to my surprise, I enjoyed it very much. Of course, this topic has been experimented with before: mysterious figure with no past, relatives, etc. But something in this circumstance struck my interest. To be perfectly honest, I don't know exactly what did it. The mother, a psychiatrist, or paranormal psychologist of sorts, decides to take the stranger in, seeing as there are no other options as of the present time. The family, which is made evident of having its own problems, takes in the boy, and of course has difficulty with him, are reluctant to accept him into household goings-on, etc. Now, I know this concept seems predictable and juvenile, as stated previously. But to me, its both invigorating and intriguing for a person, or thing, to have the rare behavior to come to the aid of those whom he has hardly met-displaying the purity of the human heart, and conversely, the wretchedness of the impurities around him. The conclusion of the episode had to be the most enjoyable though. As the family members who had once merely discarded Kyle from their lives welcomed him into their household, the viewer is acquainted with the kindness of strangers in an effort to put others before themselves--a notion brought about so rarely on both television, and in life. And while not perfect, Kyle XY has thusfar, that is in the pilot, exhibited inter-familial machinations as well as captivating abilities of observing one's surroundings, and all without ever losing itself along the way. It is curious where this plot will lead, how all the mystery will be concluded, and we will all be there to see it...every step of the way. Afterall, it's part mathematics, and part....euphoria.",120 out of 141 found this helpful.,10.0,5 July 2006
2159,Kyle XY, Time to boycott TV networks that cancel good shows,"I've said this in one of my comments about either Carnivàle or Eureka that I am not a fan of Sci-fi shows yet once again like those 2 shows I just mentioned comes yet another great Sci-fi show. Like Carnivàle it was canceled this time it was ABC turn to disappoint its audience.<br/><br/>What I don't get is Kyle XY hit record viewers in it's 3rd season even the users rating on here was 8.6 yet ABC boring Dancing with the Star has been on a serious decline and this site users rating is 5.2 yet that useless show wasn't axed and still boring us as we speak almost daily. Then there is Carnivàle this site rating was 9.0 and it still got axed, I'm certain that Eureka (seeing I love the show) will get the same treatment very soon as Kyle XY and Carnivàle It just goes to show you that the TV network just don't care about its viewers anymore and its getting worse every season, all they care about is reality TV shows so that they can save a buck. Its up to US the viewer to protest networks when they show us crappy Reality TV shows. When a reality show comes on just change the channel, maybe then WE the viewers will get our shows back.<br/><br/>I for one sorely miss the days of quality TV, Kyle XY was was very good, it had a great story line to it and it had great acting. Its shows like that that I miss instead they are showing US CSI,s and Law and order from every city in the US, they are showing us trash people it's time to wake up and take a stand and that time is now.

If you're one for suspense and mystery and a little science fiction then this show is definitely for you. I can't wait for each new show so we can find out a little more about Kyle's past. Who is he, where is he from, why can't he remember anything at all about his past? How is it that he can do all these magnificent things but can't demonstrate simple human emotions?

The family interaction is totally believable and superbly acted by all parties. They make you want to belong to the family. Jean-Luc Bilodeau portrayal of the ding bat brother is supremely done. His character reminds me of me at his age. I just heard that there will probably be another season and I am elated. I hope this family continues in the new season. Can't wait.

I really love the story and plot this show tells to the audience, it has many defining moments and experiences I'll always remember. This show is great at building characters and telling their stories. This show also has many great music choices which fits to the scene it is placed in. The plot twists are great and unexpected, leaving surprises to people who watches the show. I really miss this show and I would like a few more episodes. The ending to this series was not very well, it left many questions. I feel that a proper ending to the fans should be made. Overall, I give this show a perfect 10 over 10. I really enjoyed this show and the experiences it has given me. I've learned a lot through the lessons it is teaching in the show.

2163,Kyle XY, Interesting,"You know, after the whole Roswell and X Files debacle I really wasn't all too interested about the ""alien"" television show. The aforementioned shows were good but they were definitely lacking.<br/><br/>I personally think Kyle XY has found the *it* factor.<br/><br/>Imagine taking a 17 year old kid who is from a different country and is suddenly plunked down in the middle of America with no means of communication. Well then, you've got Kyle. He is about as strange as they come. A human shaped being and no belly button and no information to draw from as to how to interact with other beings.<br/><br/>Now it would be boring to just watch a show about a kid who is seemingly another life form and doesn't know how to communicate, just as it would be boring to watch a foreign exchange student during your lunch period right before chem class. The interesting thing about this show is that the voice overs done by Kyle walks the audience through his emotions and his thoughts as he is remembering his first days as a human.<br/><br/>It is the most beautiful experience; almost as if you looking at the world through a newborn's eyes. You see what they see and you hear what their first thoughts were. Beautiful.<br/><br/>Since ABC doesn't really have a good Friday line up coming in the Fall, I'd like them to keep this show around to see what comes of it. It sucks you in with wondering what Kyle is.",95 out of 125 found this helpful.,8.0,30 June 2006
2164,Kyle XY, Not bad at all,"I must confess that I'm a nut for supernatural fare and was not expecting to enjoy Kyle XY but it's summer and there's nothing much on. I was pleasantly surprised at how much this pilot teased my interest. Sure the script might seem a bit familiar but the story is tantalizing and I'm hungry for more. It originally aired on ABC Family but don't let that fool you. It is not a strictly kid's show. Give it a chance especially if you have a taste for the unusual. This show is a combination of drama, family fare and supernatural. Any X-Files fans will have a pleasant jolt when you see the mysterious man watching our hero. I also have to admit that I felt a slight tug at my heart at the sight of how this family takes to helping this strange...and I do mean strange...teenager who appears from out of nowhere.",65 out of 85 found this helpful.,8.0,30 June 2006

However, the more they came on, the more it got me to wondering why he didn't have a belly-button, so I decided to watch it. I'm really glad that I did. It was extremely interesting. It was the best. If you are really into shows that give off a bit of a mysterious air, then Kyle XY is definitely for you. I'm definitely going to be watching the next episodes, it's got me in suspense, and I want to know what is going to happen next.

2166,Kyle XY, A new take on sci-fi,"Being somewhat of a mix of a soap-opera, ""The Pretender"", and ""Dawson's Creek"", this show certainly surprised me, especially since I don't much care for those three.<br/><br/>We start with a basic mysterious boy story - he has some exceptional abilities, no memory, a caring psychiatrist, a newly acquired family to take him in, and a mysterious stalker - within which setting he must try to discover his identity.<br/><br/>This premise sounds pretty boring and even overdone in movies and TV, but the show grew on me, and I was hooked by the end of the season. Though many comments complain about the poor script and wooden acting, I beg to differ. Matt Dallas is well cast as a juvenile and naive character. He is supposed to have that doe-eyed-in-on-coming-head-lights look. I have to admit that some of the overall dialogue approaches cheesiness at times, but for the most part, the story stands well on its own and makes up for that.<br/><br/>I also thought this had nowhere to go after the first season, but the writers managed to put in a decent finale that will keep fans interested for the next season.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the ""adultness"" of the material. I suppose this isn't the type of show for children to watch if they aren't yet familiar with typical teenager topics like sex, drinking, relationships, drugs, and general mischief; all the stuff that I'm sure many parents want to turn a blind eye to. Is it appropriate for ABC Family channel? You be the judge. Try it out, though. I think you'll enjoy the series. 7/10",45 out of 58 found this helpful.,7.0,29 August 2006

2168,Kyle XY, Positive review,"I didn't know what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that for the most part, the show is interesting. It combines a number of concepts including that of the outsider, and the ""alien's"" eye view of humanity. The main character is at once an alien, an alienated teen, and a baby in an adolescent's body. These different experiential views combine to offer some commentary on humanity, particularly US culture (since that's where the story takes place). There are some hokey cheesy moments, but overall I think ""Kyle XY"" offers viewers multiple opportunities to ask meaningful questions about the nature of life, reality, and our own values.",48 out of 66 found this helpful.,8.0,16 July 2006

Though it can get a bit risqué at times, it is still fun to watch. I'd recommend it to anyone thirteen or older who enjoys a good mystery. It might not be for everyone, but those who I know that have seen it like it. You should try it out.

This is simply a show that meets all ages and satisfies all tastes. All the characters are so well written, and the cast did an amazing job portraying every character. It really breaks my heart that they are taking the show off the air after only 3 season!! How could they put an end to such a great show that fast!!!!!

2171,Kyle XY, Great Teen Family Show,"My teenage son could not get enough of this show, which is what had me decide to watch it- so that would be two positive ratings. <br/><br/>The show has several story threads: sci fi adventure with an evil cabal, high school drama and family dynamics. They weave together to hit all the entertainment buttons. <br/><br/>Kyle, the brilliant fish out of water, is played perfectly by Matt Dallas who manages an endearing innocence as he discovers his powers, how life works, and the secrets of his past. He gives a non-judgmental Buddha-like narration, but his character is by no means emotionless. <br/><br/>One of the strongest relationships in the show is the mother/son relationship between Nicole and Kyle which is convincing enough to make this mom tear up. <br/><br/>The teenage themes are universal, so probably expected, but when seen through Kyle's eyes they are fresh and entertaining. I was most impressed by the emotional maturity that the characters brought to the resolutions of their situations. Some reviewers found that unrealistic, but I found it refreshing and extremely satisfying. <br/><br/>Character development unfolds over the course of the series as new life experiences bring the characters new choices and growth opportunities. <br/><br/>Younger brother, Josh, provides most of the comic relief and also shows great growth as a character and great acting from Jean-Luc Bilodeau in spanning the emotional arc. <br/><br/>While this review may sound a bit clinical, it was actually fun, action filled, heart-felt and funny.

2173,Kyle XY, A Parable for Foster Care,"This mystery-science fiction series pilot shows a lot of promise as far as commentary on how far can the ""helping professions"" go; it is definitely a ""blue state"" kind of show (set in Washington State) since it implies a kind of alien visitor who can be plopped in front of ""old style"" computers and assumed to be techno-adept without much sense of what language he speaks or their importance. The director knows how to fold in a certain sense of threat and danger without going off in bizarre or grotesque scenarios. The helping family is seemingly ready to become the means to socialize the alien/savant and they are ""instant foster parents/siblings"" since the mother is apparently a state social worker/psychologist at Children/Family services of that state/county. The alien (Kyle is a ""name"" which seems a little too quickly attached to him) doesn't come with supernatural tools as did the ""STARMAN"" of a few years ago but he isn't quite a full amnesiac either since he is capable of narrating the first episode at least. For those of you looking for a mildly entertaining made-for-network series, on the basis of its pilot (June 30) I give it a 9 * rating).

2176,Kyle XY," Love, Life, Family and Identity","Kyle is essentially a fully-maturated human who has no more development to go through, only a learning process, to learn what it is to be human, to learn to love, be loved and what family and acceptance means to a person, their identity and what identity itself means to a person. Kyle XY's very first couple of episodes are decidedly awkward as a result; I personally cringed at the scene where he first speaks and is asking for a drink. He starts out very much as a wax mold of a human and this concept is used to basically poke fun at humanity itself as Kyle learns of the world around him.<br/><br/>As Kyle grows and comes to learn that everyone and everything seems to have a place in society, possibly a purely human-developed psychological structure designed to make one feel accepted, he begins to wonder what his own place is and where his acceptance lies. He then changes from a happy, glowing wax figure, one who is afraid or doesn't know how to outwardly present his own feelings, to someone who will uppercut a guy in the jaw through a window because his family was threatened; the gamut of human emotion is always there, Kyle learns, like a catalog of feelings your body is ready to open up and show you when necessary, however unexplainable they may at first be.<br/><br/>It is very refreshing to see that it is not only one character whose personality makes noticeable shifts in the life of the show, but nearly every character that has a shelf-life long enough and with enough exposure to Kyle to be affected by him, unafraid to break its own stereotypes so that characters truly do seem to grow as the show progresses. That the show is unafraid to and does discuss the themes of family, love, identity and acceptance like it does, to show that they are at the same time infuriating, heart-warming, manipulative, kind, forgiving, loathsome, pitiable and a whole myriad of other descriptions leads to some very touching moments.<br/><br/>Kyle himself didn't seem to be progressing at all but it is quite apparent at the end of season 3 that Kyle's own mannerisms and the way other characters begin to recognize his predictability was all leading up to a big change in him, starting with him punching someone and threatening his life. It's just unfortunate the show ended before we could discover where this self-revelation would take the character.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,22 August 2009

Also, the chemistry between the cast members and the excellent acting, which contributes to how we can really relate and sympathize with the characters. Great little tidbits and advice on life here and there. At times they make me feel like I'm not the only one experiencing this, or having issues with that. This show has the perfect mix of sci-fi/romance/action/thrill/mystery/comedy/drama and every other genre there possibly is, and this is probably ABC Family's best show!",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,20 January 2009
2182,Kyle XY, Not a review.,I first saw this show when it was first being aired on BBC2/BBC1 in 2008 in the U.K. At first I thought it was a film (a really good one) because I had tuned in half way through the first episode and tuned out before it was over so I could watch it fully on DVD. The next day I checked the RTE Guide to find out the name of the film. I then realised it was a TV series. I couldn't wait and watch an episode once a week so I downloaded series 1 and series 2 off the internet. After the second episode I had literally fallen in love with the characters and the show itself. After finishing series 2 I was both angry and sad that there was nothing more to watch. (Series 3 is being aired in January 2009 {but only 10 episodes :[}) I am now watching the first series of 24 which I love but I keep on wishing I could watch Kyle XY.,4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,4 July 2008
2183,Luis Miguel: The Series, This show is amazingly addicting!,"I love Luis Miguel, his music, his story, and his life. I love this show because it literally takes you into Luis Miguel's life and makes you better understand what was going on in the background of his singing career. Everything about this show is amazing and perfect. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that none of the songs on the show are actually sung by Luis Miguel himself. I think Diego Boneta did a fantastic job singing all of his songs and playing Luis Miguel but as a huge Luis Miguel fan, it was pretty disappointing knowing that on the show it wasn't Luis Miguel's voice, it was Diego's. I'm sorry but nothing compares to the songs Luis Miguel sang himself to anyone else that sings them. There is definitely a difference between their voices. I'm not sure what caused his songs not to be on the show, but I'm sure it had to do with the record label or a deal or something. Other than that, be prepared to get sucked into the life of Luis Miguel and all the dramatic, twisted things he went through to reach where he is today.",21 out of 24 found this helpful.,10.0,11 July 2018

2188,Luis Miguel: The Series, Really Great Production,"I have grown up listening to Luis Miguel's music and enjoying his television appearances on shows like Siempre en Domingo, which showcased all kinds of musical talent from Latin America and Europe. I never knew anything about his personal life and this television biopic is well produced and performed. Luis Miguel, the singer, felt like an enigma, reclusive and unreachable. Perhaps it's why the media has always remained rabid to publish stories, true or fabricated, about him.<br/><br/>It took me a while to recognize the real life people because the sound made it hard to catch what was being said. Some characters were based on real people and some were fictitious. It opened up situations that I never knew about, mainly, an unsurprisingly, the sacrifices Luismi had to make in order to become famous.<br/><br/>The performances range from mediocre in some of the younger, minor characters, to stellar among the seasoned actors. Diego Boneta nails his performance in the title role in both looks and charisma. He delivers in Luismi's essence and mannerisms. (Diego uses mostly Luismi's voice tracks when singing, so I can't say much about that.) Even the younger Luismi characters shined in their roles, particularly Luismi at age 12, played by Izan Llunas. His performance as the vulnerable child who just wants to make his parents happy is on point. (The young actor is actually the grandson of famous Spanish pop star, Dyango, and a musician in his own right). Oscar Jaenda blew me away as Luisito Rey, the overbearing and abusive father, but I would have preferred him to be a little more human and expressed a little more vulnerability in order to feel like a multi-dimensional character. The lovely Anna Favella does justice in her portrayal of Luis Miguel's long suffering mother.<br/><br/>I don't recommend this for viewers under 17. There is nudity, drug abuse, a lot of vile swearing, and some over-the-top sex scenes.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,8.0,7 February 2021

He doesn't look much like Luismi and though he sings ok... I wasn't impressed. He didn't do an awful job but his energy just felt all wrong. He went through nearly the entire series moping, and even when he was happy he looked melancholy.

2199,Marianne," At last, a good French horror series worth binging","Netflix promises a lot, but not always delivers.
They did deliver, though, with ""Marianne"", an eight-episode French series that will fix your need for all things Stephen King and Conjuring-related.<br/><br/>The story's premise is as formulaic as can be in the horror genre, especially inspired by S. King's novels: Emma, a thirty-something French horror writer, has decided to put an end to a series of books that tell the story of Lizzie Lark, her heroine, who battles an evil witch called (you guessed it) Marianne. Emma has had enough of this character and wants to move on with her life, and, maybe, write something else, something more ""serious"" (she is a French novelist, after all).
Little did she expect a former school friend, Caro, to show up at one of her book signing events, and scare her into returning back to her hometown, which she had left 15 years before, after a terrible tragedy.<br/><br/>The cast is solid, the characters interesting, diverse and well-developed. Some moments are genuinely scary. The pacing may at times be a problem, and the series slows down in the middle, but nothing too problematic.
The script is clever and culminates in an extremely promising cliffhanger that will certainly leave you wanting for a second series.",159 out of 204 found this helpful.,9.0,14 September 2019

2202,Marianne, Very pleasantly surprised.,"I love horror, but I also know that horror, especially Netflix horror recently can be either really good or really bad, so I went into this with very low expectations, and, honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised. The first episode immediately gripped me and made me want to see more, more of these characters, more of this story. I feel like this series honestly does a lot of things right, especially the characters. I felt like I was never watching characters, but real people. Scenes were they were angry at each-other had a very real tension to it, scenes were they were happy and having fun with each-other make you feel happy to see a group of friends being able to see the bright-side in dark situations. And even the language barrier didn't bother me, sure I don't speak french, and sure the subtitles were a bit wonky every now and then, but still, I was able to understand everything that was going on. Of course, like everything, this series has some issues, but very minor (at least to me). Overall, this was a very well crafted, short series, that I hope does well enough to warrant a second season because, honestly, I can't wait to see where they take the story, and what will happen next given the circumstances of were they left off.",66 out of 93 found this helpful.,8.0,15 September 2019

2205,Marianne, A show that's undecided whether it wants to be a serious horror drama or a quirky black comedy,"France has brought us horror favorites such as 'High Tension', 'Martyrs' and 'Inside'. From Netflix, on the other hand, we got last year's excellent horror offering ""The Haunting of Hill House"".
So I got really excited, when this French horror show hit Netflix and early reviewers seemed to be stoked. Unfortunately, 'Marianne' turned out to be very different from the examples above. It's mostly reminiscent of Sam Raimi's dark horror comedy 'Drag Me To Hell', including a gross out old lady, a lot of quirkiness and body horror. But the problem here is, that 'Marianne' also wants to be a drama. That doesn't work at all, as neither the story nor the characters can ever really be taken seriously. It's a tonally incoherent mess, jumping back and forth from scares to comic relief moments. The characters are either unlikable (such as the rather pretentious lead) or bland, or both. On the plus side, there's the nice scenery and cinematography. The scare scenes are mostly effective (albeit nothing we haven't seen before). So this could have been a great show, if the characters were more compelling, the narrative more straightforward and above all, void of the unecessary comic relief.",108 out of 182 found this helpful.,6.0,22 September 2019

2224,Kill la Kill, Adoringly Insane,"Straight off the bat, I'll admit that I'm not that much of an avid anime watcher. I adore Attack on Titan (and RWBY, but I'm not sure if that counts as ""real"" anime) but overall, I usually stay away from anime television shows. But Kill La Kill, my God, that sure caught my eye. Many believe that the story of Kill La Kill isn't the strongest, whereas I believe that it is one of its better areas. Looking back, I can't say I recollect any similar synopses compared to other shows. (IMDB states that 1985's 'Sukeban Deka' was an influence to the creators, but I have never heard of this series before, and it ended in 1982, leaving a void to fill) Kill La Kill has certainly filled this gap. <br/><br/>The first episodes very quickly set the precedent and foundations of the story, while remaining entertaining. Ryuko and her lovable though overly-obsessive friend Mako lead us on a very enjoyable ride through Honnouji Academy, where Ryuko aims to discover the identity of her father's killer.<br/><br/>Overall, a very absorbing, riveting story, combined with relatable and lovable characters and simple yet sharp animation creates a perfect mould for an extremely fascinating TV show. With the series looking to be running into late March/early April 2014, there is still plenty of time to start from the beginning to catch the end before the season draws to a close.<br/><br/>If you can look past the possible over-sexualisations and spontaneity, I thoroughly recommend this anime, even for those not necessarily of the anime persuasion.",47 out of 55 found this helpful.,10.0,26 January 2014
2225,Kill la Kill, Really stupid and really good,"This is that sort of anime that can be serious at times but shouldn't be taken seriously by the audience.

The action sequences are the highlights though, they are super stylized and insane to watch. <br/><br/>Considering I only checked this anime out because its made by the same guys who made gurren lagann, i had really high hopes for it. But the thing is that this is not gurren lagann. its different. It doesn't take itself seriously and its more of a parody of every single anime in existence however it still manages to maintain an original story. <br/><br/>All in all, this type of anime is rare. Its silly and surprisingly good. Not to mention the generous amounts of fan service that the creators crammed into every scene. <br/><br/>Also the main character, Ryuko is totally bad ass although really cliché.

2226,Kill la Kill, A visual extravaganza,This show is not for the uninitiated. It is a show for people well versed in anime as a lot of the fun lies in understanding the moments of parody. The whole parodies conventions of anime especially fan service. The show only tries to do one thing and that is to create one epic fight scene after another and in this regard it is unmatched in any anime since maybe Dragonball Z only unlike DBZ the fight scenes take 10 minutes not 10 episodes to end. In spite of being a pretty light hearted show it manages to create some really well rounded characters with understandable motivations and an underlying symbolism related to female sexuality but none of that should distract you from the absolute joyride of an anime,38 out of 46 found this helpful.,9.0,8 February 2014

More than being a simple parody however, KlK does sport a decent story line complete with plot twists, decent character development (albeit absurd, of course) and a well-matched soundtrack.

The show is about a teenage girl who is looking for the murderer of her father and ends up at an academy run by a fascist student council. Students at the school, depending on their rank and club, have uniforms that grant them superhuman abilities. The the gist of it. The series has very likable characters and solid humor, though Mako can get slightly annoying at times. The animation is solid and the music is memorable. Overall the presentation is good. Some people are put off this series because of the fanservice, but trust me, it's not bad. I mean, it's not in your face, borderline erotica.

2231,Kill la Kill," Kill la Kill, turns it up to 12","Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann turned it up to 11; Kill la Kill takes things ""one louder"" (to quote Nigel Tufnel).<br/><br/>It is everything one could expect from the team who brought us Gurren Lagann. It presents a show about the bonds of friendship, and pursuing one's goals to the very end, against any and all odds.<br/><br/>Ryuko Matoi brings us a synthesis of Kamina and Simon, with Mako Mankanshoku as her companion (not quite Simon, but with many of his characteristics as a youth), as Ryuko faces off against Kiriyuin Satsuke and her assembled team of Super High School Student Council Members.<br/><br/>And there are very complex character interactions, as is common for Imaishi and Nakashima. The interplay between Ima Gamagoori and Mako Mankanshoku is an endearing and compelling interplay between the two.<br/><br/>The action is even faster and more chaotic than in Gurren Laggan, with some darker themes as well.<br/><br/>And, like Gurren Laggan, there are common jokes that run throughout the series, such as Mako's frenetic exposition during times of moral outrage at the wrongs of the world and people's behavior.<br/><br/>Invest the time in this show. Watch it more than once. The things you pick up on the second viewing will be worth it.",12 out of 16 found this helpful.,,24 January 2014
2232,Kill la Kill, Over the top and crazy anime,This series follows protagonist Ryuko Matoi as she joins the Honnouji Academy; a school dominated by head of the student council Satsuki Kiryuin; she rules with the help of the 'Elite Four'. They maintain discipline with an iron fist and transgressors are severely punished or even executed! Their influence isn't limited to the school; where a family lives is dependent on their child's status in the school. The senior pupils are able to dominate the others because of the 'life fibres' woven into their clothing; these give the wearers amazing powers. Ryuko however has her own special uniform; it is sentient and made entirely of Life Fibres; using this she plans to take on the ruling elite and ultimately discover who is responsible for the death of her father.<br/><br/>This series is over the top crazy that is the whole point of it! The fighting takes up most of the run time; amazingly each fight seems to be bigger than the last until ultimately it is a battle to save all of humanity! These fights are largely played for laughs although it is clear that the characters could get hurt and sometimes do. As the series progresses the plot advances nicely and there are some nice twists along the way. The costumes are fairly skimpy but the animation style means it is mocking fan service rather than pandering to it. This style is quite different to most anime; backgrounds are imaginative but less detailed and the movement is more frenetic than most series; this gives the show a western feel similar to that used in 'Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt'. As this seems to be one of the most talked about series of the moment and plenty of people are raving about it I'd definitely recommend checking it out even though I found it a bit too much at times.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.,8 out of 11 found this helpful.,8.0,30 March 2014
2233,Kill la Kill, oddly entertaining,"upon the suggestion of a good friend, I decided this might be a good anime to watch, and he wasn't wrong. The immense creativity in this anime far surpasses what I usually expect from an animated product. its a story about a girl named Ryuko Matoi who is on a journey to find her fathers killer, armed with only half of his scissorblade. unfortunately, at the school she decides t loom in, the entire student body wears immensely powering clothes called goku uniforms. After being defeated easily, she stumbles upon a very reveling but empowering living unifrom named senketsu, and with its help and the support of an odd girl named mako, she must find out the truth about her fathers murder. just the synopsis is so ridiculous that only japan could try their hand on it.<br/><br/>this anime is so over-the-top, quickly paced, and well animated that it owns a place in my heart.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,26 October 2014
2234,Kill la Kill, One of the best shows I've seen.,"How on earth can I describe how absolutely amazing this show was? I watched it with the intention of passing time, knowing only that it was short and expecting not to care for it. Hec, I didn't even want to like it. But one episode in and I was laughing my head off (and that doesn't happen often) and by the second or third I was in love.And I never wanted it to end. For a idea that makes little to no sense most of the time it somehow manages to create a reasonable story that works perfectly. And the story wasn't overly predictable (Although I could call some of the plot points in advance, the shear amount of unexpected things that happened outnumber them spectacularly) and most importantly, the action was spectacular. There was not one thing about this show that frustrated me (aside from it's short length, but 25 amazing episodes is better than 200 meh ones).<br/><br/>Simply...

2238,Kill la Kill, Triggers first visual masterpiece,"Visuals: 9
Ok, the visuals were great! The style is great, all of Triggers shows have really good styles and this show isn't an exception. The animation succeeds in two different; it's probably the most visually funny. For example, in one of the episodes Ryoku is in a hurry and needs to transform as fast as possible (think it was the episode where Satsuki challenges the students and if they would lose they need to quit the school). And by just speeding her transformation animation just a little, they make it look like she's in a hurry and funny. I don't even know if that was supposed to be a joke, but that's one of the many visual gags. They also manage to REALLY make it look like all the powerful are really happening. How the ""camera"" shakes, the air shots away and if something gets an impact you really feel it. Whenever there's a scene in the past, color palette changes and I really like that color palette. I also really liked that whenever a text would come up (for example when someone puts on their Goku suit and they show the name of the suit) sometimes they would interact with them, but not too much so that it becomes fourth wall breaking. Both OP's had good animation, but the first one was more interesting IMO. There were also small things that I really liked, but it wasn't perfect.<br/><br/>My biggest con with the visuals was the sexuality. Some were fine, it was there and didn't distract me. But some were very weird. Ryokus and Satsukis transformations and suit, in general, were too sexual in my opinion. The buttons on Ryuukos suit even looked like nipples. The suits were just too ridiculous. And then there was Aikurou. I liked that he changed personality, but why did he randomly? It was very weird and distracting. I also didn't like the black bars on the sides when there was a flashback scene. I also didn't like how Ragyous hair was rainbow colored, there were some digital zooms that looked bad and sometimes they would repeat an action shot 5 times in a row which looked really weird.<br/><br/>Oh, and the action was really good too.<br/><br/>Music: 8
I really like the music. Some were fine, but they were mostly good. The first OP had a fine soundtrack, but the second one was really good IMO. My favorites were Ambiguous (OP 2), KIRYUG@KILL and Ad la Lib.<br/><br/>Plot/Script: 9
This was really good too. It was interesting, I really like Ryuukos relationship with Senketsu, Tsumugu's intent in the beginning isn't evil which makes him turning over to ""her side"" not feeling too weird, I like that the person wearing the suit can get too angry for the suit to handle (so it's good that it only happens once when Ryuuko meets her fathers killer the first time), I like that the academy was basically an experiment to see how humans could take the power life fibers, the plot twists were unpredictable (IMO), Ryuuko and Satsukis relationship in the end and Senketsus death was handled really well and emotional. But there were many small things I didn't like, like that they throw in Mako if anything bad happens to Ryuuko.<br/><br/>Characters: 8
They were mostly really good. I really like that when Satsuki becomes friends with Ryuuko and her gang, her personality doesn't change too much. But Mako wasn't funny, mostly when she did those blue background comedy scenes. She even did those in the middle of an emotional scene, which just ruined it! Ragyou also feels like a character I have felt a hundred times, otherwise, I liked her.<br/><br/>Overall: 9",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,11 March 2019

It's full of energy, with its pompous characters, which frankly I found to be more annoying than anything.<br/><br/>This is just the most over the top Anime I've yet to watch, and to be honestly, I'm not a massive fan of it. I appreciate what it is, and it's somewhat enjoyable. I can praise its style, and while I usually like these fresh and stylish types of show, it just isn't my cup of tea.<br/><br/>If you like what you see, then definitely give it a shot, but if this isn't your type of show, then I can't recommend it.",7 out of 13 found this helpful.,6.0,5 July 2019
2242,Kill la Kill, Really silly and over the top but seriously awesome,"From the minds who brought you the absolute absurdity of Gurren Lagann comes Kill La Kill, a show where an extremely attractive, essentially naked teenager beats the crap out of people with half of a giant scissor with the help of a talking sailor uniform. Sounds freaking amazing! Is it? For the most part, yeah. I'd actually say this is much better than Gurren Lagann, as this show is more consistent in terms of quality. Not saying Gurren Lagann was bad, but it took me a while to get into. From episode one to episode twenty four of Kill La Kill (except episode 7), I found it awesome. The story is very unoriginal and kind of follows Gurren Lagann's plot structure now that I think about it, but that isn't the point of this show. It wants to slam you over the head with beautifully animated, epic fight scenes while doling out plenty of fan service. And it does that perfectly. I like all these characters. Ryuko Matoi, Satsuki Kiryuin, and the Elite Four are entertaining thanks to their awesomeness in battle,and Mako Mankanshoku and her family bring some truly hilarious comic relief to the table. It isn't without problems though. Episode seven is bad. I won't spoil it, but trust me, it's no good. That, and I didn't like one thing about the ending. Again, won't spoil it, but you'll know it when you see it. Those two very minor things are nowhere close enough for me to advise against watching this, however, so go watch it!

I needed some pauses while watching it, because my heart couldn't take the weight that it possessed sometimes. The only reason I continued to watch, was because I wanted to hear the OP again, sland soon.<br/><br/>Overall the anime gets a 8/10 because the characters were well built and the plot had no holes, but the ending felt really rushed, considering that they had to sum up the content of 60-70 chapters of manga to 12 episodes. I couldn't stand the ending, so I picked up the manga (Which is 240 chapters long) and read it from start to the last released chapter in three days.

2258,Domestic Girlfriend, Domestic Girlfriend,"Natsuo Fujii is a high school student who has developed strong feelings for Hina, one of his teachers; he knows any relationship is impossible so agrees to go to a mixer with friends. Here he meets Rui, a girl who surprises him with an unexpected request... she wants him to have sex with her so she can find out what it is like; she is not after a relationship. He accepts and afterwards doesn't expect to see her again. Shortly afterwards his father remarries and as well as a new step mother he acquires two step-sisters... Hina and Rui! His life is about to get complicated. In the background to this Natsuo has joined the school literature club as he hopes to become a writer on day.<br/><br/>I was a little unsure about watching this series but I'm glad I did. Thankfully it avoided gratuitous fan service and forced comic situations in favour a rather touching drama. It handles two taboos; relationships between step-siblings and those between a teacher and her pupil in a mature manner. This gives many genuinely emotional scenes as well as keeping the viewer guessing as to how his relationships will develop. There aren't too many main characters; this means that the characters of Natsuo, Hina and Rui can be developed impressively. The secondary characters are still fun and each contribute nicely to the story. The series has a solid ending which doesn't eliminate the possibility of a second season... I have no idea if there will be more but I certainly hope there is.

2264,Domestic Girlfriend, Someone's fetish being animated.,"I watched this as a joke because I saw the plot, and I had to see how bad this was. I was bored okay? It's quarantine... Essentially in the first episode our main character, Natsuo, who is barely developed, finds a random girl, Rui, who asks him to have sex with her... Already a completely contrived and unrealistic moment for forced hentai. Our protagonist feels bad about it because he has a crush on his teacher, Hina... Somehow it's going to get worse.
Moving along the rest of the pilot, this is mostly cliched and mediocre side characters and school scenes that have no thought put into them and are incredibly boring. None of the humor hits, unless it was unintentional from the terribly storyline. Probably 90% of this series is filler. There's nothing original, nothing good, literally everything is mediocre to bad. There is no direction, boring character designs, still shots, minimal movement, except the hentai scenes of course...
The big twist comes, and it turns out that Natsuo's dad is getting married to the mother of Hina and Rui... This is the teacher student threesome incest harem anime.
The characters are actually so bad I can barely describe them. Natsuo has no characters traits except he wants to be a novelist, and likes Hani. Rui is the quiet girl, if it wasn't evident by her dark hair and monotonous voice. In the second episode she makes Natsuo go to the bathroom while they're both naked because the episode needed some hentai material! Hani is just a teacher, she's nicer and lighter, but with a dark secret. It turns out she's having an affair with a married guy. There's some scenes that are supposed to be sad, at least I think because of the generic sad piano music in the background... just bad melodrama. There are other characters too, but mostly useless and indescribable. There's the parents which could've been explored seeing their children being in a relationship, but nope. There is the offensive gay stereotype character who is used for unfunny jokes. He has some yakuza backstory that doesn't matter. We also have one of Natsuo's friends, Fumiya, who is literally just there for exposition.
In the third episode our protagonist finds out about Hina's affair and confronts her about it, and then assaults her with a kiss, so she slaps him, which seems like the only reasonable action done by any of the characters. Just kidding cause then she starts making out with him... The episode ends setting up Natsuo and Rui trying to stop Hina's affair. Then there's one of the stupidest most forced moments of melodrama ever... So basically these geniuses Natsuo and Rui were gone for 2 days, so their parents were about to get divorced, and Hina is sad an apologizes. There's the cliche piano music, crying, and stupid writing you'd come to expect from this anime so far.
Episode 4 begins with these characters trying to do their plan, the idiotic plan being calling the guy pretending to be Hina to break up. We get forced shower scene with Hina for the horny people. Plot twist! While Rui, Natsuo, and Fumiya discuss the plan in a bar, Hina and her boyfriend arrive! Here we go with more contrived melodrama. They discuss everything, while they get served some pasta with sausages eerily cut to seem like cocks... I can't make this up. They argue with the sad piano music, Rui throws water on the guy, and everyone leaves. This is probably the best episode so far because there's actual development given, with Hina's relationship, but there's also this useless flashbacks to Natsuo's mother that don't really do anything. The episode ends with Hina breaking up with her boyfriend, and it's like it never happened... basically it was pointless.
The next episode introduced us to Momo, yet another useless character. She's just the nice ignorant character. Apparently she's been in 30 relationships. That's all what we know about her. Now there's tension because Rui has to compete with Momo for Natsuo's affection... Rui is sick, so Natsuo has to take care of her, and there's more sexual tension built, they really want you to keep watching with the incest baiting. Then we get the greatest scene in the series, where Natsuo has to put a suppository in Rui's bum... I knew this show would be weird, but I wasn't expecting this... I was laughing throughout and then when Rui said ""wrong one"" when he tried to put it in I lost it. Then we get a conversation between Momo and Natsuo which almost leads to sex. We get the obligatory tiddy shot, but then Natsuo notices cuts on her wrists! Is this show going to have depth?! Nope, Momo is literally forgotten for the rest of the series.
The next episode we get introduced to Miu who is another one or none dimensional character. She's useless. In addition to Reiji, who is a teacher. At least he helps out with Natsuo's goal later. This episode was just boring, nothing really happens, I guess he kisses Miu, but it means nothing.
Episode 7 shows Hina explaining why she got together with the guy in an affair. Coincidentally he was her teacher. Natsuo confesses his feelings for Hina at a beach, so she takes him into the water to commit double suicide... I really can't make this up. They actually tried to give Hina more characterization with her father being getting divorced, but it's just so shallow and thoughtless. Then Rui comes and she wants to kiss Natsuo... so they do. To end the episode for no reason we get Hina pleasuring herself and of course Natsuo watches. So far the only sexual stuff that had plot relevance was in the pilot and that was already forced. It's all filler. I should've dropped this series.
Episode 8 just has this random blonde guy and Natsuo stopping this underwear thief, and then some conflict between Rui and Natsuo because he was apparently trying to set her up with the blonde guy, which leads them to kiss and then Hina walks in of course. This causes Hina to move out.
This next episode brings back Hina's ex, but for no real reason. More melodrama with the characters missing Hina. Hina gives Natsuo a key to her new house, so he goes, they kiss. If it seems like I'm skipping a lot from these episodes, it's because I am. The rest of the scenes are more garbage filler.
We're in the last 3 episodes. Natsuo and Hina are actually fully pursuing this relationship. He breaks his leg, which causes them to be apart. Oh no! Now Rui is glad she can spend more time with him. We get another obligatory bath scene with Rui and Natsuo to help him with his broken leg. Natsuo says he's going to a friend's house, but it's actually Hina's house. Then we almost get another bath scene with Natsuo and Hina! They decide not to but they almost have sex. Plot twist! Rui comes and sees Natsuo is at Hina's home and runs off crying. This is the brilliant storytelling and character development ive come to expect. Everything is basically revealed now. More melodrama, more contrivances, more filler... just wonderful character development.
This is the big episode. Rui is depressed for obvious reasons, so the best way to show her depressed is in a bathtub! Also Rui is ""going to make an effort to dislike"" Natsuo. Natsuo get's some tiny characterization since he wants to become an author. Now there's a school trip so there's an excuse to have all the female characters in bikinis. Hina wants to break up for Rui, but Natsuo wants to get serious. Guess what happens? Epic hentai time... Plot twist! While fireworks were going on someone conveniently managed to take a picture of them kissing in their apartment!
The finale. Somehow you think it couldn't possibly get worse... Hina is decides to leave the school after her relationship with Natsuo is discovered by the principal. She meets with one of the teachers, and they even try to justify the relationship because love... Natsuo goes to Hina's house but she's gone and leaves a note explaining that she needed to leave to keep them secret and that he should move on and become a novelist. Top 10 saddest anime moments! One of my favorite moments, we see Natsuo go outside and scream. It was literally a still frame, and some screeching. I burst out laughing. Natsuo is depressed. We get one of the only decent scenes where his friend tells him to stop wallowing and move on because she did it so he can follow his dream. Depressed Natsuo decides to write a novel. Once he goes he gives it to his teacher, Reiji secretly submits it for literary awards. Can you guess what happens? He gets the first prize of the amateur division. He gets 300k yen. Then he goes home and it seems PLOT TWIST! Hina is back, but it's just Rui with a wig for no reason. So now how do we end this brilliant series? With Rui and Natsuo about to have sex...
In conclusion this anime made me feel something I wasn't expecting. Pain that someone wrote this, animated this, etc. and are getting paid. Apparently the manga is better, but there's no way im checking it out. I only feel pain and regret. I wasted like 5 hours of my life. This is essentially marketable hentai. To be fair there were a few funny moments... like the suppository scene... oh god. There's really nothing good about this series. Everything is horrible. I have nothing else to say, I don't want to waste more time. I understand some people enjoying this, but I actually watch Anime for the storytelling and characters. I'm not watching for a teacher student threesome incest harem. This is a 2/10 because technically speaking it could've been worse, but this is definitely the worst anime I've watched thus far.",13 out of 26 found this helpful.,2.0,5 July 2020

Great tie-ins with the original series (comparable to the 'Six Million Dollar Man' and 'The Bionic Woman' - but so much better; don't judge those shows through a 2019 lens, they were great in the '70s), with a fantastic independent mystery/thriller setup with unusual twists in each episode.<br/><br/>Not to mention the genius casting- two of my favorite character actors, Famke Jenssen and Terry O'Quinn, playing the star-crossed, brilliant yet potentially crazy divorced couple. They happen to be the true parents of 'The Blacklist''s Tom Keen, Ryan Eggold - whose likability and attractiveness is through the roof - and he must have his pick of casting in multiple shows at this point.

The show is very fast-paced, and unlike Scorpion, they do not explain how everything works, or fill in their entire plan for us to follow along in fascination. Mainly because they just don't have the time. This pilot episode took place on two continents, and they were on the clock. The actors are all enjoyable, except for the geek: he seems to be part-genius, part-comic relief. Hopefully he will improve with time. And the underlying arc about Tom's parents is interesting, keeping us guessing about their motivations.

It will be nice to see Liz and Red join the fray. I am enjoying it thus far 3 episodes in and look forward to seeing what is next. I find good stories are not in if the story has similarities to other stories but the nuances of how the story is told and the feelings we get toward the characters who are setting the pace. <br/><br/>I have always thought Tom was a bad ass and loved Famke she is top notch and nice on the eyes.

(That sub par subplot is like an obvious bad joke that most people are smart enough to avoid and the writers of this train wreck though was too clever to miss.<br/><br/>Back to Martinez, his taking up space in front of a camera doesn't qualify as acting and his stilted saying of words doesn't even rate as reading aloud. Perhaps this hour of almost dead air will attract enough people who don't bother changing the channel that the show will continue past the eight episodes that are already paid for.

The worst thing it does is it is actively destroying the genius of The Blacklist. It is as if The Clintons were producing The Blacklist. Mindless moronic Zombie viewing. What were they thinking?

This series, however, does not have a lead Character, to carry the show. The entire cast seems to be made up of supporting type actors. I have to assume that Famke Janssen is considered the lead Actor/Actress in this series, but she just isn't good enough to carry a series. I have enjoyed her past work and don't want to sound like I am blaming her for this poor rating. There didn't seem to be much effort put into the script for the premiere. It was just standard good guy vs Bad Guy stuff for today's political climate. I don't expect much from actors/actress's these days, but even bad actors require a good script to work from.

I found it hard to believe the female lead was old enough to be his mother but I checked and found a 20 year difference. The actors mostly lacked an on screen presence but maybe they were not given any material to work with. The father is a possible exception.

I watch this 5 times a week. I have hours worth of episodes on tape. That's not enough. Colin Mochrie may very well be the funniest man alive. He's on like 12 different TV shows here in Canada. That's not good enough. There's no replacement for what Whose Line offered. Since I believe it was the peak of comedy television, and it's off the air now, I can only conclude that the world will soon become very unfunny and I will probably die a depressed and empty man.

I think it takes a lot of humor and talent to think up these things.  Plus the way Colin Mockery says lines in some of the games it seems like he has all of the one-liners planned, because they are so perfect and intricate.  Which makes him all the funnier, because he says this long line and it all leads up to a simple, funny punch line.<br/><br/>So I do believe this to be a great comedy game show.

2301,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, A New and Updated Version of a Classic,"This is the American version of the original British improvisation show, with many recognizable faces from the first series.  Drew Carey is the most recent host, and he does a good job, but nobody can do it like Clive Anderson once did.  Apparently, Anderson has returned here as an occasional host, but I have yet to see him on the re-runs, something that I am looking forward to.<br/><br/>Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie, both of whom made the original show very entertaining in the latter years, have returned here to once again amaze and entertain with their on-the-spot comedy.  As well, Wayne Brady has been added to the cast, and he is a heavy-hitter, especially when it comes to making up songs on the spot.  Often pairing with Brad Sherwood or Chip Esten, his musical/comedic talents are second to none.  Other past contestants such as Josie Lawrence and Greg Proops can be seen on some nights, which is a welcome gesture to fans of the show's older cousin.<br/><br/>Once again, the comedic talents of all the contestants are simply amazing, as they make up skits on the spot.  Many of the games from the original version of the show have been kept, with the addition of some new ones that maintain originality.  Much of the show's format remains the same, which is excellent, but unfortunately, the show is kept more mainstream by the American censors, as the original show contained more off-colour humour, and even some profanity, which added to the show in general.  Despite this fact, the new WLiiA rises above many of the other comedy shows on national television.<br/><br/>My Rating:  10/10",43 out of 46 found this helpful.,,31 May 2000

The best games, I think, are: ""Props"", ""Questions only"", ""Scenes from a hat"", and ""Hoedown"".

2303,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, The only show that truly makes me laugh,"I have been a fan of Whose Line? since forever, and I'm am so relieved that they are coming back for another season. I've always favored the Amercian version over the British version, only because it is more current and has more American humor. I do however miss some of the old pros like Mike Mcshayne and Tony Slattery. I'm torn between the hosts Drew Carey and Clive Anderson, but for now, I think Drew is holding up nicely. Anyway, Whose Line? is the only show that ever really made me cry from laughter. I love the colorful cast and the clever yet random humor. What I love most about it is the concept of a bunch of friends doing old fashion improv and having a good time just being dumb and random.<br/><br/>Whose Line is it Anyway? is totally worth watching for comedy lovers all around.",37 out of 42 found this helpful.,,25 March 2005

They are the best comedy duo I have ever seen. As best friends, they take nothing seriously and never hesitate to insult each other (various bald jokes and big nose quirks are aplenty!) and host Drew Carey.

Drew Carrey is an excellent host, and even though he is no where near as comically talented as the improv actors, he is still funny, and doesn't take himself seriously, so seems very likable. The improv actors are all talented in their own ways. Wayne Brady is excellent at singing, and is better working by himself, or with one of the rotation guests. Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie are hilarious together because of their dry sarcasm. Even when they mess up it's funny, because they brilliantly cover it up and joke about it.

A lot of jokes on the British version are things you might expect to see from those crazy Brits, but that makes it all the better.  My two favorite guys on the show would definitely have to be Ryan Stiles, who is on both versions, and Colin Mochorie?  I should probably look back on the main page to spell his name right, but I'm lazy!  When it comes to making up songs, and really good ones at that, the best is definitely Wayne, who never stops amazing me.  These guys are all hilarious and they have so much talent, it isn't funny.

2309,Whose Line Is It Anyway?," Just as good as the British version, in some ways better","I love comedy, and WHOSE LINE IS IT ANYWAY? is without a doubt the best comedy show on TV right now. I love this show a lot, it's even inspired me to practice improv comedy on my own. I also watch the British version on Comedy Central. It's good, but I like this version a little better. This is probably because I prefer American comedy over British comedy. I'll take SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE over MONTY PYTHON anyday.<br/><br/>Drew Carey is a fairly good host, although most of his jokes really don't work, and the ones that do are obviously prepared before hand and he tends to use over and over. But Clive was a lot like this too, even though he was much wittier than Drew is.<br/><br/>Part of the reason that the American version is better is because most of the best performers from the British version are back in this version, such as Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie, Greg Proops and Josie Lawrence. It's a shame that we're missing such greats as Tony Slattery and Mike McShane, though. A lot of the other performers on the British version weren't so good, but the American version has had their share of bad performers (Karen Maruyama, Kathy Kinney). There are also some fresh new faces that are really good, like Kathryn Greenwood, Denny Siegel, Greg Proops and Wayne Brady.<br/><br/>The set is also a lot cooler looking on the American version and Laura Hall is a better musician than Richard Vranch. One thing the British version has that is better is the randomness. Even though I prefer Colin and Ryan being in every episode, I don't like how it's often the same four guys over and over and wish we could get some new people, or show some of the others more often. For the record, my favorite performer is Colin Mochrie, my favorite hodown is ""Going Bald"" and my favorite game is ""Whose Line"".

2311,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, A Shadow Of The Original Series,"Whose Line is it anyway?(1998) <br/><br/>Review: I loved The original series. It was uncensored, witty, fresh and downright hilarious. Now, Whose Line goes Hollywood. Here's my take:<br/><br/>Let me start off with the improvisers in seat order:<br/><br/>Seat #1: The seat-filler comic. This one is named that for a reason. This seat is normally taken by improvisers who have little to no talent. They barely lift a finger throughout the show and are insignificant. Or it is filled by Chip Esten who is no different. The only exception here is it is rarely filled by Greg Proops. Greg is funny. He still has got it. He is one of the few that does deliver the goods, but is starting to show some rust. Remember, he is rarely here.<br/><br/>Seat #2 Wayne Brady. Wayne is different. He is however not a improviser. Wayne is here to pretty much sing and show off. He has single handedly butchered Song styles. It's the same thing every time. Every time! The original Whose Line's Song styles had songs about such mundane things such as dog poop to a bag of chips. That's what improv is about! Not the same love song EVERY time. This is Whose Line, not American Idol! Wayne does have tons of charisma, but improv is not his style.<br/><br/>Seat #3 Colin. Colin is a Whose line alumni. He was awesome during the British version, but here is still funny, but is showing lots of rust. Every once in a while, he would use some stuff from the original whose line. Other times it just is not funny. He still has lots of energy and can deliver some laughs, he is a shadow of his former self. He not awful at all, just washed up. He does get a little old after a while.<br/><br/>Seat #4 Ryan Styles. Ryan is another Whose Line alumni. However see Colin for pretty much the same thing. Only difference is Colin has more energy, and is a little more funny.<br/><br/>More: We hardly see any of the old school games. Also, the new Whose Line has butchered ""Questions Only"". Instead of just the original of just asking questions, we get additions such as ""impressions"". You ask a question while impersonating someone. 99% of the time, I do not know who they are until Wayne Brady does his Scooby Doo(which he does every time during this game). Hideous.<br/><br/>Drew Carey is another problem. He is not a good host. His host power is not there. Clive had wit and charm. Drew is wooden and lame. Drew should also learn that improv is not as easy as it looks. Drew at the end decides to partake in the improv 90% of the time replacing the seat filler comic. Drew is TERRIBLE at improv. He has not wit, no comedic charisma, and a terrible delivery. Clive Anderson knew he was not a improviser so he stayed as host. Drew should do the same.<br/><br/>And lastly, Josie Lawrence made a special appearance here. It was nice till during her improv she cursed. Just then Drew stopped her act and said that you can't do that here. In the British version, anything goes and you can get away with anything you say, here you cannot. This show has restrictions. The original did not.<br/><br/>One more thing, I HATE the Irish drinking song. Annoying is just the start of this. It gets worse if Drew Carey gets involved. (cold shiver goes up my spine) <br/><br/>The Last Word: Desecration. Whose Line went Hollywood. What a damn mistake. The comedy is watered down. The antics are sometimes lame to re-used. Drew Carey is a terrible host, and the show has restrictions. What was once great has fallen so far. Ignore this. Stick to the original series instead.",6 out of 16 found this helpful.,2.0,9 March 2007
2312,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Impov at its best,"I can't tell you how much this show influenced me. I used to watch this show while I was in High School, and since then even my type of humor is like Whose line. Even more than Friends (which Whose Line cast hated by the way).... one of my all time favorites....<br/><br/>This is one of the best improv shows I've ever seen, hats off to all those who ever did this, even for an episode.<br/><br/>I would like to especially mention Ryan and Colin. They are the jewels in the crown. But that doesn't make the crown any less significant. I don't really see people mentioning ""Brad Sherwood"", but I always loved his quirky and out of the blue ""Weird News Casters"" names like, ""Chester Snapdragon-Mcfisticuff"" or like ""Giesebel Spankbottom"", he was also really good at 2 Line Vocab, along with the other stuff. And who can forget Wayne, he was the best singer in the batch, and his shotgun lyrics were just a piece of his talent. The show was simple, off the hook and innovating every day. <br/><br/>Drew Carey was good too, but could have been better.<br/><br/>This type of shows can run forever, but sadly they don't. So after 8 years of running it was taken off air, but fans of comedy like us will always be hopeful.<br/><br/>Long story short, immensely talented people all mashed up to make a great show.

2314,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Could have been a lot better...and should have had a good host.,"I don't hate this programme despite my score of 5 but it is one of those shows that has good and bad points.<br/><br/>Of course i am a huge fan of the British original version but i do think it's good that they made it in America for a new audience. This version provides some laughs but i don't find myself having to watch every episode like i do with the British one.<br/><br/>OK firstly the good points- Ryan and Colin are as funny as ever and are a great team, they are very talented improvisers and are clearly pros.<br/><br/>Any appearance of Greg Proops is a definite advantage (although he gets less to do in this version).<br/><br/>Good games like Greatest hits and party quirks are always filled with laughs.<br/><br/>OK, the not so good points- In my opinion far too many songs games, i love music but there was far too much and it was always Wayne Brady (sure, he's a very good singer but sometimes it's funnier to have a not so good singer) There isn't a rotation of the players, it was Ryan, Colin and Wayne every single episode with usually either Greg, Brad or Chip as the other guest which became hugely repetitive. The same people did the same games and the guest player always had to be the host of the party or the guesser.<br/><br/>There were no guests from the original series apart from Josie Lawrence once. The best thing about the original is the players being from Britain, America, Canada and more.<br/><br/>There was no Tony Slattery (the best player ever).<br/><br/>The bad point- Drew Carey, i'm sorry but he is the most unfunny man ever, i don't get his appeal at all. My family and I almost press mute every time he speaks, in fact the show would be a lot funnier if he weren't involved. There is something so smug about him and when he joins in i cringe as he is usually terrible.<br/><br/>I think this programme could have been a lot funnier considering the talent of the performers but it almost feels too polished a lot of the time. Colin in fact is the main reason i watch it and if he wasn't on it, it would probably put me off.",3 out of 8 found this helpful.,5.0,8 February 2008
2315,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Take it back to Britain and bring Clive back,"There are several problems that I have with this version.<br/><br/>1. The American audience. It makes my skin crawl everytime I hear the audience squealing and whooping to EVERYTHING. Its the most annoying thing in the world! Why do they have to squeal? WHY?! It's completely unnecessary! Even when Drew Carey makes some irritatingly NOT FUNNY throw-away comment, they scream and clap. Perhaps thats why people tend to find certain Americans painfully annoying.<br/><br/>2. Drew Carey Get rid of him. He is a terrible replacement for Clive. Absolutely awful. He has no sense of humour. All he seems to do is make fun of Clive's baldness and other people. He might even be funny if he didn't pause while delivering lines. He is more than cringeworthy.<br/><br/>3. Regulars I absolutely love Colin And Ryan. They are equally hilarious. Wayne Brady is funny but he plays up to the audience far too much. Greg Proops is still funny. In the original, it worked having Colin and Ryan the main regulars. Other performers made appearances when they felt like it, which fitted. Having Colin, Ryan and Wayne regulars leaves little room for guest performers, and tends to make it a bit boring and repetitive.<br/><br/>4. American TV system This is what i found painfully annoying while on holiday. There are ad breaks EVERY 5 minutes without fail. There is no need. It completely ruins the show. There is about 1 game in each segment, which leaves the viewer with time to get bored and consider turning off. Then, at the end of the show, they go to an ad break and come back for the credits! It's an absolute ridicule! The advertising is relentless, as soon as the commercials finish we have ads for other shows plastered across the screen! I don't how the average American survives having to suffer with that kind of TV system. It exists purely for advertisement, NOT for actual entertainment.<br/><br/>Other than these, the show is constantly funny and will continue to be. If only Drew would keep out of it, i'd be happy (and i'm sure a lot of other people would be too).",3 out of 8 found this helpful.,,24 August 2004
2316,Whose Line Is It Anyway?," Review of the Performers (oh yeah, and Drew)","Wayne Brady-Although this guy can SING, maybe that's all they want him for on the show.

He makes funny faces at the beginning and has an untouchable link with Colin Mochrie. He's the one that will keep you crying from laughing. Sound Effects is just too hilarious.<br/><br/>Colin Mochrie-A balding man in his 40's who is hilarious? It's hard to find, but I found it in Colin. This man is incredible. He's tied with Ryan for first favorite improver. His most memorable action that he has repeated many times is his arm waving thing. (anybody seen that?)

2317,Whose Line Is It Anyway?, Best thing on TV at the moment,"I've been watching this programme for as long as I can remember, and it's still great - even though there are two things I dislike about the American version:<br/><br/>Drew Carey: I don't like the way he tries to make it into *his* show. Clive understood his job was to be the guy who (tried to) keep the show going smoothly and throw in the occasional funny comment.... Drew's insistence on being involved in the last sketch almost guarantees it won't be funny.... he seems to have an over-inflated opinion of his own ability.<br/><br/>Wayne Brady: He's clearly a very talented man.... at singing, improvising songs and some other things - but I don't really find him funny - he doesn't seem to have as much natural comic talent as the other regulars.... IMHO.<br/><br/>

The regulars (Wayne Brady, Colin Mochrie, and Ryan Stiles) are all very talented actors, and Greg Proops (or ""Poops"" as my mom and I called him), Brad Sherwood, and Chip Esten are also good as sometimes-improvers.  I never really cared much for the women, except for Kathy Greenwood, who is usually very funny.<br/><br/>To me, this show is outstanding and deserves more credit than it gets.  Some of the best games played are ""Green Screen News,"" ""Sound Effects with Ryan and Colin,"" ""Newsreport,"" ""Scenes from a Hat,"" ""Hoedown,"" ""Wayne Serenedes the Audience Member,"" and the game where they step down off the stairs and say something funny.<br/><br/>Of course, all of the games are good, but these are just my faves and are merely a personal opinion, not a declaration.

2320,Whose Line Is It Anyway?," Funny, but not as good as the British one","This version has Colin Mochrie, Ryan Stiles, Greg Proops (sometimes) and that's about all it has in common with the true spirit of the superior British version.  Anyone who has seen the British version knows that host Clive Anderson's sense of humor was much more subtle (and funny) than Drew Carey, who is just not funny enough to sit at the adults' table on this show. (Most annoyingly, every week he says, ""It's the show where everything's made up and the points don't matter!"" and then looks around for laughter/applause and only gets a mocking laugh from Ryan Stiles.  Clive would say ""I'm going to give Ryan a million points..."" and move on.. much funnier.  Note to Drew:  it's funnier when you don't laugh at yourself.)<br/><br/>The cast is terrific.  Ryan Stiles is an improvisational genius, and he and Colin Mochrie have a great working chemistry together.  The other members are hits and misses (usually pretty competent).  The real find is Wayne Brady who is very talented, although he seems to be more of a performer than a true comedian.  Still, he seems to bring out the most highlights because of his clever songs and characterizations.<br/><br/>The American ""Who's line..."" pales in comparison in two major regards.  The first is that it seems to rely on non-obscure pop culture references (like when the usually funny Greg Proops put on a blond wig and said ""My name is Mimi, and i just hate that Drew Carey!""  Semi-humorous as a reference to the Drew Carey show, but not more than that).  The other downfall is the absence of the inimitable Tony Slattery, the straightlaced psycho of the English show.  <br/><br/>""Who's line..."" is a fun show, but it lacks the wit, the edge and the out-loud laughter of the original... but if you've never seen the original, then you wouldn't care, would you?",2 out of 5 found this helpful.,,16 September 1999

It completely AMAZES me how great his acting is, not even because of him acting as a woman, but the acting of the woman HE IS. You completely forget he is an actor let alone a male actor. Unbelievably good.
Very nice that they decided to put more focus on her more and more as the show progresses. I have many times even rewinded parts of her that were so insanely funny , her just saying some silly remarks in a certain manner that makes it hilarious. For example 'Oh I've never been backstage at a Costco' or 'do you like selfies?'.
Also heartwarming/-breaking to see how much she truly cares for her family. Some times I have even cried , wishing for even half a mother like that.<br/><br/>I actually sometimes skipped the Galafanikis' parts just to see Christine in season1. Also I think it would be nice to give us some more of Martha as well. Her one on one's with Christine are top of the line. I missed seeing people like these. Unperfect, real , but definitely not overly trying to be real (ending up extremely fake) with emo music on top as is displayed in low levelled shows( like 'this is us' for example).<br/><br/>Btw it's weird/hilarious as in how if people see 'comedy' stated as genre, that they keep watching hoping for jokes..and get offended when it's not slapstick laughing track 'funny-ness'. Open your narrow suffocating black/white paradigmed mind.

2330,Baskets, What? No laugh track?,"I can't help it. I've come to love this show. The characters have grown on me. At first I was a bit taken aback at the style of the show. After about the first four episodes I was hooked. I can't wait to see what happens next to my dear Baskets family. The show is original, there is no laugh track, and it's more true to life than most television these days. Chip is a nice guy, an aspiring natural clown, and Bakersfield is a real town. What's not to love. I'll be rooting for Chip and hoping that the show is successful so that it will continue. Kudos to FX for airing this wonderful, refreshingly unique take on the American family. I think that the Baskets are more true to life than most people would care to admit. I for one have been in dire need of characters that are life like in a show. I hate to over analyze.

But, as the series progresses and we get deeper into the characters, I just fell in love. Some people are complaining that it's not a comedy because it has these more real moments in it, but that's IDENTICAL to Louie. Louie is not a laugh riot. There are good laughs throughout the episode, but the meat of each episode is more about the tragedy of being human. Baskets kind of reminds me of Nebraska. The show is does an excellent portrayal of the mundaneness of people's every day lives and their ordinariness. It's really funny and very moving.

2335,Baskets, Why Baskets in Bakersfield?,"At least one resident of Bakersfield should write a review of ""Baskets"" -- so here goes.<br/><br/>I agree with the majority opinion. This is an excellent dark comedy/satire with some amazing acting and quirky, creative scripts.<br/><br/>From now on I will think of Louie Anderson as a middle-aged woman in a man's body. Martha seems dull and naïve but she's actually the sanest character. Zach's characters are amazing tragicomic nutty brothers.<br/><br/>Why is the show set in Bakersfield? Our city has been the butt of jokes in Hollywood for decades. It continues to be the go-to prototype of a backwards redneck town in the worst part of California. Some years back there was a comedy cop show called ""Bakersfield PD"".<br/><br/>I was expecting to see some actual places and settings in or around Bakersfield. Some of the road-trip scenes looked like Kern County but I didn't see any identifiable landmarks. Bakersfield has a few odd cultural events, but clowns are not among them, and we only have the usual kinds of rodeos.<br/><br/>According to IMDb, none of the filming locations were in Bakersfield.

Every scene he does is so brilliantly portrayed, you can see layers and layers of depth to Christine. Is it funny? Well, no it isn't, but his performance walks such a fuzzy line between comedy and drama (much like Louis C.K.'s show) that I'm tempted to label it as an emblematic cipher of humanity; her anger, hopes, memories, limitations, strengths, and relationships to other people are all played out in her every mannerism and facial expression.

2337,Baskets, Looks excellent so far,"Any fan of Louie should also really enjoy this as he is one of the head writers. Like Louie it's beautifully dark, depressing, awkward, and absurd, without being completely over the top. I can't give it a star rating yet, as rating a show as a whole off only the pilot is silly, but I have to say I truly enjoyed the pilot much more than I thought I would and I was going in with pretty high hopes.<br/><br/>I will say this is not for everyone. Anyone who likes Zach Galafianakis because of The Hangover or Due Date will likely be unpleasantly surprised by this side of him. This is more along the lines of his older stand-up and his work with Tim &amp; Eric.<br/><br/>Without spoiling anything there are some slapstick gags that would be considered ""low brow"" by some, but the fact that they are simply there and not acknowledged by anyone maintaining the somber mood of the show makes them much more hilarious than simply the joke itself.<br/><br/>As a final note, Louie Anderson is possibly the best casting choice in history.",43 out of 65 found this helpful.,,22 January 2016

There's some laugh out loud moments for sure, but it's more about the overall quirkiness of the show and journey of baskets the clown, and they hit that nail on the head. Couldn't be better at being exactly what it wants To be, a unique dark comedy that takes a long honest look at the dying middle class of America, and a bizarre and specific family dynamic entrenched within it, clearly with passion put in from top to bottom, which is more than can be said of 97% of tv.

The viewer is torn over the character of Baskets, because he is pathetic, but still, ornery and unlovable. Galifianakis does a great job walking a line between the two. The character of Martha (Martha Kelly), seemingly Basket's only friend, is the Valium to his manic wanderings. She endlessly absorbs the abuse he gives her like a mother being told ""I hate you"" by her 5-year old. The beautiful Penelope, (Sabina Sciubba) who openly married Baskets as a way to stay in America, is cruel, but in such a coolly, detached, unemotional way that you don't even dislike her for it. Louie Anderson as Christine Baskets is hysterical. I laugh more over ""her"" than anything else. He does the parental judgy thing so well.

You have a questionable morale, calculated scandals and a lot of egocentric participants. On the other hand they deliver what you'd expect from such a format and keep the audience entertained throughout most of the play-time. It is thus one more addition to the already big pool of entertainment shows that work through a lot of sex, drama and betrayal.

A ""panel of experts"" has supposedly picked eleven ""perfect"" couples to make us this crew, and the daters have to discover the correct pairings to win the big bucks.<br/><br/>Between all the preening, posing, flirting, and fighting, there are tasks designed either to help them discover their perfect matches or to obfuscate the correct combination of pairings. It's never clear.<br/><br/>I admit I watched the previous season's first and last episodes to get a better perspective on the overall process. I wanted to know if they really learned anything? Was there enlightenment? Were there long-term match-ups? Did they even come close to winning the money? <br/><br/>This exercise helped me see that little changed in the contestants. In the end, there might have been a couple of lessons learned, but their behaviors seemed largely unchanged. And, as suspected, winning the money is a difficult challenge, though not impossible. <br/><br/>If you enjoy watching attractive people with juvenile attitudes and the conviction that being overly dramatic is the best way to be, then this show might be for you.

There is also a challenge each week where the winner and a few other couples go on a date while the rest of the house votes in who they think of the winners is the perfect match and go into the truth booth. If a team voted into the truth booth is a perfect match there essentially out of the game and get to go to the honeymoon booth. Each week they see how many of the pairings they have chosen are perfect matches by beams of light but they don't who are the perfect matches. The goal of the game is to have 10 perfect matches so that they can all share a million bucks and have 10 episodes to do this in. I have no clue if any of the past seasons or the season I am watching have everybody found their perfect match. While watching this show people hook up, think there in love and fight over the various men and women on the show. What bothers me about this show is that people don't continue a relationship once there considered not a match. I't's almost like there ignoring there feelings and go on the notion that the people who do this show know who's right for them.

Also I give special credit to Song Yun-ah who played the role as smart ambitious beautiful and tricky chaebol heirs which you can hardly tell whether she is truly generous or just a gimmick to get sympathy from people. Ji Chang Wook character was half forced to cooperate with this evil woman but he can not refuse her offer because he need her unlimited resources to revenge the death of her lover.

She has absolutely zero charisma on screen and it wasn't convincing especially when it came to the PTSD scenes. She also had zero chemistry with the male lead, so I didn't care much for their romance, which is a shame coz their story was good. She was just a bad actress, I wish they cast someone else.

2366,The K2, Great Action! Cute Romance! Satisfying Drama,"I finished the k2 two weeks ago. I really enjoy this drama very much. The drama has flaws of course but it is very entertaining at least to me. A mercenary soldier was framed for the murder of civilians or his own girlfriend and he was on the run. Later he would be joining to the bodyguards team of one of the president candidate family then he would be called Kim Jeha or the code name K2. There he got a job to watch over the candidate secret daughter who could ruin the candidate career if she is made known to the public as his daughter.<br/><br/>Go Anna was a secret daughter of the president canditate with a famous actress who died and not with his legal wife Choi Yoo Jin who is one of the main villain of our story. One thing is that she really is ambitious to make her family stronger by making her husband a president. She also kept Go Anna as her victim by not letting her see the father and very manipulating with the girl's mind. She could kill anyone who she think will come into her way. Many people are drawn by this character. The actress playing role is really great. Choi Yoo Jin has reasons for her to become evil. She has soft spot for Kim Jeha since he saved her life though she ordered him get killed at first. Jeha joined her side only they had one enemy or the competent another candidate who got Jeha framed for murder. Jeha was a compassionate upright guy who pity the weak or someone who does not have much power. He pity Go Anna for being the victim of her stepmother and her own father. She was all alone like him to which lead him to fall in love with her i think. They both have childlike behavior too as seen in episode 5 when he was looking at her eating ramen and dance happily from CCTV. Jeha is very protective of her and she depends on him quite a lot. She dislike her stepmother for keeping her like this and think she also killed her own mother. In the middle of drama the Choi Yoo Jin's half brother try to make her want to revenge against his sister since he hates his sister and want to be more powerful. Anna give in to him for a time. But at the end of day the it was not the revenge she actually want. She is just finding herself and her past. She really depend on Jeha and care for him most since he is most concern with her being. Although he is fierce fighter, jeha is so smitten with her. They were just breath of fresh air in this dark drama. One more thing i do not think Anna was a weak character but a strong one because we see she try to run away from her own situation to find her father who she long for; who she think loves her and she loves. But she got the warmness she long for from Jeha instead. She might be stupid at a time but i think she is very brave in her situation. <br/><br/>As for Choi Yoo Jin, her power come from her family. She is destined to be evil. Her father was a ruthless man just like how she became. She was competing with her relatives who hates her. She got a good_for_nothing husband who cheats on her. So yep she become a selfish villain. Yet she was very fond of Jeha; not in a romantic way. She was fond of him for his humanity and bravery and being a super hero. But it was too late for her to become good. I was so into these three characters. The political plots were good too. The only problem is that we do not learn Kim Jeha's background very much which i pretty much want to know.for examples like who his parents were and who is he really. I took one point off for this.

2367,The K2, ONE OF THE BEST ACTION KDRAMA,"Underrated but WELL-RECOMMENDED.
DEFINITELY WAY BETTER than the higher rated dramas like Itaewon Class, Goblin, Vagabond (goodluck with that) etc.
Action packed since Ep1 to end.
Not your typical drama where plot is laid out front - hard to predict the outcome until the very end. The cast is great especially Madam Choi (Song Yoon Ah) I LOVE HER.
If there's any negative, it would be the character of Anna - annoyed at her for being helpless.
Overall, great series - debatable top 5 drama all time.
Not sure about the negative comments - they are probably expecting a romantic comedy in this thrilling action packed series.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,6 September 2020
2368,The K2," ""It's only after girls grow up, they become witches?""","This is positively one of the BEST ass-kickingest one season dramas ever. If you don't realize that the role played by Song Yun-ah (maddam Choi Joo-Jin) is one of the best strong female anti-hero characters ever created, you haven't watched movies your entire life for over 50 years.<br/><br/>Jun-ah kills it. She is not only elegant and super-gorgeous, but deliciously malevolent and bad-ass smart, anybody's great companion to the underworld. The end of the second and beginning of the third episode is a phenomenal thumb sketch of both her and Ji Chang Wook's (Kim Je Ha) characters.<br/><br/>In the tradition of fair suspension of disbelief I'll overlook obvious gaffes such as Yoona (Goh Anna) leaving the house with her hair cut short and arriving the next morning with it fully grown out again.<br/><br/>The soundtrack deserves much more love than it's getting on YouTube.

2374,The K2," Bad directing, genre problems","This show is so annoying I registered an account just to tell you how bad it is. **spoilers throughout** Without a doubt, the worst thing that occurs in this entire show is the dancing-with-joy-for-having-found-a-pack-of-ramen-noodles in slow-mo scene, which lasts at least 1-2 minutes and has romantic background music while the male lead stares at her like he's falling in love. What else is wrong with this scene? Well, the girl is so emaciated it is hardly believable that if she ever eats ramen that she keeps it down. Her clothes don't stop you from seeing her bare bones poking out now and then throughout the series. The acting is so bad, especially while dancing with ramen that you feel like fingernails are scraping out the inside of your brain, it's that painful. Thankfully, streaming allows you to skip a lot by jumping ahead. Oh, right, another thing I had to skip a lot: the fight-porn in the first several episodes. Antagonizingly long fight scenes that reminded me of 80's movies. Ugh. True bad-ass fighters don't take that long to take out a bunch of guys, so it just doesn't work. Oh, and let's not forget the 50-naked-guys-in-a-communal-shower fight scene, which also lasted a long time. Skip. Skip. Skip. I know right? And I actually like guys. Didn't anyone ask ""what is the point of this scene being so long?"" Shaky cam throughout. Even when totally inappropriate. Yeah, film-makers snobbily call it ""found footage"" like that makes it more classy, but it's still annoying as hell when not used properly. There were a couple of times it was giving me a headache and I had to look away or skip ahead. Contrived. That style of camera work is best when it fits the action or adds something to the scene. Genre switching like nobody's business. Usually this is a political action thriller type of show, but once in a while they forced the actors to act like they were in a romantic comedy and then there would be cheesy romantic comedy music that didn't fit in AT ALL - and so makes you want to vomit. The characters in those moments had to act so inconsistent to their character from the rest of the show that I felt bad for them. The romance wasn't believable either at all. I don't think that girl is very good, specifically. Except when she's yelling and screaming at people. She seems good at that. The cutesy romantic parts felt like a plot device that the director didn't have the slightest idea how to deal with. Okay, so there's this Snow White theme going on with an evil stepmother mastermind and a magic mirror, which is a little sci-fi/fantasy, so felt like it was bending the genre a bit as well. However, the evil stepmother character was really well played and pretty interesting. She was so good it made me wish they had just eliminated the female love interest, who was terrible, and just let the evil stepmother carry it. The only reason I'm giving this a 5 and not a zero is because the stepmother subplot was so entertaining and believable. Unfortunately, most of the side characters were really well acted and believable, but the female love interest was bad enough, shallow enough, superficial enough to ruin the show, and the male lead appears to have been forced to do some shitty scenes on that account. His acting is great when that stupid girl isn't around. :P - Also, you have to suck at making TV shows to make that guy look stupid. Because he is super cute. After the first several episodes they seem to have some of their bad directorial choices put in check as the fight-porn gets minimized somewhat or is better incorporated with the story later. There's still some painfully superficial romantic scenes throughout that are not believable. Like - oh, right, when the female love interest is dying from allergic shock and it's this big tense moment of trying to save her and - oh - the guy has to give her some mouth to mouth because she stops breathing - what do you think is most appropriate? None other than trashy romance music exploding out of nowhere, because a girl dying is soooooo sexy. That was probably the most insulting thing I had to watch as a viewer. Really? Someone thinks it's trashy-romance-sexy when someone is unconscious and dying. F.U. Look though, if you really want to check out this show, a few episodes of Healer will wash that taste right out of your mouth when you're done. No problem.",19 out of 36 found this helpful.,5.0,30 June 2017

2376,The K2, The Drama will be perfect without the heroin im yokn ah.,"The Series was good. The acting was absolutely amazing. It went downhill everytime it comes to scene between the Lead Actor Ji Chang Wook and weekly portrayed character of the heroin,Go Anna (Im yoon ah). It was pain to watch them trying too hard, yet cannot beat the chemistry between the lead male and the lead female antagonist, Choi Yoo Jin (Song Yoon Ah)
The series was on the peak eventho just few episodes in the beginning and went straight downhill after gave one episode for the hero n heroin to work they way in convincing audience that they are in love. The director tried so hard portraying the heroin as a beautiful,ie angel of Barcelona etc. but the reality was she is not. Even the lead antagonist actress which is 17 years older than her outshine her too easily.<br/><br/>In sad scenes btwn hero and heroin, no tears flowed. As the love doesn't feel real.
But the scenes btwn the hero and lady antagonist, let it be love, respect,or just friendship, when their eyes met every one can feel the powerful tensions of care.<br/><br/>We agreed if they change the actress who played the heroin to a better acting, prettier, charismatic actress then we wont mind the story line.<br/><br/>Or they can tweak so the romance is between Hero and the lead antagonist.

It's only because of these two I am rating it 3, it doesn't even deserve that much otherwise. The lead character played by Im YoonA is supposed to be innocent and childlike but because of her lacking acting skills and bad writing, she comes across as rather dimwitted. The romance between the lead pair appears to be so forced.

The film makers were generous with the amount of blood and fighting they packed the first episodes. The action continues till the very end, which was really strong, leaving an impact, as it didn't conform with the cliché happy ever after. Another thing that I liked about this drama was that it portrayed each character in depth and presented everyone's motives and background, even emotions. In addition the performances were excellent, even from the second lead lady that, I admit, I didn't expect her to be that good. However, for me, the romance was a little weak, stuck between the twists and the action scenes, being only there to give motivation to the characters to act and go beyond the human limits.

2385,Ballykissangel, Pleasing Irish series,"One of my favourite series.  Ballykissangel is an example of how Ireland can produce quality family drama with wonderful characters and  good writing against a picturesque backdrop of the Irish countryside.<br/><br/>Filmed at Avoca in Ireland it follows the characters in the fictional town of Ballykissangel, mainly the Catholic priest Father Peter Clifford. Hidden underneath the weekly episodes was the quietly growing attraction of Father Peter and Assumpta Fitzgerald (pub owner of Fitzgeralds)<br/><br/>The series had a slightly quirky edge to it and its humour helped make the series such a ratings winner.  The show went for 6 seasons but the best episodes were the first 3 seasons.  After the end of the first 3 the two main characters left and the the creator and writer, Kieran Prendiville, also handed over the reins to other writers.  The show was never the same and lost some of its humour.   Then Peter Hanley (Ambrose) left the show. Later on the series suffered more blows with actors, Birdy Sweeny (Eamonn) and Tony Doyle (Brian Quigley), dying in real life.<br/><br/>With falling ratings Season 6 saw Ballykissangel given some new life with the arrival of a more charismatic priest, Father Vincent Sheahan (played by Australian Robert Taylor) and the return of the original writer Kieran Prendiville.  Despite Season 6 being more enjoyable, and showing more promise, it was decided to end the show after 58 episodes.<br/><br/>Personally I think it could have continued as long as Kieran Prendiville held its reins but it was not to be.<br/><br/>Ballykissangel will go down in television history as an example of how good an Irish production can be, which, at its best, was extremely likeable.",42 out of 43 found this helpful.,,15 November 2001
2386,Ballykissangel, It could happen next door,"For some time now, I am following the TV-series ""Ballykissangel"". Why? Simply because it´s one of the few TV-series which is worth being watched: no unnecessary violence, no stupid, easy-to-see-through jokes, and a good storyline, combined with a set of good actors. I call this a real top british TV-product, and it´s a shame that the Dutch TV stations don´t show it on prime time! Ballykissangel is all about the life and complications of the people of a small irish village, where there has been assigned a new young catholic priest, which happens to be british. The main characters are the english priest, father Clifford, and the owner of a local pub, Assumpta, who gets sick from everything connected to the church. The fundamental differences of character of these two (Assumpta is verbally aggressive, sarcastic and sometimes even vicious, whereas Clifford is friendly, sweet, helpful, and unbelievably naive sometimes) result in a mutual love/hate relationship and neither of them knows what to do with it. Most episodes can be watched separately, however watching most of them gives you the best clue as to the development of the relationship of the main characters, or should I say, the non-development. However, it is very easy to identify yourself with one or more of the main characters. This, combined with the misunderstandings and tricks in every episode, makes it a joy to watch this series, time after time.",26 out of 28 found this helpful.,,31 May 1999
2387,Ballykissangel, Ballykissangel took easy way out,"The first 3 seasons were very exciting. The storyline between the priest and the publican (Assumpta)was dangerous, edgy and romantic. Then the writers took the easy way out by killing off Assumpta. Then they did it again when they killed off the husband (Ambrose)of the woman (Niamh) who fell in love with someone else! <br/><br/>I was shocked at the first death. Although it was a cowardly way to settle the story line, it did work, although it could have been so much better had they explored the ramifications of a priest falling in love. But then they did it again with the next troubled romance. <br/><br/>Other serious flaw:People disappeared without comment: Eamon, Padraig, Danny, Emma, Orla. They just disappeared.<br/><br/>The series never recovered from the killing off of Assumpta and Father Peter's exit.<br/><br/>I wonder how much the story being in Ireland and funded with Irish government $$ (very Catholic) limited the writers. <br/><br/>Ballykissangel reminds me of Hamish MacBeth, which actually was much more fun and even though that also had some deaths, did not use them to artificially stop exploring interesting story lines.",13 out of 13 found this helpful.,5.0,4 April 2009

I thought the series lagged a bit after the initial two characters (Father Clifford and Asumpta) left but still had enough to continue interest. I noticed a strange commonality between almost all the main characters. Did anybody else note what all these pivotal characters had in common: Asumpta the local bar owner, Brendan the local teacher, Siobhan the local vet, Dr. Ryan, local yokels Liam and Donal, entrepreneur Quigley, storekeeper Kathleen, Garage owner Padraig and his successor in the later series, father O'Comnnell's sister Orla, Eamon and his elderly replacement and stable owner Avril? Not one of them was married? Rather unusual for a ""typical"" Irish town.

While there is a tendency to romanticize the rural life in many films (and in part here), there is a greater depth than the average show. There is much humor in this series and also much heat break. As much as the viewer yearns for things to go right in the characters lives, things tend to go wrong and the characters must deal with personal loss, death, divorce, and financial ruin. For a show billed as a comedy, it is more drama with an overlay of humor. I am being somewhat vague in this review because this is a series to be dipped into for episodes that are uplifting and heart warming but ultimately overshadowed by reality.

The last season was better, but as the majority of the cast had turned over, it really didn't feel like the same series as much as the same set.<br/><br/>Bottom line - the first three seasons were the best, but it's not a complete waste of time to watch the last three, either.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,5 December 2009

2399,Ballykissangel, One of my all-time favourites.,"Now being re-run on ITV3, I am really enjoying BallyK all over again. For me, the acting of the whole ensemble cast is wonderful and particularly Stephen Tompkinson as Father Peter Clifford. His relationship with Assumpta is fascinating, even when I know what happened, because it shows them actually relating to each other as people and not in the roles that they play in the village. Peter goes beyond the traditional remit of the priest, while executing it faithfully, and his kindness and good judgement are an inspiration to all. He is an example of a really good man, although he has his own inner conflicts which are played convincingly. Most of all, I feel that all the characters in BallyK are friends who I want to visit - I feel as if I know them. It also hasn't dated too much and I think new viewers would enjoy it as much as those of us who remember it warmly from the first time around.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,13 March 2009
2400,Ballykissangel," Maybe this is a SPOILER, I dunno.","I started watching this show on youtube and at first I liked it, then it turned into something akin to 'hollywood anti-God series'. I cannot believe that the character, Father Peter, would leave the priesthood just like that for a piece of a$$; on the other hand, the actor who played Peter WAS living with the actress who played assumpta so maybe they broke up. It's a shame, really, that they took the opportunity to have a Roman Catholic Priest give up his Belief so easily. Sure I know it happens, but I also know that I was BFF with a Jesuit Priest for 35 years and although I thought he was very sexy (he still is) I NEVER once thought about boffing him or dinking with his belief in Christ. I am NOT a RC, but a born-again Christian. I tell you this, a man who has given himself to the Lord to the point where he becomes a Priest, is not going to give it up for tail (that IS what we are talking about here). We who love Jesus are not easily pulled away from Him. Too bad so many of the TV show / movie makers are so anti God. It's quite a shame.",6 out of 11 found this helpful.,2.0,28 July 2013

After that, it loses its way somewhat.<br/><br/>People debate, defend or prevaricate as to whether Father Clifford and Assumpta should have consummated their relationship, but it wouldn't be true to the heart of the series if they did. It is the very point that Peter cannot turn against his beliefs thus providing the seeds for his downfall: a downfall which would have happened in some way regardless of the fate of Assumpta. This is why I think I find the first three seasons so eminently re-watchable - it displays a human struggling for an unattainable ideal - ultimately failing - but the struggle was noble and inspiring.

2407,Ballykissangel, Allegory and Love Letter to the Church and to the Lost Sheep as Well,"There are so many details to the allegory of series one of Ballykissangel that I cannot fit them all into a review. I will give you a representative sampling.
There are 13 main characters, who represent aspects of the main ""characters"" in the Gospel portrayals of Christ and indeed of those who choose to follow Him: Peter (""on this rock shall I build My church"") the contemporary church and intermediary/scapegoat/priest/counselor and lover of souls; Assumpta (a sort of Mary character/virgin/lost sheep); Quigley (the business side of the church perhaps); Fr Mac (the tradition/intermediary/priest/father in more ways than one); Dr Ryan (healer); Ambrose (judge/the law/named for St Ambrose); Niamh (wife/has miscarriage - of child, of justice); Liam and Donal (the two thieves as those crucified with Christ/carpenters like Joseph); Brendan (skeptic to some extent/father without benefit of Holy Matrimony); Siobhan (mother without benefit of Holy Matrimony); Kathleen (Sunday stalwart, represents the traditional worshippers and followers of Christ); and Padraig (to me he represents the fishermen who were ordinary people taken up with a special calling nonetheless).
It starts with a priest (Fr Mac) near a church roof (""nearer to God"") and ends with a publican (read ""tax collector"" in the New Testament), who is also a virgin who has been ""stoned"" in St Joseph's Church no less, dying of an (electrical) shock in a pub basement (can't get much farther away from Heaven than that, yet she is saved when Peter says the Last Rites of the Roman Catholic Church over her).
Words come up again and again in every or nearly every episode and here is a sampling of the double-meanings: shock (electrical/spiritual ""round teabags would come as a shock to some of the people around here"" says Siobhan), Father (Godfather - what is a priest but a God father/natural father/Father of all things=God); play (Passion play/staged play/""I'm playing barman"", says Leo); ""housekeeper"" (which is what the Greek word Diocese means, right?); call (altar/ordination/phone/needed/Last Call, as in a public house).
What is a public house but a secular church? The church writ large and the lost sheep or nonbelievers outside the Church need each other (that is another word that figures frequently in the series), though they keep denying it. People sleep during the day (see the episode after baby Kieran is born) and are awake at night (see the episode where Ambrose and Peter stay up in church all night ""looking for the hoaxer"" only to entrap Fr Mac, who is a ""good man"" but is a kind of hoaxer too because he as a Roman Catholic priest preaches celibacy without practicing it. His daughter comes to BallyK in the ""Lost Sheep"" episode where she is introduced and only Kathleen and Fr Mac recognize her for what she is (""Father Geraghty's housekeeper"" is mentioned in another reference to diocesan and bishop roles).
I think, and I have not seen Kieran Prendiville address this, that Ballykissangel is a love letter to the church, imploring it not only to reach out to the lost sheep in trying to follow Jesus' command, but also to nurture those within it (""...and drive the faithful out!"", Kathleen exclaims as she leaves a Folk Mass - what is a folk mass but an outreach like fishers of men were called to do). Also a warning that the time is short to make that ""connection"" before it is ""Gone with the Wind"" or a ""Brief Encounter"".
Other references are: ""Dark Rosaleen"" which is a poem about Ireland by James Clarence Morgan(allegorical), Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd ""Dark Side of the Moon"" - a look at the titles on that album will give you more comparisons and aspects of BallyK (""Speak to Me""...""On the Run""...""Money"", etc).
""She doesn't want it; she told me!"", Peter cries in one of the final scenes of ""The Reckoning"" (what reckoning? - a totaling up, a story being told, balances of two sides?) ""What if she needs it anyway?"", Niamh replies. This is the whole point. ""I am an innocent bystander caught (there is another word used several different ways) up in a bitter feud"", Peter says. Indeed this is the situation between church and those outside it who say they are spiritual but not religious. ""...bringing people together, helping them make sense of their lives..."", Assumpta says of Peter, and this can be said of church.
I encourage people who watch this series, the first season with the Peter and Assumpta main characters, to think allegorically, to find in it meaning, deeper meaning, to search for the double and treble meanings in frequently-used words in this series. I think you will get more out of it, and will come away from viewing it, whether for the first time or the three hundredth time, with a focus for thought, contemplation, outreach, sympathy, and spirit.
I thank Mr. Prendiville for having written it and for the actors for having so carefully followed what he and his writing partners wrote.
A meaningful piece of work, hidden behind a ""forbidden love"" story that conceals what it is really about.
The only flaw, other than the fact that I have never read a review of this show which ""gets it"", some of the humor is a bit slapstick, but that is only this reviewer's taste and might not be yours.

2408,Ballykissangel, GOD awful beyond belief- Committed the biggest SIN there is for a comedy- NOT funny at ALL!,"*************SPOILERS EVERYWHERE************* <br/><br/>Hello! <br/><br/>This horrific garbage ticked me off in a way that no show has for a long, long time.<br/><br/>First off, this has got to be some of the worst series writing I have ever seen. I will critique the first episode.<br/><br/>Over and over, the writers put in scenes obviously intended to be funny, that fall flat on their faces, without even a chuckle.<br/><br/>Technically, I suppose, this was supposed to be a dramedy (IE, both a drama and a comedy), but there were numerous scenes that obviously were INTENDED, unsuccessfully, to be comedic.<br/><br/>A giant box falls off a truck, tumbling down a mountain, narrowly missing a bus carrying the new priest into town. This was OBVIOUSLY intended to be funny, but fell completely flat.<br/><br/>Ridiculous confessional being installed, with comfy chairs, ""Occupied"" lights, and a fax (would've been something that you might have seen in ""Last of the Summer Wine""), that was continually played, UNSUCCESSFULLY, for laughs. Not a laugh, not a chuckle.<br/><br/>Not only were the writers utterly and completely incompetent at writing comedy scenes, the terrible actors were also completely incompetent at DELIVERING comedic lines. Again, not one laugh, not one chuckle.<br/><br/>The new priest was obviously meant to be the ""hero"" against the supposedly old and stodgy and hypocritical in the village, but, again, the writers were utterly incompetent, and had NO idea what they were doing.<br/><br/>The rich man funding the ridiculous confessional, became the new priest's arch enemy for virtually NO reason at all. The new priest's superior, Father MacAnally (I'm NOT joking, this is what the writers called him!) tells him outright that the rich man is a friend of the church, and to treat him well.<br/><br/>Well, Mr. new priest, there all of one day, not only IGNORES his superior's (presumably having lived there decades, with intimate knowledge of the area and situations) advice, but then declares the rich guy as priestly enemy #1, for NO real reason. (Yes, supposedly the ridiculous confessional would imply sins of pride and vanity, but, so WHAT? Presumably in this guy's congregation, there would be people committing a variety of sins as large, or larger. WHY did he single out the rich guy???) <br/><br/>And perhaps Mr. rich guy has previously contributed to the poor, or done other charitable acts? How would Mr. new priest, there all of one day, even KNOW this? <br/><br/>On the other hand, the unbelievably arrogant new priest committed MAJOR sins, all over the place, FAR in excess of anything that rich guy appeared to have done.<br/><br/>Examples: 1. Intentionally doesn't tell rich guy that the newly delivered confessional fell down the mountain, a fact hidden by the delivery people, who would have been liable. (By the way, HOW did it fall hundreds of feet down the mountain, WITHOUT an apparent scratch on it??? Even GLASS inside it, was shown to be intact! MORE bad writing.)<br/><br/>2. Intentionally and publicly, during the middle of a service, humiliates the rich man, not once, but TWICE. (Also, the writers don't seem to understand how electricity works. Priest has rich guy unplug the confessional, moments later, the fax kicks on, so rich guy can be humiliated publicly again. HUH??? With NO electricity???) <br/><br/>3. Tells police man to ""shack up"" (way rich man phrased it) with rich man's daughter; that it's OK as long as they don't have sex. MORE bad writing. Even if this is technically OK , it is stupid, ignorant, and naive beyond belief for a priest to say this! BAD writing! <br/><br/>4. FORGES A LETTER, using a faxed invoice intended for the rich guy (WHO sends invoices by fax???), to intentionally fake that the rich guy was trying to bill the church, for his ""gift"" of the confessional, instead of it being a real gift. NOT ONLY is this a TERRIBLE thing for a priest to do, it is probably criminal, as well! MORE horrible writing! <br/><br/>And YET, this new priest is supposed to be a paragon of virtue, against this ""evil"" of the rich guy, and Father MacAnally.<br/><br/>MORE bad writing: new priest and rich guy are trapped in confessional when electric doors jam. (AGAIN, obviously meant to be funny. Not one laugh, not one chuckle.) Solution? Pull the confessional through the roof, with THEM STILL IN IT, by a crane. A real laugh, right? NOT! Ummm, haven't the writers of this heard of a crowbar, or a saw, to open the jammed doors??? PLUS, I have NEVER seen an electric door that you couldn't open by hand, say, if the electricity or something else failed.<br/><br/>MORE bad writing: the confessional is WAY too large to go into any building, through any normal door. By luck, for some stupid reason I don't remember, there was a large, convenient hole in the roof, where they lowered it in by crane. (Must make this confessional a real big seller!) The BAD writers obviously did this, for the ""funny"" (NOT!), scene later where they are lifted out by crane, still in the confessional.<br/><br/>UNBELIEVABLE!!!<br/><br/>GARAGE, TRIPE, REFUSE, DRIVEL!<br/><br/>AVOID at ALL costs!<br/><br/>Karl<br/><br/>*************SPOILERS EVERYWHERE*************",2 out of 11 found this helpful.,1.0,13 September 2014

This is one of the best television shows ever created, why is it such a cult classic? Ever see a really bad movie? I know you have, we also know how much we love to make fun of a really bad movie, that's exactly what the characters of Mystery Science Theater 3000 do, they take the worst movies of all time and absolutely tear them a new one. They are like the friends we want to have around when you feel like you wasted your money at the movies, because at least you can get a good laugh at just making fun of it. I saw this show for the first time in 1998 when my parents finally broke down and got cable, the first channel that popped up when I turned on the TV was the sci fi channel and what looked like a fun werewolf movie... then I noticed three little figures in the corner. I didn't get it, why are they talking through the mov... oh, because this is a really bad movie and they are saying everything that I am thinking... I'm in love! At that point I was hooked and tuned in every week to see a new episode.<br/><br/>The show first started off with Joel, a man who is stranded on the satellite of love space ship with several robots: Crow T. Robot, Tom Servo, Gypsy and Gambot. He is being tortured by our villain, Dr. Forrester with terrible movies. Eventually in the middle of season 5, we got a new host, Mike Nelson. He was a slave to Dr. Forrester, but is now sentenced to the same fate as Joel to see the most horrible movies of all time. We also later on got a different villain, Dr. Forrester's mother, Pearl Forrester who is trying to take over the world while presenting horrendous movies to Mike and the bots.<br/><br/>The great thing about this show is it didn't just make fun of horror movies, nope, any bad movie could face the hand smack of Mystery Science Theater 3000. I couldn't choose a favorite episode, but I stepped into the Mike era so most of my favorites come out of those seasons like: Prince of Space, The Final Sacrifice, Space Mutiny, Girl in Gold Boots, The Brain that wouldn't Die, Squirm and Soultaker. Not only do they make fun of movies, but ""educational"" shorts as well with the scary ""A Date With Your Family"" and ""Spring Fever!"" that are frankly the most disturbing thing on film. Like most shows, not every episode is a classic, but is always guaranteed a good laugh.

Joel is blasted into space in an apparently escape-proof ship called the Satellite of Love, forever doomed to orbit the planet Earth. Forrester keeps contact with Joel via satellite transmission, and each week sends hims an unbearably awful b-movie which he is forced to watch.  The mad doctor's idea is to keep sending movies that are so mind-numbingly terrible that it will eventually drive Joel and his viewers to insanity, thus giving him an easy outlet for conquering the world.  To help preserve his sanity, Joel uses parts from the ship to build four wise-cracking robot friends that keep him company and help us to avoid cinema-induced lunacy by mercilessly heckling the films.<br/><br/>The show aired weekly, and re-introduced old 1950s-70s era drive-in swill to a world that has long forgotten about it.  The movies they chose--The Brain That Wouldn't Die, Time of the Apes, and (most notorious) Manos: The Hands of Fate, for example--were truly some of the most awful abominations in cinema history, and how they were able to find clear, working prints of these (mostly) obscure films is beyond me.  Not only was it great to be able to witness some of these ""masterpieces"" first-hand, but the non-stop commentary by Joel, Tom, and Crow was absolutely hysterical.  There was never a dull moment when those boys hit the SOL's onboard movie theater.  On occasion, there would be a break from the movie to show a humorous sketch that would further the basic plot of the show.  While many of these segments were admittedly not all that funny, they didn't last long, and Forrester would call for ""MOVIE SIGN!"" again in no time.  Come to think of it, it may not even be that these primitive skits weren't funny, but that they simply paled in comparison to the sheer hilarity that took place in the ship's movie theater.<br/><br/>MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 is one of the few television programs that seems to be loved by virtually everybody.  Seriously--I know of not a single person who didn't like this show, nor have I ever read a single negative comment or review of it.  That being said, why on Earth was such a brilliant show like MST3K canceled?  It couldn't have been because of poor ratings, since the show had a huge cult following and a substantial amount of regular viewers.  If anyone has any information regarding why this series was taken off the air, please contact me!",101 out of 120 found this helpful.,10.0,19 July 2003
2432,Mystery Science Theater 3000, One of the Greatest Ideas ever come to TV,"MSTK 3K was never meant to be a quality show. It's simply a cheesy skit to make fun of really, really bad movies.  In a world, where everybody takes things too seriously, this show produces a much needed boost of comedy. Sitcoms tend to become the same, and humor anymore is few and far between. There is just a finite number of plot lines that a sitcom can have. And many sitcoms tend to outlast their usefullness (Friends and Fraiser). However, MST3k, the humor is always refreshing. Joel (or Mike) and the robots never run out of potshots during a movie. So many movies become untentionally funny, because they are so poorly made.  The robots are very clever, when they can relate contemporary events with old movies. I'll never forget when Croww T. Robot, said when he saw a wrecked T-bird ""Teddy Kennedy are you alright?""<br/><br/>The shorts are very clever too. They make fun of the stupid short films that you had to watch in elementary school. (Posture, grooming, what to do on a date).<br/><br/>The only thing that one must watch out for, is that sometimes people don't get the jokes that the robots are pitching. As long as one is up on current events, he would find this show hilarious.<br/><br/> I remember watching the movie when it came out to theaters in 1996. I have never been in an audience that laughed so much.",61 out of 71 found this helpful.,,8 July 2003
2433,Mystery Science Theater 3000, A consistently great show,"A lot of the movies on which I've commented on this website I've seen as episodes of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000.""  However, I find it difficult to write about this show as a whole - not because I can't think of anything to say, but because there is so much to say that I don't know where to begin or end.<br/><br/>I guess I'll start by saying I approached this show prepared to be unimpressed.  A show about a janitor and two robots goofing on bad movies in space?  That's about the dumbest idea for a TV show I've ever heard!  And in lesser hands this could have been an idiotic show, not worth bothering with. But in the hands of the troupe of writers and performers who call themselves Best Brains it is a show of rare intelligence and wit.  The writing is first rate and the performances (especially in the host segments, in which skits are performed which are more or less inspired by the movie) are sharp and enthusiastic.  So good was the writing that show was able to remain fresh and entertaining despite several major cast changes (by the time the series ended after ten seasons none of the original cast members remained).<br/><br/>Best of all, this show helped broaden my appreciation for cheesy movies. I've always loved horror and sci-fi movies (horror especially), and some of the movies shown here were familiar, but there were others I would never have seen were it not for this show.   Some laughably bad, others cheesy and surreal, others pretty darned interesting.  (Still others were just plain bad.)<br/><br/>In short, this was one of the best shows ever shown on television.",75 out of 89 found this helpful.,,14 November 2000

It's hard to believe there could be anything that could make horrible movies like 'Hobgoblins' fun to watch. The show is clever and witty. It's hard to believe a show about a group of three making comments while watching a movie could spawn a ten year series and a movie. But it was done, and I'm sure we're all thankful for that. It's a shame the show has ended but the went out with a bang, making the series finale 'Danger: Diabolik' one of the best of the series; my personal favorite is 'Hobgoblins'.

2435,Mystery Science Theater 3000, From Trash to Treasure: Rich Genius on a Salvation Army Budget,"A mad scientist's plot to rule the world hurls an employee (and later a temp worker replacement) into space on a fully furnished satellite where, in the company of quick-witted robot friends, the captive is forced to watch real movies from nearly every genre imaginable that threaten to rob him completely of his sanity. That's all you really need to know to start watching, but it can't begin to scratch the surface of what you will encounter. Beneath the surface is a work of comedic genius that has held a stronger-than-cult following for almost 20 years.<br/><br/>In the Mystery Science Theater 3000 dictionary, you probably can find a picture of Joe Don Baker under the definition of ""irony."" He is quoted with having threatened physical violence on the creator of MST3K after how they treated him in the film ""Mitchell,"" yet he played a trailer trash dad in ""Mars Attacks"" around the same time. It's these kinds of relationships between one movie and another, the throwbacks to our culture, and (most) performers' ability to be a good sport that makes MST3K such a brilliant program. It is only in the case of this series that too many writers don't spoil the ambiance; in fact, a large group of writers is essential to capture every flaw and possible remark that can be made about a single movie. If you grew up within the last 50 years, then you are bound to have seen most of the movies featured on MST3K. On the same token, you are bound to get most of the jokes the stars hurl at the screen, but don't be surprised if you catch something new every time.<br/><br/>Sci-fi and film purists have deemed MST3K detrimental to film genres in some arguments, and some viewers who saw the actual movies when they were released or were influenced heavily by a group of films might be taken aback by seeing their favorite movies torn to pieces for the sake of comedy. Nonetheless, MST3K has the ability to grow on virtually everyone who sees it... and has done so. The show is filmed with some of the most dated film technology while the robots and sets were literally sculpted from scraps of junk gotten from Goodwill, but the impact is lasting and any argument you may have over scientific mistakes are immediately addressed in the last line of the catchy theme song. Mexican wrestlers, Italian spies, Japanese giant monsters, 1960s-era juvenile delinquents, mad scientists, educational short films, rugged bikers, and even works of Shakespeare (well just one work but still) to name only a few types of the over-200 films featured in its 10-year run (many of which continue to hold high ranking on IMDb's worst films list), are the primary fodder of this brilliant undertaking, and you are hereby dared not to find the same amusement in every movie you see after experiencing MST3K for yourself and succumbing to its effects.",29 out of 35 found this helpful.,,13 March 2006

2437,Mystery Science Theater 3000, My Best TV Friends at the Movies!,"Comedy Central gets credit when credit is due. ""South Park"", the ""Chapelle's Show"", ""Win Ben Stein's Money"", ""The Daily Show"" and a few others -- were breakthough series for a very hungry comedy generation. But this was their very first hit, let no one tell ya differently.<br/><br/>At first, I thought Mystery Science Theater 3000 would bug me. A bunch of folks talking through a movie. I HATE that. But these guys have gone through and chosen a host of films that are bad to begin with. And you know as you're sitting in the comfort of your home, by yourself or with friends watching these same films, you are saying or thinking the same thing of what Joel and Mike and the 'bots are.<br/><br/>Yes, MST3K is ""cheap"", its stupid..but its a heck of alot of fun. There are a few movies they took that I didn't think deserved an MST3K ""do-over"" but at some points in the series, they did a unique thing and added in Cartoons, old Soap Operas and TV Series before showing the full feature. That was a laugh riot.<br/><br/>Comedy Central's MST3K went to the Sci-Fi Channel where they still show the series but I wish they would also show the ones with Joel and the 'bots along with the ones with Mike and the 'bots. In such a depressing time, it puts a smile on my face for two hours every Saturday Morning. It's simple and s-i-m-p-l-e.<br/><br/>Every year the Sci-Fi network does ""Twilight Zone"" Marathons which I love. I remember Comedy Central ONCE doing a ""MST3K"" Marathon, it's time to do another. This is the best comedy/sci-fi series to date, it deserves alot more than it got.<br/><br/>If not, maybe its time to pull the gang together and do another ""Movie"". The ""MST3K"" gang really blew it with doing ""This Island Earth"" when we all know ""Manos, the Hands of Fate"" would have gotten them Academy Award Nominations.

2439,Mystery Science Theater 3000, The best comedy series ever.,"The best comedy series ever.  The range of humor, from lowbrow to extremely sophisticated, is amazing.  Despite numerous cast changes over its ten-year run, it maintained a high quality and its final season was no less funny than the others.  The writing was top notch, the performances hilarious, and their treatments of the abysmal films they mocked proved that you CAN make silk purses from sows' ears.  Certainly, a station with greater resources than Comedy Central or the Sci-Fi Channel could have delivered the audience the show deserved, but, sadly, this was not the case, and its second cancellation was final.  No TV program has enchanted me the way MST3K did, and I still mourn its cancellation more than a year after the fact.  Catch it while reruns are still being aired!  I don't expect them to continue much, if at all, into 2001.  If you manage to see it, I guarantee you'll be heading to Rhino Videos to order tapes of the old episodes, and contacting fans to obtain copies of newer ones.<br/><br/>I am in my forties, yet Servo and Crow, the two main robot puppets, became as real to me as any human character on TV.  Along with the rest of the cast, they became friends with whom I looked forward to spending a couple of hours every Saturday morning.  Invite some real friends over to watch it--it's much better as a group experience.

This show takes it one step further - and makes a GOOD job of doing just that for you!

2441,Mystery Science Theater 3000, Best Cult Show EVER!!,"""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" does what we'd all love to do when watching a bad movie, but hesitate due to courtesy or our own lack of wit: Offer our own biting commentary on the wretchedness before us. For 12 seasons, this sleeper cult TV hit used this idea (one that can never grow old because there will always be bad movies) to hilarious advantage. The plot was as follows: mad scientists Dr. Clayton Forrester and Dr. Larry Earhart (who was replaced one year later by doofy henchmen TV's Frank, who proved much more popular) run Gizmonics Institute. They have such an irrational dislike to quirky, sleepy-eyed custodian Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson, the show's creator), that they blast him into space on the ""Satellite of Love"". As if that weren't bad enough, they force poor Joel to sit through bad movie day after day to study their effects on our hero's brain. Well, space gets pretty lonely, so Joel builds himself four robot companions (according to the show's theme, they're built from parts that could have helped him ""control when the movies begin and end""). The main robots are suave smart-ass and occasional crooner Tom Servo (who is made from a gumball machine) and abrasive pop culture fiend Crow, a bizarre, gold, bird-like thing. There's also Gypsy, who controls the main functions of the ship and has a girlish crush on B-actor Richard Basehart, and Cambot, who tapes the show. Every week our hapless captives were sent an awful movie (just a reminder, these are REAL movies, and they have to be seen to be believed), each more horrendous than the last. Bad acting, cheesy scenery, plots that range from silly to reprehensible, lame special effects, laughable fashion, stilted dialogue, these movies have it all. Yet Joel and his plucky pals have a secret weapon: their never-ending supply of wisecracks at the rubbish they're forced to watch. Everything that comes out these guys' mouths is a comedic gem. Example?<br/><br/>Servo: What do you think the lesson of the movie was? Crow: Don't watch it. <br/><br/>Like all long running shows, ""MST3K"" went through many changes. Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank moved from Gizmonics to Deep 13, a lair located at the core of the Earth. Joel Hodgson left the show in 1993 and was replaced by one of the show's writers, Michael J. Nelson. Like the fictional Joel Robinson, ""Mike Nelson"" was an affable, All-American temp working in Deep 13 who was much disliked by the mad scientists (Dr. Forrester called him a ""mild-mannered boob""). When Joel miraculously escapes after seeing the Joe Don Baker crapfest ""Mitchell"", Mike was immediately blasted into the Satellite of Love in Joel's place, and stayed for the rest of the show's run. Mike was an excellent replacement, having a slightly different comedic style than Joel, but still getting plenty of laughs. While Joel was more laid back and wry, Mike tended to be more blunt with his remarks during movies (""Did ANYONE know how to run in the '50s?"" he quips during a horror film). Five years and one movie later, Dr. Forrester's mother Pearl was the main villain, along with her henchmen: Bobo, a simian professor, and the Observer, or ""Brain Guy"", a cloaked genius who transported movies with the power of his mind. No show has ever had one formula that stayed fresh for so long, and it's still a cult favorite that's a hit on DVD. Mike Nelson even keeps it up with Riff Trax, a web site where you can download his skewers of bad mainstream films like ""Road House"" and ""The Phantom Menace"". Yet the fine art of making fun of cheesy movies will belong to those silhouetted three chaps who tear sub par movies a new one. Yup, I stand by my statement: Best. Cult show.

2442,Mystery Science Theater 3000," In my opinion, the greatest thing to ever happen to T.V.","basic synopsis: Joel Hodgeson, along with his robots Tom Servo, Crow, and Gypsy, is held captive thousands of miles above the earth, in the satellite of love (S.o.L.), where he is forced to endure gruelingly bad movies. Joel, rather than succumb to the terrifying badness of the films, makes slapstick puns, which Tom Servo and Crow easily join in on. Joel also creates weekly inventions for Frank, the man who shot him into space. Inventions include the comic grinder, which mixes boring comics with other boring comics to create FUN!!! comics, i.e. ""Ziggy got Garfield neutered?!? NOW THAT'S FUNNY!""<br/><br/>Even after 10 seasons, the humor never ran down or let up. In fact, the only notable difference was the change in humor styling, from Joel to Mike. What happened, basically, was Joel either decided to quit, or was fired from, the cast of MST3K. His replacement was Mike Nelson, who did an equally good job commentating on movies. Anyways, where Joel brought a sarcastic, harsh tone to his humor, Mike gave more of an analytical, joke-by-comparison type of humor. It is very hard to explain, but you should understand once you actually view a couple of episodes.<br/><br/>Overall, there were many decent episodes, such as those from the first season, which were really stepping stones for the MST3K crew to find their real footholds on the show. the jokes were less risqué', and the cast lacked it's flare. Nonetheless, the episodes were still worthy of watching. Titles include: The Crawling eye, the robot versus the Aztec mummy, and Mad Monster. Definitely not a bad group.<br/><br/>However, the third season was where the MST3K really got things cookin'. This was the first season where MST3k appeared on Comedy Central, and it shows. Personally, this, along with season's five and ten, was my favorite season. The episode's were all great, every last one of them, and they all had the necessary emotion put into them. Titles include: Cave Dwellers, Santa Claus conquers the Martians, and fugitive alien. Must see!<br/><br/>Finally, we have the fifth season. Half way through this season, something went wrong with Joel, and thus he was fired. So, starting with episode 514 (Mitchell) we were introduced to Mike Nelson. Do not take this statement the wrong way, this season was great! All of my favorite episodes were packed in here, and above all else, the season had the change that MSTies everywhere were looking for. Titles include: Eegah!, Mitchell, I accuse My Parents<br/><br/>The only other episode I would like to remark on is Manos: The hands of Fate, which is considered to be the worst movie ever made, and, in my opinion, truly is. It is also a great episode, providing lots of hilarious gags, etc. Definite must see.<br/><br/>Overall: MST3K is a 10/10 fa sho.",6 out of 8 found this helpful.,10.0,27 July 2005
2443,Mystery Science Theater 3000, Originality would be nice.,"You know, I'm getting kind of tired of people reviewing movies here on IMDB, based solely on what they saw on TV. Especially movies people saw on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Now, I'm not saying that MST3K is bad, I think it's great! It's just that when someone watches the show, and reviews the movie shown, they have no imagination of their own. I've read reviews for movies shown on MST3K that directly quote the show. The people have no new material to joke about and are confined to what Joel or Mike or Tom or Crow find funny because they cover everything in the movie.<br/><br/>By now, you probably think that I hate the show, but you're wrong. I love it! I watch it every week. I think they bring justice to movies that need justice brought to. They make great jokes and really bring about a thrashing to some movies. But it's when people watch the show and they take a quote from the show, and claim it as their own, that is when I have a problem. Not necessarily with the show, rather with the people who have no independent thought. And they have no independent thought because you really can't joke about a comedy show. It's very hard to find something previously ignored by a show who's job is to find funny things out of every part of something it a movie. I mean, the guys on the show watch one movie at least half a dozen times a week in order to prepare for the actual taping. There are some movies they did that I would go insane watching that many times. Invasion of the Neptune Men was a personal hell for me, as was Hobgoblins (yeah, I really felt agony after watching that movie)<br/><br/>At this point, I have been dodging around my main reason for writing this. I guess after all of this, I am really trying to say, ask, even beg people to get some independent viewing of a movie in order to honestly form an opinion about that movie. You need to find what YOU think is funny, what YOU think is stupid, what YOU think is goofy about said movie, without the help of anybody else. And if that means going out and renting the movie and watching it again, then so be it. You're opinion about the movie has to be yours and yours alone. You need an unspoiled viewing of a movie in order to get your true feelings about that movie.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,,22 January 2002
2444,Mystery Science Theater 3000, Tragically cut down in the prime of life.,"It's sad that this series was cut so short - even though it lasted 11 seasons, they still had a mountain of stinky movies that they could have done. The ones they did do, however, really deserved it in most cases. One of the testaments of how good the series was is that even though it's not had any new episodes since 1999, the repeats on the sci-fi channel are still attracting fans. The premise is that an evil mad scientist has captured a guy, shot him into space and forces him to watch really bad movies, one a week. He's a test subject for finding the worst movie ever made and then the scientist will broadcast it into everyone's mind, causing their minds to collapse and then he would take over the world. Helping our hero out are two cobbled together robots he made. Maybe someday someone will make a 'next generation' type sequel to this series.

2445,Mystery Science Theater 3000, Joel Hodgson is my idol.,"The man had the best idea ever. Take the crappiest movies ever made and make a show all about making fun of them. It's the idea everyone else wish they thought of first because we all do it. Joel found the formula, and the perfect way to institute it. Not only that, but because he worked his way up from his initial KTMA studio days and then finally to Comedy Central. The show later on was adopted by the Sci-Fi Channel after Joel left the show. I haven't seen every episode and the show was on when I was a kid, so there is still a lot I don't know about.<br/><br/>*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* I also love the premise of the show. You learn about the story in the theme song of the show. Joel Robinson works at Gizmonics Institute doing janitorial work, shipping, etc. His bosses, Dr. Clayton Forrester and TV's Frank, didn't like him so they took his red jumpsuit wearin' keister and shot him into space aboard the Satellite of Love. As part of their weekly experiments, they send him the cheesiest movies they can find and force him to watch. A man would go insane having to deal with that all by himself so makes a sacrifice. He can't control when the movie starts or stops because he uses the machinery to make robots. You've got Cambot, who's purpose is to film Joel as he makes his broadcast. Gypsy, the only girl robot aboard (aside from Magic Voice who is just a voice) who keeps the Satellie functioning. Tom Servo, the bubbly little gumball machine. And of course, the legendary Crow T. Robot made from gold parts, famously the bowling pin nose.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Mike since his onscreen presence didn't have the same strength as Joel. Mike did a lot of appearances (Torgo, Morrissey, Steve ""Hercules"" Reeves) prior to taking over as the human. He didn't have great host segments, partially due to the loss of the invention exchanges (which was Joel's fault). I just didn't like the fact that someone took the reigns for Joel and that minor changes were made to the set. Mike did the great writing for the show but his words came out better through Joel, in my opinion.<br/><br/>
I think I first saw the show when I was 9 or 10 and just being floored by it. It was on at midnight on Comedy Central, and I would stay up late when I wasn't supposed to so I could watch it. I LOVED IT. I usually didn't make it for the full two hours but watching Joel and the 'bots was amazing to me. The first one I might have seen all of was ""King Dinosaur"". As time went on, I would tape all the episodes I could. I wanted to get a jumpsuit just like Joel's and I would run around making wisecracks I heard from the show. They released a few movies on tape through Rhino, namely ""Catalina Caper"", ""Manos: the Hands of Fate"" (CLASSIC), ""The Gunslinger"", ""Side Hackers"", and a few others as well as MST3K Shorts featuring different segments they performed. I'm waiting for them get more out. Other favorites of mine were ""King Dinosaur"", ""Super Agent: Super Dragon"", ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", ""Hercules Unchained"", ""Beneath the Ocean Floor"" and ""Eegah"".<br/><br/>It's truly priceless. Awesome series, I wish I could have helped work on it. Turn your lights down (where applicable) and have a Patrick Swayze Christmas.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,,16 July 2003
2446,Mystery Science Theater 3000," Consistently brilliant, one of the finest shows of our time","Living every pop-culture enthusiast's dream of talking back at the industry's bottom-of-the-barrel refuse, at least those samples they could get their fingers on, the marooned janitor Joel Robinson (Joel Hodgson) and his bots Tom Servo (first Josh Weinstein, then Kevin Murphy) and Crow T. Robot (Trace Beaulieu, later Bill Corbett) have, at least in the minds of their countless fans, been elevated to an almost Christ-like status of brilliantly witty, film-savvy martyrs. Forced to watch atrociously bad movie after atrociously bad movie, which they survive only through the use of their own biting and above all highly educated and sophisticated wit, they are identification figures for all of us suffering wannabe critics. From the lowbrow to the esoteric, no opportunity for a cutting remark is missed by these lovable rascals, who practically invented this new way of reviewing film. It's the dissatisfied moviegoer's commentary track, an option that should, in my opinion, be included on the DVD releases of pretty much all major blockbusters released today. After all, wouldn't we Mysties just kill for an MST3K treatment of the Bay/Bruckheimer movies or Lucas' prequel trilogy? I'd like to think so.<br/><br/>Now for the development of the series: The KTMA years were still pretty sketchy and mostly unscripted, but did nevertheless successfully create the foundation of the show, firmly establishing its format. Though many of its episodes were forgettable, there were some true standout moments. One of these was their treatment of Sandy Frank's `Fugitive Alien' series, which would be repeated and perfected in MST3K's third season. The official first season was still not quite up to the quality we're so used to now, but it provided the show with some of its most memorable host segments and catch phrases, namely Servo's romantic infatuation with the ship's water cooler and `Hi-Keeba!'<br/><br/>Season two to six represents the shows golden years, wonderfully covering many of the `Gamera' and `Godzilla' films, other Sandy Frank abominations like `Time of the Apes', many ambitious Bert I. Gordon and Roger Corman misfires, the Italian `Hercules' series and, of course, Hal Warren's classic `Manos: The Hands of Fate', still the most infamous of all MST3K movies (the wonderful Torgo became a memorable recurring character throughout the show).<br/><br/>In the middle of the fifth season Joel Hodgson left the show and was replaced by the equally great Mike Nelson, who served as head writer all through the series. With the change of the host also came a change of the shows tone. Joel was an exceedingly amiable, pleasant fellow - a great balance to the scathingly sardonic Crow and pompous, overeducated Servo. Mike was still likable, but generally favored a much darker brand of humor. Thus, by the end of the 8th season, the show had become far less jovial in their treatment of the films, some comments being downright spiteful (for instance, the Canada song in `The Final Sacrifice').<br/><br/>As for the villainous mad scientists, Dr. Forrester (again, Trace Beaulieu) and his assistant TV's Frank (Frank Coniff) were later replaced by Dr. Forrester's mother (the positively Dawn Frenchian Mary Jo Pehl) and her assistants, Professor Bobo (again, Kevin Murphy) and Observer (again, Bill Corbett). Needless to say, it was not really a worthy replacement, and the quality of the host segments decreased considerably. Nevertheless, MST3K still produced some incredibly funny episodes, on par with (if not superior to) the best of their early work. `Puma Man', `Space Mutiny', `Overdrawn at the Memory Bank' and `Prince of Space' are unarguable classic episodes I would not want to live without.<br/><br/>All in all, an absolutely amazing show of quite consistent quality.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,,14 August 2003
2447,Mystery Science Theater 3000, One of the few reasons I watch TV,"I feel that I am at a loss of words to describe how much I truly adore this show. It is pure genius and pure delight. I remember my first ever encounter with MST3K: It was five years ago and the featured movie of the episode was Hobgoblins. I had heard about the show but had never really had an interest in seeing it. I came across it channel surfing and decided to watch it for awhile. At that moment, I was forever hooked. Since then, I have seen every Sci-Fi era episode and roughly half of the show's Comedy Central days. I have been exposed to some of the worst movies in history, and I have loved every minute of it. When I found out that the show was ending its run of original episodes in 1999, I was devastated. Fortunately, Sci-Fi has kept re-runs of MST3K going every Saturday. My only complaint is that its not on enough. Rhino has made the wise decision to release select episodes of MST3K from the Comedy Central era on video and DVD, making the show readily available to a new generation of fans. Hopefully, someday every episode of the show's prestigious run will be released for human consumption, or at least it will go into wide syndication like many beloved TV classics. Until then, tune into the Sci-Fi channel every Saturday morning and witness a true work of genius in progress.",6 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,14 September 2002

The shows with Joel Hodgson were especially well-done, and one hopes that we will hear again from this very funny fellow. For unclear reasons, only the recent shows from the sci-fi channel run (the shows from the comedy channel run were far superior) are being re-run. One wishes that one of the myriad of cable and/or satellite channels would re-run the classic shows we know and love.

2451,Mystery Science Theater 3000, I Love the Satellite Of Love,"I'm not a Super Fan of MST3K, and I am selective in the episodes that I watched, which are relatively few of the total that ran for 11 years. Some people very strongly dislike this show claiming that it ruins the films, but I keep in mind that the films that Joel and Mike and the 'Bots ridicule, are still available in their original form, and I generally prefer to see the films in their original form before watching the MST3K treatment. Producers and directors like to see the audience reaction to their films, and when we go to a movie house, we have an audience whose reactions we can observe. But, watching a TV show at home, our families might not care to watch the show with us, so we would be basically alone watching the film if it weren't for Joel or Mike and the 'bots are an audience whose reactions we can get as solo viewers, and we can make the audience even bigger if we have any friends to invite over to watch with us, and the MST3K host, and the bots. To me the show does not ruin the films, but is just a different way of viewing the films. One could make the argument that the Host and the 'Bots reading a written script for their reactions to the film is not the ""real thing,"" but it was the real reactions of the script writers.",2 out of 2 found this helpful.,8.0,23 February 2020

This is a continuation of the Goldbergs set in the 90's with Coach and Tim Meadow's character at the center of the series. There is great potential here, but I find the family being followed to in no way be as endearing as the Goldbergs and the episode culminating in an entire school singing to a Backstreet Boys song is incredibly unbelievable. The Goldbergs has some real heart, as it's centered around Adam's real childhood memories. This series is not based in anyone's reality and I believe the Goldberg creators are just plain out of their element working in the medium of this decade.

2478,Home Fires, Seems very authentic,"Well my parents lived in this era and I still have my father's bird watching books WW2. It was very different - even compared from when I was young in the 70s. The first episode was excellent. Based on a book I have not read called Jambusters (sorry) I know it has not completely developed into a mini series yet but initially, at least, all the characters were interesting. We like the war dramas and this WW2 period piece has taken over from the very different crime drama Foyles War, at least it has in our house. Foyles War actually raced through WW2 (well we thought it did) and then had to survive in the Cold War. Everything about Home Fires seems to have the depth of the late 1930s and by that I mean not only the colours, like lots of greens and fawns/browns but also the correct and what are now antiques but also the cycling, or running after ambulances and being given a lift by a period tractor. The simple plots, blackberry collecting for instance, surely reflects the pace of that period. Most important the authentic characters with plenty of good actresses and actors have a great script to work on. There are interesting men, at least one nasty one, in the series so it's not just women and the Women's Institute. It might turn out to be a very memorable series. Please keep that era authentic.

Authentic &amp; Brilliantly acted - and yet another superb show canceled... why if you please?,"This kept popping up for me to view and at first I did not watch as I wasn't sure I would enjoy the setting... war time. But the appeal of watching two extraordinary actresses : Francesca Annis and Samantha Bond.. drew me in in the end. So glad I watched. I felt the first episode had to take time to set the stage and the characters and from there it just got better and better. <br/><br/>I can remember my Mother talking about the second world war and what the women did in particular during that time. I feel as though this series really captured the essence of the strength of the women and the strength of people, women and men, when outside threats bring a community together. I loved how the small arguments between the WI members at the beginning fall away into respect and friendship as the months continued. <br/><br/>Of course Francesca Annis and Samantha Bond are outstanding but so are the rest of the cast, women and men alike. Claire Rushbrook, with whom I am not familiar as I have lived in the US for many years, is absolutely outstanding in the role of Pat Simms. As for Mark Bazeley as Bob, her cruel &amp; vindictive husband, he's terrific, I just wanted to punch him! <br/><br/>The authenticity of the locations, sets, clothing, make up etc is first class and it must be quite hard to achieve that.. we are talking about a time which is now 80 years ago. <br/><br/>Like other reviewers, I am dismayed that ITV canceled it. I recall the same reaction when BBC canceled 'Merlin"" ... even though Merlin had more viewers than Home Fires. It seems that viewing figures of 5 - 6 million is not enough to constitute keeping a show going. I wonder what the other long running dramas get ? I simply refuse to believe that more than 50% of the general public want to watch the boring, CGI, violent, blood spattering, badly acted rubbish that is in most shows nowadays. That stuff is being marketed consistently and yet it is these shows, portraying a time when communication between men and women and people in general was gentler, more respectful and shows humanity that many people want to see. <br/><br/>Thank you to the producers, director, cast and production crew for making such an authentic and engaging show. <br/><br/>I hope that some other production company will have the courage to take this up and continue the story.

Stunning sets and achingly beautiful cinematography with sweeping shots of the glorious Cheshire countryside, this drama nevertheless holds the promise of great menace and danger to come. Simon Block has created characters that are emotionally intelligent and with great integrity and authenticity, translated effortlessly into outstanding performances by a stellar cast. The imminence of the war and the women's determination not to be cowed by whatever the next few months might bring is never stronger than in the very first scene: strong femininity versus the brutal machines of war.

Nobody said the American pronunciation which became popular during the 'Friends' long running comedy series among younger viewers. And the young lad on the farm greeting a lady exclaiming 'Hi !'

But I found the scenes of his bullying very upsetting. Although viewers in this day and age would not understand why she allowed him to treat her like that, and why she did not walk out on him, rather than cover it up, in those days she would have been convinced that she would have a difficult time getting a job and finding somewhere to live, as she had been so brainwashed into feeling worthless and that she deserved to be treated like she was, that she would not have had the courage to leave him. She could have got a job and somewhere else to live as workers were in short supply when the men went off to war, but she hadn't the confidence.<br/><br/>The accountant who was being blackmailed into falsifying the accounts of war profiteers should have gone to the police regardless of their threats. Once again, someone was allowing themselves to be bullied.<br/><br/>Other than that, I found that the series overall was very comforting to watch, showing time when people kept their ready cash in a tin on the mantelpiece, and when they paid a bill, placed the banknotes in an envelope.

2503,Green Wing, Brilliant Show--NOT just another hospital show.,"This show is so utterly brilliant. The other day my husband came home while I was watching it and said he could hear me laughing halfway down the sidewalk. May take one or two episodes to acquire a taste for this show, as it is so different from what you're used to watching, but there is so much richness and depth to Green Wing. The characters, while extremely quirky, are still real. While you may be screaming with laughter at some outlandish physical comedy moment or gag one moment, the next they will surprise you with a relatively sober, very dark scene (Joanna and her flip-book of Polaroids of herself as she ages).<br/><br/>In the US, this airs on BBC America. I would recommend it to people who love ""Arrested Development."" Of course, some of the most quirky and original shows can't last through very many seasons without losing some of their sting. I just hope ""Green Wing"" doesn't flare out soon, or disappear as its actors become stars in high demand in Britain and the US, as I'm sure many of them will.<br/><br/>By the way, for those of you who are sick of ""hospital"" shows, don't be fooled. This show couldn't care less about the patients! You almost never even see one, unless used as a meaningless prop beneath a sheet in the operating room. Definitely no ""ER,"" this, thank God.",51 out of 54 found this helpful.,,13 July 2005

2507,Green Wing, Fifteen years later (!) and it's still fresh and funny,"Green Wing is, in my mind, one of a kind.<br/><br/>This show manages to successfully combine conventional elements of a drama/comedy (a compelling romance plot, likable characters, a seemingly grounded hospital setting) with wacky madcap slapstick, mind-bendingly surreal escapism and sketch comedy. Doing so is no mean feat.<br/><br/>Even after seeing the series multiple times, every time I watch the show I undergo the same process as a viewer. Initially I feel slightly weirded out by the unusual filming style (slow-mo and fast forwards are used an awful lot) and juxtaposition of comedy and occasional effective drama. It's so different from the standard TV fare even in 2019.<br/><br/>Then after a few episodes suddenly I once again feel totally at home with the style. By the end of the show I always feel a real final sense of sadness that there are no more episodes in this unique style and format with these great characters!<br/><br/>Perhaps my favourite aspect of the series is that despite it's insane surreal comedy and ridiculously over the top situations, it still manages to exactly nail the real feelings of social anxiety, social awkwardness, work stress and romantic failure that exist in real life. Somehow the show can be a completely mad melodramatic exaggeration of reality and yet still keep the bits of reality you most recognise and empathise with.<br/><br/>Caroline's house party is a notable example of this kind of blend; everyone's dressed oddly and behaving hilariously but at the same time the scene genuinely feels one hundred percent like every fun-but-sketchy-and-awkward house party I ever went to as a Uni student.<br/><br/>The cast is universally excellent, but my special shout out has to go to Mark Heap as Dr. Alan Statham. Heap has been a standout cast member in everything I've seen him in, from Jam to Spaced to Green Wing and the man possesses prodigious talent for both comedic acting and physical comedy.<br/><br/>I also really like Tamsin Greig as Caroline Todd, she brings a kooky humanity Todd that makes her a very compelling ""everywoman"" character. She's not as mad as everyone else (endearing her to the audience), but is still quirky enough to feel like one of the gang.<br/><br/>Perhaps my only disappointment with the show was the ending; personally, I feel like the series could have gone on a good deal longer and it's a shame it ended after only a couple of seasons. The latter half of Season 2 and the Special ending feels rushed in comparison to the rest of the series, as if the writers were simply told by the execs upstairs to make it a wrap.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you haven't seen it...see it!",12 out of 12 found this helpful.,9.0,22 February 2019
2508,Green Wing, Comedy at it's best,"As a fan on good humour that stretches back to the Goons, Hancock, Monty Python, and includes The Young Ones and Fawlty Towers it is always an event when you discover something that is not only very funny, but also funny in a completely new style. Green Wing is excellent. The characters larger than life and unlikely yet are totally believable. You find yourself liking even the most obnoxious characters and wishing you could be in a position to use some of their retorts. The devise of speeding up the film is more than just a gimmick, it's like a vehicle for flying you straight to the next funny situation before you've had time to recover from the previous one.

Caroline and Mac and the respect and attraction that glides beneath the surface. Fresh and innovative.

The characters are really accessible too, and Sue White and Guy Secretan are Really funny. But then even the 'straight' characters are much funnier than the regular stuff. and no 'learning' or 'growing', thank god. the comedy is quite soft, yet it's still enjoyable.

2512,Green Wing, Fascinating physical &amp; mental comedy,"An instant addiction, the big cast of characters are bizarre but complex enough to be believably human (unlike, say, the support roles in Will and Grace).

The dialogue is sharp and very funny (huge team of writers) and on top of all this, there are enough plot lines to make you really care about these hyped-up weirdos, even the radiologist nerd, played by Mark Heap, who in contrast to all geek mythology ever, gets LOADS of sex. Even if the sex is funny enough to make you wince.<br/><br/>So much more witty than the ""let's muck about dressed up in women's clothes, har har"" style of recent ""Little Britain"" and ""League of Gentlemen"".<br/><br/>This is a great direction for British comedy/sit-coms to veer off on.

Michelle Gomez is Glesga's outstanding comic ambassador today. When I worked in Glasgow's hospitals Sue White was nowhere to be seen (probably at drama school). She is excruciatingly funny at times -- through perfect timing accompanied by a host of vocal inflections and gestures I've lived 40 years waiting to see done in an authentic Glasgow accent (in a comedy which doesn't need to be as oversexed as it is). If I can criticise MG at all she occasionally takes a point beyond subtlety -- but, she does it right much more often than not. The awful compost of peoples' lives is satirised acutely -- sad that the failure to know how to find love and give the same, is so evident in the collection of characters, including SW, Green Wing sends up. For its timing and innovation, 100%. For risqué, sarcastic, surreal laughs -- largely from my favourite, Michelle G -- 100%.

2515,Green Wing," The funniest TV show EVER (since ""The Office"" BBC )","This show is without a doubt, the most laugh-out-loud comedy I have seen in YEARS. It's much different than ""The Office,"" in that is standard sitcom format; a sitcom in a hospital, ala ""Scrubs."" But where ""Scrubs"" can be mushy and repetitive, GW is fresh and unsentimental. Basically, it works. All the time. It's too bad that Americans won't be able to view it anymore. Most of the US wouldn't get it anyway. And a lot of Americans would probably find it offensive. Which is too bad, because as I said, it is the funniest hour of TV I have ever seen. It has replaced ""Spaced"" in my heart as the best comedy. I still DO love ""Spaced."" The character of Sue White is the most surreal funny woman EVER on TV. And Dr. Statham deserves all the comparisons to John Cleese. He is a brilliant comedic actor, with physicality to be jealous of. In short, seek this out. Find it. Get a multi-region DVD payer. Hack yours. Do whatever you can to watch this show. With American shows like ""Friends"" having hundreds of episodes, it's sad that GW only has 17.

2518,Green Wing, Green Wing: Superb,"Green Wing is unbelievably original in itself and between episodes. Before 2004 I'd never heard of any of the cast and now they are at the top of my 'to-meet' list. Michelle (Sue White) gives an outstanding performance as staff liaison officer who is confined, most of the time, to her office and manages to think of a different crazy stunt for every Sue-scene. Julian and Tamsin (Mac and Caroline) bring the drama to the show in the most hilarious way possible do really take centre stage a lot of the time, excluding operating theatre scenes where Steve (Guy) stands completely centred and gets away with being the only one not wearing a mask. Boycie, Statham, Joanna and the office girls bring the outrageously bizarre comedy from Pippa (Joanna) having needles in her face to post-its on heads. Karl Theobald plays the forgetful and slow Dr Dear with some family issues going on. Victoria and her team of writers piece together a sound script and leave room for Steve and Michelle to ad-lib.

After that every episode is a full hour packed with the best absurd humor you'll ever seen. It is almost as if every scene is a sketch on its own that is also contributing to the storyline. It is really an extremely clever masterpiece. Also, getting to know the characters helps make the scenes and jokes even more fun. It also is fast paced with really great music leading you out and into scenes and having you laughing and out of breath in no time. There is seriously little time between hilarious scene, situations and jokes that rapidly follow each other up for each full episode. Really a must see series.

2520,Green Wing, Does Comedy Get Any Better than this?,"Amazing, Brilliant, Fantastic...Have I gone over the top with my praise? I think not, GREEN WING is simply one of, if not the best comedy series to come out of the UK in the last 10 years! The rest of the world, you don't know what your missing! I would ""Set the Scene"" for you, but no doubt this has been done already, so ill go onto my personal thoughts! Overshadowed so much by other shows, the first series, although very successful didn't get as much hype as I thought it would although it was utter genius! A sketch show come drama come regular sitcom, I don't remember seeing a more original series. It did take a bit of getting into, the fast pace and constant flashing between scenes did irritate a little at first, but once you get used to them you realise that this makes the show more original and doesn't spoil the action at all.<br/><br/>The writing and directing is second to none but the 99.9% of the praise has to go to the cast. Although a bit of a Mix and Match from other sitcoms and shows, this doesn't affect it at all and you are used to the quite famous cast in their new roles by the end of episode one and you will be left wondering if every role was written for every actor.<br/><br/>Although the entire cast is top notch the best things about this show is the wonderful Michelle Gomez, who's role of Sue White is the best comedy character I have ever seen. Her performances are flawless bordering on psychosis from one minute and Normal (well as normal as Sue Gets) the next. I find myself laughing before she has done anything and if she just stood there the audience would be in hysterics. Mark Heap as Dr Alan Statham is a close second but when paired with Pippa Haywood's Joanna Clore is rite up there with Gomez. Simply brilliant! With the impending release of Season 2 on DVD, I can finally relive all these glorious episodes over and over again.

With equal helpings of bile, vitriol, cynicism, disrespect and sheer gut wrenching embarrassment the cast interact with each other. From the quasi nymphomaniacal 'mutton dressed as lamb' hospital administrator having an affair with the hated, anal retentive, status obsessed consultant radiologist to the newly arrived, homeless (showerless), registrar avoiding the attentions of a self obsessed, puerile anesthetist the show has a good variety of characters. Some of them, although not many, are even functional human beings. I did find that there are just enough 'normal' characters to highlight the truly strange behaviour of the more obvious 'comedy' characters. The actors pull it off well and no-one seems to try and steal scenes, apparently relying on tight direction to balance the characters and the use of wit against outright ludicrous situations to get the humour across.<br/><br/>Relying mainly on good verbal humour and the awkwardness of situations Green Wing does nonetheless have some visual humour and a nice touch in that changes between scenes or characters are denoted by using a combination of slow motion and double speed.<br/><br/>It's only the second episode so far but if Green Wing retains its speed and edge I shall continue to watch and enjoy, only occasionally looking away because a character is being so excruciatingly awful!",5 out of 8 found this helpful.,,10 September 2004

Studied them, analyzed them, watched them over and over again. Great pieces of documentary filmmaking to say the least. NOW, what these guys have achieved here with these light-hearted and hilarious mockumentaries, which reflect the original ones, is just extraordinary! They actually revamped them by adding a comical element to many (with their special SNL humor touch) and certain story alterations but kept the original style of filmmaking accurate and similar to the originals. They made a different documentary; i think that if you didn't know any of their actors or their intentions and happened to come across one of these randomly, then you d think its the real thing! The result is just magnificent.
These mini docs are full of heart, talent, comedy and most of all they give a wink to the viewer to visit the original documentary.
Maybe it will be good to search for a guide on what documentaries they are basing their mockumentaries on so you get more into the humor but its definitely not necessary.

I mean, if you stop thinking that it's a parody on few minutes then you can truly believe that it's a real film. <br/><br/>Work of writers, acting of actors and design of clothes that they were wearing, everything is awesome. I want to mention Bill Hader because, how I think, he's made an excellent work on his role. Lil' Vevie is something I really scared of.

2538,Documentary Now!," deeply niche, exceedingly masterful; a wet dream for cinephiles and comedy writer nerds alike","I will admit to not understanding this show for years. i, as i'm sure is also the case with many others, just found myself confused while watching season one as it premiered. i found myself waiting for some overt goof or joke, when i finally realized this material is far more akin to the work of Andy Kaufman as opposed to the more straightforward vibe of SNL. its less about building to a punchline and moreso about absolutely commiting to the bit.<br/><br/>watching any interview or conversation that includes either Seth Meyers, Fred Armisen, or Bill Hader, it becomes clear that they are simply comedy nerds of the highest order. Armisen has the deadpan commitment needed to sell these jokes, no matter how subdued. Hader has the imagination to turn a simple gag into a realized world. and Meyers has the deep appreciation of the blood, sweat, and tears that go into comedy writing that makes him see the deep brilliance of a joke that would go over the heads of the general public. give these three the keys to a show and you get a truly unique experience, unlike anything else on television.<br/><br/>besides the sheer commitment to a joke, the other standout of this show is the production's borderline obsessive attention to detail when it comes to recreating the documentaries being spoofed. one of the biggest joys of this show is seeing how effortlessly their crew recreates the style and era of each film being parodied or satirized. Armisen and Hader's long-practiced talent of impersonating is also used to great effect for this same purpose. i struggle to name any other actors who can make at least two seasons worth of material where they both embody entirely different characters that works just as well.<br/><br/>given the hyper-focused lens of both comedy and film being put on display here, its definitely not a show for everyone. but if you can open your mind to something completely different, i think you'll find it hard not to enjoy. with the right mindset, its like a warm cup of tea. cozy, comforting, and tranquil to just sit back and take in.",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,10.0,26 September 2020
2539,Documentary Now!, It's not a sketch show (sort of),"(They're not really spoilers but I want you to experience this stuff in the show first.) I love it when comedians do something really creative, and perhaps off-putting to the general public, and it pays off. I scrolled past this on Amazon and it intrigued me because I like Bill Hader and Fred Armisen, but I assumed it had been a hit and miss because it only had 7 reviews, which averaged 4 stars (pretty low for amazon I thought). I was wrong. When I eventually watched it, I found that it is a really funny, creative and intriguing show. I also thought it would be a sketch show, but it's not. Sure, they explore different characters who are played by the same people every episode, but the story develops (as much as it can in just twenty minutes) in a way I don't often see in this type of comedy. It's not just funny, I actually want to know how the episode ends. I love the premise. It's cool that it allowed them to have the freedom to really do whatever they wanted, like SPOILERS FROM NOW ON: have characters be killed off within the first few minutes. ANOTHER SPOILER: ""Their dog is a chicken"" made me laugh so much that I now find it completely unamusing (apparently, unamusing is not a word - did not know that).",1 out of 1 found this helpful.,9.0,19 August 2020

2542,Documentary Now!, A great addition to the IFC catalog.,"*NOTE*: This review is based squarely on the first episode: ""Sandy Passage"".<br/><br/>In my opinion, IFC has produced some of the best alternative comedy in the past decade. From Portlandia to Comedy Bang Bang!, they've raised the stakes for what alt comedy should/could be. <br/><br/>Imagine to my surprise when several months ago, while watching the premiere of The Spoils of Babylon, I saw a promo for a new series called Documentary Now! Starring alt comedy darlings Bill Hader and Fred Armisan, produced by Seth Myers and Lorne Micheals, and presented by Helen Friggin' Mirren! My expectations rose to kilimanjaric levels after seeing it. <br/><br/>Now, having seen the first installment, I feel as if I have a firm grasp on this series and can review it in full. So, here we go. <br/><br/>""Sandy Passage"". A ""parody"" (using that term loosely) of the 1975 classic about a two- man film crew who set their sights on chronicling a mother-daughter pair of socialites living in a ramshackle estate. The episode essentially plays the film beat-by-beat with Armisen being the mother and Hader being the daughter.<br/><br/>It's all very funny, satisfying, and even a bit poignant, but the real kicker comes at the very end, when it is revealed that the mother and daughter are murderers; both responsible for the ""disappearances"" of their former boyfriends and grocery boys. The ending genuinely scarred me, and as someone who often watches horror movies, that's saying something. Though the twist does feel a bit jarring after having sat through something so slow.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Sandy Passage"" is a surprisingly nice little tribute a trailblazer of the documentary industry, and a nice entrance into the world of Documentary Now! I will definitely be watching further episodes. <br/><br/>RATING: B+",6 out of 18 found this helpful.,8.0,5 September 2015

2547,Documentary Now!, Comedy Gold,"Documentary Now! (2015 - ) - [9/10]<br/><br/>I love this show. There are hundreds of reasons behind why I love Documentary Now! (2015 - ). Maybe I love it because of how it mocks legendary documentaries. Maybe I love it because I want to be a filmmaker - and they make fun of a lot of filmmaking tropes. Maybe I love it because it is exceptionally written. Maybe I love it simply because it is hilarious. Critics love it and audiences have never seen it. It is ridiculously smart, absolutely entertaining, and masterfully made. Anyone that has seen a documentary will find this show funny. Fred Armisen, Bill Hader, Seth Meyers, Rhys Thomas, Alexander Buono, John Mulaney, Lorne Michaels, and so many more are attached to this show - each contributing to the hilarity. It is crazy how detailed this show is. It dances across a thin line; it is so close to offending the original documentary, but it honors the original documentary (or documentary company) with each episode parodied. Many shots mimic the original documentaries' shots. In fact, they were able to get some of the equipment that the actual documentaries' used (lenses, sketch artists, etc.). After each episode, you want to see the original documentary, because they make jokes that will go over your head. I love it. The writing is exceptional. It is hilarious, crude, genius, and masterful. The creators are all veteran comedians, with backgrounds in SNL (1975 - ) and it works so well. Documentary Now! (2015 - ) is like a cinematic, thought out, and sincere SNL (1975 - ) sketch. Each episode is a hit, because of the writing. Whether from the source material, spoofing, or mockumentary style. They try not to mock legendary documentaries, but pay ""homage"" to them. There are Emmy nominated performances from each season. Fred Armisen and Bill Hader are masterful comedians. They fully become their characters, with different voices, looks, and quirks. Both of them have very dry, stark, humor and encapsulate what Documentary Now! (2015 - ) is. The guest stars are also hilarious. Owen Wilson is in a couple episodes, alongside Michael Keaton. Peter Fonda, Mia Farrow, John Mulaney, and so many more. Each episode requires a different role (or the same episode has multiple roles), and that just shows how great Armisen and Hader are. Everybody that has worked with this show are comedic geniuses. This show is a lot of fun. Some episodes aren't as strong as the others, but they're funny nonetheless. I've loved this show for awhile, and I can't wait for more seasons and episodes. Each episode has its own unique style (big props to Alexander Buono and Rhys Thomas' direction). Each episode is comedy gold. Each episode encapsulates what documentary filmmaking is. Documentary Now! (2015 - ) is uniquely original, perfectly spoofs classic documentaries, is sincerely made, and a show that every comedy fan must watch.",0 out of 0 found this helpful.,9.0,9 May 2020

2551,Documentary Now!, Very clichéd writing,"Lorne Michaels WAS very talented - over 40 YEARS ago, when he started Saturday Night Live.<br/><br/>Back then, with the original (and still, THE best) Not Ready For Prime-Time Payers (Gilda, Dan, John, Garret, Jane, Lorraine, and - Chevy. By the way; Bill Murray joined AFTER Chevy left), it was biting the hands (the network, et al.) and they DID take chances.<br/><br/>But, since they left Mr. .Michaels has done the same old, same old for so long, it's as if he's a 'puppet,' and everything is 'pre-made.'<br/><br/>There's no more daring humour, no jokes that dare cross the line. It's all safe pablum.<br/><br/>So, seeing his name as Exec. Producer is no surprise - to me. It's like that Simon 'LeGree' Cowell, and all his 'Star Search' rip off series, where the winner DOES get a contract, but, it's more like indentured servitude; they (the winner) is forced to crank garbage out for (in this case, Lorne Michaels) for eternity. They're forced to do his pre-made yuk-fest' whether-or-not they want to.<br/><br/>Analogy; just like a kid who likes Chef Boyardee ravioli might grow up and still find - as they've grown to adulthood, this canned thing to be their 'favourite,' in all its sugar-drenched, chemically- tasting awfulness, it also goes with humour. As there are people who laughed at 'chicken crossing the road' -type humour when they were little, and STILL do years - perhaps decades later.<br/><br/>There are a lot of people who have moved past this.<br/><br/>For the people who still think SNL humour that they remember from their young adult-hood/college years as 'funny,' they will love this. <br/><br/>For what these are - little 'take-offs' of well-known/familiar films, told in a style that almost has a built in 'pause' for the audiences guffaws, it's fine.<br/><br/>But, if you're sense of humour is beyond this stage, these (so far only) 6(I hope that's all) episodes encompass 'ha-ha' versions of Grey Gardens, The Thin Blue Line, and several other well-known documentaries.<br/><br/>The thing is, the original stories these 'parodies' are meant to 'gently nudge' (yawn), are so well- known, and has already had parodies, jokes, and what-not made, that it's pointless.<br/><br/>The humour is plain obvious, i.e., in 'Sandy Passage' (Grey Gardens), we start with the old 'Uncle Mitly' vaudeville gag; men in drag. Yes, it can be funny, but, just drag, JUST for the FACT of having someone in drag ISN'T funny.<br/><br/>The characters in Sandy Passage - 'big' and 'little Viv' are, again - very obvious caricatures, with absolutely nothing new.<br/><br/>The real people, 'big' and 'little Edie' were so much larger-than-life to begin with, they've had performers of every calibre - from small clubs, and gay bars, to big venue shows - do send-ups of them.<br/><br/>The take on Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line, one knows going in that they're going to make the southern  everyone - incredibly dumb (which is OK by me), so dumb, that even with the 'innocent' (but really guilty) party doing/saying everything BUT 'I'm guilty,' they STILL try to brush it off as him being a 'cut-up,' and the (truly) innocent schlub is 'of course' (according to them) guilty (primarily because he ISN'T a southerner).<br/><br/>This is sophomoric humour at best, and if that makes you laugh, then perfect for you. <br/><br/>Otherwise, skip it.",7 out of 55 found this helpful.,,16 April 2016
2552,Kings, Best new series in a generation,"Finally something intelligent and well done that does a network proud. When was the last time anyone in charge of a network production could say that? I was amazed that a TV production was permitted to adapt a biblical story to commercial television and not make it a travesty. The writing, acting and casting are first rate and the ingenious production that sets the story in a modern setting easily identifiable to not only American but World audiences is outstanding. How power corrupts and becomes the guiding principle of a regime (whether its elected or hereditary) and how human failings overshadow all the events they contrive and no matter what they orchestrate, realize that they are really never in control.<br/><br/>Ian McShane steals the show as the King and is perfectly cast. The writers have even managed to depict the proper tone of a man falling from the pinnacle knowing that his path is taking him to ultimate failure after he's abandoned his principles.<br/><br/>Kudos to Christopher Egan and Allison Miller. Egan as the 'David' and reluctant hero and Allison as the love interest and King's daughter who wants to be more than just another pretty face.<br/><br/>Th writing is first rate and I'm amazed that it survived the usual story development process as well as it did.<br/><br/>It's a do not miss and will be talked about for years.",109 out of 120 found this helpful.,10.0,24 March 2009

I see the show as more of a kind of fantasy, with the historical definitions of kings being ""gods"" and ""chosen by god"". I guess what I'm trying to say is, you don't need to be religious to watch it, it's just a really good show whether you are or aren't, just don't expect the show to be fully realistic.

2554,Kings, Wow. Absolute awesome.,"I was fairly impressed with the pilot episode of this series, and even though I picked up on the Biblical allegory partway through, I definitely didn't know about it beforehand. As a fan of drama, I'm fairly intrigued and am waiting on tenterhooks for the next episode, which will hopefully help my impression of the film.<br/><br/>The setting of the story is somewhat unusual. It takes place in a monarchic state called ""Gilboa"", which bears an uncanny (read: almost exact) similarity to the United States, with the one obvious difference being the presence of what appears to be a constitutional monarchy. However, the monarch here isn't some figurehead like the Queen of England. He's a very real monarch. He makes laws, decrees, signs treaties, acts as the head of state and commander-in-chief, and there is a line of succession. Regardless, this is unlike any TV show about royalty that I've ever seen. The culture, customs, dress, language, and society are exact copies of that which you'd find in the United States and the issues they face are very real - if anything, more real - than the issues we find in our society. The society is mixed-race, with no race truly claiming dominance (the royal Reverend is black, one of the secretaries is Latina, etc) and instead of sprawling palaces and estates, the King is housed in a gargantuan skyscraper in the capital city, referred to (tongue-in-cheek) as the Capitol. It reminds me somewhat of Battlestar Galactica, in that you could find nearly everything in our society - but not quite.<br/><br/>The story, on the other hand, is a direct cognate of the David and Goliath story and the rise of David to become King of Israel from the Biblical version. The King's name is Silas (Saul), his son is Jack (Jonathan), of the House of Benjamin, and they're at war with a country called Gath, which commands fearsome Goliath tanks. A farmboy enlistee, David Shepard (note the last name), saves the King's son from a hostage situation single-handedly and takes out a Goliath tank on his own, and becomes a national hero. Out of personal gratitude, the King invites him over for a banquet in his honor, and realizing his potential, turns him into the military liaison of the royal house (an obvious reference to David's appointment as the commander of Saul's armies). He eventually strikes up a romance with the King's daughter, Michelle (as did the biblical David with Michal).<br/><br/>Although relatively faithful to the biblical material from which its borrowing, beyond modernizing, the story takes some obvious dramatic liberties. David isn't fearless, although he is brave. He isn't without flaws. The society isn't Jewish, obviously, it's multicultural and multireligious. And, in a sort of twist of the Samuel storyline, the power working behind Silas is not a witch or crone, but rather a shadow corporation which helped put him into power. Most strikingly, Jack's character is quite different from that of the biblical Jonathan. For one, although only hinted at in the Bible, his homosexuality in the show is made relatively obvious. He doesn't show any love towards David that we know of, and in fact resents him for being given a position which he feels he should have deserved. So, although definitely remaining loyal to the source material, it's perhaps no secret that Kings will develop a life of its own.<br/><br/>The acting is high above average and it paints a visual and dramatic spectacle which is unlike anything I've seen on television in a long time. I sincerely hope this show remains on such a powerful dramatic note.",37 out of 45 found this helpful.,9.0,17 March 2009

2561,Kings, The Best King David Miniseries Ever,"I caught this show by chance in the 4th episode, and had no idea it was based on the Biblical story of King David. I simply enjoyed it as a soap-opera in the court of an alternate-reality, present-day functioning monarchy. (One with royal decrees, cellphones, and young royals in the tabloids.) Then I watched the first 3 episodes on Hulu.com, and figured out the plot line reads directly out of the King David Wikipedia page.<br/><br/>But its brilliant, because it follows the exact story of David's ascension to the throne against the first King of Israel Saul (Silas), with all the characters and relationships from the Bible, with all the drama and intrigue of Shakespeare's Richard III. David saves the King's son in battle (vs. Goliath), and the King rewards him with a military position and the hand of his daughter (Michelle/Michal). Meanwhile the King's son (Jack/Jonathan) sees David as a threat to his own position. Soon, Silas realises David is the anointed successor, and plots to kill him.<br/><br/>All of this is done masterfully, as the writers cleverly (and transparently) work the plot and intrigue into the modern day setting. It plays like modern Shakespeare of a North American monarchy. The story is so engrossing, you forget you're watching science fiction / fantasy. It has all the elements of a classic story, and is extremely entertaining.<br/><br/>I think all of the episodes are already in the can, and I can guess all 13 episodes play out the entire story of David's reign, wife, son, etc. I never knew the story of David until now, and I'll probably read the Wikipedia page as I finish watching the series.",23 out of 32 found this helpful.,8.0,8 April 2009

It envisions a (fictional) powerful industrialized country led by an almost omnipotent king. The story, itself, feels much like a modern day retelling of the books of Samuel in the Bible. The pacing isn't breakneck, but great care is taken to make each moment important. Within the span of two episodes, it's possible see certain character arcs forming, and one character, in particular, already feels well-rounded.<br/><br/>Most shows worth watching inherently reinforce some world-view, and many in this day and age embrace a very liberal one. Kings is interesting because the writing seems quite balanced. A few obvious stances are taken here and there, but many scenes seemed to reinforce the notion that there exist two sides to every story. One cliché, ""popular"" villain has arisen, but the writing is so entertaining that I'm willing to overlook this.<br/><br/>The writing is quite good, but the acting is even better, largely due to Ian Mcshane. I was a stranger to this actor until quite recently- I've seen in him only in the underrated Hot Rod. Mcshane is one of those rare actors with true depth. Not that the rest of the cast is shabby, but he's the clear heart of the show thus far.<br/><br/>Here's my one great worry: While the pilot occasionally beats the viewer over the head, it does so far less often than most popular TV shows. Shows like this have a tendency of dying at young ages. After MOWE, I thought I had sworn off new shows until they had gained a following. In the pilot alone, Kings has given me great reason to take a risk again.",22 out of 32 found this helpful.,10.0,15 March 2009
2563,Kings, Really Good Show,"This was a really good show. First off because they have a good cast, granted the only one I knew about was Ian McShane, but nonetheless they were really good actors. The story is unique but also old plot as well. It was knew with the whole 'King' idea which seems to be in a parallel universe, not talking about sci-fi just that we don't have that here. It is a good show that I really enjoyed, I would mind seeing this on for at least a couple of seasons.<br/><br/>I'd wish I could say more but that would be spoiling it for those who haven't seen it yet.

2564,Kings, Getting cancelled was one of the biggest TV crimes of the 00s,"So much potential in this show. From the amazing writing to beautiful cinematography and perfect casting. Re-imagining stories from the bible in this fashion is a phenomenal idea. I've been dreaming about a series like this ever since I was a kid in Jewish school. These stories are bloody, gruesome, and filled with drama and turmoil with epic resolutions. You can easily turn many tales into modern-day epics. Kings is obviously the story with the most character intrigue, but imagine a long epic of Joshua, recanting the bloody wars and killing in the name of creating a nation and identity. Or the story of Purim as a several season arc.<br/><br/>It's a shame this show is now lost in history. NBC should have at least given the series another season to prove it had an audience. Instead, it was a victim of the early TV streaming days, where Hulu viewership would not count for NBC's ad revenue (even though it was one of the most popular shows on the streaming site). It deserved to at least have a grand conclusion.",3 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,5 February 2019

2566,Kings, I was mad it was cancelled,"I was very disappointed this series was cancelled. As one reviewer said this series may have worked better on HBO or Starz. Personally I feel it was overly intellectual for the average person so people just thought it was not interesting, when in reality it was very well done. The acting was very good and I found every episode to be intriguing and mind bending. The production, style and techniques used were superb. But most viewers do not like to think this much and so it failed. It was easily one of the top 20 series, in my opinion, I have seen on TV in my 45 years of viewing. It is a shame that every time I find a gem like this it only lasts one or two years, and I am a viewer of everything from Rich Man Poor Man, Twin Peaks, Family Guy, I Love Raymond to The Walking Dead.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,,7 November 2011
2567,Kings, Poor Ian McShane,"When I saw Ian McShane on the Daily Show last night, I was really excited about this new show. He had been fantastic in Deadwood, a real S.O.B. who I had to have empathy for. But after watching 20 minutes of the pilot, I had to grab the bucket and hurl. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I probably should have watched more and given it time, but the entire 20 minutes I saw stretched my credulity to the breaking point. The enemy takes their first hostages of a war and keeps them in an unguarded tent within eyesight of the good guys? Good guy runs across brightly lite ""no man's land"" completely undetected? Good guy has a roll of gaffers tape and makes a 'potato masher' grenade because the kingdom that built a majestic city after being at war for decades hasn't come up with anything better? There's just too much wrong with this for me to overcome. I've got to get Deadwood back from the library and watch what happens when good writing and strong characters come to the little screen.",20 out of 43 found this helpful.,1.0,19 March 2009
2568,Kings, I'm not sure what the point is,"""Kings"" is set in an alternate-reality version of today; that is, the societies depicted have technology, architecture, and fashion indistinguishable from modern Western nations, but the states themselves (Gilboa and Gath) are fictional. The storyline takes its basic shape from the Biblical story of the rise of King David, echoing many of the names and narrative functions of characters from the ancient text. This is not a retelling: it's a reuse of structure. However, I don't think anything was made of this potential.<br/><br/>""Kings"" is a good-looking show: most of its elements, taken individually, are very competently executed. Sets, costumes, and photography are all lovely, and the performances are convincing and sincere. However, compared to its source material, ""Kings"" is astonishingly tame and bland. Fatally, when the character of the King is so very toned down, it's not clear what the point is. Even regarded on its own terms, the stakes seem so very small and soap-operaesque. The battle sequences in the pilot episode are a microcosm of this: ludicrous in their tiny scale and nonsensical action. Armies are represented by half-a-dozen guys per side, deployed a couple of hundred metres apart. Imagine a low-budget 1970s BBC historical drama, but with state-of-the-art visuals.<br/><br/>The theme of leadership going bad and questions of holding and losing the mandate to rule are timeless and powerful. It's astonishing to me how little ""Kings"" managed to do with this.",6 out of 10 found this helpful.,4.0,13 May 2014
2569,Kings, Excellent and riveting,"It's as if you have to wait any more to see if a show is going to make it to fall in love...I can't believe this show may be gone after 1 ""season"". I watched the first 4 episodes all in a row and was captured from the fist moment. All the characters are written well, they deliver their parts believably and there are some truly great character actors in this series. I didn't want to have another Hollywood diatribe about Bush hidden as ""fiction"" and it's not. It's loosely based on the Saul and David story a page turner all on its own. I loved the line ""Silas has raised his $10,000 and David his $100,000"" there is a lot of very clever dialogue in this show and I agree with one of the posters who said it hardly seems like a Network show, its HBO quality. I even paid $1.99 to rerecord the first episode before I realized that they were rebroadcasting on SciFi - this show deserves overwhelming support before it goes the way of Firefly.",6 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,11 April 2009
2570,Kings," Dramatic, deep and a delight to watch","One of my favorite new shows. Every episode has been enjoyable and builds the storyline in a good way. I like the quasi biblical feeling to the whole thing; it's epic. My concern is that the story will have to end at some point, and maybe that's an OK thing. It will hopefully burn brightly and end in its own time. I'm glad that IMDb is presenting the episodes here to watch as I do not have HBO. I was surprised to here some criticism of this show as being about religion and God. My opinion is that it's as much about these things as ""Battlestar Gallactica"" was. Unlike Battlestar Galactica, I find the episodes of Kings to be fuller and more interesting.",6 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,7 April 2009
2571,Kings, Good Idea...but....,"The idea behind ""KINGS"" is a great one. The biblical story of David told in a modern setting sounds great. But the production of this modern day telling is very lacking. It was difficult to understand how modern nations, at war, were limited to WWI type trench warfare, with WWII type tanks, but with 21st Century communications and crystal clear battlefield television. It didn't make any sense. Also, the Royal Family is completely and totally repulsive. The producers and writers of this show should be congratulated for providing some television drama that is different from the overload of police procedurals. But is is difficult to see how very many viewers could return to watch more episodes of a show that has several unlikeable characters and a plot that requires much more thought than almost any other drama on the air. It is somewhat reminiscent of the new ""Battlestar Galactica"" in dramatic intrigue but lacks Galactica's human characterizations. Nice try though.",14 out of 34 found this helpful.,3.0,17 March 2009
2572,Kings, AWESOME the second time around,"I purchased the DVD of this remarkable production with the intention of delving into the plots and cross-plots and intrigue which is what I appreciate about the genre. I was pleasantly surprised that watching it the second time I picked up on all the subtle and not-so-subtle religious overtones. It never hit me the first time how much it mimics the biblical story. Sure, I saw the David v. Goliath reference, Silas rather than Saul.. the son Jonathan, who loved David (here in a jealousy not mentioned in the Bible), and all the rest. It's not that I didn't see them, but the quality of the production, the amazing Ian McShane, who can sell poop to a fly with that mellow-as-a-good-cab voice blinded me to the substrate of the story.At first, I regretted not having a second season, but now, I feel it's a complete package.

2574,Kings, Kings story summary SPOILERS!,"Gilboa is recovering from war. King Silas comes across a city burnt to ashes and has a vision of a new capital, Shiloh. God sends him a sign in the form of a swarm of monarch butterflies that then land on his head in the form of a crown.(MONARCH butterflies, get it?) Meanwhile, the northern enemy country, Gath invades. A country boy (David) and his brother Eli are on the front, when they get word that two Gilboan soldiers have been taken hostage. David takes on one of Gath's superior tanks called a Goliath and single handedly blows up the tank (David DEFEATS GOLIAT, GET IT?) and saves the hostages.<br/><br/>Turns out, one of the hostages is the drunkard playboy Prince Jack. King Silas promotes David to the capital as a military spokesman, and promises him any reward. He asks to date Princess Michelle, and the King has to keep his promise. The Kingdom of Gilboa is gaga over the new hero and the daring rescue, and the enemy Gath is demoralised and shamed, and proposes a peace treaty.<br/><br/>King Silas is eager to end the killing, but his evil brother in law William, who heads up the military industry Congrecion, insists the war continue since he bankrolled the building of the new capitol. The King owes him, and must keep the war going (CAN YOU SAY HALIBURTON?). So Gilboa launches a surprise offensive against Gath.<br/><br/>Prince Jack confronts his father when he is ""promoted"" to a safe post, which would hurt his chances of being a respected leader, and expresses his jealousy of the King's new favourite golden boy, David.<br/><br/>The King then chastises Prince Jack, his decadent lifestyle, and reveals he knows that Jack is gay, and that his chances to be King are in doubt. He is ashamed of the Prince, and wants him tucked away in a safe place where he can do no harm.<br/><br/>Upset by the exchange, the King sneaks out and visits his mistress. Then the bombshell is revealed that the King has a secret illegitimate child, who might also be a claimant for the throne.<br/><br/>David gets news of a masacre at the front, and his brother Eli is killed.<br/><br/>Suddenly, without persmission from the King or William the war minister, David approaches the enemy and pleads for peace. The King's hands are tied, he cannot contradict David since he is the public's hero. William is incensed, freezes funding to the government and has a secret meeting with Prince Jack, hoping to back HIM as Silas' successor, since he feels he can control Prince Jack who was more or less told by his father that he wasn't fit to be King.<br/><br/>David is once again hailed as a hero of the Kingdom, having secured peace with Gath. He stands in the garden, and although he thought the King's story of butterflies was allegorical, butterflies start to swarm, and form a crown up on his head...MONARCH butterflies....the King observes this from a palace window.

2575,Kings," Good start, long setup","This has set up some very good possibilities for some interesting drama. It is unfortunate that it took so long to set up. The pacing is more book-like than TV. My major problem is the corporate defense contractor, who ALSO states that they paid for the entire dynasty. A corporation that is a pure defense contractor wants the government to be at war to furnish it with lucrative defense contracts. A corporation BANKROLLING a war however, such as in the show, wants to get the war over with as soon as possible so they can get all their loans paid off with peacetime tax revenue as soon as possible. The problems with who gets stuck footing the bill for a war underlie some of the most interesting and violent episodes in all of history.

2577,Underbelly, Reality imitating art imitating reality,"It is called the Australian Sopranos. There are two problems with this tag: Underbelly is not as good as Sopranos and, unlike Sopranos, it is all too real.<br/><br/>I am a Melburnian. I have worked in Carlton for seven years. Most of the members of the Carlton Crew were familiar to me, although I have never met any of them. Alphonse Gangitano was often referred to as the Robert de Niro of the Lygon Street  not after the actor, whatever his real personality is, but after the characters he played in films like Goodfellas and Godfather Part 2. It was obvious to all that have known him that Gangitano was imitating art and this was true for the rest of the so called ""crew"". On the other side of the non-existent proverbial fence were the suburban kids that had not known a life without violence  Dino, Benji, Carl Melbourne has been mentioned more than once in the past decade as the 'most livable city in the world. It cannot be too far from the truth. It has the most of the charms of the best cities of the globe  from New York to Paris to Barcelona  without their accompanying woes. It also has a dark side, as dark as anything that you would find in Detroit, Marseilles, or Bangkok. Between 1994 and 2005, this alter ego of the city crept into surface of the cultured, intellectual and tolerant Melbourne. True to the title of Bugsy Siegel's biography 'they only killed their own' (mostly) but they did in broad daylight, in front of children, suburban mothers and 'more than innocent'bystanders. One of the safest cities in the world was suddenly in the spotlight as one of the most violent until the forces of the light (played by the detectives of Purana task force) put a stop to it.<br/><br/>What we know is that most of these hard men who lived as if there was no law, no rules, no morals and no tomorrow, also lived life as if they were actors in a movie. The news footage of the funerals (and there were more than two dozen of them) could as well have been taken from the episodes of Sopranos. They idolized the likes of the fictional characters in films such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, Godfather trilogy, and Sopranos, because this is what drug dealers, bank robbers and career killers do between 'jobs', workouts and fornication: They watch films. It was life imitating art imitating life. Those, like me, who watched the whole scene unfolding in front of them (I used to live in the apartment building that was 200 metres from the club where Lewis Moran met his end) with a fascination bordering on the perverse, wondered about the price of real freedom. Were these men really evil or were they simply more courageous than the rest of us? Perhaps, they were both My middle-class friends looked at me with expressions ranging from surprise to disgust when I posed the question to them, only half joking.<br/><br/>Underbelly is a flawed series in a number of ways. Producers' insistence on choosing actors both with local popularity and a striking resemblance to their real-life counterparts takes its toll on the quality of the acting. It is, to say the least, uneven. So are the scripts Way too much emphasis on fornication, after the point is well made, and too much pondering on the popular taste formed by our, now world-famous, serials: Neighbours and Home and Away.<br/><br/>Let me assure the viewers foreign to the current affairs of fair Melbourne: All the public incidents in these series have really happened and their recreation is eerily similar to reality.",64 out of 78 found this helpful.,7.0,9 March 2008

2579,Underbelly, As good as or better than any American drama. From a Canadian's perspective.,"Just started watching this one this week. I have started at season 1 even though I hear you don't need it to be able to enjoy the new series. This show is so well made though, I am exceedingly impressed more with each episode I watch. There is just this building story that is getting bigger the more new characters we are introduced to. If you have seen the Shield, and the Wire already, then this should be your next stop. <br/><br/>Added March 03 2014 - If Season 1 is like the Sopranos, then Season two was like Miami Vice meets Life on Mars. Season 2 is a complete prequel, and it is just as good if not at some times better than the first. The addition of Anna Hutchison, and that Farrah Fawcett hair, and the charismatic Matt Passmore from The Glades (before The Glades)I would call season 2 the ""pretty years"". <br/><br/>Added March 18 2014 - Season 3. For season 3 we are simply following season 2 from the late 80's into the mid to early 90's. and we follow once again both the good, and the bad people of Sydney. This season is very drama/action oriented and it is all about the ""Golden mile"" the downtown strip of Sydney where there always seem to be 2 rivals working to sell drugs on either side of the street, while police corruption finally meets it's match, and the people who try to make a living just getting by are shown coming, and going. This season is not as flashy as season 2, but it is just as gritty. We get as usual some very brilliant women who are just as key to the story as any man with the story of Wendy Jones the Mother of the Detective who's daughter will be one of the mighty forces from the first season, and of Kim Hollingsworth The girl who comes to Sydney with a dream of joining the force, but keeps getting forced back into the life she only wanted to try out.<br/><br/>Added March 21 2014 - So season 1 was the Sopranos, and 2 was Miami vice, the 4th season is Boardwalk Empire, except because it is Underbelly, and Australia, the power players are the women. Kate, and Tilly. These women were the real players in Sydney for years, and as usual this season only covers about a decade, but is is quite an active one compared to the first 3 seasons as you can tell in the fact that it takes the first 8 episodes just to get through the first 3-4 years. The acting in this season is just as good as any of the past 3, and though there is far less death, when the razors come to play it really is a new ball game. It took me a couple of episodes longer to warm to this season, but in the end I may have Enjoyed it more than the others so far. Also the narration has continued with Caroline Craig doing a great job, and the wrap up at the end is extraordinary. I would bet money that ""Big"" Jim Devine actually thought he was running things. (he reminds me so much of my own uncle)<br/><br/>Added March 22 2014 - Yeah they are shorter seasons from here on looks like. Like climbing a mountain, you will eventually reach the top, and have to descend, but that does not mean that the view becomes any less spectacular, or in this case the story acting, and depth. Season 5 we are in yet another decade of a Sidney based view of the good, and the bad, this time around it is 2001-2012 and now that there are only 8 episodes it goes just a little bit faster(though at time it feels repetitive as they will have a specific flashback referenced more than once in an episode). The cast this season is made up of Jonathan LaPaglia who most will remember from 7 Days as the evil, and Matt Nable does a great job playing the dedicated Good cop. This was really the first season that did not reflect really any police corruption, they spoke of Chook in an argument, but that's as far as it ever went. So as I mentioned this was shorter, though I hope I have made it clear that you will not end up with less, in fact the fact that this is more contemporary made things feel more real. the wrap and dedication brought me to a misty place, and I never thought when it started I would end up really caring for Frank, but Aaron Jeffery just plays him so human. Nice. <br/><br/>Hunt down UNDERBELLY﻿ it is from Australia, and you can easily compare it to the best from any other country in the world. You will not be sorry.

2582,Underbelly, Underbelly Under Review,"What can I say about 9's Underbelly? Best Australian TV show of the decade, so far, for a start. Unlikely to be out done. Channel 9's Underbelly is the most significant piece of Televisual cinematic art to grace our tube's since Blue Murder. Comparable to a hyper active season of The Soprano's, it is a major classic series that depicts the 25 or so murders of the Melbourne gangland wars.<br/><br/>At the center of the series is Carl Williams character/ real life OG, played portly and excellently by Gyton Grantley. William's is given an interesting character arc, starting as a lowly Moran driver and slowly moving into producing his own Ecstasy tablets and cornering the market by under selling the competition. Into Williams life comes Roberta, played with a bravora performance by Kat Stewart. She is a gutter mouth shrew who eggs Williams on to bigger crimes and higher times. Together they are the crazed heart of the show. A suburban Bonnie and Clyde. They are completely mythologized in the show. The real Carl and Roberta Williams say they were nothing like the pair, but it doesn't matter too much. The on screen pair are classic gangster characters, reborn, Melbourne style late 90's... in tracky daks and pushing prams, while planning hits.<br/><br/>I should say apart from a few small minor bad apples, the show is exceptionally well cast. Vince Colosimo was born to play Alphonse Gangitano and gives a great opening to the show. If only we could have seen more Vince, but as we all know the Gangitano murder sparked off the war, so he bows out early in his designer suits and tassled loafers. Les Hill and Callam Mulvey nail the Moran brothers... all old school gangster machismo and violence. They are the old power in Melbourne that Williams is out to overcome and then silence after they shoot him in the gut fatefully one afternoon. Kevin Harrington is truly superb as Lewis Moran, he looks and acts just like the real deal from news footage. As an aging gangster in over his head and torn apart by family tragedy, Harrington is excellent. Damian Walshe Howling is central also as Benji Veniaman, a hit-man with divided loyalties. Kind of like a better looking Scott Ryan from The Magician, Benji is a major catalyst in the war with the Carlton crew. The Carlton crew are led (in the show!!) by what appears to be its Godfather Mick Gatto (another great thesp turn by Simon Westaway, capturing the Gatto mannerisms and front). Gatto is the mysterious man at the top of the Carlton tree. An old school gangster, with style and a peace maker, essentially. The violent war shocks him and he does his best to cool the heads of the younger hooligans. Westaway's Gatto is a man of cool respect and one on one Violence only... in the Benji confrontation scene. He is the foil to Williams wild colonial E dealer. Side kick to Gatto is Mario Condello, spot on portrayed by Martin Sacks in probably his best role yet. Condello is a loan shark and money man forced into the big chair of the Carlton crew when Gatto is arrested for Benji's shooting and on the run from William's endless supply of hit men. Throw in an amazing ensemble, see cast list and you have gangster gold.<br/><br/>Add to all this mayhem from the characters above the Keystone cops of The Purana task force. The best character is Steve Owen, who wants to bend the rules to catch these guys and stop the war and murders. Rodger Corser plays Owen as an edgy cop ready to go toe to toe (if anybody would let him) with William's and crew. You wonder why he wasn't allowed to? Indeed, the accusation of the Police sitting around and letting these crims bump themselves off seems somewhat validated in the show. Many scenes where the Police know a hit is happening but fail to swoop on suspects until after the alleged murder (due to some unbelievable technical difficulty) are shown here. Sort of making them accessories of sorts (by incompetence, generally) in the crimes they are trying to stop. Frankie Holden's Detective Butterworth is a short breed eating 'by the book', discombobulated by events head of Purana and Caroline Craig's Jacquie James, is the perfunctory female cop, ala Blue Heelers, narrator and moral compass.<br/><br/>Its a damn shame it can't be aired on 9 locally.<br/><br/>The shows direction has been criticised by friends and while I agree it could have been more cutting edge... that could have made it Internationally brilliant, as good as The Soprano's. The direction is competent and pretty good Oz TV work, moving the story ahead, superb casting as mentioned and lively use of cool Aussie music, etc.<br/><br/>I must say the show is actually meaningful. Has real content. It is profound in its portrayal of Williams as a young upstart good guy, who is slowly corrupted by ambition, his wife, drugs, legitimate threats on his own life and other issues. Even when he becomes a killer he still is a nice guy to friends and family, generous and caring with money, etc., this all makes the Williams character sympathetic. After he is shot in the park by Jason Moran, Williams appears to go a bit 'postal'. He soon escalates the cycle of violence for which the real Williams is now serving his 35 years. But you can't help feel bad for the Underbelly Williams. If he wanted to succeed and stay alive in his chosen profession, could he have acted otherwise? The journey of Williams in Underbelly is one of the more profound Australian tales in many a moon. It resonates, it mostly true from the base facts of the case. Highly recommended Oz TV. Hunt it down overseas readers.<br/><br/>Review by MUFF director Richard Wolstencroft",20 out of 29 found this helpful.,,11 April 2008

Like that show it shows a life of crime and how these gangsters deal with their family. After having seen five episodes more depth is shown and it gets real clear that things will get very nasty indeed. The acting by the cast is superb. And it was good to see Calvan Mulvey (Heartbreak High) return in a much more mature role. What I liked especially in this show that it doesn't exactly choose sides. It is not just about the police getting the bad guys. They also show that even the gangsters have their morals and aren't entirely evil as most people would have us believe. But it doesn't glamorize the life of crime either. When necessary it does show the impact of the crimes committed. Excellent show!,31 out of 51 found this helpful.,9.0,24 February 2008
2584,Underbelly," Brilliant blend of drama, comedy and realism","This is no easy subject to film and is still restricted in its distribution in Australia due to possible legal issues. I found it excellent. The cast is necessarily large and the acting exceptional. The gangsters really look evil and the blend of drugs, excessive sex and violence gives a chilling insight into this nether world of gangland culture. It is shot on location in Melbourne. The case is well known locally and despite it being a dramatization it runs more like a real life fly-on-the-wall documentary. For me it out Sopranoed the Sopranos and is one of the best gangster films Australia has ever produced. See it if you can. I watched all 13 episodes straight through!!",12 out of 17 found this helpful.,9.0,10 June 2008
2585,Underbelly, Each episode feels like a mini saga of its own.,"I really can't say enough good things about this show. Each season we are introduced to a whole new cast of characters and series of events spanning over roughly a decade for each series. The show does a beautiful job of spanning over several years without feeling like anything is rushed or left out. Each episode feels like a mini saga of it's own, with new challenges and conflicts facing the characters that it focuses on. We watch characters grow from amateurs to professionals in a matter of episodes and it all feels very real. Also, as we see at the beginning of each episode, it is all based on real events. A quick search on the Internet will reveal that almost all characters and events are very close to their real counterparts. I could go on about the attention to detail in the story lines and the the top notch acting all around but you should just watch and see for yourself.<br/><br/>Note: I'm writing this review having just finished watching season 3 of Underbelly, which is unfortunately the last season available to me on Netflix here in the U.S.",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,9.0,29 January 2013
2586,Underbelly, Fantastic series. Couldn't be better.,"I loved watching every episode of the underbelly series. The moment you finish one episode, you cant help yourself but to start the next one. Amongst all the characters being played my favorite was Alphonse Gangitano played by Vince Colismo. He was too good. The series picks up momentum again with the introduction of Benji. I loved performance of Gyton Grantley throughout the series portraying Carl Williams. I recommend watching this to all. In all it is a great fun.The series is like a ticking time bomb and gets you involved with every episode. Though a lot of characters were in and out at short intervals, my personal opinion is the characters of Alphonse Gangitano, Jason Moran, Carl Williams, Roberta Williams, Benji were portrayed very well.",12 out of 18 found this helpful.,8.0,14 November 2008
2587,Underbelly," First four seasons were like a full throttle ride, Season 5 ran out of steam","Watching the first four seasons of Underbelly was like a fast ride full throttle. Everything about the fast cutting, the pacing, the music, the freeze frame identification of new characters with whimsical captions, was an exhilarating ride, reminding me of a 13 hour MTV video. This series had a STYLE like nothing I had ever seen before! The slightly skewed reality resembled European films I have seen. As each season appeared, I felt they could not get any better, but they did. I particularly enjoyed the different locations and the new faces from Australia's remarkably handsome pool of talent. Chelsie Peyton Crawford's portrayal of the chain smoking brassy platinum blonde tart with no heart in Razor was tour de force. She wrote the book on common trollop. The sets were good, lots of location shooting, which made you feel as if you were right there, and watching the Sydney Harbor Bridge construction progressing in Razor gave the series added authenticity. <br/><br/>My only complaint was too much nudity and graphic sex, which would rule it out for US network viewing and lose out on a lucrative market. They should have saved the more graphic sex and skin for extended edition DVD's. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Season 5 ran out of steam. Where was the music? Where was the fast editing? Where was the location shooting? Where was the full tilt boogie band feel? The slightly off-kilter reality? I watched two episodes and turned off to do the housework which had been neglected while bingeing on the first four seasons. Did the director change? Was the budget cut? Suddenly the best thing and most refreshingly different series in years has turned into a routine cop show. Whatever the reason, they should have stopped while they were ahead.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,,21 November 2015
2588,Underbelly, Bloody excellent!,"Now firstly I can't help but to roll my eyes at reviewers slating the series having not watched the whole series! I can think of plenty of series that didn't grip me with the first episodes but I gave it a go &amp; it was splendid.<br/><br/>I moved to Australia 9 months ago so I didn't know any of the history of the gangland wars beyond seeing on the news here that they were extraditing Tony Mokbel for murder after his dramatic escape to Greece (series 2 perhaps?).<br/><br/>I've watched the whole series &amp; it was bloody excellent. I live in Melbourne &amp; it was interesting to see the locations I recognised. Now what really made this great imo is that I've met people who were exactly like the characters portrayed, they were believable everyday people - therefore it felt realistic.<br/><br/>Perhaps it's not as slickly produced as the Sopranos but I'd imagine the budget is rather different. ""Underbelly"" - being set in Australia had an entirely feel - a real Aussie vibe compared to US vibe which made it interesting. Both series are excellent in their own different ways.<br/><br/>Highly recommended viewing!",7 out of 11 found this helpful.,10.0,8 August 2008
2589,Underbelly, This is not an American sit-com,"Plenty has been written elsewhere on this site about ""Underbelly"" so there is no need for me to detail the plot or the relationship to real events. My purpose is to comment on the other commentaries. A few years ago, Screen time produced a mini-series based on the Bryce Courtenay novel ""Jessica"". It was aired on the 10 Network in Australia, presumably to boost their Australian drama quota. It bombed despite being of excellent quality. The reason was that the Ten Network audience has different expectations from the ABC audience. The same applies to ""Underbelly"". Though it has certainly rated well and is the talk of the office every Thursday morning, I can't help feeling that it would have been even more appreciated by those whose dials are rusted on to the ABC. Those who have commented here about low production values and those who have compared the show to ""The Sopranos"" give away their expectations as typical Nine Network viewers. They like slick, tightly scripted programs, typically produced by American networks. Thank heavens ""Underbelly"" didn't get the ""Days of Our Lives"" treatment. I feel that I know the characters in ""Underbelly"". The incidents and the people are straight out of the national news bulletins. This is a dramatised documentary in many ways. ""The Sopranos"", popular though it may be, is candy-coated fiction in comparison. Give me reality, rough with warts, any day.",17 out of 33 found this helpful.,10.0,23 April 2008
2590,Underbelly, First season great. The rest? no!!!,"IMDb should actually have separate entries for each series, rather than filing in it as one show with three seasons. Each ""season"" is a separate crime story, set in a different era with different characters. My review of 8/10 is simply for season 1. The first season was a fascinating story and the series was fairly well put together, though it did become a fraction ""soapie"" at some points. Nonetheless, the tone set by the acting was well conceived and the accuracy was pretty much there, even though a few events and aspects were simplified. <br/><br/>Engaging plot, engaging characters, a few well-placed humorous touches, great acting. Enormous success.<br/><br/>Following this, we had the second year which was titled Underbelly: The tale of two cities. This show was set in the 1970s and 1980s and was, in a nutshell, unengaging. The story was a bit thin, it was hard to find characters to sympathise with and several mid-season episodes seemed to play no role in advancing the stories, while others covered areas and stories that were covered in previous productions such as Blue Murder. I lost interest and its dwindling ratings throughout the season were well deserved. <br/><br/>The first episodes of the third ""season"" (The Golden Mile) has just been aired (at the time of writing this) and it similarly appears that the characters will be largely uninspired and a suspicion that material will run thin and ratings with dwindle.<br/><br/>Why didn't they just leave it at the first ""season"" and launch other crime stories under a separate title?

2591,Underbelly, Right up there with the Sopranos!!!,"First of all I am a Sopranos fanatic of the highest order, I've bought all the DVDs for all seasons. Hence with such a ""refined"" palate for the genre I really didn't have high expectations of this Aussie program. In fact when TV3 screened it earlier this year (or was it last year?) here in NZ, I missed it. I caught up with the recent rerun on the same TV channel (also bought the DVD). And boy! I'm glad I did because it is absolutely fantastic... Now, I saw a few ""nah, it ain't all that"" comments here but as 1)a Kiwi who is very frugal with any praise directed at anything or anybody Australian and 2)an out and out Sopranos fanatic I'll tell you this is one awesome show, right up there with the Sopranos. If anything, I think it's even better especially with its ""life is even more mind-bogglingly stranger than fiction"" story. Full credit to the film crew and sound editor; they nailed some emotionally- moving scenes with the cinematography and soundtrack. Underbelly is the only Mafia-style program/movie that has moved me to tears because of its poignant moments of futility, stupidity and sorrow.

2592,Underbelly, Too funny,"Solid Aussie drama. All actors in good form, but top marks go to to Kat, who plays Roberta - hilarious. Vince Colosimo as the Black Prince was also a standout.<br/><br/>The direction and editing may upset the purists, I reckon its edgy and appropriate.<br/><br/>There are some cheesy moments, like at the end when the Purana mob are all walking over the hill in slow mo to arrest Carl (scene saved however by an angry Roberta mouthing a slow mo ""f*** off""!). <br/><br/>Much has be written about the ""reality"" of the show and the gratuitous sex scenes - but all in all its crackin' good tele!<br/><br/>Comparisons to Blue Murder and the Sopranos (and Scorsese?) are a given, but Underbelly stands up fine on its own.<br/><br/>PS - Loved the soundtrack.",6 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,19 May 2008
2593,Underbelly," Australian Sopranos? No, far better","This show is incredible! It is amazingly entertaining.. The best modern crime show ever. Its all true. compare Underbelly to Sopranos? lol come on. Underbelly makes the Sopranos look like p*ssy non-amusing bs. One of my favorite shows because its just flat out entertaining. DirectTV has a little hidden gem. Wonderful writing, crazy characters and wild True stories. It is not for everyone. It's the most gritty show I've ever seen. Where did this show come from? I need it on DVD. It's as well made as an HBO or Showtime show. Mark ""Chopper"" Read makes an appearance. The Kane brothers are deep in the plot. Australia has some great crime stories. This show is far better than The Sopranos. I only compare the two because someone else did. The acting is swell, the directing is fine, the art direction and cinematography are exceptional. If one has the chance to watch this show. Give it a whirl if your not faint hearted. Wildly entertaining. I really can't say enough or too much about Underbelly, you got to check it out.

2594,Underbelly, The start of an epic saga.,"OK, Underbelly is banned in part of Australia(Victoria) and I'm not going into any of the details, so just forget the hype surrounding this show and look at it for what it is.<br/><br/>For starters, it's only the beginning. This is a 13 part epic saga, which so far only 2 of the parts were played, and I'm already hearing a lot of complaints about this show that there either wasn't enough violence or that it just didn't lived up to the hype. Well I say those people probably don't follow the news, because if you knew anything about the past 10 years of crime in the Melbourne Underworld you would not only want to see more after just 1 episode, but you would have a little more respect and at least let the series play out before you start firing guns prematurely like a mad Alphonse Gangitano. Speaking of which, actor Vince Colosimo was outstanding in his role of the prince of Lygon street. If anyone says otherwise they should go back to watching ""Home and Away"", because they obviously cannot appreciate a brilliant Australian actor when they see one. You also have a tremendous ensemble of many established Australian actors with a few fresh faces.<br/><br/>With only seeing the pilot and with my knowledge of what is about to happen, I know this is going to be an epic saga and will be remembered I hope for being a gem in goldmines of the Australian film industry, and not for its controversy. Of course, so long as the poor Victorians get to see it. Lastly I won't spoil anything so long as you watch the news, so we should all know Carl Williams is the last man standing in the end. But right now he is just the ""Underbelly"".",12 out of 30 found this helpful.,10.0,18 February 2008

In addition and wealthy drug indulgence scenes of wimpy looking so called Australian ""underworld"" figures acting like absolute ponces with a arrogant conceited tones to their line delivery.<br/><br/>The film demonstrates nothing about the human condition and the disjointed editing and meaningless ""story line"" requires continual narrative voice over to explain who is who and what is going on.<br/><br/>The whole thing is absolute crap.",15 out of 49 found this helpful.,1.0,17 February 2009
2597,Underbelly, Australia's True Account of Its Criminal Underworld,"Underbelly is Australia's answer to The Sopranos, obviously due to The Sopranos being a HBO show with a much larger budget and scope, Underbelly is always going to seem lower-budget to it. Underbelly however, with its smaller budget has more to go by in terms of value and authenticity. Whilst The Sopranos is based on a real Mafia Crime family based out of New Jersey named the DeCavalcante Crime Family, however it only uses this as the basis for the show and not follow real-life events of the its real counter-part.<br/><br/>Underbelly however, does the opposite and tries to do its best following and depicting the real events of the story of Underbelly. The real murders, the real shootings and accounts that have been written in many books about Australian organised crime. Series one of Underbelly, simply ""Underbelly"" charts the infamous Melbourne Gangland War of 1995 and lasted until 2004. Following accounts, and evidence released the first series portrays the events leading up the bloody turf war over Melbourne's drug trade.<br/><br/>This is done well, seeing as this is to date the more current and recent portrayal of the crimes, as the other series portray the 1970's and 1980's. Most of the cast, is obviously veterans of Australian soaps and television dramas so it can be excused if some of these actors and actresses don't match up to James Gandolfini's status in The Sopranos. This is evident with the designated real-life portrayals in the show of the gang bosses, and top men in the underworld. They do air their presence on the show, the power they wield of life and death and even the respect from their men. Particularly the brutal real-life Melbourne gang boss Alphonse Gangitano perfectly portrayed by Vince Colosimo who has gone on to many more projects since even in America.<br/><br/>For series one of Underbelly, the Melbourne Gangland War is well portrayed from the brutal murders that fanned the flames of the war, to the arrests, and even the trials near to the end of the feud with a smaller budget for an Australian drama. Then ""Underbelly: A Tale of Two Cities"" was aired, set between the years of 1976 and 1987 showing events of organised crime in the cities of New South Wales and Victoria in Australia. <br/><br/>A Tale of Two Cities, portrays the events of the rocky, yet profitable eleven years of organised crime, and partnership of two criminal figures; Australian Mafioso Bob Trimbole and New Zealand Heroin Importer Terry Clarke. A profitable time in Australian organised crime, the show portrays their rise and fall well taking into the account of the change of decades with sets, clothing and filming. A Tale of Two Cities, feels like Boardwalk Empire for Australians but in the 1970's and 1980's.<br/><br/>Both characters of Bob Trimbole and Terry Clarke are well portrayed on screen, by their counter-parts and you can see a rise in quality acting that could put even a few Crime Dramas in America to shame. The show stays faithful to the true events of those years depicted, the murders and even government enquiries into police corruption. The police corruption is well portrayed, and even opens an even more interesting sub-plot that brought the real corrupted police officers in Australia down for drug trafficking, and even murder.<br/><br/>With a change of scenery, another more recent sequel has been released named ""Underbelly: The Golden Mile"" portraying the events of 1988 to 1999 around the infamous King's Cross in Sydney. ""The Golden Mile"" does well to show us events leading up to the original ""Underbelly"" series of the Melbourne Gangland War, as some events cross over and inter-merge together. Police corruption was rife, and is well documented in this third series with police investigations into money laundering, drug trafficking and murder by Sydney Police Officers.<br/><br/>Again characters, real events, murders and trials are well portrayed perhaps to a little extent I feel ""The Golden Mile"" is second to ""A Tale of Two Cities."" This is maybe due to having a real feel of 1970's gangland in Australia, and the sudden move to the 1990's with ""The Golden Mile."" However characters, the acting and writing are still sublime in third season, and may in some areas be better than series one as the police corruption plot is expanded.<br/><br/>Finally of television series released, ""Underbelly: Razor"" has been aired quite recently and portrays the years of 1927 to 1936 and is the earliest portrayal of Australian organised crime in the series. Portraying the events of early gangland in Sydney, and infamous Razor gangs who used shaving Razors as weapons in their fight for dominance. Currently I have yet to get my hands on a DVD release of ""Underbelly: Razor"" to watch, but from reviews I had heard it is a good addition to the series.<br/><br/>As of note, a trilogy of three TV-films were aired and released depicting other events of crime from other parts of Australia. This series continuously becomes larger and ever expanding, which I love and can only hope more for the future. Give it a go, if you have an open mind and want to enjoy gangster films, and shows about other countries.",3 out of 6 found this helpful.,8.0,20 May 2010
2598,Underbelly," Like ""Neighbours"" and ""Home &amp; Away"" with a bit of violence.","Only mild spoilers ---- <br/><br/>I was looking forward to Underbelly for many weeks. The advertising campaign was fantastic and the banning in Victoria definitely helped this. With all respect to the parties involved in the current litigation, I am only commenting on the artistry of this project more than anything related to the events it represents.<br/><br/>Underbelly is correctly based on a true story about the gangland battlegrounds of Melbourne Victoria. This is quite a powerful story and quite possibly something that will be marked for the crime library of Australian history.<br/><br/>This is only a comment on the pilot episode, so I'm unsure of how the rest of the series is going to be. I understand that it is wrong in some cases to even begin to comment on an entire series just on the strength of a pilot so I will only comment for the pilot.<br/><br/>The opening of this series felt weak. So weak that it was almost embarrassing. It was only thanks to Vince Collosimo's performance, that it held together. Even so, with dialog that was undoubtedly written by a soap opera professional, it was amazing to see that all of this almost worked. The violence was not that violent considering the camp ""Terminator SCC"" was on immediately afterwords and left it for dead. The sexual content is about as sexy as a bad hand-job. I don't know what the tabloids are trying to enforce because the Direction on these areas were mild. Doesn't matter much on this point though, we know that this kind of thing doesn't make up for a good story. Now, a lot of the introductions to these characters were almost comical, like a lock stock and 2 smoking barrels kind of slating for gang members. This felt cheap, it looked cheap and it was unintimidating in any way. If this was an attempt to make us aware of a possible ""coolness"" to come from these characters, then it just wasn't right.<br/><br/>One begs to wonder whether this series needs or now needed a better Director and a better cinematographer or should I say a videographer. (Well, it felt like that anyway) Maybe even a better writer, because a lot of our actors here deserve way better than this. I think some of the most unfortunate and lifeless work was lingering around the gang meeting scenes at the sports arena (or was it a racecourse?) But apart from this, there are definite believable and smooth moments. I hope more of these moments occur and I must say I am somewhat interested in seeing more of Gyton Grantley who looks exactly like Carl Williams in real life. <br/><br/>There are more episodes to come and I look forward to eating my own words. For a TV mini series, it's not over till the fat lady sings - but so far, I'm hearing a scratchy record loop.",9 out of 31 found this helpful.,5.0,13 February 2008

It took me a couple of episodes to understand what was being presented, but the payoff was so very worth it. I think I went in thinking this was The Sopranos and was put off by what I mistakenly assumed would be the ""infamous protagonist"" of the story. I then realized my approach was incorrect.

2602,Alone, Very very highly recommended,"I've never felt the need to write a review on IMDb, but the few people who don't give this show a high rating seem to be the only ones writing reviews. <br/><br/>Alone is not so much a survival show as a psychology experiment. The contestants are dropped in a dangerous wilderness with just the barest necessities and left to their own devices. Besides having to find shelter, food, and drinkable water, they have to deal with being alone all the time for as long as they can stand. Some of you probably don't realize how hard it is to deal with loneliness. Just watch a prison show and see how people break down in solitary confinement. <br/><br/>The one thing they have for company is a little hand camera, and the contestants that last long enough really open up to it. The longer the season lasts the more they bare their soul for all to see. To me it's the most fascinating TV I've ever seen.

Sometimes the drop off location is not as good as others, but that's the part that shows how good of a survivor these folks are.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this show just based on the fact that it is legit and lets you into the lives of very diverse individuals and what they see as important to them.

2607,Alone," A ""Real"" Reality series","Lot's of haters reviewing. First off, I would call for help within 30 minutes as I could never survive. The only thing I could outlast anyone on is being completely alone but I have none of that survival skills.<br/><br/>I think it's funny that many really think this is easy and not realize the many limitations these guys faced. They were not allowed to take any firearms or protection aside from pepper spray. You could take a bow and 6 arrows but not sure that would do much against a bear. As far as equipment, they were only allowed to pick from a list of 40 items. I'd really like to see these guys huffing and puffing to really join the show.<br/><br/>As for help, depending on where they were, at night, there was no way anyone could rescue them immediately. In one of the episodes (spoiler alert), Wayne called for help after a bear started chasing him... help got to him 3+ hours later...<br/><br/>I really like this because it's a ""real"" reality show.

I find it very entertaining watching the contestants do the wrong or right thing and then deal with consequences of there choices. I have also learned a thing or two - like using a tarp to build a boat or something that will float (never considered that, but I have a canoe so I never had to). The longest amount of time I have ever spent alone is 6 days and I have been alone for days many times over the years. I can tell you first hand it can really mess with your head.<br/><br/>Storms, vermin, predators, insects even the silence it all effects you.

2609,Alone, Being out there is not easy.,"Being out there in the wilderness at night with no protection is no picnic, and I can tell you have never done it if you think it is.<br/><br/>I can say this because I grew up in northern Canada, and as a kid we would chase away black bears and we saw them all the time when i went hiking with my friends. I was 12 at the time and a group of us would chase these bears away, we lived in a town of about 350 people up near Alaska, a small Canadian mining town, and so I got used to seeing all kinds of wildlife. There was one time an older black bear turned around and started charging back at us after we had chased it across a big baseball field at night, I have never ran so fast in my life, and the kids I was with ran as well, as there was no protection out there on a field with nothing to climb or hide behind, we had a golden retriever who was my family's dog, He had warned me more then once about some bear while camping or fishing, and had many times he had stood his ground protecting us, but that time he ran faster then all of us, and speed past me.<br/><br/>I have also read all the stats about wolf and bear attacks, and while it is one thing to understand that there has not been any real wolf attacks documented, it has happened. And there are numerous bear attacks having been documented. There is a big difference between a timber wolf and a normal wolf. When I was around 15 years old, I went hiking and being a kid was oblivious to my surroundings. I was crossing a river, when I felt something, so I looked up, and there was a timber wolf staring at me also crossing the same river, it wasn't the usually way a dog looks at a person, it is very different, you could see he was trying to decide if I was food or not? It was super scary, the two friends I was with bolted, and having no choice at that time, I did the same. When he started to run at us I could tell he still hadn't decided what he was going to do, but it was just instinct. I got to a bunch of trees and climbed up them quickly and he stopped at the base of the tree and looked up. He then heard another hiker call out down the trail, and he gave me one last glance and bolted. if I was alone he might have decided to eat me, seriously, while most Hollywood portrayals of wolfs is ridiculous, attacks do happen, and a timber wolf is a real predator, unlike a normal wolf which i feel like I would have a chance against, a timber wolf is so much bigger and made to kill big prey. Their chests are huge, as well as their paws and teeth.<br/><br/>Anyway, it seems like easy money this show, but to the credit of the people who have left, it is another thing when you are actually being stalked by the bear, all the way back to camp, that is serious behaviour and I have no doubt that such a bear would attack when it showed no fear, and actually showed aggressive behaviour. Admittedly wolfs, I would be less scared off, but is is still another thing to have no way of protecting one's self and no way to get help quickly. To those who think it would be easy, well, go try being in a tarp tent, without even a zipper, and see i you think you are as brave when a cougar, bear or timber wolf is scratching on your door.<br/><br/>The best thing any of them can do is create a big fire at night, that would go a long way to scare away animals, and create some sort of protection. I can't wait to see anyone here who thinks it is easy to get out there at night, and see how they do. Again, it is a completely different thing to read stats, or to meet bears with the protection of a car, a good tent, even the protection in numbers, then when you are all alone, with no weapon, and know you are pumping fear hormones into the air. You have no idea how scary that can get, it is no wonder that the people who have had predators come back to their camp have left... I do not blame them, even having my experience with bears and wolfs. <br/><br/>Maybe the show's producers should take people up on these forums who think it is easy.",37 out of 48 found this helpful.,,10 July 2015
2610,Alone, 'Alone' puts the 'real' back into reality TV.,"Although TV series like SURVIVOR can be quite entertaining they are for the more part very much manipulated in multiple ways, the producers put up challenges that they think will benefit certain more interesting characters and conflicts are at times nothing more than a production.<br/><br/>Here we get none of that, no votes or backstabbings or alliances, no competitions to get immunity or extra nurishments etc. Not even any contact with any outside human sources such as a camera crew or anything because they have to film their experience themselves.<br/><br/>The rules are really simple, 10 people are taken to isolated places in the wilderness miles apart from each other. They then have to try to survive off the land, build shelter and find food sources to last them as long as possible. <br/><br/>All while surrounded by packs of wolves, bears and cougars and dealing with often extreme weather conditions.<br/><br/>The person who stays the longest wins, 500 000 dollars.<br/><br/>So there are no gimmicks or game twists merely survival of the fittest and that is why this is a reality series that is definitely well worth checking out.",16 out of 19 found this helpful.,9.0,2 February 2017

The episodes themselves consist of half doing and half talking behind b-roll of the environment, with cliffhangers stuck on each commercial break. There's a lot of downtime with the whole zooming out showing the contestant's area which will have you reaching for the fast forward button.<br/><br/>These downsides are mitigated by the heartbreaking moments in each season. Don't be naive like me and immediately dismiss it because it's a reality show.

2612,Alone, Alone Artic in the treeline like 1000kms as the 'crow flys' or in this case the Raven from the real artic?,"I was born in Yellowknife on Great Slave lake where this year Alone Artic is filmed. One no offence but this is not the Artic, it Boreal forest / borderline tundra but not the Artic. Great Slave is 400kms below the Artic Circle and over 1000 kms as a raven flys from Inuvik 3600kms by road (one of many true 'Artic' locations to base such a series from. Artic to a Northerner is the land of the Inuit not the Deni people. Also this show was filmed when there was still a lot of light and no real freezing (there is a 6 metre (20') thick solid surface of ice over Great Slave I the winter (there is a major Ice Hwy. from Hay River to Yellowknife) every winter. So saying these are 'Artic"" conditions is like slightly stretching the truth lol. Do not get me wrong, I'm enjoying the series but some honesty about this years true 'location' would be nice. So like showing a northern Boreal Forest setting in early fall, is not the Canadian Artic sorry to burst anyones bubble.

2613,Alone, Way too much filler/editing and the sound effects are horrendous!,There is so much overlay and intro between the commercials its excruciating. The only way to watch this is to record it first and zip through the filler. They repeat so much stuff as well. They take a great concept of being just by yourself in nature and destroy it with the most commercialized editing drivel possible. And in many episodes (I'm currently in Season 3) they use this breathing sound effect ad nauseum. Its used often more than once a minute. Can you imagine how aggravating it is to go through that - to hear something maybe 100 times in a single episode? Truly the most brain dead editors working on this show.,7 out of 9 found this helpful.,5.0,27 June 2020
2614,Alone, Best (Survivorman-style) survival-based contest reality show out there. I think Les would enjoy watching even if he hasn't admitted it yet.,"They took Les Stroud's innovation to film himself alone and built a reality show contest out of/around that premise with 10 contestants per season and the results are great. It was a no-brainer really, and i'm surprised no one got around to doing this show until so many seasons later after Les basically laid out the formula minus the contest part, which is really not a bridge too far even for the least impaired and creative producers out there. It took more inspiration to come up with naked and afraid than it did this show, but this show proves that more [hokey, over-produced] is not always better. Let them try to make it, and give them cameras, in an unforgiving environment at a time of year when it only gonna get worse and worse. Let the participants do the rest. Only pay one of your contestants/content producers. How could that plan possibly not have succeeded? Great entertainment for anyone chilling in a warm home with food while appreciating the small things over which others are struggling mightily. Makes a little snack from the fridge/pantry that much more satisfying.",5 out of 6 found this helpful.,10.0,7 May 2020
2615,Alone, Great Show,"I was amazed at how much trouble participants had with this challenge considering the potential payoff. Isolation became a huge factor but obviously some of them were starving to death too. I think the person who won made it with mental toughness but also due to ingesting as many calories as possible and good shelter location. The man who came in second had some shelter issues and he was clearly starving to death. Going into it, I figured the animals would have been the biggest problem but it was isolation and lack of food for the people that made it more than a week. An interesting experiment. I tend to think I could do four months easy for half a million dollars but apparently that's not true. Great show.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,9.0,23 August 2015
2616,Alone, Good Show But I Wish the Conditions Were Less Harsh and More Emphasis on Skills,"I wrote about S1 and I've just watched S6. The participants in S6 were outstanding and the conditions way beyond dreadful. I like the show, although it seems like torture porn. I wish they could have a season that wasn't so harsh and really allowed participants to thrive in the wild instead of barely--and I mean just barely--surviving. The extreme conditions work to speed up the process of elimination, but it just seems cruel and very inhumane, like throw gladiators into the arena.<br/><br/>S1: Absolutely extraordinary! A thrilling landscape and a formidable challenge for the participants: survive in the Pacific Northwest wilderness.<br/><br/>First of all, it seems a little risky as a TV show as it wouldn't be impossible for someone to die doing this, not impossible at all. The chances of someone being hurt would be highly likely, in my opinion. The location they use in this season is the spectacular Pacific Northwest, an area I know pretty well having lived in Seattle for eight years and I spent a lot of time in the mountains in Washington and British Columbia. Bushwhacking through these woods is extremely difficult and the weather (I think they began the show in late September or October) is pretty wretched as you will see. Below are a few of my thoughts as I watched the episodes.<br/><br/>I went through Air Force Survival School in eastern Washington (Spokane) and it sucked, mostly because it was the coldest winter in school history (just my luck). I'm not saying that I would do well in this sort of thing but I guarantee I'd last more than a few days.<br/><br/>Dudes are crying after a couple of days-one guy the first night like the fat guy in Shawshank. I could go without water or food for a few days without missing a beat. ""Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!"" Grow up and grow a pair.<br/><br/>The most embarrassing thing is the ""rescue team"" that snags the very early quitters, as if they are being rescued. No, you aren't being rescued; you're giving up almost immediately.<br/><br/>""Nobody knows what it's like out here except the ten guys doing it."" Dustin (quit after 6 days). I think that a vast Indian population who lived there for centuries would beg to differ.<br/><br/>Stop trying to build a canoe, dude. Make a decent house in which you can sit out a mild Northwest storm without crapping yourself and crying. What a bunch of crybabies. Seriously, Crying? On camera?<br/><br/>""I did it. I made a boat."" Fantastic, how does this help you survive? And how the hell does he have time to build a canoe? To do that he obviously isn't having trouble getting food and water in which case one would ask why he feels the need to build a damn canoe.<br/><br/>I think that after three weeks you could walk out of there with your head up. That's a long time and shows that you could probably go longer it you had to do it. By episode 8 they are into their fifth week in the wilderness, time enough to have serious problems with hunger. Sam was the big surprise for me because he looked like some Dungeons and Dragons video game punk and he hung in there. Sam-mouseboy-seems to be putting way too much effort into trapping tiny rodents which present a small pay-off if you succeed and would hardly provide the calories you need. Roasting it wouldn't be the best choice, calorically speaking, to prepare food. Boil it in water to retain every bit of fat. The same goes for fish and shellfish.<br/><br/>In this area if you aren't fishing you are wasting your time. Mushrooms would also be a likely and abundant source of carbohydrates. Shellfish would seem to be abundant and easy to snatch. This part of the world is lousy with mussels and oysters but I didn't see anyone making much use of this resource. A couple of them brought along a bow and arrows and a slingshot (Sam) yet we see only one half-hearted attempt by Sam to hunt. There is only one bit of film of him letting lose a single arrow. They couldn't kill a bird?<br/><br/>I'm just not seeing enough food production from any of them to sustain life. Allan was the only one who seemed even remotely successful in getting a few fish but they never showed him catching anything in his big fish trap. Meanwhile Lucas is spending his time making a lute? Not the best use of your time when you're slowly starving to death. I would spend every waking minute getting food, water, and making my shelter the best it could be.<br/><br/>None of them brought a shovel. Maybe it wasn't on the list but it seems like it would have been a valuable tool. If it wasn't available to bring along they could have made one for clam and mussel digging and other chores around the camp.<br/><br/>Here is what the last four packed in (the other six who left early were complete chumps so I didn't bother with their lists):<br/><br/>Allan 1. Saw 2. Axe 3. Sleeping bag 4. Large 2-quart pot 5. Ferro rod 6. Water bottle/canteen 7. 300 yards single filament line with 25 assorted hooks 8. Small gauge gill net 9. 3.5lb wire 10. Knife<br/><br/>Sam 1. 12×12 ground sheet tarp 2. Axe 3. Sleeping bag 4. Large 2-quart pot 5. Ferro rod 6. 300 yards of single filament line with 25 assorted hooks 7. Bow and 6 arrows 8. Slingshot 9. Extra emergency rations 10. Knife<br/><br/>In the end the best man won, and the funniest man, and the most articulate man, and the most philosophical man. Alan just seems like a great guy.",11 out of 19 found this helpful.,10.0,18 August 2015
2617,Alone," Amazing show, until episode 9 season 3","To be honest here, i love the show. I believe this is one of the closest to reality, TV shows. However......<br/><br/>I do believe that their obsessive need for diversity has lead to the exacerbation of several stereotypes and has recently in episode 9 of season 3 has hit a new low. I believe the circumstances of Dave's disqualification for medical reasons was highly suspect. This man had 30 fish fillets and a seemingly endless supply of vegetation and fungi for additional minerals and necessary nutrients. <br/><br/>My argument is that low blood pressure due to long term starvation is noticeable by medical professionals weeks before it becomes ""dangerous"" or a risk of ""organ failure"". So if as the producers said they perform medical exams every week, then the doctor would have known long before it was actually that bad. Even with such a low blood pressure, simply eating two fillets a day, in two meals, he would have quickly improved. However they pulled him without question. During all other clips during doctors visits, they told the contestant their vitals, however in Dave's case, they did not. In other seasons the doctors notified the contestant before their Health issues were dangerous and even posed a choice to stay. But in Dave's case he was forced out. Dave seemingly could have stayed at least another two weeks, where as all other contestants had no food reserves and are on the brink of collapse mentally and healthily. So he was a shoe in for the win, unless the producers removed him. We all know betting happens regarding the win er of this show and this executive decision totally warped the odds. Secondly, it is clear the producers and editors have set the narrative for a female winning since the beginning, despite the person with the clearest path to victory was just forced off the show. <br/><br/>Im disappointed and feel the show was unjustifiably rigged after this stunt. I would have rated 10, if it weren't for Daves disqualification and their constant seeming need to place unqualified people in the show in order to ""diversify"".",8 out of 14 found this helpful.,9.0,3 February 2017
2618,Alone, The stress of dealing with yourself.,"I've always been a sucker for survival shows, but the newer shows tend to focus too much on the sensational than what one actually needs to do in a survival situation. Les Stroud being the exception. THat's why this show was a positive surprise for me when I started watching it. I was expecting a show more in the lines of Survivor or something like that, but instead I got a show where each man is pitted not against the other contestants, but against himself and his skills or lack thereof. It was interesting to watch how the guys dealt with the wildlife, climate and the need to build, from scratch, a home in the wilderness. It also helped that the climate on Vancouver Island is much the same as where I live, minus the large predators, so it was extra fascinating since this showed the rigors of trying to live off the land in an area that's damp or wet most of the time. The simple task of making a fire, keeping stuff dry and keeping warm is made that much harder when everything's damp.And all this done by guys that easier to relate to than Bear Grylls. THey seemed like guys you'd meet at the local pub or at work, but with just that little bit of extra interest in survival and the outdoors Another key thing that kept me watching was that you could see their struggle to keep, well, not sane, but motivated to tough it out when the trip back to civilization was just a phone call away. Back to the family and friends and the modern creature comforts. So, all in all an amusing show that actually managed to teach me a few tricks along the way.",4 out of 6 found this helpful.,7.0,7 August 2016

Why is that I wonder? They are all catching lake trout, there is no falling and rising tide or any of the sea life associated with the ocean. None of them have gill nets for catching fish, which the first two season participants had and used to their great advantage. Other than that, it is well worth the time to watch this show.

I understand that they sometimes need to stretch it to fit the time slot of a large corporate network, but the repetition of scenes in most episodes is so annoying. If this was an indie show like Louie's Horace and Pete you would have better continuity - some episodes longer than others when they have to be.<br/><br/>Now that season 3 has finished, I agree with the other comment about Dave; he seems to have been treated unfairly and the show producers/doctors should have done their homework better and let him know before its too late.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,2 October 2016

Of course, besides various entertaining destinations in the desert, Vegas/Primm gambling, and the Hoover Dam, the pawn shop where this show is filmed was one of our main destinations.<br/><br/>The actual reality of this show made this ""pawn"" shop, by far, the most disappointing part of our trip.<br/><br/>Everything I found out about the actual reality of this shop and show was gathered from the locals who were in line (over 30 of them that day) waiting for a chance to stand around in the ""pawn"" shop as extras during filming, looking like they are shopping for something.<br/><br/>Watching the show, you think what you see is the best of what happens every day in the ""pawn"" shop. No, what you see is a staged, filmed, and in all likelihood scripted TV show that is filmed in the ""pawn"" shop. All of the characters on the show do not even set foot in that shop more than one to three days a month.<br/><br/>If you go to the ""pawn"" shop on any given day, either they are filming and you can't get in without being picked as an extra, or there are a bunch of people working there that you've never seen before on the show. The vast majority of the ""pawn"" shop is never seen on the show because it is just for selling show merchandise. The tiny part that you do see on the show has a ton of overpriced crap. I say ""crap"" because none of the stuff you've ever seen ""purchased"" on the show is ever sold there, only typical pawn shop crap being sold at about triple its actual value because you pay for the privilege of buying it there.<br/><br/>Oh, and the people who walk in to sell stuff? They have to pay $200 for Rick and company to look at it and offer to buy it or turn them away. So, when you're watching the show, anybody who sells anything for less than $200 just lost money purely for the purpose of getting on the show. Anybody that gets turned away because they wouldn't buy their stuff just got stiffed for $200. But at least they got on the show. Maybe. I have to believe some of the suckers who pay $200 for a Rick appraisal don't even get on the show.<br/><br/>That fact alone, confirmed by more than one of the locals, just made us sick enough to stop watching this show. You just can't watch people go into that place and get screwed after you find out that every one of them paid $200 for the privilege.<br/><br/>Of course, there's the fact that the guys on the show that you think work there every day don't actually go in to work more than one or two days a month for filming of the show. I'm sure they've made way too much money at this point to be working, let alone seen, at a pawn shop.<br/><br/>Pathetic.<br/><br/>So, I would have given this show one star, but I gave it two stars simply for the fact that, by itself, ignoring all the facts of the reality behind this show, it is very entertaining and sometimes informative.",34 out of 45 found this helpful.,2.0,26 October 2013
2631,Pawn Stars, Chumlee isn't funny,"Been a fan of the show since the first series. Corey and Rick seem good guys and good luck to them. I don't understand why Chumlee is some kind of hero in America. He isn't funny- and he pretends to be dumb like Paris Hilton (albeit with slightly more facial hair) but spoils the show. Would be better if Chum went- Rick and Corey would do the selling and the Old Man would complain in-between. Chum, the scripted story and constant laughing at stuff that isn't funny are the downsides to the show. Would be much better if the staff didn't pretend they were working and produced a show where they come out of the back for great items only...we know they don't work on the shop floor off camera and it's insulting that they still carry on the pretense after all these years. I have been to the shop - very poor touristy style attraction...not a pawn shop as such. Just cashing in on the T-Shirts and other low quality merchandise. Don't go to Vegas just to visit there - you'll regret it.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,7.0,8 August 2014
2632,Pawn Stars, Highly entertaining show,"To comment on classicalsteve from Oakland, CA's post. The most important point was, as with ANY business situation. : Do your homework on current market values! I don't think in the case of Pawn stars that these guys necessarily make an offer based on what YOU think you should get for it, but rather, what they think or know they can get for the item. No different than any other wholesale to retail business.<br/><br/>Although there are similarities to antique roadshow, these guys are offering INSTANT CASH in most cases. When they are unsure of an items value, they bring in experts in their field, and they do it while the customer is there. It is funny when the expert says an item is worth 3000 retail and then the customer expects 3000. As Rick says over and over, I can't stay in business paying retail.<br/><br/>As to Steve's comments on collectibles; I don't think they are making 10x what an item is worth. Anyone that stupid to sell so cheaply deserves to get hammered in my opinion. If you are a collector, then you should be doing your own homework on channels to sell through, and there are plenty of them. If you feel your best option is to sell to a pawn broker, then what would you be expecting? Steve, I'd like to know in your opinion, what exactly the value of ""culture"" is, as you state in your post. They are pawn brokers. That's what the show is about. Your post suggests that the SELLERS of the items are not interested in the money, which is clearly not the case. Every single person is most interested in what they can get for their item. And I also don't agree with your assessment of ""the poor seller at their mercy due to lack of knowledge."" Knowledge is something that can be acquired, and sellers should obviously have acquired some concerning their items value before entering the arena of buying and selling. Also how could they tell the buyer what they intend to resell the item for when they really never KNOW what they're going to get. Market forces are constantly at work. Personally I think you paint a picture here that these guys are crooks, when in reality, this is business as usual. Buy low, sell high. You are clearly not a businessman. The interaction between the characters is highly entertaining, and somewhat informative as well.<br/><br/>Mike",50 out of 72 found this helpful.,,26 November 2009
2633,Pawn Stars, GREATLY Disappointed by 2015 Episodes promised return to basics,"I HAD been a long time fan since conception of your program, but last year I finally got fed up with the absurd juvenile antics which had come to take the place of the great history rhetoric Rick used to provide and the general education via unique items and paraphernalia otherwise never to be seen or heard of by the layman.<br/><br/>With much travail and hesitation my wife and I decided to bid adieu to the program so long having been a part of our entertainment and topics of conversation. Deleting that timer from our DVR was actually traumatic, silly as that sounds, for it felt as if we were restricting ourselves from access to a part of our very own family.<br/><br/>Imagine our GREAT delight when this year your advertising campaign was aimed at delivering a message of ""going back to basics,"" or so we gathered from watching them. With much delight, I re-sat a timer for PAWN STARS and we were ready to go! After the first four episodes our disappointment was gut-wrenching, you were right back to the same asinine stupidity and themes aimed at Chum's flaunting his ignorance and retarded/obstinate head-butting with Rick to prove his non-conformist viewpoints. His waddling around a place of business in flip-flops and the pathetic display with the ""Bearer of the Note"" being the exact sort of infantile displays of stupidity, backed with agreement and encouragement from Corey just to agitate Rick; I think you underestimate how much it DOES agitate people with a normal brain and certainly business oriented and/or persons of a physical or MENTAL age past 15.<br/><br/>So, once again, I have deleted my timer for Pawn Stars. I know you don't care about one person, but just so you know, everyone I know has done the same. People are simply sick to death with the childish, immature displays of adolescent contempt for authority figures and disregard for any sense of normal business practices or respect for their elders or management. Corey owning part of the business does not grant him a right to be respected, his friendship and antics with Chum may delight the teenagers, but I doubt many of them are spending the big bucks in your store or steadfastly watching your program, as those you continually agitate with the absurd frolicking and bizarre behavior of the moronic imbeciles viewers must tolerate in order to hear a few tidbits of wisdom from Rick and true professionals.<br/><br/>Once upon a time, we looked forward to this show with GREAT anticipation, loved the history of the items presented and the education gained, but now it is a sad soap opera of pathetic BS and whiny, immature characters acting like .........well, there aren't words for it. It is pathetic. It is scripted, plot oriented garbage revolving around an imbecile without responsibility or common sense. I HOPE that Corey and Chum are truly not as ignorant and immature in real life and their behavior on the show is someone's sad, pathetic concept of a way to grab an audience of 15 year old boys, forgoing their appeal to adult audiences entirely.",12 out of 15 found this helpful.,1.0,15 November 2015
2634,Pawn Stars, Went downhill,"I started watching this series from the git go. It was really good until this year (2013). I found the items that the people brought in to pawn or sell very interesting. I learned some very entertaining and even educational stuff at times. The give and take between the ""stars"" of the show was funny at times but I think it is now taking over the episodes. There is so much interaction with the big boys, both figuratively and literally, that the true purpose of the show is now secondary to the wise cracks, bitching about Chumlee, and watching the Old Man sleep. I used to have the DVR set to record the show but now I just don't watch it anymore.",16 out of 22 found this helpful.,3.0,6 June 2013
2635,Pawn Stars, Jumping the shark?,"I still enjoy the show but see signs of it maybe running out of gas. Too many obviously scripted situations attempting to be cute and funny. Chum getting a more serious role in the show which he really doesn't seem to be cut out for, especially when he starts rattling off facts concerning whatever a customer is trying to sell or pawn. I realize that it is a TV show and that you can't film a typical day in the pawn shop without boring the viewers to death. The customers are hand picked and Rick and the rest are schooled on the facts and history of whatever item is being featured. All that is still interesting to me and the main reason I watch the show. I guess the problem I have is having to sit through all of the ""situations"" the staff of the shop has to deal with over the course of an episode. Situations which I find not to be interesting or amusing. Like I said before however, I still watch the show, just not as often as I used to and usually if nothing else is on.",4 out of 4 found this helpful.,5.0,26 May 2014
2636,Pawn Stars," Misleading title, dumb show","Some members of my family like this show so much, I've been subjected to watching MARATHONS of it on cable -- amazingly, the cable channel it is on shows a dozen episodes in a row. Seriously! as if there is nothing else they could possibly show.<br/><br/>I'm not positive, but I think the granddaddy of these shows was ""Orange County Chopper"" -- maybe there is something older in this format. That's the first I have watched. A hard-to- believe business, run by a handsome but surly older guy and his doofus sons. They make or sell an unbelievable product, and make a ton of money at it, and joke around about their clients or some imaginary ""deadlines"".<br/><br/>They took that, and heaping spoonfuls of ""Antiques Roadshow"" to create ""Pawn Stars"". First off, there is one terrible problem -- this is not a Pawn Shop (despite the name). Or if it is, or ever WAS a Pawn Shop, that day is over (since the show) OR they hide the actual pawn business somewhere in the back.<br/><br/>Because they virtually never get a customer in to pawn something or get something out of pawn. What these guys are, is ANTIQUES DEALERS. They have a huge store, filled with antiques and collectibles -- some quite rare and expensive -- I have seen them buy 18th century antiques for thousands of dollars. That is NOT what Pawn Shops do.<br/><br/>Furthermore, they keep about half the collectibles for themselves -- a kind of private museum. I can see in a carnival atmosphere like Las Vegas, that such a collection would draw people to look and buy -- but that is not even remotely what normal pawn shops do!<br/><br/>Undoubtedly the success of the show has made the owners millionaires many times over -- probably the source of their wealth and ability to buy fine antiques, NOT the pawn business - - and they are clearly reveling in their stardom, attention and showing off on camera.....redoing the formula from ""Orange County Choppers"" and others....the staged fights and arguments, the clownish son and fall guy (Chumlee -- who on earth would really employ this loser?).<br/><br/>Worst of all, it is 100% obvious that every transaction is ""staged"" and that the shows producers are not filming real pawn transactions, but bringing in people with very unusual and rare antiques and then staging an equally fake negotiation over the items. Sometimes, the owners are shown taking one of their ""buys"" and spending many thousands of dollars on a high end restoration, using what is apparently a team of the finest restoration artists in the country....in Las Vegas? Why would these guys be working in what is a relatively small town (population-wise) based on gambling? Is there some huge subset of Las Vegans who restore old cars or barbershop chairs?<br/><br/>Again: restoration? cool, but nothing whatsoever to do with PAWN SHOPS.<br/><br/>It's purely fake and staged and 100% formulaic. As one poster here says correctly, Americans are obsessed with the ""value"" of collectibles and the idea that one lucky buy or find will make you ""rich"". Or that the value just goes up and up (provably untrue: many collectibles have lost value over the past decade).<br/><br/>Even worse, it often looks like ""Rick"" (owner) and his sons are pretty much taking advantage of uninformed and naive sellers, who would do better on ebay than with these sharks.<br/><br/>Just a thoroughly unpleasant ""reality"" show that has about as much ""reality"" as circus.",23 out of 35 found this helpful.,2.0,4 July 2012

2638,Pawn Stars, Get Rid of Chumlee.,"When it started, Pawn Stars was a really good show. People would bring in unusual items and a brief history of them would be told and Rick and the seller would dicker on the price. Sometimes, he would bring in an expert and we learned a lot more about the objects.<br/><br/>Does it really matter whether many of these objects are from museums and private collections? I don't care where they came from because it is the story behind them that is interesting, or would you rather the customers bring in stuff like what is really pawned in a pawn shop? The show was interspersed with short segments about the characters, and Chumlee was a likable guy - a lot of it, I suppose, might be sympathy because he was always bumbling and getting everything sort of wrong and was the butt of many jokes. He became the real Pawn Star. Now the banter between the stars is taking up more of the show and is becoming annoying and Chumlee has become unlikable.<br/><br/>For some reason, over the last couple of seasons, he has turned into a really obnoxious, rude, ignorant slob who tries to get as much time off as he can, even lying to his bosses to get it, and does as little work as possible. He has no work ethic and kids shouldn't be allowed to watch the show because they are seeing that what he does is acceptable at work.<br/><br/>He has absolutely no respect for his boss, being rude to him and not doing the jobs he has been assigned, and he is always telling Rick how he should run his shop. He also keeps Antoine from doing his job by getting him to help in some idiotic project of his.<br/><br/>The show is obviously scripted - if it were reality, Chumlee would be out the door on his ass faster than the boss can say ""You're Fired"". The writers portray Rick as a totally incompetent manager because he lets Chumlee get away with it. The only logical reason Rick doesn't lay down the law or can him is Chumlee must have some real dirt on Rick.<br/><br/>He has become so obnoxious that he is nauseating - that bit near the end of the show where he is dressed like Liberace just about made me vomit- whatever writer came up with that has no sense of what is and isn't funny whatsoever. That show didn't jump the shark, it jumped a whole pod of whales!! I am not the only one sick of Chumlee's new personality - check out the reviews on TV.com and see how many want him canned and have quit watching because of what he has become. I still like the objects and watch it, but I have joined those members who now tape the show and fast-forward whenever he appears.<br/><br/>The producers also have a double standard here - they fire a girl, Olivia, because she posed for nude photos that were posted on a website, but they don't get rid of a guy who gets busted for possession and gets involved in a street brawl (there go all those millions! I hope the guy sues). What ever happened to the ""Morals Clause"" in contracts? He was arrested with 7 POUNDS of marijuana - ""for his own use"" - and if you believe that, Pawn Stars is the most ""True to Life"" show ever aired. The way the show is going, I think he must be sharing his stash with the writers If he isn't off the show or his character reformed, and more time spent on objects than the ""Family Feud"", the show's ratings will do nothing but go lower. I think Too much damage has been done to revive it Explaining his disappearance from the show would be quite easy. He gets fired, goes to jail, killed in a motorcycle accident, or is shooting an old gun and it blows up killing him.",8 out of 10 found this helpful.,1.0,21 February 2016
2639,Pawn Stars, Very interesting and entertaining show,"I have just recently gotten into Pawn Stars and I find it to be a great mix of entertainment and history lessons. The main draw for me is the simple give and take that goes on between the Pawn Store operators and the people who bring items in looking to make quick money. Clearly the biggest draw for this show is Rick, the pawn store owner. Although his dad (the old man) and his son (big hoss) are big parts of the show, it is Rick who makes this show interesting and worthwhile. I don't think that Hollywood could have scripted someone who could make a pawn store owner a truly likable and complex individual. Rick manages to show interest and respect to every person who brings in something for sale while managing to explain his position in understandable terms. The bottom line is that a pawn shop is a place for people in need of quick cash to sell just about anything, just at bargain basement prices. If someone wants to get maximum money for their goods they would have to do market research, team up with a reputable auction house, or go on ebay and roll the dice that someone may make a high enough bid. Otherwise, you can go for the easy money of a pawn shop (albeit much less money.) <br/><br/>A couple of final notes about the characters on the show, as I stated earlier Rick is far and away the star of the show and he is really what makes it watchable. His father doesn't contribute a whole lot other than some standard old man talk. His son (Big Hoss) is pretty much a waste of space and contributes nothing to the show unless you like to watch a very (very) large person walking around in Ed Hardy jeans acting like some kind of tough guy. He is a very simple person, clearly having missed many of the complexities of human nature possessed by his father. Finally, Chumlee is one of the most enjoyable characters ever to grace television, the large man-child with a good heart and a simple mind. All in all I would definitely recommend watching this show to anyone.",43 out of 72 found this helpful.,8.0,1 December 2009

This show revolves around a pawn shop in Las Vegas and there are apparently a lot of strange things that happen there so there are going to be some interesting things for people to want to sell. So we get to see during each episode some interesting stuff people bring in, some rare stuff, and some just plain strange things. You also get to see people haggle over price, people getting mad when they are told their stuff is not worth all that much money, and people get really happy as they find their stuff is worth a fortune. The show centers around a dad, his father and the son. It also has a guy called Chumlee who I just can not believe he is as stupid as he appears to be. All the guys are interesting, it is fun to watch when one of them buys something not worth anything and then the others pounce. The show is humorous to go along with seeing all the interesting things people bring in. Things that people have sold on the show include very rare coins, hot air balloons, numerous cars and a whole bunch of other stuff. Things they have not bought include a car that was obvious crap that the guy who was trying to sell it got ticked off when Rick (the dad) backed off after a person with mechanical experience looked at it.

2646,Pawn Stars, The first few seasons were entertaining but the show has gone downhill since.,"The first few seasons of this show weren't bad. The majority of the show revolved around the items brought into the shop. Sure, there were some annoying side-scripts involving the different cast members (e.g. Chumlee acting foolish or the old man falling asleep) but it wasn't the focus and thus didn't detract from the show too much.<br/><br/>Fast forward to the last year or two. The show has devolved into something borderline unwatchable. The ""annoying side-scrips"" are now the focus of the show. The acting is so incredibly obvious that it makes you feel foolish for even watching.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why the folks at the History channel feel the need to throw in all this scripted garbage. The original formula (the one that made the show so popular in the first place) allowed the show to practically write itself.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you're just getting into the show, my recommendation would be to check out all the older episodes.

The clients by all means deserve being ripped off, majority of them being so obviously dim.

History Channel not so long ago used to be about history.

And they still have the audacity to market these shows as ""history being made every day"". Oh, hilarity! None of these shows has anything to do with history! If the problem is lack of audience for true history documentaries, then I'd rather they close the channel down than to continue with this nonsense.

Don't let anyone convince you that it never ""got off the ground"" as I see some reviews stating. That is flat wrong. Every single character is complex, human, flawed and totally relatable. Each character's story is developed so carefully and each story line refuses to be rushed. We are so used to 30 second sound bites and immediate gratification in our culture that many people want to be entertained without having to think, go deep and reflect on how the TV show or movie make us feel. This show refuses to cater to our need for rushed results, like fast food for the senses. Be prepared to settle in and take a gorgeous, heart wrenching, heart pounding and stunning journey with each character. Don't expect one-dimensional characters or CGI action scenes. This is an intelligent, thoughtful, beautiful show and every actor in it deserves an Emmy for their performances. I hope this show catches on ignites our imaginations for what humankind can accomplish (with a new and empathetic understanding of the sacrifices required to move the human race into the great unknown).

2653,The First, It's a drama not a Sci fi,"Im a huge Sci fi fan. This is not that but it is actually a really great series about a man who is trying to juggle some extreme issues at home while trying to hold together an extreme job. The acting is outstanding, I don't get why people are hating on the character of the daughter. She has real issues that I'm sure alot of people have had to deal with first hand or been within the destructive orbit of her issues. Although Mars might be the destination ( I haven't seen all the episodes) the show is about Penns character and his personal journey. If you're looking for a Mars Sci fi space struggle I'd say still give it a chance its actually quite good",189 out of 258 found this helpful.,8.0,16 September 2018
2654,The First, Well....,"This seems to me like a bait for SciFi fans, 95% drama and 5% SciFi, and that is really fair percentage estimation.

2655,The First, Marketing gone terribly wrong,"I've watched the first episode so far. It wasn't bad. The rest of the show appears to be congressional hearings, family drama, etc. And then maybe the last episode they finally blast off for Mars....?
But if you market a new show with a cool picture of rocket leaving earth and call it ""The First (Person on Mars),"" you better make it a show about people going to Mars. Make the setting Mars.
As it is, I fear there will be a terrible backlash on this show, which may kill it during the first season. Diehard fans of something (like sci fi geeks, as I am) get very angry when you market a show as sci if and instead make it an earthbound drama. 
The reason I think there might be a big backlash is that this show *sounds * like it's going to be exactly what many sci fi fans have been waiting for - an intelligent, well-done story of the first people on Mars. So this show is setting up fans for that, and they will be all the more disappointed. But can we hope that Season 2 will be more like what we expected? If the show finally gets to Mars, it could easily become that show.",148 out of 222 found this helpful.,7.0,15 September 2018
2656,The First, Episodes 1 and 8 are all you would want to watch unless you are having trouble sleeping.,"While this production has high production values and an excellent cast the show is way too boring to watch unless you want to watch something while you drift off to sleep. Why... because for 6 of the 8 episodes nothing happens... NOTHING!!! If you watch episodes 1 and 8 you not only have the whole story but also the high points of the story. In general the show suffers from labored pan shots that go on way too long, labored close ups that go on way too long, and a script lacking in energy and entertainment. If you simply want a visual distraction that doesn't draw the eye too acutely then this is the show for you.

because we often forget the human, interpersonal dimension when it comes to space flight.. it conveys the human behind this excellently.

2658,The First, Not sci-fi but the usual chliché laden family drama.,"If you expected a sci-fi show about the hardships that the first Mars Explorers would have to overcome you're in for a rude awakening. 
The only sci-fi elements are shown in the first minutes of episode 1 and in the middle of the season finale. That's it, eveything else is your standard generic family drama which was done already a thousand times and also done better I might add.
The First might become a sci-fi show once they get to Mars, assuming that there will be a season 2.
If you want a really good sci-fi show with extremely good dramatic moments go watch The Expanse instead of this snoozefest.

2660,The First, Giving this a 1/10 rating is unfair...,"This is a genially well made and well acted series that feels more like art house movie that your typical TV series or movie. The science fiction elements are mostly in the back ground and credit should be given because they are done in a very subtle, and believable way. The focus is on the relationships of the astronauts but it doesn't mean we don't also get a look at the preparation but it is looked at from a personal perspective. For example there is a problem with the unmanned MAV they previously sent to Mars and if they can't fix the problem it could effect funding for the mission as well as their survival odds of the astronauts and it is shown how that effects the people on the show along with the other events that take place during preparation. At the end of the day the show is mostly about the people that are left behind and primarily about the daughter of the potential commander of the mission and how his relationship with his daughter could effect the mission.<br/><br/>Most science fiction fans would have preferred the focus to be on the mission but there are some merits in this approach as well. My recommendation is to watch it with no expectations and be patient this is definitely taking a leaf out of the 2001 A Space Odyssey school of film making but like 2001 the slow pace is designed to ground the story in reality something that few TV shows and movies dare to do these days, this is not a failing of the show but a failing of viewer attention spans.",87 out of 146 found this helpful.,8.0,16 September 2018
2661,The First, Horrible pacing &amp; cheap emotional subject matter,This show is bad. It's the kind of show that combines all the classic emotional tropes and clichés to force viewers to feel something. It's literally using all of them. The lesbian black commander who loses her job to the white guy. The single father who lost his wife to mental health who has a recovering drug addict daughter. The career first woman who prioritizes being an astronaut over a mom to the disappointment of her husband.<br/><br/>It's nauseating.. <br/><br/>Hulu doesn't typically put out all of the episodes at once. It's clear they did this time because the show is paced so horribly if they didn't there'd be few folks tuning back in..<br/><br/>I've fast forwarded through parts of most episodes and still think I've wasted time..<br/><br/>The only bright spot to me is the cinematography is pretty good.,105 out of 180 found this helpful.,4.0,17 September 2018

2666,The First, More life on Mars than there is in this series,"Rarely, if ever, have I seen a pilot episode as utterly pointless as the first of The First. It purports to be a series about the first crewed mission to Mars, but there's nothing in the pilot that even addresses that premise. Instead - spoiler alert - we get a rocket that explodes shortly after take off, killing the entire crew. What follows - mostly just angst from all involved - could well be a docudrama about the aftermath of the Columbia tragedy. We learn nothing about the proposed mission to Mars - nothing about the logistics, the rationale, the politics. Nothing. And while starting a story about a mission with a major setback is potentially interesting, devoting an entire episode to that setback and nothing more, is just stupid. There's also little in the way of character development and not enough about the key relationships to make us care about anyone involved. It looks pretty much like Hulu has spent a truckload of money on a TV series written and produced by people who don't know the first thing about drama.",95 out of 171 found this helpful.,1.0,16 September 2018

2668,The First, For Grown-Ups Who Like People and Science,"'The First' gives us a realistic, believable near-future setting populated by solid actors at their best. Colin Stetson's soundtrack is a thing of beauty, but trying to find it online produces ""the first soundtrack,"" not the soundtrack of ""The First."" Boolean be damned, it's time to ask a librarian for help.
The road to Mars that this film presents is not another emergency mission to save the world, made for an ensemble of A- and B-list actors afraid of obsolescence. This film's journey reveals the depth of courage required by those who would make the trip without shying away from the effect their physical and emotional distance has on their families and partners. The technology of the spaceflight, the vehicles, and the ubiquitous wearable smart devices feels easily within reach from where we are now. Thanks to JPL, the film seems almost prescient.
For a bonus, we get to watch Bill Camp hijack our sympathies as he steals all of episode six with some truly professional acting.

2669,The First," Pick your ruined genre, as drama it is every trope and cliche strung togther, as sci-fi it is terrible","Wow what a mess. Firstly this is NOT sci-fi. The entire plot could be overlayed with Sean pen being a doctor in a 1980's hospital series, say a submarine cpatian -- or for that matter a truck driver -- or a partner in a dental practice who is juggling home n work. There is no US of the science or futuristic aspects, no major thought challenge theme from it. it is just there.<br/><br/>All this series is is a pedestrian drama. And it is one that literally uses every single worn out trope and cliché one has ever seen. I challenge any reviewer to even name a single original aspect -- or even well done cliched one in this series.<br/><br/>And really, I get that Sean Penn thinks he is a military vet after playing one in a film, but ""the First' clearly makes him imagine he is a film writer since he has acted in films as he is apparently responsible for the post production adding of the bizarre pauses with haiku like voiced overs. Terrence Malik can do that Sean -- you can't without appearing desperate to save this mess.

Lots of dialogue and Mr Penn's muscles, presumably because it's a lot cheaper than expensive CGI.

2673,The First, Please Stop Trashing Based on What You Thought it Was Going To Be,"I use IMDB frequently to help guide my viewing selections and, I must admit, sometimes find myself looking for confirmation of my own opinions based on critics and viewer ratings. When there are a substantial number of ratings for a film or show on IMDB, I believe the average ratings generally become a reliable reflection of the quality of a film or show.<br/><br/>However, with The First, I think the divisive ratings aren't providing an objective evaluation. When you look at the written user reviews, numerous individuals are reviewing the series based on what they THOUGHT it would be like (surprise, it wasn't), and not on what it is. It is indeed important to note what the series isn't - typical sci-fi. But either stop watching and leave it be, because it's not the kind of exploration you expected, or adjust your expectations and review the creation for what it is - a unique exploration of the human elements of interplanetary space travel with some exceptional genuine, emotional, and very believable performances from the actors and characters in the story. It also contains some very realistic, very possible near-future technology. I equate some of the narrow-minded ""disappointed"" user reviews to the same kind of reviews on Amazon where the reviewer gives a product a poor rating because the box was damaged - that's not a review of the product!<br/><br/>The First is definitely not for everyone, and as one critic put it, it requires an ambitious audience. A few of the middle episodes certainly provIde some discomfort and are visually experimental. Nonetheless, I've really enjoyed watching the series as a whole and would rate it up with some of the other very good Hulu and Amazon originals - in my opinion, it really should have an average rating in the range of 7 to 8.

The format is near perfect, with the interviews interspersed with very creative audience participation segments, stunts the guests are asked to do, and performances by fantastic rock bands at the end. Among the show's negatives is that there are few women guests. Sometimes Norton jokes about British celebrities that viewers in the US or Australia won't have heard of.

No gore, lust, immodesty or language. I also liked the fact that three tween-agers were actually nice to one another, and everyone else. Little to no cattiness! What there was, was addressed and attitude problems solved. From my 12 yr old daughter; ~ Kept our attention during the whole program ~ Siblings acted like real siblings. ~ The suspense &amp; cliff hangers left you wanting more! 10 year old son; ~ When the kids were kind and generous to others, good things happened, and lessons were learned. ~ It had magic, but fun happy magic, and not scary gory magic or things that would give you nightmares. ~ I liked that kids my age did great cooking, and that their families let them do it by themselves in the kitchen like you let us do.",26 out of 34 found this helpful.,10.0,25 January 2015

Sure, there was good-natured ribbing of the Right, but it wasn't hate filled. Who wouldn't have laughed at Murphy's fight with Dan Quayle no matter which side of the aisle you sat? New Murphy Brown changed that and now only throws out hate toward the Right. The way it is done is insulting and humorless.<br/><br/>Adding Tyne Daly was a good move. Avery is a likable guy and had potential, but they are only using him as a way to put down the news channel liberals hate the most.

She allows her excellent supporting cast including Faith Ford, Grant Shaud, Jim Regalbuto, and the guy who plays Jim Dial. When Grant Shaud left the show, the show brought Lily Tomlin who did an excellent job. I loved Garry Marshall and Pat Corbett as Phil, the local bar owner and the guy that knew everything in Washington D.C. There are several hilarious episodes with guest stars like Barry Manilow serenading Baby Avery, the wonderful Colleen Dewhurst as the memorable Avery Brown, Murphy's mom, Darren McGavin as her father, Broadway Legend Marian Seldes as her aunt during a fabulous Christmas episode. I am sad that Robert Pastorelli passed away recently but he was memorable as the house painter/artist and nanny for Avery.

Just about every scene contained derogatory remarks about Donal Trump, and to make matters worse they even invited Hillary on the show to tell Bergen's character how wonderful she is.

2739,Adventures of Superman, A good spirit behind the whole thing,"The general consensus seems to be that the first season of this all time classic TV show was the best and I would probably agree with that. Although, I'm a dedicated fan of the entire series.The injection of color into the closing stages of the production run gave those final episodes a special quality of their own.<br/><br/>George Reeves was born to play the title role. The previously inconsequential journeyman actor brought the character to life with great conviction, charm and a wonderful enthusiasm which never faltered. Of course, he had some fine support with John Hamilton as Perry White, Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen and Robert Shayne as Inspector Henderson.<br/><br/>As for the portrayal of Lois Lane, it really depends on which approach you preferred. Phyllis Coates created a prickly, no-nonsense big city reporter. Noel Neil was more of your good natured girl next door who was always ready with a cheery word and a polite laugh whenever Clarke Kent or Jimmy made a clumsy attempt at humor (which usually backfired).<br/><br/>So it's all a bit corny when you look back now from our jaded perspective of life in the present day. But, who cares? It's still good, clean fun which is more than you can say for most of the vile, mind numbing garbage that spews forth out of the television these days. And there was a good spirit behind the whole thing ...obey the law, salute the flag, say ""please"" and ""thank you"", be kind to your fellow human beings, take in stray cats, brush your teeth (and the cat's teeth) twice a day.<br/><br/>It was a different era and a better world in some ways.",63 out of 68 found this helpful.,8.0,4 May 2003

2741,Adventures of Superman, Groundbreaking Series a TV Classic...,"""The Adventures of Superman"" was, in the 1950s, the ultimate adventure show for kids, a series that transcended low budgets, often laughably bad scripts, and a torturous shooting schedule each season to become a genuine 'TV Classic'. Next to ""I Love Lucy"", the series is, perhaps, the most frequently rerun of any show of that decade; in shooting several seasons in color, it was a major trend setter (particularly as there were VERY few color televisions at the time); as a show that was syndicated, and not owned by a network (Kellogg's Cereal sponsored and financed the program) it paved the way for all the syndicated programs that followed. It's place in television history cannot be denied, and it's story is complete with drama, success, and tragedy, and a hero whose life and strange death still fuels controversy, to this day. <br/><br/>Superman, DC Comics' high-flying hero, had already achieved success on radio, in animated short films, and in two movie serials, when a low-budget feature film, SUPERMAN AND THE MOLE MEN, paved the way for the television series. The film replaced serial star Kirk Alyn with brawnier, square-jawed George Reeves, a youthful 37-year old whose promising film career had been derailed by WWII. He was joined by Phyllis Coates, replacing the serials' Noel Neill as ace reporter Lois Lane, and the pair made the transition to television, joined by 19-year old Jack Larson, as photographer/cub reporter Jimmy Olsen, and veteran character actor John Hamilton as editor Perry White. Helmed initially by veteran producer Robert Maxwell, the series utilized the same 'assembly line' formula of the movie serials, shooting multiple episodes at one time (which was why the cast always wore the same outfits), relying on action-heavy scripts heavy with Gothic atmosphere, and creating 'master' FX shots that were reused constantly, keeping the budget within acceptable limits. (While the 'flying' shots have been the object of humor over the years, the use of wires and a 'flying pan' in front of a rear projection provided the most realistic 'look' yet achieved, and the technique would still be in practice when SUPERMAN RETURNS was filmed, 55 years later.) Reeves' 'Man of Steel' was a street brawler, unafraid to duke it out with villains, and his 'Clark Kent' was every bit as no-nonsense as his 'Superman'. The program was actually quite adult, for a comic book adaptation, and the first season episodes are considered the best of the series.<br/><br/>When Phyllis Coates left the show, in 1953 (believing it would not be renewed, she signed for other film work), Noel Neill returned, softening the character of Lois Lane, but participating in some of the series' greatest episodes, including the most popular episode ever filmed, ""Panic in the Sky"", where Superman attacks an asteroid 'head-on', resulting in amnesia and near doom for Earth. By now, the 'wired' take-offs of Superman were replaced by vaulting off a springboard (after Reeves had barely escaped serious injury after dropping over ten feet when the 'liftoff' wires broke).<br/><br/>When Whitney Ellsworth took over production duties for the series, pressure from Kellogg's (due to the show's tremendous popularity, and investigations into the detrimental effect of violence on children) to tone down the mayhem resulted in episodes becoming increasingly silly and far-fetched. As this coincided with the series' move to color, the marked difference is clearly evident. The color episodes (particularly in the last two seasons) are, by-in-large, held in far less regard than the black and white ones. <br/><br/>By the series' final season, George Reeves would look chubby, and far older than his 43 years, Noel Neill would sport flaming red hair, and the episodes, shot on a very tight budget, were nearly unwatchable (other than the series' finale, ""The Trials of Superman"", directed by Reeves, where the cast are all placed in ""Perils of Pauline""-style catastrophes).<br/><br/>While Larson and Neill would move on to other projects, and John Hamilton soon passed away, George Reeves found himself type-cast as Superman, with his career considered to be at a standstill. The assumption that depression resulted in his committing suicide in 1959, at 45, has, however, been the subject of debate for over 40 years. It turns out that Kellogg's was prepared to finance a new season of ""Superman"", that Reeves had several upcoming directing opportunities, he was about to be married, and that on the night of his death, he was in excellent spirits. There is a growing belief that his 'suicide' was actually murder, by a 'hit man' hired by either by his ex-girlfriend, or her jealous husband. While the truth may never be known, the news of his death devastated a generation of children, who truly believed he WAS Superman.<br/><br/>While Christopher Reeve and Brandon Routh may be the definitive ""Men of Steel"" for their generations, and Dean Cain and Tom Welling have their fans, George Reeves, and ""The Adventures of Superman"", carry on a legacy that will never fade away. Each year introduces new fans to the series, and reminds us baby boomers of how fortunate we were to be there, at the beginning.",65 out of 73 found this helpful.,,16 January 2004

The characters were wonderful. It's still a delight to spend time with Jimmy Olsen, Perry White, and Inspector Henderson. I also love both Lois Lanes. The first Lois is all business and the second Lois melts my heart with that smile of hers! George Reeves is fantastic in each and every episode. The Adventures of Superman is still a joy for me to behold in 2005. I can always count on any one of the 104 episodes to make me smile.

2743,Adventures of Superman," Jeepers, Mr. Kent!!!","What a hoot!! I loved it. I watched this television series as a little kid but the stories in this first season were so old (almost 55 years ago!), I didn't remember more than a few scenes, although they sure brought back memories.<br/><br/>The special effects and the credibility (picking a scene apart) were beyond bad. Apparently, they had a budget of about $5 a show, or so it looks, so you'd see the same scene over and over in various episodes. I could write volumes on all the ludicrous scenes that made no sense but that's what helps make this so entertaining. It's so bad, it's good! I don't want to sound like I am criticizing this because I thoroughly enjoyed it and have already purchased the second season.<br/><br/>It was especially fun to see the first show, the TV version of the origins of Superman. Then, as the episodes continued, to hear the innocence of a young Jimmy Olsen saying, ""Jeepers, Mr. Kent,"" ""Golly, gee whiz"" and other similar exclamations. I laugh every time I hear those. Wow, compare that to today's TV.<br/><br/>Phyllis Coates was good as Lois Lane. It's too bad she left after one year. I'd rate her a slightly better Lane than Noel Neill, but Noel was good, too. Lois and Jimmy, with their nosiness, naiveté and just plain stupidity would have to be bailed out by Superman show after show.<br/><br/>George Reeves is likable as Superman but I got tired of John Hamilton screaming all the time as Perry White. They did calm him down a bit in subsequent years, but that first year all he did was yell.<br/><br/>Each episode was completely different and entertaining on this DVD package. This is great stuff for nostalgia buffs. Right now, I am in the middle of watching the second season on DVD and look forward to all of the sets that will be released.....hopefully, all of the seasons.",44 out of 51 found this helpful.,,22 January 2006
2744,Adventures of Superman, One of the best from the early days of television,"Growing up in the 1950's I was an avid collector of comics. One of my favorites was superhero Superman. The other was Plastic Man. For some reason few have heard of the original Plastic Man, but Superman is still very much with us and probably will be for some time to come. Before judging this series, one must remember that only televisions that showed black and white were on the market. There was no color. If an early television show was produced in color it was for other reasons, say possible release on the big screen. Some producers hoped to string two or three episodes of a popular television series together and distribute it to movie houses as one feature as was done with The Lone Ranger. Also, there were no big-screen TV's. Therefore special effects could be kept fairly primitive (and inexpensive) because the viewer wouldn't be seeing much anyway. The average TV screen was about 13"". A person was uptown if he/she had a 17"" screen. <br/><br/>There were Superman movies out at the time featuring other actors rather than ""the real"" Superman, George Reeves. The Superman TV shows were compact, well-written, and well-performed. For me Noel Neill will always be Lois Lane. Ditto for Jack Larson as Jimmy Olsen, John Hamilton as Perry White, Robert Shayne as Inspector Bill Henderson, and even though Christopher Reeves did a bang-up job as a later Superman, George Reeves will always be Superman for my generation.<br/><br/>Another reason I was so drawn to the Superman TV show was because a stunt man who was married to my cousin at the time appeared in one of the episodes. In the episode, ""The Wedding of Superman"" Doyle Brooks played Mr. Poole, one of the heavies. Brooks was born in the little hamlet of Bethesda, Arkansas, married my cousin and set out to become a movie star in Hollywood. He ended up a successful stuntman but did very little acting. His biggest success was playing the Ajax White Knight in a now famous television commercial.<br/><br/>Superman's may come and go but George Reeves will always be ""the"" Superman to all of us who were kids in the 1950's.",31 out of 36 found this helpful.,,6 November 2005
2745,Adventures of Superman, TV ICON!,"It was a different time and different era when this now legendary program was first televised.   Yes some of the episodes toward the end of the series are on the hokey and corny side. However this show is a part of television history. The opening credits with the great theme music always set the mood. My favorite was the two part ` The Unknown People' episode.   Although I always thought Noel Neill was a cuter and sexier Lois Lane Phyllis Coates played the part to a T.  Jack Larsons Jimmy Olsen idolized Clark Kent as a father figure like the character did in the comics.  John Hamilton was superb as the gruff  but understanding Perry White. Robert Shayne as Inspector Henderson who never solved a case by himself but did it matter? Then George Reeves.   Other actors donned the costume through the years but George Reeves was and always will be Superman, and when you think about it that's not too shabby.",29 out of 34 found this helpful.,,10 February 2000

The man of steel wearing red and blue. We need more shows like these instead of what we have now. Every show was like a cliff hanger. Nail biting action. Would Superman make it in time? Can he get to the bad guys before they hurt Olsen and Miss. Lois Lane? These were questions that were answered every time Superman came on. He made you feel good about the world.

2747,Adventures of Superman, Update with impressions of Seasons 5 &amp; 6,"(Initial comments) My son gave me a copy of Season One of ""The Adventures of Superman"" for Christmas, and I must say it was the best present I've received in a long while. We had such a good time watching favorite episodes. I am a child of the 50's and grew up with Superman while it was still fairly new. My son experienced it on Nick at Nite re-runs, a special time for us both.<br/><br/>Now I have purchased the Season Two set, and the episodes here may be in many ways better than those in the first. A particular favorite is ""Panic in the Sky,"" where our hero has to deflect a meteor as it hurtles towards Earth. Special flying sequences were filmed for this episode that were not used in any other.<br/><br/>A special treat is ""Stamp Day for Superman,"" a special episode that I never saw as a child. While it is a quickie ""freebie"" made to support the U.S. Treasury Dept., this episode stands up pretty well with the ""regular"" episodes.<br/><br/>The featurette ""First Lady of Metropolis"" is a wonderful tribute to Noel Neill, who took over the role of Lois when Phyllis Coates was unable to continue. It is so nice to see Ms. Neill still looking lovely. She still has the ""sparkle"" in her eyes that made her Lois so enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>Another favorite episode is ""Around the World with Superman."" Anyone who is not moved by this story of a blind girl's attempt to re-unite her troubled family just doesn't have a heart.<br/><br/>Thanks to Warners and to my son for helping me capture a sense of my own youth.<br/><br/>(June 20, 2006) I just got my copy of Seasons 3 &amp; 4 of Adventures of Superman. Special features include a piece entitled ""Adventures of Superman: The Color Era"" and another called ""Faster Than a Speeding Bullet: The Special Effects of The Adventures Of Superman."" <br/><br/>The former, about the series being filmed in color features interviews with Jack Larsen, Noel Neill, Gary Grossman (author of ""Superman: Serial to Cereal"") and a television historian whose name escapes me. All pretty much agree that it was a shrewd move of the producers to start filming the show in color, and saving the negatives until color television was common a decade later. In the words of Larsen, ""Those guys were pretty smart."" <br/><br/>The one about the sfx was mainly a profile and interview with Thol Simonson, along with Larsen and Neill. Both cast members were effusive with praise for Simonson, saying they always felt safe, no matter how risky the effect looked on screen. Something I had not seen before is a diagram of the ""pan"" apparatus and counterbalance that replaced the wires that had earlier suspended Reeves. <br/><br/>Episodes I have watched so far are ""The Wedding of Superman,"" ""The Big Freeze,"" and ""Through the Time Barrier."" As has been noted elsewhere, these stories are much less heavily dramatic as the nourish early episodes. However, the light comedy is not really campy, just good-natured. Also, Neill as Lois looks quite fetching in her cave-girl outfit in the time-travel story. <br/><br/>In fact, Ms. Neill still looks quite lovely in the new interview footage. She still has those same sparkling eyes and the lovely smile that gave me that first crush on Lois all those years ago. <br/><br/>(Update: December 3, 2006: Initial impressions of Seasons 5 &amp; 6:)<br/><br/>""Superman's Wife"" is not as hokey as many of the other episodes in the final season. Joi Lansing is a knockout, and John Eldredge, as usual, makes one of the more interesting, intelligent villains. <br/><br/>""The Perils of Superman"" is pure FUN.<br/><br/>Noel makes for some NICE cheesecake in that proto-Jeannie outfit in ""The Tomb of Zaharan."" The story was pure cheese, though. (In ""Foghorn Leghorn"" voice: hey, I made a funny. Cheese--Cheesecake.)<br/><br/>""The Big Forget"" contains the greatest tease in the entire series: Clark changing into Supes in full view of all the series regulars!<br/><br/>The final shot of ""All That Glitters"" is really poignant, considering how things turned out for George. <br/><br/>The featurette about Jack Larsen is a nice little tribute.<br/><br/>A fun time with old friends that I now share with my grandkids.

2748,Adventures of Superman, George Reeves' Superman was a great hero!!,"George Reeves' Superman was a tremendous heroic figure to many of us as children. It's unfortunate that some previous reviewers have made remarks about Reeves' appearance which indicate that they just don't get it. The fact that Reeves' Superman seems more mature than others who have played the same role only helps the appeal of his type of Superman. Many heroes of classic TV and movie serials may not have ""the look"" of their modern incarnations, but there's more to a hero than just looks and fashion. The great myths tell us that small boys can be slayers of giants, the elderly can be wielders of magic, and a poor battered carpenter can be the savior of the world. It's not all about looks. It's much deeper than that. It's about HEART. It's about BRAVERY. It's about TRUTH and JUSTICE! Reeves' Superman is a symbol of all these things.

So a good 90 minutes of entertainment some mornings.<br/><br/>Superman/Clarke Kent was played by George Reeves who is certainly no relation to the late Christopher Reeve who starred in the four Superman movies which some people seem to think so (the surnames are different).

2750,Adventures of Superman, Season Two,"For some reason, many people mark season one as the best. I think most Superman fans, I mean real fans, would disagree. Season two is by far the best season. Granted Phyllis Coates was a better Lois Lane for this version of the series because she was sexy, tough, and gave a little sexual tension between her and Superman. Noel Neill was the perfect Lois in the serials and was the obvious second choice when Coates became unavailable. Nobody is going to deny that fact. But we're not talking about The Adventures of Lois Lane. This is Superman and the show was far better in season two than in season one and all subsequent seasons. Here's why:<br/><br/>1. The stories hinged on the dramatic as well as human interest. This was before it became ""too"" kiddie. It also had enough warmth to make us care about the characters rather than just be extensions of a cartoon. 2. George Reeves looked more comfortable and actually acted much better in both roles (see ""warmth"") 3. Humor was used but just enough to be real. 4. George looked his absolute best in any of the Superman costumes. This was the only season in which he didn't look padded. He looked refreshed. 5. George's stunts were more acrobatic and there was less use of re-hashed stock footage with flying or leaps into the air. It seemed they actually shot take offs and landings for this season for those individual shows.<br/><br/>So this is why season two is must have out of all the seasons.",14 out of 17 found this helpful.,,16 January 2006
2751,Adventures of Superman, Equally successful combination of action and cheese,"This was a very weird series in execution.  One part of its life was serious, generally well executed action.  The other part was uproarously funny, probably unintentionally so.<br/><br/>Running a span of both black and white and color, the shade factor of the episode determines what you'll get.  Black and white generally guarantees serious action scripts, usually well executed for the time.  Good episodes include ""The Unknown People,"" (The Mole People movie.) ""The Runaway Robot,"" and ""Panic In The Sky."" (Superman looses his memory trying to divert an asteroid heading for Earth.)  Color usually means in you're in for something outrageously improbable, almost along the lines of the Adam West ""Batman"" series nearly 10 years later.  Episodes so bad they're good include ""Flight To The North,"" (Chuck Connors thinks he's Superman, and a crook wants a lemon meringue pie.) ""Great Ceaser's Ghost,"" (A crook dresses up as Ceaser's ghost to drive Perry White insane.) and some silly episode with a mind reading burro.  (Bank robbers steal a peasant boy's burro because it can read minds.  They want it to read a vault combination from a guard, and clop it out for them...)<br/><br/>A decidedly unusual series whose only faults would be the special effects of the time, the on the surface unsettling mix of action and stupidity, and there were no licensed character or recurring villains.

Even today, at 3:00 am on TV LAND, I find myself catching episodes of the original series, and thoroughly enjoying them...never mind that I have seen them dozens and dozens of times. Admittedly, I could never figure out why eyeglasses prevented Lois, Jimmy, Perry White, and Inspector Henderson from being able to recognize that Superman and Clark Kent were one in the same person, or why Superman would crash through a wall, stand with his fist on his hips, while bad guys emptied their guns into his chest (bullets bouncing off of course) then duck when the thugs threw their empty weapons at him.  Superman stood for everything good, and young viewers such as myself always got a positive, wholesome message.  Even now, I get that lump in my throat when I hear, ""Truth, Justice, and the American way.""  A simple show, still one of the best ever made.

2757,Adventures of Superman, GREAT SERIES,"Along with Batman, this was a great 60's superhero series about the adventures of my favourite superhero.<br/><br/>George Reeves was very good in the role as Superman and he was well supported by an excellant supporting cast.<br/><br/>The stories themselves were just pure fun. Some of them may have been tongue in cheek but who wants seriousness when they switch on a TV? If you want seriousness switch onto the news. This show was great fantasy (like most shows in the 1960's) and when they repeated it here in England back in the late 1980's I tuned in again.<br/><br/>Here in England none of the good TV series ever seem to be released on video but I wish someone would release the entire series onto video someday.<br/><br/>Fantastic and fun-watching it was a real treat.",7 out of 10 found this helpful.,,27 February 2002
2758,Adventures of Superman, a wonderful series,"This program fueled my youthful imagination and made me happy with it's warmth and it's continual positive spirit. The more kid friendly episodes were favorites of mine and they still are. I'm still a kid at heart and I still adore the series. Perils of Superman is my favorite episode and there are too many other favorites to mention here. I can't agree with the critics who take a purely ""adult"" or ""logical"" view of this program. Wearing glasses as a disguise was the biggest lapse of logic, but so what? That sort of thing didn't matter to me when I was young. I also didn't mind the different Lois Lanes. How can you not adore 'em both? The Adventures of Superman never failed to uplift me and make me happy. It's heart was always in the right place. It's positive spirit never faltered. It always radiated good will, fun, and decency. There will always be a special place in my heart for the Adventures of Superman. I'm thrilled that every episode is being released on DVD.",8 out of 12 found this helpful.,10.0,7 June 2006
2759,Adventures of Superman, Better than you might remember,"If you watched these when you were a kid, especially if you did so back in the 50s or 60s, watching the episodes on DVD may surprise you.<br/><br/>The production values of the black and white episodes during the first two years were very good. The resolution of the images was sharp as a tack, and the black and white tonal gradation and lighting was very professional. Yet on the old black and white sets, much of that would have been lost.<br/><br/>On the other hand, they took some cheap shortcuts, such as inserting stock footage that was surprisingly out of date, sometimes it seems from the 30s or even 20s.<br/><br/>In the third season they moved to color, even though according to the commentary, the show was not actually broadcast in color until 1965. (Color broadcasting began in 1954, but most people could not afford the $1,000 color television sets in a time when cars cost about $2,000.) The old black and white episodes are more geared to adults than the later color versions, which go with a more comic book approach. Some BW episodes are more like Perry Mason mysteries, though the quality and type of approach varies all over the place in those early years.<br/><br/>This is also the beginning of television, and the producers were pioneering a new medium, not always quite sure what approach to take, or which would work. There is an obvious influence of the old radio dramas, seen especially in the announced opening. Some of the early episodes seem to follow the format of the old Hardy Boys boy's book series of mysteries, complete with hidden stairways to secret basements, haunted lighthouses, and secret tunnels to boathouses. I wonder if any of the Superman writers had been ghost writers for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, which actually wrote the Hardy Boys books.<br/><br/>The commentaries are fairly interesting, though often redundant, and sometimes inaccurate. The commentator does not appear to be good with numbers. The consensus seems to be that the series began filming in 1951, but began airing in 1952. The commentator says that the show has been broadcast from every presidential administration since Eisenhower, yet Truman was president in 51, 52 and into early 53. He also keeps going on and on about how little boys would have been watching the shows on tiny 8 or 10 inch black and white TVs in 1951. Not if they weren't on the air. And he says Jack Larson was a very young 17 (or did he say 19?) when the series began, yet IMDb shows he was 23.<br/><br/>What would be more telling about those old TVs is that they cut off portions of the image, especially the corners, but also tops and bottoms. So the occasional moment when Superman's springboard is visible today, would not have shown up on anything but professional TV monitors. <br/><br/>The commentator also remarks on how it seems Clark Kent didn't have such a large office. I've got news for you, viewers, I have never seen a newspaper that had offices for reporters. The publisher gets an office, the managing editor gets an office, with windows onto the newsroom, but just about everyone else is in one big room. The writers show a certain amount of insight into newspaper work, many writers having been reporters at some point, but the show obviously didn't want to pay for extras standing around in a newsroom, I presume.<br/><br/>But the best part, in my opinion, of the first year, was Phyllis Coates, who played Lois Lane for one year. She was (is) a fine actress, who seemed to give the show a certain gravitas lacking in later episodes. And she was a babe! <br/><br/>The move to color was a stroke of genius. This enabled them to keep reselling the series many years down the line. And the color holds up quite well.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,3 March 2007
2760,Adventures of Superman, Accuracy is preferred,"Okay, folks. This is a great show. But the ""trivia"" given about the black-and-white costume is incorrect. The costume used in the first two seasons was brown and gray, not brown and white. I've seen it. It's odd-looking, no doubt. The actual color costume is much better looking, but that wasn't the point when they created the brown/gray combo. It was just what they felt would photograph properly for early television broadcasts. <br/><br/>With so much dreck being released on DVD, when is Warner going to wise up and finally release the entire series for the world to enjoy? It certainly puts forth a very positive message and George Reeves is great as Superman.",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,,29 April 2005

Most of them are just trash and I quit after just a few episodes. Rarely I watch one until the very end and very few rise from the bottom to get a score from 5 to 7. But this show did more than that, it got an 8. <br/><br/>It is an ecchi anime (there is no denying that fact), but the first one of the genre that I truly liked, because of the story. It is very funny and characters are more close to have real personalities than most animes. And certainly much more than ecchi animes.<br/><br/>The story meshes really well with the ecchi parts, making them really fluid, after all this an anime about a group of horny guys locked in prison. There is the mandatory bath scene, but gladly the anime stays for the most part away from baths and ripped clothes.

2768,Prison School, An Ecchi Comedy.,"I watched this at the suggestion of a friend and was quite surprised at how good it was.<br/><br/>The animation is very ecchi and has a lot of unique angle perspectives common when doing fan service. It reminded me of High School of the Dead's cinematography. Some of it is a bit ridiculous like Meiko and her breast size, but some of it was actually used to create great moments, especially with Hana. (personal bias) Plot is quite simple, some guys go to a new school that used to be girls only and being desperate they hope having 200 girls to 1 guy will help them in finding girlfriends. They get imprisoned in the schools detention block.<br/><br/>The main character Kiyoshi is quite likable and it's a strong coming of age story with good friendship bonding moments. I'd say its bros before hoes, but generally, the bros are working together in an effort to get hoes and they do betray each other in further their own causes. They learn about helping each other, in particular Gakuto helps them realize this by using a lot of Romance of the Three Kingdoms stories and references.<br/><br/>The humour is a mix of blue jokes, and slice of life scenarios. I usually find blue jokes rather detrimental to a story and while they didn't always help, they didn't always hurt this series and many times they are the straw men to move the plot forward.<br/><br/>Overall it was a great experience and the only things that make me take points off are some of the ecchi choices and the main character has instant infatuation with one girl and instant loyalty to that girl which I find very common in anime's. Perhaps I don't watch enough romance anime, but I would like the main character to keep their options open once in a while and experiment in different relationships but that's probably all coming back to the personal bias for Hana.",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,8.0,18 January 2017

2773,Prison School, Sophmoric male humor but... I laughed out loud.,"I saw this title in the Top Ten Anime list.
After a few miutes I thought ""well... this is stupid"" but (luckily) I contiued on.
I was rewarded by several ""laugh out loud"" moments before I reached the end of episode one.
Viewers should proably be forwarned that this is definitely males humor.
Basically the men in this story are obsessed with the opposite sex.
The women in this story tend to have a negative view of the males, ""pigs"" that they are.
After a group of adolescent males are found guilty of peeping they are confined to the schools prison.
There they are supervised by women who were reminiscent of dominatrix's.
I know the premise sounds a bit risky but (my opinion) the humor was not ""dirty"" in any way, just lighthearted and extremely sophomoric.
However, it may be best to get a contemporary woman's perspective on this.

The boys got caught while pulling a stunt by checking out the girls changing room and they were all sent to school's prison, yep that sounds weird but trust me the fun starts from then. Got a brilliant final episode and an epilogue to set season 2 in the run, this was really a fun ride.<br/><br/>The story gave us more intense and gripping scenes than a crime anime, got strong antagonists with an evil plot, the bizarre comedy was all over the place, amazing characters, the animation was fantastic the voice actors were great, the facial expression and the weird sounds made it more hilarious.

2780,The Young Ones, The Great Surrealist Sitcom.,"The Young Ones may be an obscurity in the USA, but here in Australia its fondly remembered. We first heard rumours of it back in about '82, then someone sneaked in a crappy tape of 'Bomb'. We sat and watched it in awe. This was The Great British Surrealist sitcom; the logical next step from The Goons and Monty Python. It was appallingly, daringly head and shoulders above everything else from the 80's (oh, alright, except Black Adder. Especially Black Adder II).<br/><br/>Four students:  a hippy, a punk, a would-be anarchist who secretly loves Cliff Richard, and... Mike, 'the cool person' - who appears to be throughly normal. Except he isn't. In fact, when you really take a close look at him, Mike is actually stranger than all the others put together. Half of his lines make little or no sense. He said something once about a sheepdog, which struck me as one of the strangest lines I've ever heard on television. But anyway, he is still nominally the anchor of normality around which all the madness rotates.<br/><br/>Using Python's rapid-cut technique, and employing a similar lack of concern for continuity, a Young Ones episode is a rollercoaster of surrealism, violence and squalor (the latter two elements taken to even greater extremes by Mayall and Edmonson in 'Bottom'). Episodes are suddenly interrupted by the appearance of Benito Mussolini, singing a song called 'Stupid Noises', or by various other manifestations of Russian landlord Alexai Sayle, who is inclined to go into stand up comedy routines and address the audience, much to the confusion of everyone else on set. Images of garden taps or insects are flashed on screen for a fraction of a second, scenes cartwheel off in all directions:  a family of peasants in the adjoining room sit huddled round a lamp, a wardrobe leads into the realms of Narnia, an unexploded atomic bomb lands in the middle of the kitchen, vegetables in the fridge talk to each other, and Motorhead just happen to be in the loungeroom, performing 'Ace of Spades'.<br/><br/>Someobody else said that this series hit Britain like bombshell. It's effect was similar in Australia. It never spawned any imitators - the rest of the 80's seemed to be given over to dreary political satire, but it is undeniably one of the great English sitcoms - even if, now and then, it drags its feet just a little.<br/><br/>Like Fawlty Towers, it ran for only two series, but when they were over, it had breached countless boundaries of bad taste and absurdity, introduced the writing talents of Ben Elton, the careers of Rik Mayall, Alexei Sayle, Nigel Planer, Dawn French and Adrian Edmonson, and made the godawful, bland, mid 80's bearable for a few people like me.",55 out of 58 found this helpful.,,3 June 2001

2783,The Young Ones," Never equalled... never even imitated, because most writers are too scared to try...","Produced in six-episode fits during 1982 and 1984, The Young Ones would have been relegated to the status of a historical curiosity if not for one simple fact - it is a lot funnier even today than a lot of the dross that has been put on television since. This show came long before Australia had pay television, a short while before eMpTyV, and a long, long time before Hollywood's standards fell so low that the likes of Jim Carrey or the brothers Farrelly were given jobs.<br/><br/>Focused upon the daily routines of four British college students, the show came out with all guns blazing, and it didn't let up for a single episode. The first episode pretty much sets the standard for all the others - while Rik is screaming his head off about things that mean very little, Neil is cooking a last supper, and Mike is being his usual bland self, Vyvyan crashes through the kitchen wall and announces that the council have decided to knock down their house. The council are reasoning that the lads are a health hazard, so while Rik is whining, Neil is thinking of hiding within the walls, and Mike is planning to get into the council representative's pants, Vyvyan plans to thwart them by knocking the house down himself. At one point, he even jumps through the wall that seperates the lads' house from their next door neighbours. Classic stuff, and it gets even more over the top in the next five episodes.<br/><br/>My favourite episode... well, it's a tie between Nasty and Bomb. Nasty is just so stupendously funny because Vyvyan is at his nastiest, but Bomb is by far more ridiculous in its premise - who could imagine a bomb landing in front of the fridge, then Vyvyan eating the TV in order to escape the TV license man? As if that last question doesn't date this show enough, Nasty sees Vyvyan and Mike trying to figure out how to operate a VCR that the latter has borrowed from Harry The Bastard. Not a gangster, mind you, but a guy who works at Rhumbalo's (sp?). In this age of DVD-Video, an imminent HD-DVD format, and a standards war between SDTV and HDTV, with Recordable DVD now out in force, those of us who were six years old, or older, when Nasty first transmitted should be experiencing flashbacks now.<br/><br/>The band appearances were quite something too, ranging from Radical Posture and Alexei Sayle doing a real crackup of a song about Dr. Marten's boots to Dexy's Midnight Runners playing Jackie Wilson Said in the dunny, it seemed that every collection of musicians eager for a start or some kind of exposure wanted to get on The Young Ones. It also served to prove that there was a lot more interesting music coming out of England during the 1980s than has come out of America during the entire twentieth century.<br/><br/>Given the political situation in most of the Western, so-called First World, and the advent of entertainment technologies that were considered science fiction when this series went to air, the time could not be better for a new version of The Young Ones, or something that follows in a similar style. The problem there is that The Young Ones set the standard so high that it's going to take a Herculean effort for a new series to simply not be destroyed by comparison to the original. Which is not bad considering some of the crap that was about to hit the airwaves later in the 1980s.",50 out of 56 found this helpful.,10.0,24 September 2002
2784,The Young Ones, This Is The Way To Do Comedy,"With few exceptions, today's comedy scene is abysmal. Canned laughter and absolutely nothing funny. No-one seems able to write a funny script now. The Young Ones didn't have to try too hard to be entertaining-it just was, period.<br/><br/>It was set in a student household and didn't really have plots-just craziness. Margaret Thatcher was UK Prime Minister at the time and the characters made frequent digs at her and her regime. Rik Mayall played Rick who was the craziest of the lot and always picking on Neil who was played by Niger Planer. Neil was the hippy who cared about everyone, man and beast but was bullied constantly. Adrian Edmondson played punkrocker Vivyan who was violent at times and simply didn't give a toss. Then there was Mike played by Christopher Ryan. It is hard to define Mike-I challenge anyone to give a character description to Mike. He wasn't as crazy as the rest of them but he was weird. And that is what I liked about The Young Ones.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, don't expect any plots because there are none. And as for them being students, well I never saw them revising in their spare time. There were some great scenes throughout the show and some very surreal scenes as well. Items of food in the fridge spoke on the state of things at times and there was the two speaking rats. Alexi Sayle as the landlord Balowski popped in from time to time.<br/><br/>Expect the crazy when you watch this. Great scenes throughout the show included a nuclear bomb landing in the kitchen, Vivyan eating the TV to escape prosecution by the TV Licence man, the students fighting and Neil being planted like a seed in the ground and spouting other Neils.<br/><br/>A fantastic cartoon-like comedy which had some impressive cameo appearances throughout it's run.

2787,The Young Ones, Absolute genius classic!,"There was never anything quite like The Young Ones and there never will be. It's almost impossible to copy this outrageously bizarre and far-fetched TV show anyway. It's even impossible to exaggerate how crazy it was. Do I have to say I totally love it? each episode is crammed full of eternally quotable dialogue, wonderful physical comedy and insane, unexpected plot developments. The Young Ones takes place in a universe where absolutely ANTHING can and WILL happen. Rick is undeniably the best character tho. He and Vivian get into the stupidest fights and argue over the dumbest of things. Neil the hippy is also consistently amusing in his many failed attempts to off himself. Mike hardly ever had any funny lines but thankfully no episode really ever revolved around him. Plus a Bolowski family member (always played by Alexi Sayle) pops up in each episode to add to the mayhem.<br/><br/>What makes the show priceless are the totally irrelevant and senseless intercut scenes. Check out the episode 'CASH' for the best example of this. And, in an effort to raise the budget from 'sitcom' to 'light entertainment' the show had a musical performance each week from the likes of Jools Holland, Madness and Motorhead. They never intrude tho as they are cut over madcap montages.<br/><br/>It speaks volumes of the youth of 80's Britain and has a lot to say about the politics of the Tory Government at the time. All four play penniless students, surviving on lentils, who are completely unconcerned about their exams or coming bottom in the whole world. This is mainly channelled thru Rick (Mayall co-wrote the show with Ben Elton) who is the most studenty of them all, a wannabe anarchist and people's poet. Vyvian is a hard, hardcore Sex Pistols-like punk/thug who thinks nothing of having steel stars stuck onto his forehead or chopping his fingers off for a laugh. Neil smells. And has no quibbles picking up dead pigeons off the street to cook for dinner. Mike is a ladies man, despite the fact there are precious few ladies around him. All four get on like a house burning down. Or exploding like a cigar thrown into fart gas.<br/><br/>The show was shot on early 80's video with an aspect ratio of 1.33:1. the picture quality is not the best but it's always looked like a TV show so it's perfectly adequate. The sound is Mono but that's all you need to enjoy.<br/><br/>
The extras seem cool but they're not really. There is a bonus episode from Filthy Rich and Catflap and one from Bottom (the episode 'Smells' in which Ritchie and Eddie try to lure two lesbians with foul-smelling pheromone spray). The 15-minutes long 'Creating the Young Ones' is quite superficial and deserved to be much longer. And where are the new interviews with Edmondson, Ryan and Sayle? The same applies to 'The Young Ones and the 80s'. Why wasn't it longer? Five postcards of all the main stars are also included in the set. And you must buy it.",24 out of 29 found this helpful.,10.0,7 May 2004
2788,The Young Ones, Now that's what I call anarchy!,"Back in the days when MTV really meant MTV they would show this imported britcom on Sunday evenings. I always looked forward to watching it. This show was so different than any other kind of show I had seen before that it absolutely fascinated me. The characters of Rick, Vyvyan, Neil and Mike had me hooked with their loud, obnoxious and rowdy behavior. On one level it's lowbrow, juvenile and shrill. On another it's clever, original and refreshingly unlike anything else. It's partly a situation comedy, partly a musical variety show. I love the arguments between Rick and Vyvyan and Rick and Neil and well.....Rick and anybody! I love Vyvyan's random destruction of the house and random abuse of well.....everybody. If you want a reason to really laugh out loud this is the show that will help you do it.",9 out of 10 found this helpful.,10.0,16 August 2005
2789,The Young Ones, Hit Rick over the head with the bank,Why cant there be more shows like the Young ones filled with senseless violence and verbal beatings. Ill tell you why its because everyone is so worried about being politically correct. If we could all give it up and say YOU BASTARD on a regular basis television might just be funny again. I mean why is everyone so afraid of being offended? who cares. My favorite episode is Sick. How can you go wrong with any show that has British punk band Madness playing in the middle of the street while a riot is going on. By the way the riot was started because a man throws a brick at a womens head.

2790,The Young Ones, Personal favorite Young Ones story about the most raucously funny show episode ever - Bambi,"My favorite thing to do with the Young Ones happened in a shop in Greenwich Village in the early 90's. I was in Meyers of Keswick, a British grocery in the Village with a young female coworker who trod down there with me in hopes of purchasing Christmas crackers and some English candy for the parties we were going to. We were in line waiting, and I noticed an actual Kendall Mintcake on the counter, picked it up, and screwed my face up to try to look like Ben Elton and said, ""Hi,"" like I was Mr. Kendall Mintcake. My coworker stared blankly and I frustratedly tried to explain who The Young Ones were, Bambi, The Balowski Family, Monk deWally deHonk, Mr. Liberal,etc. to no avail. A cockney bloke standing next to us finally exploded and shouted, ""Its Only The Greatest show Ever, Mate!!!"" I asked him if he wanted to see how many pressups I could do. His girlfriend screamed at me that she was not being aggressive and we cracked in up in front of a few astonished bystanders.",13 out of 16 found this helpful.,10.0,28 November 2006
2791,The Young Ones," Anarchy Rules, OK!","... How fortunate that on this one project the nations foremost figureheads in alternative comedy were gathered together and allowed to give their imaginations free reign. I don't think you'll ever see a sitcom as gleefully silly or unconventional as this one, partly because of the personalities involved in making it and partly due to the regular musical interludes that were thrown in purely to give the team more cash.<br/><br/>Incidentally, ""Cash"" from series two is my favourite episode, and Neil my favourite member of the gang. What can you say about a scenario where Vyvvian (a bloke) learns that he's pregnant, except that it's utter genius?! Neil's whole demeanour seals it for me; he doesn't even have to say anything, and Nigel Planer's mournful expression will still crack me up, without fail.<br/><br/>It's the absolute opposite of those cosy, easygoing shows where everybody likes one another really. You can't really call it 'The Good Life' when you're living in what most would describe as 'a hole'... As it happens, I don't really have any objection to such a nice '70's comedy, although listening to Vyvvian launch into a verbal tirade against it almost changed my mind, delivered as it was with such unchecked outrage. You can always trust ""The Young Ones"" to offer some biting political comment, unless you're talking to Rick, that is... !",5 out of 5 found this helpful.,9.0,5 June 2007

2793,The Young Ones, Would've loved it if not for Alexi Sale and a few parts that just aren't funny.,"This show is pretty much the height of stupid British humor. I struggle to think of one show that was more brainless, more violent and more ""wrong"" than The Young Ones and I still can't think of any.<br/><br/>This show is about 4 students who could not be more different that live in the same house together. This might sound a bit boring but make the characters a violent punk (Adrian Edmondson), a poet/political rights activist (Rik Mayall), a hippie (Nigel Planner) and the stereotypical ""cool guy"" (Christopher Ryan) and you've got a combo that is lethal to anyone who stands in its way.<br/><br/>Although while this show does deliver in the laughs department it has its problems. The worst one is Alexi Sale. Maybe its the view of a foreigner, maybe its the view of someone who wasn't alive at the time but Alexi Sale has never so much as raised a smile from me in relation to this show. Episodes that he is in for more than half, I give at the very best 4/10. Then again there are also sequences that just aren't funny. This show did provide plenty of laughs along the way. The best example I can think of is the entire episode ""Bambi"" which is my favored.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good show for those who are Adrian Edmondson/Rik Mayall completionists and people who want a laugh, in spite of its small errors.",6 out of 7 found this helpful.,7.0,3 April 2013
2794,The Young Ones, The Best of British Lunacy!,"I remember watching The Young Ones back around 1982-83 on Public TV in Gainesville Florida while attending college at U of Florida. There were only 2 TV stations in this smallish city/town, ABC and the local public television station. It pretty much sucked for television except when they aired the BBC comedies like The Two Ronnies, Dave Allen at Large, Benny Hill and my favorite TYO's! I marveled at their total lack of respect for everything and everyone, especially stuffy english royal types. Back in those days, we in America rarely got to see a show where the characters showed total disregard for authority. Saturday Night Live was about as close to raunch and outrageous as it got. So I loved the 4 lads from england! It reminds me of my youth and the fun times I had back in college. To this day, I haven't seen the Young Ones on TV anywhere! I miss all these great BBC shows!",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,,31 August 2004
2795,The Young Ones, My Generations Monty Python,"When The Young Ones first appeared in television I was 12 years old and it felt like a revolution had started. I can't imagine any show before or since having such a huge impact on a generation. Contrary to what others believe I don't think it has dated in the slightest. There is so much about this show that I love I hardly know where to begin.<br/><br/>Others have outlined the context for the show so there's no point going over that. One of the aspects I loved about the show as a kid and still do was the idea that there are bizarre things going on all around us that we aren't aware of. Talking brooms, people living under the ground, men living in basements etc. The Young Ones created a whole strange world around the main events of the central characters and I think that is part of its appeal to kids. There was even an episode where they did a parody of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe which in a strange way fitted perfectly with the show.<br/><br/>Of the four main characters Rik was by far the most interesting and well drawn. The others were rather 2 dimensional caricatures but worked perfectly well in the surreal context of the show. Although I have to say Vivian didn't represent accurately anyone you would have met in the Britain of 1982. Real punks wouldn't have had ""Very Metal"" written on their back in studs. Vivian is more like a middle-aged persons idea of what a punk would be like. Whether this is because Adrian Edmondson just didn't have enough cultural savvy or it was done deliberately in order to make Vivian seem like an out of touch fool it's not possible to say.<br/><br/>The tragedy of the show though is that Mike was written for Peter Richardson who didn't take the part due to some disagreement. I'm not criticising Christopher Ryan who made the part his own but I would have loved to have seen The Young Ones with Peter Richardson. Due to Christopher Ryan's diminutive stature the character become a rather ironic figure. If Peter Richardson had played the part Mike would have genuinely been the cool person in the house. In the Comic Strip Presents Mr Jolly Lives Next Door, Peter Richardson plays a gangster called Mr Lovebucket. I recommend you watch it if you want an idea of how he would have played Mike. It was also sad for Peter Richardson himself that he didn't take the part. If he had he would have been as famous as Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson who, in my opinion, he is more talented than.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,16 July 2008
2796,The Young Ones," ""Dear Mister Echo...""","'The Young Ones' polarised audiences when it first appeared in 1982, if you were over thirty you regarded it, as Malcolm Allison did, 'utter rubbish', but if you were under thirty you loved it! I have to admit I was not an immediate fan, but took to it after several viewings. <br/><br/>'The Young Ones' was all about four students - hippie Neil, punk Vyvian, wide boy Mike, and hyperactive Rik, who never seemed to do any studying. They lived in a house where incredibly surreal things happened, such as the furniture talking to itself, or atom bombs dropping through the roof. The characters weren't likable, but then they weren't meant to be. Alexei Sayle cropped up from time to time as their landlord, Mr.Balowski. The humour was aggressive, violent, and very rude, more so than any show had been before. <br/><br/>My favourite gag was when Vyvian leaned out of a moving train, only to be instantly decapitated. We then saw his headless body pull the communication cord, get out, and run up the track! Some aspects have undeniably dated; for instance, a 'Dallas' spoof contained the credit: VITRIOL CONSULTANT - MISS NINA COW. This was a dig at the television critic Nina Myskow, who was one of 'Dallas' most vocal supporters. The 'tampon' gag in an early episode caused a sensation. Full credit for this show must not only go to the performers, but also to writers Rik Mayall, Lise Mayer ( whatever happened to her? ) and Ben Elton ( who appeared occasionally ). It is difficult to think of another comedy show that captured the spirit of the '80's so successfully.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,25 October 2006

Quite much actually so lets start.<br/><br/>First of all, this series is one first-rate comedy on its own. I cannot compare it with anything else! Second, all the characters have great personalities. There must be at least one character everybody likes as a favourite.<br/><br/>The combination of violence and dialogs makes it absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes:<br/><br/>Rick's conscience: RICK... RICK.... this is the voice of your conscience speaking... you just killed a hippy!!!<br/><br/>Rick: No, I wasn't me, it was Vyvian, and Mike.<br/><br/>Rick's conscience: No it was you you spotty little bastard....<br/><br/>**** Rik falls asleep and has a wet dream ****<br/><br/>Rick's conscience: Stop having wet dreams you perverd!!<br/><br/>Vyvyian: RIK!!

Just as other Brit-coms are brilliant - this one is a gem! I had not seen the show since the mid-80's but every once in a while I would remember how funny they were and wish that MTV would re-air the show. FAST-FOWARD to August 2003: I'm at Best Buy and accidentally discover *GASP* the complete series in a 3 DVD set!!!! One disc is NOTHING BUT special features like cast and crew interviews, behind-the-scenes, and two bonus episodes of spin-off shows!!! Needless to say I bought it and rushed home to see it excited as a pervert leaving Kandy Kink's with a copy of Bam-Bam Girls #26...<br/><br/>What a joy, man!!! It all came back to me and was EVEN FUNNIER than when I was 14 cuz I actually ""got"" some of the stuff I didn't understand back when I was a kid. Vyvyan the Punk, Rick the Anarchist, Neil the Unhappy Hippie and Mike the Cool Cat - they all sprang back to life and I was happy as can be. Watching Neil, after finding clones of himself growing in a pile of manure say, ""Anybody watching that must've thought it was a negative reality inversion"" then watching from a distance a woman says to her mate, ""Hey, that looked just like a negative reality inversion"" had me laughing out loud.<br/><br/>This show is a riot! You've got disco-dancing ants, an atomic bomb in the kitchen that Vyvyan tries to detonate with a sledgehammer as Neil builds a fallout shelter 5 feet away, washers that spit-out the guys' filthy clothes, lots of gratuitous violence and cursing, live performances by bands-du-jour and lentils, lentils, lentils.

2802,The Young Ones," Hilarious, yet brainless, the Young Ones is a hilarious viewing that should not be missed!","The Young Ones does not have the sharp wit and sarcasm that made Blackadder great. But it is far more hilarious and pant-wettingly funny than Blackadder, and it really recaptures the gritty feel of student homes in the 80s. Obviously done on a higher budget than Blackadder, there is ALWAYS action in the Young Ones, and it shows how little things have changed here since the 80s. This show is zany with a capital Z - there is no order or peace in this show - and nothing is normal. However, this only makes it better, and this classic of a comedy has not been ruined by a cr*p third series (Little Britain and the Fast Show have been marred by this) or any specials shown ten years after the show finished. The video quality is OK, but the outside filming is not as bad as it is in Blackadder. Ben Elton has proved himself to be one of the 80's greatest comedy writers - if it wasn't for him, Blackadder would have been rather a limp fish, and we wouldn't have this - an action-packed, completely barmy look at what life is like for four very bored students.<br/><br/>If you watch this, bring a spare change of underpants - you will wet yourself with laughter!

Together, they are the Young Ones, students who live together in a strange house.  Throw in the Balowski Family and some odd neighbors and vegetables and you have one bizarre and funny show.<br/><br/>Even in the 80's, MTV was pretty shallow; but bless them for bringing this show across the Atlantic.

A third of the first series could have been cut due to slow and unnecessary dialogue. A faster pace in future series (hopefully!) would be great! Direction and production overall great - camera crew (editors? Sorry for technical ignorance )deserve a special mention for the ""putting together"" which helps the overall performance and effect by at least 80% I imagine. Geniuses.

The acting is actually superb and despite the location settings for any scene, the acting and storyline - no matter if you find it bizarre or believable, even if it seems uninteresting to you - I love the ludicrously overactive EVERYTHING personally - it all flows so well and becomes a believable and addictive addition to your life. I binged watched the first series in half a day. Mostly for ""Ron""s HE WILL ALWAYS BE RON DAMMIT performance.

Download it, watch it drunk, sober, tired, full from bingeing on popcorn pizza and dr pepper(or Fanta fruit twist?!) it's worth the wasted hour or three (trust me, persevere) to see a couple - or four - episodes. Top tip; if you're single it takes your mind off the post one night stand misery:lack of hooking up. If you're with someone - newer the better IMO, it's the perfect silly sitcom series to watch post coitus/early weekend brunch in bed (guys (and girls-who bother to cook, ever..avocado/mushrooms/tomato's all or some/one whatever on toast goes down well the morning after etc, meat eaters grab some streaky or not bacon or sausages and fry up a sandwich feast. Nothing helps the first series episode go down well better than a greasy or open (poncy IMO - but I love em) sandwich!) 
Ps. Enjoy my super long ""helps you in the bathroom iykwim kinda review"" no longer do you need the back of the shampoo bottle - FYI they've edited them ALL to tell you they're trying not to poison the ocean. Star my bloody ranty review. Insomnia grew this! And Ron - he will FOREVER be Ron has grown up. Don't miss watching him break free in Sick Note. This might be the last REAL sitcom you see him in before Hollywood snap him up and he morphs into a factory style same old same old actor in yet another unbelievable Diaz-UK ""unknown"" actor rom-com. He needs the support of the UK for the work he is doing here and now. As does, most importantly, the writers producers directors and everyone else involved in Sick Note. It has been directed/edited/produced/written/everything else that goes into it BLOODY WONDERFULLY. Watching this, at times seemed slightly CRINGE. Slightly MEH, a little OH COME ON WHATEVER AS IF a few more times than I would have liked....but it was all GOOD IN CONTEXT. The flow and feel of the whole first series at least from start to end was consistent and gripping even if it were more lighthearted than the description suggested. It is a breath of fresh air and a rather truth ISH testament in some aspects to real life in my neck of the woods (from what I've been told - except the articulate speaking - no one is that well spoken all the time in London - anywhere realistically - not just south London OR north London. (Pls no one take offence LOL) It's overall a great easy watching funny show with some great actors. It deserves more exposure. End of. Bloody watch it.

I am amazed when I see things such as equipment operating for long periods without a sign of a grease gun or any maintenance at all! A season or two ago, an excavator chewed up a final and Jack took it apart, and it was obvious that it was bone-dry without lube- no wonder! Does anyone there ever check fluid-levels or grease anything? They seem to just jump in and go to work! I don't see them winterize anything, yet they come back the next year and wouldn't you know? It fires right up, and again they go right to work with it! Amazing equipment, huh? This year Todd and Jack take over an existing claim, and wouldn't ya know? Somebody left equipment there! Another miracle- the batteries are hot, the stuff starts right up without anyone checking a thing. Hells' bells, the Teletubbies have more smarts! I have to add one more thing... the narrator has a death-wish outlook! If something minor happens, suddenly we're told ""If they can't fix it, all will be lost!"" C'mon, get real.

2837,Gold Rush, Hoping most of the show is for real,"Feeling slightly stupid to be a sucker for this show.

How much is real and how much is played or scripted, I don't know, but seems real enough for me to not turn the program off.<br/><br/>From the first season the Hoffman crew has been running on too small budgets and knowledge, I don't know if effort, luck or help from the TV- production has made them still succeed sometimes. Parker is developing a A-class asshole attitude, if some of this is real it is interesting to ponder why - ambition, expectations, camera fever, narcissism or something else?<br/><br/>What makes me believe in the show is that too much operation, equipment and costs are involved for it all to be fake. One annoying fake element of this show is the drama build-ups and the speaker voice - ""If they can't manage to ... this will be the end of the season!"".

This series is no exception. The first few seasons are fairly real, then it becomes progressively more sensationalized, acted and staged.
One of the mines is being run by a 19 year old, who is doing a good job running the mine, especially considering his age, but he develops a progressively cocky attitude that gets pretty annoying. It may be the producers editing it that way, doesn't appear to be though.

2839,Gold Rush, Glorifies Incompetence and Idolizes Stupidity,"Seriously these idiots supposedly spent Nearly $250 to get their home made wash plant built and running on their leased claim in Alaska. OK I checked the classifieds in the California Mining Journal. A ready to run truck mounted wash plant Was Listed for $60,000 including the heavy equipment needed to run it. Seriously, check the classified ads.<br/><br/>The writers have gone out of their way to create fake drama in this show. We're down to the wire out of money and have been (supposedly) running for months. Never once have they checked to see if they are actually getting any gold. Nobody, except maybe a Hollywood writer, is that stupid. For the amount of material they supposedly moved and the pitiful amount of gold recovered they have picked the worst spot on earth, maybe the entire solar system.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just biased because I've been prospecting and mining gold in the Mojave Desert since the 1970's. I think this show is offensive to any one with common sense. Real miners are not stupid. The stupid ones end up blowing them selves up or falling down a mine shaft. This fate awaits the writers of this show.<br/><br/>This is the core of what's wrong with this show. The writers are too detached. It's unlikely any of them have ever seen a gold pan let alone a real gold mine. They presume their audience is as ignorant as they are. Big mistake. This show, had it been base on any sort of earthly reality, would have attracted people that had been bitten by the gold bug. Instead we have yet another badly written, poorly acted, soap opera. This time instead of motorcycles we have gold pans.<br/><br/>Perhaps they should all go crab fishing.<br/><br/>P.S. It's impossible to lose gold. You simply fail to recover it. It's not lost.

2841,Gold Rush, Facing Reality.,"I with no doubt say that this is a good TV show. Maybe the story-line isn't nothing new to people but it's really interesting to watch and I completed the whole season in just two evenings. The camera crew had done a really great job. The filming was creative and I always like to think how it is for them. <br/><br/>This TV show actually gave me a few life lessons and I bet that to the crew - even more. Things don't go always the way you want them to go. In this case they faced like tons of problems but they're spirit was unbreakable and the mechanic - amazing. Some may say that Todd's leader skills are poor and that they make some silly rookie mistakes. But, people, don't forget that they are kinda desperate in the situation they are and overall just six ""average Joe's"" When I watched the last episode I saw that they have really fell in love with gold mining and they wont stop. I think that this adventure has changed their lives.

Season 3 is a must, as this show just seems to now be hitting it's stride. <br/><br/>Gold Rush Alaska is the NEW Storage Wars! I've enjoyed Storage Wars, I begrudgingly watch Pawn Stars but just find that show to be all contrived, and Ricks Dads is unintelligible, talks like his mouth is full of marbles, and with Rick's laugh, who needs canned laughter or a laugh-track, he laughs at all his own jokes! Ricks laugh reminds me of Muggsy from cartoon land. Suffice to say it barely holds 22 minutes of interest for me.<br/><br/>Gold Rush Alaska is filmed and shot extremely well, it has great flow and has a terrific pace to it.

What a goof! <br/><br/>Shows like this has an audience not for the fake drama, but just to watch the machines working, illustrate repairs and improvisation, and the final product. It doesn't need anything else! Just like ""Ax Men"", another great show that the producers ruined by the fake drama, this series is also going to eventually fail, if they keep up with the soap opera scripts.<br/><br/>EDIT/ADDED:<br/><br/>I've just finished watching S08 ep 20, and have to amend my review.<br/><br/>Todd and crew are pathetic, portray themselves as bumblers that have traveled North and South America mining for gold, and obviously don't have a clue about mining, nor understand the machines they use in the show.
I see them as a bunch of aimless idiots!<br/><br/>Tony Beets has joined in the soap opera scripts, it seems - behaving like a greedy a-hole that resents anyone else operating a mine to the point of sabotaging others' operations?! 
Yes, what he does, obstructing the lawful movement and development of another business is criminal, *and if this was real acts of interference* he would be arrested and lose all the rights to his claims - forbidden from mining, himself...but it's fake, so he continues to just behave like a goof for the cameras.<br/><br/>Parker is still a tyrant brat that continues with his own fake crisis, fake feud with Beets, and fake drama.<br/><br/>*All these lands are owned by the State/Province/country, and mining rights/prospecting rights are permitted by the grace of these government jurisdictions*.

2846,Gold Rush, Entertainment Only,"Where to start with this train wreck of a series? Well, real gold miners must laugh themselves silly watching this rubbish. I worked in a coal mine for years and the one thing that is drummed into you is maintenance. There is none on this show.<br/><br/>There are three main crews in this - Parker Schnabel, Todd Hoffman and Tony Beets. Each one as ludicrous as the next so lets start: Parker Schnabel is an arrogant spoiled brat who, unfortunately, runs a crew at the ripe young age of 21 (about). He treats or rather mistreats his employees in a way that should have resulted in several law suits. He throws tantrums when things go wrong and it's everyone else's fault, not his. One laughable moment was when the water ran out and they started pumping silt through the dredge. Here's a hint, start doing a pre-start walk through of the mine, you may have picked up you had no water. An idiot's mistake. And, his Australian girlfriend is back for another season? The producers must have paid her to come back as it is a mystery why she is with Parker.He is a thoroughly unlikable character.<br/><br/>Todd Hoffman who never seems to learn. Every season they run out of good mining area. Here's your hint - a mine plan. I have worked in several mines, they all had mine planes. We knew where we would mine each day and had a three month plan, so this never caused a shutdown, And, I don't think God's plan involves making you rich so stop the ridiculous prayer every time you want to find gold. It really cheapens Christianity and is not what I would expect from such self proclaimed pious people. And, just about running out of money every season and then finding a rich area that enables you to continue mining the next season is getting a little old. It happens every season and it's about time the producers came up with a knew story line.<br/><br/>Tony Beets is a foul mouthed idiot whose brains have been passed on to his kids. Only Monica the daughter seems to be able to string a sentence together without sounding retarded by mumbling and excessive swearing. Engage brain before opening mouth. Although I don't get all hot over swearing, it is overdone and noticeable because of the amount of bleeping to cut it out. They sound uneducated and simple.Tony tries to sound decisive as if everybody jumps when he yells and he expects instant action. Such as when the engine seized on the dredge operated by Kevin (son). Asked what the F*** is wrong. Sons yells back I told you it was F*** stuffed and you need to buy a new one. How much father asks - $600K says son. Do it says dad and the next week and brand new custom engine appears ..... what? Then one of the engineers lets it slip it was ordered last year. Good God, how stupid do you think we are. This, of all of them is the worst crew for maintenance. A barge engine overheats and a larger coolant pipe is added to keep it cool. Shall we test it? No, lets just F*** go. And of course the pipeline is never checked and comes off just about seizing the engine. Between the equipment that fails and is mistreated because it doesn't get regular maintenance and the stuff this idiot gets built that doesn't pass compliance (the barge was a good one) I shiver at the amount of lost money. If he was the CEO of a company run by a board he would have been fired a long time ago.<br/><br/>I gave this a 3 because it is one of the few programmes that makes me laugh out loud and that can't be all bad.

Raping the lands, killing the wildlife and teaching that to their kids, they talk about friendships yet leave one guy sleeping in a tent in the middle of Alaska where the Bears outnumber the humans-dumb dumb dumb. They had a decent chunk of cash, more than most and they could have used it to invest in things that do profit during economic times and employed their friends. Old chappy's son and that goatee and barking commands and saying- I don't have enough money when he should be saying I don't have enough of dad's money. To me it looks like he has been eating way to much on dads money. The only person who made any sense was the safety dude and I don't understand why he was on board with this operation. I don't care what the ending is- I shut it off because of the irresponsible acts like shooting guns anywhere without concerns of fellow neighbor miners claim.<br/><br/>This reminds me of the Documentary where that idiot decided he is Yogi's best friend and is kissing all the Bears and naming them,then one eats him.

Just because a tree grows fast does not mean it's been there for hundreds of years, especially spruce trees. I know absolutely nothing about gold mining but I will tell you I can do a hands down much better job than those idiots.<br/><br/>And their leader, oh my god their leader... How the hell are those guys still following him around??? He appears to have very little to no backbone. When he gets angry his voice goes up to about 35 decibels.

2854,Gold Rush," The Egomaniac, the Clown and Prime Evil on a senseless Hunt.","I started watching the series with I guess the same fascination many of us have: the interesting and daring abilities of man, the perseverence and excitement in achieving success. After a few series, I realized that this series is the representation of Evil in its purest form: the American Dream gone bad.. The financials of a gold-digging business consists of cost and revenue: the struggle is about earning more than spending on equipment and manpower. And while it seems useful for the sakes of employing people, the net sum is that there is no practical use whatsoever of adding gold to the existing gold in the world: the enormous sums of gold that exist currently are not even fractionally being used for useful purposes, such as healthcare equipment or R&amp;D. Most of it is used purely for speculation or totally useless consumer goods we could live without, or for which alternatives could be developed from other materials than gold. But the result of the gold digging business is, almost equal to the enormous amounts of money earned with this rare metal, the enormous pollution caused by the machines that work on digging it out and dredging, not to speak of the maintenance of these machines and even more pollution creating them for this purpose. And given the relative cheapness of oil compared to the value of gold, the volumes puffed away are enormous. Not to forget the accessability of gold: trees destroyed, creeks diverted, top soil removed which we are in dire need of to sustain nature, and the non-mentioned chemical treatments that many companies use to make the gold even more accessible. And all this for what? To give some punters the chance to get rich. What a noble cause.. Which brings me to the second, human aspect: the way these miners are portrayed. Their lifestyle and attitude towards other fellow humans. Moreover, towards those who make them rich. Here, the operation owners show their truly dark side: the hypocrite quasi-Christian praying of the simple-minded Hoffman, who behaves as if it is an unjust act of God if he does not get rich from gold digging, while he obviously has no clue of the business and most likely never made a profit, were it not for the heavy royalty money he gets from the producers of the series. Does God exists for the purpose of bringing them gold, as if the entity were some servant that does favours?.. Followed by the ego-centric Schnabel, who instead of learning humanity and humility from his late grandfather, has learned to become a self-appointed prodigy for the sakes of showing his merits, walking over his loyal men at any given occasion with the fury of a 5-year-old deprived of his toys, while immediately deserting them when a new kid comes around the block who kisses his *ss and hisses as a snake in his ears. No spine whatsoever, in the business pour l'art and would not survive either, were it not for the parents offering him this opportunity to play with toys. Last but worse, Mr Evil himself, the peasant Dutchman turned dictator, Tony Beets. The style is the man himself: hates the world and everything in it and the only God for this man is money. Treats everyone who works for him worse than slaves, including his own children who hate him and just see him as a fat wallet, just to compensate for his lack of self respect, justly knowing that someone like him should never be in a position of power, due to his sheer destructive manner towards anything human. The three flawed characters represent the American Dream gone bad: no noble cause, exploiting the opportunities offered in the worst possible way, people that serve them and destroying nature along the way. We watch with fascination, as if a dark drama is being presented that never ends, always waiting for liberation when finally their success may turn them into the good people we hope they really are deep within. But the fact is, the evil in them grows along with the purpose of the business and will never lessen. Their success will only justify their methods and the spiral never ends. It is up to us to decide whether we realise the sickness of it all and learn the lessons taught: what to avoid in our ways at all cost, how not to live our lives and finding real purposes instead of these people's meaningless goals. The sad reality however is that the producers do not make any attempt to offer this choice: no contemplation, no retrospect, no reflection. The series is shallow and is lost in the mechanics of the business, in the details of thrills and tension"" whenever a new human bond is tested or broken, due to the inherent risks of the ventures. We are left to our devices to learn and most of us probably are led to believe that the acts are heroic and for worthy causes, just another aspect of a twisted world. The producers would have a powerful means to reflect on the sickness of it all, instead they exploit the weak human interest in sensation and drama and encourage drama to portray twisted minds as heroic acts of perseverence. Either they are pathetic or plain dumb. The series is a human fail and should be taught in schools as media manipulation first degree. The actors should be prosecuted for crimes against humanity, the producers sent to detox to get rid of their perverted minds. Meanwhile, stay sane and use your heart when you watch this garbage. The real world is not like this, don't let it become like it by accepting lies as the truth.",6 out of 20 found this helpful.,3.0,15 November 2016
2855,Gold Rush, Watching people obsessed by gold is just candy for the eye.,"Reality tv, normally the kind of thing I just pass on but in this case I have to admit that this is my guilty pleasure. It's like a documentary about how everything works in the gold mining industry. By now I know everything that needs to be known if I ever wanted to start gold mining, which by the way will never happen. Overall it's well shot, with alot of different camera angles that show the whole operation like if you were there. It's also a nice discovery on how people behave whilst having 'The Gold Fever'. I don't have to tell you that money brings the bad out of somebody, it's just obvious when you watch this show from start till the end. The characters they follow during all those years are all different but they also have alot in common, basically they are all first class a**holes. You have the Hoffman crew, with Todd ""I can guarantee you"" Hoffman as the leader and also the biggest loser of the whole show. Besides taking bad decisions after bad decisions he doesn't do much work. If you want an example on how to NOT run a mining business follow his example. His father, Jack Hoffman (or the papa smurf with the most annoying voice ever like I call him), is probably the most irritating character of Gold Rush. The whole crew likes to pray to God for gold. As good Christians as they are it's gold and welfare they pray for, not for world peace. As a convinced atheist it's just so funny to see them fail time after time. I guess their God couldn't be bothered with them. Needless to say Todd Hoffman and his crew are just the laughing stock of this show. Then you have the Schnabel crew, with the petulant child Parker as the head of the crew. At a really young age you can see that he's discovering gold mining, trying to make his grandfather proud, but ending up to be just a first class a**hole as well. I would probably smash his face after one day but that's just me. But it's fair to say that he learns the business and he will succeed as he knows what he's doing contrary to the Hoffmans. His grandfather and father look like nice people, I guess he didn't inherit their character. Then you have ""The Dakota Boys"" with Fred and Dustin Hurt, father and son, clearly obsessed by the gold. Father Fred is probably the man with dirtiest finger nails on this planet, I guess a manicure costs way too much for him, the greedy b*st*rd. He starts the show as a claim jumper, basically a filthy little thief. So it's really enjoyable to see karma catching up on him. He obviously can fix things over there in the bush, and that comes in handy, but everytime something goes wrong I couldn't help myself being happy watching him fail and lose money. He's just a little greedy filthy thief. His son is about okay, even though I can see him becoming like his father. And then, for the piece de résistance, you have the Beets crew, with the godfather of the gold mining industry, Tony Beets. The way he treats people is just awful, even his own kids. I don't know how he never got shot or beaten up by now. But he knows what he does, that's a fact. From Dutch origin, you can clearly hear that from their accents, the Beets family business are making money, day after day, year after year, but will probably die friendless with alot of gold. You also get to watch and follow other characters during all those seasons, some good hardworking people that deserve much more than the constant verbal abuse from their ""bosses"". If I had to chose people to make a good crew I would go for Fred Dodge, Andy Spinks, Dave Turin, Mitch Blaschke, Gene Cheeseman, John Schnabel, Juan Ibarra, Rick Ness and Jim Thurber. I think with those people gold mining would be a success, but also pleasant working, that in my eyes is so more important than money. Basically this reality tv show is about people obsessed by finding gold, but it's all well documented and shot.",1 out of 3 found this helpful.,8.0,17 November 2019

So here's how this show must be created. Film a bunch of hours of rigs, machines and other manly stuff running for a season. Probably create some fake scenarios of equipment failure etc etc. Then after viewing the footage go back with the so called miners etc and script and edit things for maximum drama like it's happening in real time. More editing then present to tv executives who give a thumbs up or say not quite enough over the top stuff for our viewers then tweak it some more until it's up to snuff!

2861,Toradora!, Simply Beautiful,"When I first heard of this anime, I was given a link to the site with episodes and a series summary. I didn't watch it then because even though my friend told me it was the best anime he had seen, I didn't see a potential for greatness. It looked decent. He had mentioned it other times since then but didn't push me into it. I think it was mostly a ""why not, I'm curious"" attitude that got me to see this show. I watched the first four episodes, not long after I was tempted to see more, and then only stopped because I required sleep. Then I got up early, started again, stopped only because a friend wanted to see me, then finished the show. In short, I was hooked and by the end as close to crying as any anime got me.<br/><br/>The story is about an odd boy named Ryuji and a delinquent girl named Taiga, the palm top tiger. Their first meeting doesn't go well. Then Taiga accidentally leaves a confession letter meant for someone else in Ryuji's bag, then goes to his house to make sure he can't use it against her. Instead he calms her down and agrees to help this unruly girl get together with Ryuji's eccentric best friend Kentemura. Their first attempt fails and Ryuji is free to not help Taiga but he decides to continue helping her, and soon enough Taiga becomes an honorary member of Ryuji's family.<br/><br/>First off, we must mention the ungodly pacing. The amount of content packed into a single 25 minute episode without having to rush it is mind boggling. A typical Toradora episode has the content of two to three episodes of another anime yet flows naturally. This also ensures there aren't any pointless filler with every episode contributing. This is the only series I can think of where there isn't a single bad or lack luster episode. Every episode is high quality, and you'd be surprised how hard that is even for a twenty five episode show. This pacing also gives immense room for characterization and development, where the show shines most. The five main characters all get a good chunk of development, with the main two getting the most of course, and they all get it every episode in some form or other. This results in the anime becoming a home away from home, with a sense of familiarity and adventure in even their most common activities. The humor, while involving some slapstick, is mostly from the character's personalities, be it Taiga's spiteful snarkyness, or Kentmura's zannyness or Ryuji's habits.<br/><br/>This series also boasts amazing drama, and it does so without gimmicks that other highschool romance shows use. We don't see Taiga or Minori getting kidnapped by some biker gang with Ryuji needing to come to the rescue. We don't see attempted rapes or psychotic people trying to murder one of the love interests so they can move in like many highschool romances(and I honestly expected at least one of those to pop up in this show at some point) Now there's not necessarely anything wrong with those plot events, but it says a lot that Toradora can create much more powerful drama with events on a much smaller scale, and don't think this show can't produce some intense moments despite it's light hearted tone.<br/><br/>There are still some highschool romance conventions here but they're all played well. Toradora is up there as an all time favorite of mine, with only two anime I can think of that can compete with it. If you've never seen a romance anime before, I'd start with this one.",72 out of 78 found this helpful.,10.0,17 August 2010
2862,Toradora!, Excellent,I found this anime while I was board and just searching for anything to watch and I came across Toradora! and I must say that it is one of the best shows I have ever watched.<br/><br/>The characters are simply amazing in there design and the plot is fantastic. Also the protagonists are very unique and well thought out and out of all of the anime I have watched the protagonists are probably some of my favourites.<br/><br/>I never expected to be moved so much by it and I was so hooked I had watch all the episodes without even thinking about sleep. By the end of it I was nearly in tears and didn't want it to end so I had to watch it again.<br/><br/>And although this show does not seem as if it should stand out it is out of this world.

2863,Toradora!, The greatest anime i have ever seen,"I didn't know this series existed until it was on its 15th episode, indeed i only thought i should watch it because a couple of my college mates where watching its opening on youtube and i felt curious to see what it was like.<br/><br/>I started watching it, at nine o'clock a Saturday morning. I didn't get up again until after midnight as i couldn't stop watching episode after episode of this beautifully animated series. <br/><br/>The characters, and there relationships with all the others as well as the situations they end up in, feel completely natural and not forced. The series albeit short was breathtaking at every point with its humour and drama shone through every minute of the day and always left me hungry for more after every arc. <br/><br/>If you asked me, back in January, that i would finally find an anime that hooked me again, i would have shrugged it off as i had started to feel like the genre was just loosing its touch, then i watched this series, and my faith was restored to full, as well as made me check out others once more of my love of the style.<br/><br/>the story, i will keep to a minimum as this series needs to be seen to be enjoyed. <br/><br/>Ryuuji Takasu had lost all faith in ever finding love, when his path crossed with that of Taiga Aisaka, a young girl in his class who was good friends with the girl he had a crush on. she had written a love letter and instead put it in his bag instead of his best friends. as she was trying to kill him to keep her feelings a secret he makes a deal with her, to help her get with him.<br/><br/>thats a very summarized version of the pilot, i am sorry but i refuse to tell you more after that, if your interested, check it out as this series is fantastic and worth every point i gave it. In my eyes, if you disagree then fair enough, its your opinion and as such doesn't diminish it in anyway.",40 out of 48 found this helpful.,10.0,27 March 2009
2864,Toradora!, Damn fine storytelling,"Me: an occasional anime watcher. Very lazy, so dubs for me.<br/><br/>This is a real gem. It's a story of 5 friends as they come of age, grow together, and the overzealous love of teenagers.<br/><br/>What sells this is that the two primary characters are both quite believable. You have Ryuuji, who is a deeply caring guy, and Taiga, who is aggressive, cocky, and also vulnerable. While the story is told from Ryuuji's perspective, the most interesting character throughout is Taiga as she handles the trials of growing up. Fundamentally, she is not a cookie-cutter ""cute girl"" to stick in the centre of what is essentially a romantic series; she is needy and often unpleasant, while also caring for her friends deeply.<br/><br/>A lot of anime have craaazy hijinks and characters who are incredibly dense at reading others. The joy of this series is that for the most part, these guys are limited by their own inhibitions in a relatable way and often guess what each other is feeling. It's rare that you want to punch characters for being stupid, at least. Although they may punch each other.<br/><br/>Voice acting in English is pretty solid, certainly above average for anime dubs.",15 out of 18 found this helpful.,10.0,7 August 2015
2865,Toradora!, Toradora - A show about characters,"Toradora is an enigma to me as I do not usually like romantic comedies, or even anime in general. And this anime does a lot of things that make me dislike anime: it pulls characters from tropes, however this show made me realize maybe that in itself is not a bad thing, because this show did that but did it so well that that didn't matter to me. The main love interest IS a tsundere but there was so much more to her than that, unlike many shows where the trope defines them, where it IS their character; Tiaga is herself first and tsundere second. This can really be said for all of the characters in this show, many of them seem at first very two dimensional, but in reality as you watch the show you realize they each have their own personality and Toradora shows that, it makes you care for them. You feel these characters struggle and succeed on a personal level until the very end. This show is, for the moment, my favorite anime, and I would say almost perfect if it weren't for the lack-luster ending.",16 out of 20 found this helpful.,8.0,23 January 2016
2866,Toradora!," Great Anime, Lackluster ending...","This is going to be a relatively short review, mainly because I don't have much to say. As youtuber Glass Reflection says often, ""The ending is paramount,"" something that applies wholeheartedly to this series. This anime has an amazing cast of characters, mostly 2 dimensional, that develop very nicely, but the ending SPOILERS!!! mashes it completely. The anime should be watched through, and if you want closure further than the series goes, then look up the Toradora video game ending. If your still not satisfied, make up a realistic ending, like I did. The shows OPs are both great songs, but OP 1 is better in my opinion. OVERALL: Great story that leads to a lackluster ending where the mine cart of buildup falls down a pit.<br/><br/>Told you it would be a short one.",13 out of 16 found this helpful.,8.0,5 March 2017
2867,Toradora!, Haruhi mastered.,"""Since the ancient times, it has been decided that only dragons are worthy of standing next to tigers."" The relationship between the two main character is almost identical to ""Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi"". Aisaka Taiga (AKA ""Tiny Tiger"") basically abuses and bosses around Takasu Ryuuji (""Ryuu"" is dragon). And just as Haruhi series, she eventually falls for the guy.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the Haruhi series, but this series was even better. The characters were very interesting and developed extremely well. Even the supporting characters had great depth.<br/><br/>I've always found it difficult to cry in anime compared to live-action because let's face it, they're just drawings. But I really connected with the main characters in this series and the scenarios really touched me. This is probably the first TV anime series where I actually cried.<br/><br/>Unlike the pure conclusion-per-episode format of Haruhi series, ""Toradora!"" had somewhat more continuity between episodes and therefore characters developed much better. Music was exceptionally well-made and touching, and although the quality of animation was average, the character design was really well done and memorable.<br/><br/>Although ""Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi"" was more of a fantasy and ""Toradora!"" being coming-of-age school romance, I thought they were very similar and ""Toradora!"" was superior in every way. The previous reviewer says this is ""The greatest anime i have ever seen"", it is for me as well, and I have enjoyed every moment of it.

2871,Toradora!, Quirkiness and bizarre happenstance,"I came across this anime on a list of comparable titles for Clannad and the Clannad Afterstory. What I found, however, was nothing like what I expected. <br/><br/>Basically, the story is about a high school senior named Ryuji Takasku(which, in Japanese, Ryuji means ""Son of the Dragon,"" or so I'm told) who happens to have a frightening face which generally scares people into thinking that he is a bad guy. In reality, he is actually a genuinely nice person who is actually a bit OCD, but is far from being a delinquent. Then he meets Taiga Aisaka who is nicknamed the ""Palm-Top Tiger"" (Primarily for her height and rather ferocious disposition). They both realize that the other is best friends with the one that he/she is interested in, so they form an alliance to basically get each other to date the person they want. <br/><br/>The plot may sound a little threadbare, or perhaps clichéd, but I actually found it very refreshing after watching anime such as Clannad, Kanon, Air, or Angel Beats. The artwork is nothing groundbreaking, but at the same time it is absolutely brilliant. I particularly like the art done with the two title characters. Ryuji isn't really facially attractive (small pupils, sharp eyes, and generally fierce features), but he still manages to endear himself to the viewers so that, even while admitting that he is kinda scary looking, you can still see that he is genuinely good. Unlike the typical hero in almost any anime I can think of, Ryuji is really not supposed to be handsome, sweet, or kind looking, and yet, on the inside, that's exactly what he is. As for Taiga, well, I love her animation. Far from the heroines endowed with extreme shapeliness, generally sweet personalities, and normal height, Taiga has the body of a child, is really pretty thin, has a majorly caustic personality, and is really short. The shape and animation that went into her face and head was excellent. The hair color (orange) clearly hearkens back to her name ""Taiga"" which is clearly reminiscent of the English word ""Tiger."" Yet, in spite of her seemingly negative traits, it wasn't unbearable like I found Haruhi's in the Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. Taiga is as sweet as she is sour, maybe even more so the former.<br/><br/>This anime gives a very refreshing outlook on life. I can't say I really liked the last episode, but it hardly ruined it for me. This show has a lot of heart, and if my review hasn't convinced you to watch it, you still should, because if there is one thing that Toradora! really states it's that there's always more than meets the eye and you can't judge a book by its cover.<br/><br/>Edit (3/28): I forgot to mention that the voice acting is superb. I have yet to find an actress whose voice is as perfect as the girl who voices Taiga. Each character has levels of depth to their voices which exceed the general call of duty when it comes to voice acting. Taiga, in some scenes, sounds severely injured. The emotions come across really well. Also, characters who I feared had no depth or character development completely blew me away. Like I said before, there's more than meets the eye. The music is also very good. It didn't blow me away like the Clannad soundtrack, and it wasn't the fanciful magic of Kanon's soundtrack either, but it suited the situations perfectly. It had a very light, mischievous sound to a lot of it that, again, was more than it initially sounded like. Also, the opening and closing songs are perfectly appropriate for the series, especially the lyrics.",7 out of 9 found this helpful.,10.0,27 March 2013

2873,Toradora!," Coming of age, self-discovery, and growth well done...","Yes, it's another teen coming of age / ""slice of life"" anime, it has many of the classic character stereotypes represented, and yes many of the classic tropes are represented, but unlike so many others it's well done.<br/><br/>What surprised me is how naturally the series develops.<br/><br/>The characters are simple but not one dimensional, depth is obtained through flawed but very human choices and the consequences of them.
Tropes are present but instead of being shoehorned in they exist as integral parts of the story, often noticed after the fact instead of standing out like the ""fan-service"" we've come to expect (and often dread).
Episodes flow well, without the gaps and jumps I've grown to expect and when the end is reached it felt natural.<br/><br/>It would be easy to go on, but in the end it's an enjoyable series that makes me interested in taking a second look at the ""Slice of Life"" genre.<br/><br/>Pro's:

2876,Toradora!," Interesting,beautiful,exactly right for a light teen romance","I must say I liked it better the first time I saw it,but I guess that's because I was younger then.<br/><br/>We have a story about normal kids and their everyday lives.They are around 17 years old.The protagonists are a male character living with his mother and a small female one,with broken family,living alone next-doors.<br/><br/>They meet and start taking care of each other.At first they constantly fight and mock each other but as time goes by they grow into each other.Their friendship began with a deal.That deal dictated that one should help the other with their love life,since they could not confess their feelings to the people they liked.Of course they always fail miserably,getting into all kinds of trouble,creating funny scenes.There are also some scenes that can get you nervous,thriller and warmed up....<br/><br/>The design is beautiful.Characters are portrayed quite good.Even those who are introduced later in the series.<br/><br/>I liked Ryou but I would like him to be a bit more steadfast at certain points.His ""holding back"" thing gave room for many misunderstandings,bad behavior towards him and dragged things along.I also liked the Ami character quite a bit.I would like to see some more development there though....I would maybe even like her better than Taiga as Ryou's partner.Minori was really annoying.The later council president proved nice,I did not like him in the beginning.He seemed soulless,always fine with everything.I also liked their single female teacher and Haruka(something like that),their classmate that was always creating laughter for everybody.Taiga's design is a bit weird for a 17 year old girl,I think I would like something closer to a real woman,like some of her classmates and I am not saying she should be like the hottest ones,just a bit more developed.I also did not like the fact they would leave many lines from the dialogues half way through and let you assume and struggle to understand the characters' true emotions.Sometimes that is necessary in a story,but here I believe they used it a tad too much.<br/><br/>Towards the end,it gets pretty moving.Ryou's family scenes are really something.Their school friends and their inner wishes and dreams about staying together forever,like that,having fun and talking,being a part of each other's life even as adults,was really sweet....It was so sweet and innocent....It was maybe the most touching concept of the series for me.It made me think about my old life,friends and classmates,how we were always together,never thinking those years would be ever over,playing,running around,fighting,falling in love and experience the sweet anxiety of these emotions while you are still discovering even the most basic parts of yourself....That was beautiful...<br/><br/>It's definitely worth a watch,especially if you are a romantic,under 23 person.If you are older you may still like it,but could also strike as a bit light or simple.I has been more than 5 years since I first saw it.Then it made quite an impression on me.Now I liked it pretty much but was able to notice many things that would push me out of it,ideas or scenes I could not relate too anymore.Still,a very decent,beautiful and touching light story.",4 out of 5 found this helpful.,7.0,4 October 2016

(although will admit i thought they kept the first opening and closings themes for a bit too long into the show, the second opening/closing themes were great!)<br/><br/>Not much else to say other than one other random point - first watched this anime as a younger teenager and sort of overlooked it a bit because i didn't completely understand it (and there wasn't as much ecchi and comedy as other anime i had watched at the time (lol) but after rewatching it a few years later i came to fully understand the story and just how great it was made!.... and now randomly saw it on IMDb so giving it a review :P",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,9.0,13 September 2016

Characters are dynamic, well rounded and interesting, and the story is complex but not enough to be confusing. It sticks with the same main theme throughout the whole show but never once does it feel boring or overdone. Every episode brings something new or interesting to the table. This series will make you feel all sorts of emotions, as the characters are so spectacularly done and feel so real. Nothing feels cliche and everything is extremely well executed and put together. It is capable of making grown men cry near the end. Toradora is a masterful mix of romance, comedy and drama.

2883,Toradora!, Not for adults I guess,"All reviews here are positive, I wanted to leave a review for people who might not like this anime. It has raving reviews on the web, someone said here (correctly) that the first half of the episodes is a drag, but I forced myself to carry on due to the reviews. In the end, it gets much better, but I wouldn't recommend it to any adults (or 18+), which makes sense since it's probably aimed at a 8-14 yr old audience.<br/><br/>Why would an adult want to watch this? Well, because there are animes with deep and heart-warming messages, even though they're aimed at children. Hayao Miyazaki's films comes to mind; in terms of series, one can think of Natsume's Book of Friends / Mushishi, Barakomon / Usagi Drop, Angel Beats / Plastic Memories, Clannad After Story etc. Any of these series has much more depth to their story, characters and messages than Toradora.<br/><br/>I don't know if people were using a different translation, but I couldn't see any depth in most Toradora's episodes (the last ones are a bit different, but they go through an entirely predictable and beaten path in animes, copied and pasted basically). Toradora's character are shallow, almost unidimensional (the exception is the obvious transformations towards the end into something a bit more mature), unrealistic and very childish. Unrealistic characters are fine, Clannad and Angel Beats, for example, have a bunch of them, but their unrealism serves a higher purpose. Here they are unrealistic mostly due to their silliness, I guess it's supposed to be funny, but in a brattish way for children to laugh. When they blossom in the end, it's still unrealistic, unfunny, childish and silly, there aren't bigger life lessons to be transmitted.<br/><br/>Why am I writing this review? Because I can't believe that adults would recommend this. From the visual style, you can already see it's not aimed at adults, so it's of course fine for teenagers to like and recommend it, but I feel cheated and having wasted my time watching this series (which could easily be shortened to 15 or 12 episodes at any rate), please correct me if I'm wrong, but I read adults recommending this and I must have understood them wrong, they must be recommending it for pre-teens.

2884,Toradora!, A Great Rom-com,"There is a lot to like about this show. Taiga's hostile attitude towards Ryuji's, or Ryuji's desperate attempt to not become like his father. This was one of my favorite romantic comedies anime I've seen, and I've pretty much seen them all. From the well known ones like Kaichou wa Maid-sama, to the not well known ones like Ore no kanojo to osananajimi ga shuraba sugiru.<br/><br/>When people don't like the anime I here they don't like it because they think that it is to predictable. Like they knew they would get together in the end, but I think that adds to the fact of the show. you can see them go from hating each other, to helping each other, then to falling in love with each other.",3 out of 5 found this helpful.,10.0,29 December 2015
2885,Toradora!, A delightful anime,"This series is centred on Ryuji Takasu, a high school student whose looks make people think he is a thug, and his classmate Taiga Aisaka, a diminutive girl with an aggressive temperament... known as 'Palmtop Tiger' to her classmates. The two are also next door neighbours and inevitably they gradually become friends. Soon after becoming friends they discover that each of them secretly fancies the other's best friend.<br/><br/>This series is a real delight. It has elements of comedy and drama but ultimately it is all about the characters. The two leads are fun to watch and so are the secondary characters; particularly their aforementioned best friends; a young model who joins their class and Ryuji's mother. The humour never feels overly forced and the characters are believable. Over the course of the series we see various highs and lows for the characters as they interact and do the sort of things high schoolers do in anime. The animation is decent and the character designs are good. Overall I'd recommend this to all anime fans looking for an enjoyable little story, great characters you care about and emotional moments.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,10.0,30 November 2019

Although the pilot episode leaves the audience with the impression that this may just be another stupid soap opera mystery, my advice would be to hang in there and watch a few more episodes to see so many of the actors/actresses characters and friendships evolve into many intriguing story lines.<br/><br/>Demián Bichir and Roselyn Sanchez nail it as Mr. and Mrs.Mendoza, the owners and hands-on operators of the Miami, Florida, Grand Hotel.

2912,Knight Rider, Pure Fun!,"This show is getting a bad rap for the simple reason is that people are expecting some kind of masterpiece. This show is a present time follow up to the 1982 series starring David Hasselhoff and features a futuristic car that was created to fight crime. Although it started out a little too ambitious by involving the FBI as the owners of KITT and took on story lines that were large in scope, it has now moved toward the original premise of the original with a small operation proving that one man (and a super cool car!)can make a difference.<br/><br/>The thing about this show is that it is just pure simple enjoyment and shouldn't be looked at for more than that. It features a cool car, doing cool things with a sexy cast that plays well together. I mean people talk about the original like it was Shakespeare or something, but in reality it was nothing more then fun as well. I mean the story lines were far fetched and gimmicky as much if not more then this series, but the 2008 version constantly gets knocked for it. My advice to anyone that watches this show is to put away any pretentious preconceptions of what it is ""supposed"" to be and sit back and enjoy the ride. Television is supposed to be a fantasy diversion from our hectic lives and that is exactly what this show provides.",61 out of 86 found this helpful.,8.0,5 April 2009
2913,Knight Rider," Not as bad as some think, but not that great either","As a viewer of the original series, I was initially glad when NBC announced that Knight Rider was coming back to the small screen. But the 2-hour pilot movie was poorly paced - like a stretched-out 1-hour episode. It tried to connect with the original series by including David Hasselhoff in a very brief cameo at the very end. (SPOILER - Mike Traceur/Knight is the son of the original Michael Knight.) The new series tried to reinvent the original series while making references to the original. But in trying to please everyone, they pleased very few.<br/><br/>Many fans wanted another Trans-Am KITT, but since that model has been out-of-production for years, that just was not possible. I suppose using the new Chevy Camaro would have been one possibility, but since that model was heavily linked to the Transformers movie, it would have been a poor choice as well. I didn't mind using a Mustang as the new KITT and have grown to accept it. In retrospect, maybe using the Chevy Volt concept car as the new KITT could have been a possibility.<br/><br/>Since the producers have a deal with Ford, the new KITT now morphs into various other Ford vehicles, transformer-style. Not only is this distracting, it is such an obvious product placement as to make the show less entertaining. Some fans like this, but many have voiced their dislike of this new feature for KITT.<br/><br/>Acting and special effects in the first half of the season were simply awful. Student films exhibited more skill. Both acting and effects have improved somewhat but there is still room for improvement. The show's executive producer is more versed in car action movies (see ""The Fast &amp; the Furious"") than he is in one-hour scripted drama.<br/><br/>The new show expanded the original concept into a covert government agency. Many viewers objected to this, so that storyline was changed and 3 principal cast members were written out (including, arguably, the best and most experienced actor on the show). But the show still failed to bridge the connection with the old series. There were numerous references to KARR, but when the big showdown came, it was over in 1 to 2 minutes. The ""mysterious past"" of the new Michael Knight - which could have been an interesting subplot - was referenced numerous times early on, then quickly explained away with little resolution.<br/><br/>There are fans of the new show, but far too few to justify the expense of this one-hour show's continued production. NBC ranks fourth overall of the Big 4 broadcast networks. Times are so tough for NBC Universal that they announced a $750 million budget cut in December 2008, laid off nearly 1,000 people, and have since announced a reduction in primetime scripted dramas by 5 hours each week (to be replaced with a new Jay Leno talk show at 10 PM Eastern). <br/><br/>In the end, the success or failure of the new Knight Rider must be based on its own merits and shortcomings, not in comparison to the original series. The new Knight Rider appeals to some, but seems to be a poorly conceived action/drama that fails to create characters we can care about. (Make no mistake, the original series was pretty cheesy, but somehow we accepted it and the characters.)<br/><br/>Hopefully, another more skilled production team will take Knight Rider and give it the care and attention it deserves. Maybe this would fare better on a cable channel such as SciFi (also owned by NBC Universal) if the appropriate budget and care could be devoted to it.",19 out of 24 found this helpful.,,18 February 2009
2914,Knight Rider, The knight life.,"OK, I got enough of people insulting the new show and rating it low in comparison with the original. First of all: the ridiculously stupid and random twists and subplots of shows like Lost and Heroes aren't examples of good writing. By the way, the few good ideas behind Heroes are a total rip-off from X-Men. Then: the original show was fun, I loved it as a kid, I sincerely enjoy it today. But it was just that. The scripts were campy to say the least, with holes and non-sense everywhere. The characters were... a talking car. Nothing else, Michael Knight was just optional. The new show, also, is just fun. A talking car, a funny character for Michael Knight, punch lines and that's all we need. This new show delivers some good action, not too much, funny lines and even some acceptable (and advanced) visual effects. I like it just like i liked the old one. And by the way: KITT has to be a cool car that you can expect to see everyday, like it was the Trand Am, like it is the new Mustang. Great choice",23 out of 35 found this helpful.,,21 February 2009

I understand that it wouldn't be feasible to have a 1982 Firebird fighting crime in 2008, but at least keep it within reason.<br/><br/>One of the great things about the original is that all the technologies could exist, as futuristic as they seemed back then. Not once did KITT ever turn into a Transformer. Even today, that's so far-fetched it's ridiculous.<br/><br/>The producers should have kept in mind the original audience of KR and catered to them. What's the point of using the KR name to develop a show that has nothing to do with the original premise? They could just as easily have called it ""Fast and Furious Transforming Rider"" and it wouldn't have made a difference.

Unfortunately the dismal ratings ended the show before the cast could possibly gel.<br/><br/>It's difficult to bring back pseudo-cult programing but it has shown to have been done successfully over the past few years. The best example may be Glenn A.

2919,Knight Rider, Well that was short,"Mike is your average male heroic lead in a Hollywood production... he has no trouble with the ladies, he's defiant but wins for the good guys, and he can handle himself. Is there nothing else to him? Well, he seems to have a crush on Sarah, and the audience is meant to hope they'll get together. It'd help if the characters in this weren't so crudely drawn, nearly being caricatures. The dorky(yet hot) chick, the nerdy guy, the tough-as-nails boss, and I could go on. Acting-wise, we're not much better off. Anyway... aforementioned descendant of The Hoff is this generation's(yes, we're ignoring the '91 TV-movie... everyone is) driver for K.I.T.T., an ultra-modern car graced with its own AI, the voice of Val Kilmer, and occasionally a sense of humor. Ah, if only the funny moments of this were intentional. On the plus side, it doesn't take itself seriously, with comic book-style ""villains"" and plans, not unlike the vastly superior Alias. For the concept, this could(and should) have far more vehicular stuff, but what there is, is quite cool. The remixed opening theme beats the original, at least in my mind. One does have to wonder why half the one season this got did not have any faces in the credits... were they unsure if they'd stick with the cast? Technology leaps since the 80's show are taken into account. The dialog is OK. This has some nifty plots, if it is overall low on memorable content. The action is reasonably choreographed and executed. Cinematography and editing are fast-paced and at times suffers from the current infatuation with hand-held photography. At its best, this is dumb fun that you can get into quickly, and do not have to think about. But as far as that goes, you can do an awful lot better. I recommend this to those who must get into any entry in this franchise(at least it's not TKR). You shouldn't have trouble finding the episodes... they all awkwardly work in the word Knight into the title. 6/10",5 out of 7 found this helpful.,6.0,11 March 2011
2920,Knight Rider, knight rider is most enjoyable show in a long time,"what more could you ask for. its got a gorgeous good looking sexy cast and a gorgeous good looking sexy car. storyline is lighthearted and not meant to be taken serious. i mean how much further can you take the storyline of a crimefighting team and a super-car. car and man get mission to stop bad guy and man and car go out and stop bad guy. its got action, jokes, humour and i even had a tear in my eye at some points. cast are great and all gel really well. the original show was good and now they have just updated it and made it better. just don't take the show too serious, sit down, relax and just enjoy the show. i hope there is a 2nd season as it deserves one",15 out of 28 found this helpful.,8.0,10 November 2009
2921,Knight Rider, Good family entertainment - an updated classic,"I used to watch the oldies with hasslehoff when i was a kid so was excited when the newer version came out. I have to say that I like it and thoroughly enjoy watching them (im a 30yo female). The acting may well be a bit cheesy at times but its very accessible to younger people like my 10 year old son - so I would say this is great family entertainment and we watch them together. The main people are all easy to watch and I love the KITT humour and how he develops a personality - that part of it is interesting too. I like the newer format since about episodes 14/15 and think thats the way to go. KITT doesn't disappoint with all his gadgets and transformations but im not a hardcore car person so cant really be too picky in that respect. In summary - its got a bit of everything - humour, the whole will they-wont they relationship thing with Mike and Sarah, car stuff coupled with action etc and is suitable for most.",12 out of 22 found this helpful.,8.0,21 March 2009
2922,Knight Rider, Highly underrated !!,"Although have just rated this 10, it of course isin't a 10, but this deserves far better than the current 6.5 rating, perhaps around an 8.<br/><br/>I have just borrowed a DVD with the first 11 or 12 episodes. Found it quite addictive! And this is from someone who does not watch so much TV and is very very picky.<br/><br/>I am 32 and was a heavy Knight Rider fan back in the day. After watching the pilot of this new one, I thought probably after trying the second episode i would be finding something better to do with my time. But surprise! It turned out to be great! What's so special about this series? It does not take itself seriously! It is quite simply a bit of fun, very well done. This includes utterly superb comic acting and script. It's been made differently. Why would anyone want a continuation of the old Knight Rider when they can just watch the old one? The team who put this new one together have taken the concept or subject matter, just as an artist does, and painted it from a different view.<br/><br/>And it's done excellently! But to accept this one has to be free enough in their mind to be in the present moment and not compare it to anything else. Unfortunately humans are not currently very good at this and just love to judge everything against everything else. Thus the show has received negative reviews because of comparison to the old one. But art, which is what everything is, stands alone by itself and should be appreciated by itself. And by this open minded view, the new show is intelligent, fun, playful and funny. Yes there are plot holes and a few stupid moments but they are naturally forgiven because anyway it doesen't pretend to take itself seriously.<br/><br/>Could not believe the removal of the 3 characters at the end of episode 11/12. But that was purely a network financial move. I would assume a fatal one in terms of quality of the show but that's the way things go. Will miss the exquisitely beautiful Sydney poitier and comic facials and likability of Bruce davison.<br/><br/>Just want to write well done to the main actors who seem to have a nice playful harmony together and are excellent at comic facial close ups/expressions and timing. For me the show has become more human in a real sense because life is supposed to be fun. Apparently many critics can't accept this........man continues to take himself too seriously.",15 out of 30 found this helpful.,10.0,23 March 2009
2923,Knight Rider, it had promise,"This started off as a pretty good remake with a lot of promise. but they went over board with the nanotech and ruined it, in the end it was more like transformers in knight rider packaging.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,1.0,28 February 2020
2924,Knight Rider," Annoyingly, this isn't actually that bad.......","So having been a child of the 80's where Knight Rider, The A Team, and other such Glen Larson staples were a religion for me I sat down with the full DVD season 1 box set of this remake fully prepared to growl and hate my way through the entire thing.<br/><br/>Annoyingly, frustratingly, and hating myself when I admit it, this wasn't actually as bad as I was expecting.<br/><br/>Yes granted the best way to look positively at this rendition is to not actually compare it it the first run, and especially not the god awful other attempted reboots since the ending of the 4 season run of the original.<br/><br/>The first second you see B list movie staple Bruce Davison in the cast list you know you aren't dealing with the likes of shawshank or schindlers list.<br/><br/>That not withstanding, the series itself has some amusing moments, and Val Kilmer replacing Bill Daniels as KITT isn't as bad as many would expect either.<br/><br/>Yes its shameless lower primetime shenanigans and is completely filled with bare skin heavy pretty girls and leading man handsome men all giving pouty looks and eyelid heavy looks just off camera at every opportunity but when its such blatant americana like it is, this can be overlooked if not forgiven.<br/><br/>The car itself is well designed, the mustang being a very good choice. However the transforming abilities are just a step too far for the suspension of belief for me.<br/><br/>A welcome return was the appearance of KARR with the original voice talents as well.<br/><br/>When you watch this you'll need to be aware of the first series, but try not to cast an opinion based on the warm memories you may have of it as a child.<br/><br/>Justin Bruening is a valiant attempt to replicate the Michael Knight character and is fleshed out in terms of back character a little more than David Hasslehoff was but still, its a channel 5 type budget show so you aren't expecting george clooney levels of talent.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Hoff, his cameo makes a welcome addition to the pilot and is strangely subdued and serious which you wouldn't expect.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun show but not one you'd really expect to be renewed even tho a second season may be fun.<br/><br/>Watch it on a weekend afternoon when you have nothing better to do, its really not that bad and you'll enjoy it if you want a brainless few hours just to enjoy some typical man time with cars, explosions and the like.",3 out of 4 found this helpful.,7.0,2 April 2016
2925,Knight Rider, What I think about Knight Rider,"First of all. NBC has done a great job with the new show.<br/><br/>I have watched the whole Knight Rider show which starred David Hasselhoff. But i though i love the new KR show. I wouldn't goto an extent of comparing it with the 1982 show.<br/><br/>But the new show is really good.I find the show very interesting and exciting. <br/><br/>Its one of my favorite shows.<br/><br/>Love seeing KITT and of course the crew as well. Deanna Russo and Smith Cho are of course gorgeous. I'm really impressed on how well NBC has done the show. Personally, I love it.<br/><br/>Don't Complain If you don't like the show. And it best you don't watch it either because im so fed up of seeing people just throwing insults at it.<br/><br/>I rate this TV series: 10/10.",23 out of 55 found this helpful.,10.0,17 July 2009
2926,Knight Rider, Money badly spent,"I wondered about this show. First of all, I was rather disappointed about the car. I mean, discarding the stylish Trans Am for a mere Mustang? Just doesn't do the job. After watching KITT for a while, it turns out he can even transform in three forms, which is quite senseless and most of the time it does not even make sense... The voice of KITT is rather boring and toneless.<br/><br/>Then the new intro song. Normally I like remakes with a bit of a rock twitch, but this one? Rather disappointing.<br/><br/>Then the more important things: The stories. I watched several episodes, as I want to give it several chances, but it does not really seem to get better. The stories are rather flat and chaotic and even quite repetitive to some lengths. <br/><br/>The acting is most of the time either overacted, or on the contrary missing livelihood in mimics and body language.<br/><br/>The special effects are really well done. Alas most of the time, they do not add to the story. On the contrary even, they are too often a way to show off with the CGI capabilities.<br/><br/>In some fist fighting scenes, the stand-ins didn't even look like the original actors. Different size, different body mass, different colour of hair, different hairdo. Normally I do not complain about such things, but here it's embarrassingly obvious at times.<br/><br/>Long story short: they better had spent less money on the effects and more money on decent writings and talented actors.",17 out of 40 found this helpful.,5.0,5 May 2009
2927,Knight Rider, So so bad,"This is horrific. The actors feel like characters from a bad video game. The action is cheap and predictable. The target for this show seems to be the 5 - 10 year old audience.<br/><br/>KITT is now a Ford Mustang. There are so many options for a great car these days. But since the car had to be American, I guess they had to go with this. Although when it transformed it looks a hell of a lot like a Nissan Skyline GTR.<br/><br/>Worst part of all this is KITT is voiced by Val Kilmer! The intro from the original series is much more entertaining than the whole season of this new series. I don't know why these networks keep canceling great original idea TV shows (Firefly, Kings) and destroying good old shows by recreating previous great shows on such a cheap and bad scale. <br/><br/>I hope this gets canceled or they bring in some new actors and writers for the next season.",9 out of 19 found this helpful.,1.0,28 October 2009
2928,Knight Rider, Why A Remake,"When I first found out that they were doing a remake to the original Knight Rider, I thought how could they do a remake of it. To me, Knight Rider is with David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight and always will be. I'm not surprised that the new version didn't make it pass Season 1. I managed to watch the 2 hours episode to promote the new version but only because David Hasselhoff makes a cameo appearances it and that was the only thing that interested in me and after that, I wasn't really bothered about watching it. Knight Rider was one of the best things that happened in the 80's and it should stay like it and plus the original Knight Rider was the one that made David Hasselhoff known for who he is.",16 out of 39 found this helpful.,1.0,18 June 2009
2929,Knight Rider, A let down and then some,"So, when this first came out, there was a hope for a good show. Unfortunately several things let it down. 1. A very poor cast and terrible acting. 2. The show tried to incorporate too many characters and had poor scripts trying to fit them all in on each episode. In addition, the show went from One Man helping people to grand stories involving governments and end-of-the-world stories. 3. Terrible CGI and instead of using the nano skin concept from the pilot they went down the Transformers route. Any way for Ford to get as many of their models into the show, same thing happened in Team Knight Rider.<br/><br/>The show did get better towards the end of it's run once they killed off a lot of the cast and got back to the premise of one man and one car with a small group of supporting cast. Had the show ran it's full episode amount for the first season, it may have got more viewers and made it to a second season. A lot of interesting story lines were started, but some where left unfinished, others rushed to conclusion. They did miss out on, what could have been a great 2 part episode, when the introduced K.A.R.R. Unfortunately making it a robot, aka a Transformer, and having probably the worst CGI I have seen outside of a B-Movie Sci-Fi special, created a major let down. Had this episode been up to the expectations of the fans, it may have saved the show as it was the jump off point where the show got back to the story lines of the original.<br/><br/>Only 2 things were good in this show. Val Kilmer as K.I.T.T and the Mustang.<br/><br/>Next time, leave Ford and the writers of this incarnation, out of the equation and we could have a good show.",5 out of 9 found this helpful.,1.0,21 September 2014
2930,Knight Rider, Bring back Bruce!!!,"New Knight Rider is no worse than old Knight Rider - but it could have been BETTER. Having got rid of Bruce Davison, the HQ feels EMPTY. And while I approve of losing Big Brother, the new, sleek, downsized team seems a bit lost.<br/><br/>The premise is ludicrous of course - an operation like KITT would cost serious money - and full of holes - what is the PURPOSE of the giant hanger? (Presumably it's an old airship hanger - it LOOKS great, but we haven't seen it USED in ANY way).<br/><br/>But the MAIN failing is the WRITING. ALL TV shows that want to truly entertain, need WRITING - even lightweight ""fun"" dramas. America has produced PLENTY of shows where the premise was absurd, but the attention was drawn by superior DIALOGUE. Even low-brow series can entertain if the WORDS are there.<br/><br/>And there IS still POTENTIAL here. Val Kilmer hits the right note, Smith Cho is Gorgeous and even the guys have their moments. The SFX is superior and while the product placement is a little invasive, it PAYS for the damn thing - deal with it!<br/><br/>So get NEW WRITERS - and have them write BRUCE back in.

2931,Knight Rider, Feels like TKR and lasted as long,"Honestly, the new series felt like TKR in so many aspects, but the writers didn't do their homework, and like TKR it also was an unsuccessful spin-off. That wasn't even a big shocker really.<br/><br/>The first half of the series was horrid and seamed like a crossbreed between the original series 100 words or less plot summary and the ""Transformers"" live action movie it was inspired on. Seriously. The transformers were a cool brand name and many people paid to see the movie once. But there is a difference of success in profit, and success in making something we would watch again. The first halve of the series had too many subplots, adult teasing in every episode and one big fiction no sense conspiracy. Its literally ""writers gone wild"".<br/><br/>The original KITT was a simple car with an integrated super PC and extra features, all covered in an invisible armor jell or something like that. The new KITT was anything but simple. Many features seamed too appear out of nowhere and were never seen again when needed. Is the new transforming shell liquid like in the film, or plate? Sometimes the system couldn't do simple things like visually track planes through a satellite, but the next time it seamed like they could hack pentagon. That got really annoying really fast.<br/><br/>When the viewers got fed up of this (insert your emotion response here) and made it clear to stop watching an insult to the original series, the writers realized they were so close to getting fired, they finally started to take it seriously and went to what we were expecting. The cast went down to 4 main human characters and became more about a regular detective show. Some of the episodes after the KARR battle were good to watch, but it was too late and had the writers done so in the first place, the series might have lived for another season or two.<br/><br/>In TKR I really liked not only the new cars (more than one) special abilities, personalities (yeah, they could simulate emotions), but mostly the vertical flight super plane. The practical idea of the original knight semi was something we all wanted to do at least once in our lives. Here we were given almost no practical effects, just plane effect. Explain to me how spinning KITT helps scanning the exterior? Explain to me what happened to the pilot who wanted to bail out of the carrier plane and why did the carrier plane explode in the first place? You cant without using the words ""writer"", ""looks cool"" and ""developer"".<br/><br/>Worst of all the series had some of the original development crew form the original series. I kept asking myself, what happened to these people? Why did they make this so different from the original that we can't recognize it? Did they stood up and tried to make a change before the verdict on the show was made? So many questions.<br/><br/>Maybe it's me, but it seams like there is a failure curse on all the Knight Rider spin-offs. Hell, they even didn't beat TKRs 22 episode marker. Really sad.",7 out of 16 found this helpful.,4.0,8 June 2009
2932,Knight Rider, American series-making at its worst?,"I just watched an episode of the Knight Rider 2008-series and after about 10 min I couldn't help but laugh while at the same time trying to suppress the pain in my brains.<br/><br/>This show has so many glaringly obvious problems. I love the old show and although it also had the occasional badly or cheesy written episode it always did it with heart. You cared about Bonny and Devon and you liked them as characters.<br/><br/>The new show: 1. Poor script writing with characters dropping in and out in ways that make it nearly impossible to suspend disbelief as well as loopholes in the script so big even KITT couldn't turbo-boost over them.<br/><br/>2. Very! poor dramatic implementation of dialogue. Example: Michael and his esteemed colleague are in KITT while napalm heats up the car to the point where they'll either die of overheating or running out of oxygen. Does the scriptwriter try to convey the panic of that moment? Not at all. Instead, we are ""treated"" with smug comments from totally irrelevant ""team"" members whose only job seems to be making said smug comments instead of actually energetically working out a plan to save their lives from getting snuffed out.<br/><br/>This could be mistaken for tongue in cheek comedy but in my eyes its just a sign of inadequacy.<br/><br/>3. Over the top reliance of the director on fast camera movements and CGI effects to past it all together. Seriously, after watching the show for 15 min my eyes were basically hurting. It's like they were trying to make a 45 min long videoclip instead of reserving the fast-paced action shots for when it really mattered: the action scenes.<br/><br/>And what is it with US film/series makers and their ill-conceived ideas about visible lasers in broad daylight in a dust-free environment anyway? I know it's supposed to be a semi-scifi show but really they should give the people in the US film industry a speed course in basic physics.<br/><br/>4. Totally irrelevant characters. It's great one geek has 6 Phds in advanced sciences and its equally great another character can speak 9 languages but despite all of these ""assets"" they're totally irrelevant to the show and more a nuisance than anything else.<br/><br/>The end result? I give it 4 for effort but for the rest they failed miserably. And that's even without knocking the developers on the head for the blatant ""lets do some product placement for Ford"" kind of thing.",23 out of 77 found this helpful.,4.0,1 March 2009

2934,Knight Rider, Should have been a reboot,"This series would have been so much better as a reboot rather than an extension of the original series. The continuity errors stand out like sore thumbs. The biggest being KARR! In both Series' KARR has the same programming flaw which means that they made the same mistake twice. As a reboot they could have taken the rivalry to new heights.<br/><br/>Also the transforming thing, KARR becomeing a robot and KITT being a shapeshifter were both really dumb ideas. All KITT became was an advertisement for Ford.<br/><br/>The money could have been better explained as a reboot as well. And I'm still confused on why the series started off going in one direction with Torres and the government for a full 11 episodes before taking a sharp left turn into reestablishing FLAG and the group being autonomous. No hint of strife or wanting to separate up to that point. This was just odd.<br/><br/>The cast was great, Deanna Russo and Smith Cho were both beautiful and created the perfect balance to Justin Brushing and Paul Campbell. The Mustang was a nice choice for KITT too.<br/><br/>I think Knight Rider as a concept has more life left to it, but it must completely separated from the original series and be fully updated to the present or near future (not the post apocalyptic future like Knight Rider 2010) to make it work. There are enough of us real Knight Rider fans still out there to help put a solid plot together, I'll happily volunteer to participate in a research panel to make it happen.",2 out of 3 found this helpful.,5.0,31 October 2018
