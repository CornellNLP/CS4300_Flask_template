There may be some support for my view that the earlier episodes, which featured 'Blamire'( Michael Bates)as one of the three leading characters, were characterised by the interplay between these three characters,expressed in terms of dialogue rather than the 'comic' situations which became a feature of later episodes, coupled with the development of other characters who played little or no part in the first series. I consider that the quality of the scripwriting suffered as a result of the changes, particularly when the focus moved away from the central trio. Nevertheless, the programme maintained its popularity over many years and developed almost a cult following. Curiously, though, this popularity was not wholly shared by the population of Holmfirth, who saw the programme as a mixed blessing when the interest generated by the programme resulted in an influx of sightseers into their small, quiet narrow streeted town, with predictable results.  Suffice it to say that while one or two enterprising people benefitted from the publicity, the sightseer were, it must be said, disappointed with the fact that there was very little to see of real interest and, of course, the 'characters' were nowhere to be seen. That the programme retained its popularity for so long can only be explained by how well the characters created the illusion of three eccentric old men enjoying their freedom in nostalgic adventures in beautiful surroundings where the sun always appeared to smile on them (the grim reality of the harsh Holmfirth climate being conspicuous by its absence) The secondary characters were always believable and the humour was, by and large, unsophisticated and free from innuendo, reasons, perhaps, for its acceptance in the context it was presented. It may be that the reason for the success of the programme is that it presents a world that no longer exists, a set of endearing characters,lost in their own little world, steeped in a kind of rural simplicity from which the harsh values and events of the real world are permanently excluded,playing the sort of schoolboy adventures in which we may, at one time, have all shared.

The show is more like comedic serial than a sitcom. There is the ongoing secret courtship between married Howard and single attractive golden girl, Marina. Then there is the annoying happy marriage between Glenda and Barry. It's almost nauseating to hear Glenda speak so highly of her Barry to her mother and their friends over tea as they discuss husbands with the suspicious Pearl, the widowed Nora and Ivy. Of course, it's wonderful to watch Auntie Wainwright as an antique seller in the small town. It's a delight to watch Jean Alexander thrive in this role.

These little girls have more heart and more hustle than any other superheroes, and when trouble strikes, these three little superheroines don't waste time with the philosophical speeches of the \"SuperFriends\" or the inane transformation sequences of \"Sailor Moon.\"  The Powerpuff Girls are always ready for action, and when trouble strikes they stop only to ask permission to leave the classroom - and only if there is time.<br/><br/>Besides plenty of action, the show has superb, though often subtle, character development: a happy but lonely Professor Utonium creates three super-powered girls, to whom he gives love, support, and discipline. However, he occasionally reveals his concern about the dangers of their crime fighting, his feelings of loneliness and burden about being a single parent, and even buried anger from his childhood.<br/><br/>The girls have distinct personalities as well: Blossom, the self-appointed leader, is very smart for her age and has an ego to match; Buttercup is a tomboy who cannot wait until she is old enough to go out after dark; and Bubbles behaves like a normal five-year-old girl, coloring, singing, and trying to keep the peace.  Our adorable heroines experience the friction that most siblings do, but their love and fight against evil keep them together.<br/><br/>Also, the supporting characters, including both the good citizens and the villains, have complex yet consistent personalities.  The kind mayor's assistant and evil Mojo Jojo are as interesting and complex the Powerpuff Girls themselves.  Even if a scene begins with a random monster attacking the city, you can be sure that there is more to the story, and another piece of the relationship puzzle will be put in its place before the show is over.<br/><br/>Of course, the episodes are extremely funny and uplifting, and the only thing this show does not have is the built-in toy advertising.  The writers and artists borrow elements from shows and movies that we children of the sixties enjoyed.  Besides their own original story lines, they have cleverly parodied \"Star Wars,\" the classic step-mom fairy tales, and everything from James Bond to Japanese monster films.  Whether the subject is exciting, sad, or scary, you will always find the humor and the warmth.<br/><br/>The show does have a few minor drawbacks: sometimes the \"cartoon violence\" is a bit excessive, and I recommend that young children do not watch this show - it is rated for children eight-years-old and older.  There are sometimes inconsistencies between shows or even in the same episode, but these are minor, and I should not complain because it is a cartoon after all.<br/><br/>Overall, \"The Powerpuff Girls\" is an excellent television show that leaves its audience feeling good.  All of the characters are well developed, and the girls themselves are as believable as kindergarten superheroines can be.

But the question is, does it still hold up today? Does it still have that combination of Sugar, Spice, and Everything Nice. Well, the answers are YES, and YES. This is still one of the best things Cartoon Network has ever made. This show is about three little girls named Blossom, Bubbles,and Buttercup who uses their awesome superpowers to defend their good old Townsville USA from crime, monsters, and super villains. All that while living their cute, normal childhood lives. This is one fun and kick ass show. The action scenes are very creative and surprisingly visceral. You can feel the intensity and the sweat that's put in to those action scenes. Also, it can get really bloody at times. Like for example when Buttercup beats up Ace when she sees her sisters in trouble, there's blood coming out of his nose. Or, when Bubbles beats up all those monsters in a simulation and she takes one of the monster's horns and throws it at another monster's mouth. It's gruesome! The animation is simple but effective. It is very clever how you see The Powerpuff Girls themselves as the only cute ones and the background characters had a very sharp edge to it. The supporting characters are really good too. Professor Utonium plays a big role as being a father to the Girls despite him being their \"creator\". Miss Bellum was a very intelligent character and The mayor of Townsville was an amazing comic relief. Also, I really love the fact that The Powerpuff Girls is a spoof on superhero entertainment and anime. This is one of my favorite superhero shows along with Justice League, The Tick, Batman TAS, Superman TAS, and Spectacular Spider-Man. And what's a great superhero show without it's villains.

She is able to appreciate the simpler and more beautiful things in life without getting too bogged down as her sisters normally do.  Sure, she may seem absent-minded at times, but she does have a penchant for finding the occasional needle in the haystack without really trying.

It's admirable when kids shows do that.<br/><br/>The Powerpuff Girls show is also loaded with both funny, scary and likable characters with their own memorability. The girls themselves have their own personalities like the leader, the tough one and the innocent one, but without being one-note characters. The character called \"Him\" is perhaps the scariest villain in the show with a airy and echoing voice and the ability to posses people and control their minds.

There were frequent references to the new style of music that was just about to break through to mainstream media at the time the show began. i.e. a bulletin board in one classroom had notices for the \"Tom Tom Club\" (a real band formed by two members of the Talking Heads) as if it was some organization for building school spirit. And the theme song was written specifically for the show by another unique and fantastic early 80s band, the Waitresses.<br/><br/>Quirky in delivery but right on in concept, the show was far and away ahead of its time. Perhaps the only recent program on TV it can be compared with would be \"Malcolm in the Middle\". Although not as sophisticated as MITM, and with many silly, sophomoric jokes, those of us who were aware of the changes bubbling below the crusty American cultural landscape of the time sensed that this was the first breaker of the \"New Wave\".<br/><br/>The characters on the show were about as broad-stroked as they could be, yet the characterizations were unlike anything I'd seen before. Patty and Lauren were two high school freshman desperate to be admitted to the \"in\" crowd, but were often spared of making fools of themselves like the kids who considered themselves too good for our heroines. It didn't hurt that \"the skinny one\" was played by a young actress that would go on to fame and fortune in one of the most popular TV series of the upcoming century. And to marry Matthew Broderick! SJP did bring much heart and honesty to this very small role, as did her co-star Amy Linker, and that was part of what endeared the Square Pegs to us.<br/><br/>The only friend the two could count on in the show was played with goofy panache by Merritt Butrick. The actor managed to stretch his career out through the end of the decade (and possibly longer; the last I remember seeing him was on Hollywood Squares, probably in the 90s), but his portrayal of the eccentric yet somehow cool Johnny Slash landed him the short-lived program's one catch phrase, \"Totally.\" <br/><br/>More success would come to the actresses who played \"the pretty one\" (Tracy Nelson, who went on to star in \"Father Dowling Mysteries\", and is still acting today); and the incredibly uptight and driven one with the unforgettable name of Muffy Tepperman (Jami Gurtz, the lead actress in a number of movies over the ensuing years and star of the recent hit TV show \"Still Standing\".) <br/><br/>Rounding out the cast was the working class Italian hunk (Jon Caliri in an updated version of John Travolta's \"Welcome Back, Kotter\" character of the same name), the always angry black girl (Claudette Wells) and the nerdy schemer with another classic name, Marshall Blechtman (John Femia), who I swear I went to high school with.<br/><br/>In the end the show didn't catch on, but it will always remain a bellwether to the energetic shift in music, fashion and attitude that was the 1980s.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "5 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "3 June 2007"}, {"title": " Square Pegs -- the Movie!", "content": "Since Hollywood has ravenously consumed nearly every \"classic\" television series and regurgitated them into \"big screen\" treatments, time has come for \"lost\" series and failed pilots to become adapted for film.<br/><br/>I became a fan of \"Square Pegs\" when it was playing in re-run in 1986-87.

After leaving \"SNL\" after five years (in 1980), she took the nerds concept and extended it, creating \"Square Pegs,\" a comedy about social misfits in high school.  Sound familiar?  That's right, \"Freaks &amp; Geeks\" is NOT that original, it's merely an updating of this short-lived program.  What also differentiates the two is that \"Square Pegs\" was more of a straight comedy, whereas \"Freaks\" is a \"drama-dey\" (an excuse for it to be not as funny as \"Pegs\").

There's no car chases or shootouts here, so some episodes do tend to be a little slow, but for those who like it, ultimately rewarding. There's obviously a good amount of chemistry between the three stars, and as I said, the stories are very family-friendly, often dealing with issues everyone can relate to.

Monica has served nine years as an angel case worker. Being evaluated for promotion to supervisor, she's given her toughest assignment in a small town where before Easter most children had died in a school explosion. Talking with the pastor of the local church subsequently abandoned by everyone, she tearfully describes the holiday in the above quote. The pastor replies that \"all of us are stuck here on Saturday, aren't we?\"<br/><br/>The paradox about the series is that despite literally presenting the existence of God and His helpers, the show was watched faithfully by nonbelievers. Each week the angels were dispatched in human form as a nurse, or a teacher, or a carpenter, or a friendly neighbor to assist in an illness, poverty, loneliness. Invariably the angel as human would fail to resolve the problem so they would finally reveal their true nature by glowing, and inform the suffering person that God loves them. At this point, numerous viewers broke into tears.<br/><br/>It's been said that life is tough and then you die. Thus countless people desperately want to believe in a loving God that will reward them in Heaven. The show dispensed with theological downsides, namely questioning why a loving Being would allow hardship before reaching that Heaven. Each week one was so wrapped up in the realistic portrayals of suffering that one was enraptured by the happy conclusion.<br/><br/>Cynics hated the sugary treatment and even some believers thought it too simplistic, especially the suicide episodes. A person pointing a gun to their head or standing over a cliff was asked by a glowing angel to put down the gun or step back from the cliff because God wanted them to live. Viewers protested that a friend or relative had killed themselves so where was their angel? The writers answered with a story where a man puts his gun down, so the joyous angel departs, except afterward hears a gunshot. Both the angel and the man's family are angry at God, but they learn the lesson that people possess free will and not even God can change their behavior.<br/><br/>The finale was all the more blunt, precisely playing upon the emotions of long time viewers trying to handle the show ending its weekly uplift. In this two part episode held over two nights, we were given time to absorb the fact that due to her promotion, Monica was going to be separated from her beloved teacher Tess. Consequently, she'd face the same grief as the viewers. That was the ultimate secret of the show - tapping into and sharing one's deepest feelings. True, clever preachers do that, but viewers felt the writers and actors on the show sincerely believed in their message.<br/><br/>Sadly, the finale mirrored life too well. Monica and Tess are indeed gone. Perhaps you have experienced brief encounters with people who appear \"angelic\" - such as a benevolent stranger offering a kind word or deed. But they disappear and you are left only with memories.<br/><br/>To refresh those memories, I repeatedly watch the finale on DVD.

However, it all backfired when Honor Blackman decided to leave the series in order to star in GOLDFINGER. When season three ended, ABC decided to pull the plug on THE AVENGERS and sold the series to Telemen Limited. Albert Fennel and Brian Clemmens were both recruited to keep up the standard. Plus, a big revolution happened: The series moved from videotape to film and the budget was also sightly improved.<br/><br/>But even knowing Patrick McNee came back, the studio faced a major problem: Cathy was gone. Since Blackman had already made the character so popular, it was decided a new partner would be created to be paired up with Steed. So Elisabeth Shappard was cast as Emma Peel (Man appeal! Get it?) and production started. But it was soon noticed Sheppard's cold beauty and persona was not right for the role. So Sheakespeare stage actress Diana Rigg was cast as a replacement. The show premiered in 1965 as a completely different deal.<br/><br/>And of course, the rest is history... Diana Rigg brought the charm and kindness that Blackman lacked, altrough she lacked Honor's strenght and toughness. Patrick McNee also played a very different Steed: He went from a James Bond-like sexist macho man to a more kind gentleman spy. The new AVENGERS became so popular that it was exported to the US.  Yes, the fourth season was indeed revolutionary. But what made it so much better than the previous seasons? The most obvious answer would be Emma Peel, or the bigger budget, but I would give credit to the writers. This time, the scripts were much sharper and the show never took itself very seriously. And then there is the wonderful chemistry between McNee and Rigg. The Steed/Emma relationship was subliminally romantic and funny. They always enjoyed great lines togheter.<br/><br/>Some season four episodes are good even for today's standards: THE GRAVEDIGGERS has a hilarious silent film spoof climax. THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT was a clautrophobic \"girl alone in a house\" sort of thriller. THE CYBERNAUTS brought a strong sci-fi element. TOO MANY CHRISTMAS TREES brought the Steed/Emma chemistry to he highest calibur. And let's not forget a TOUCH OF BRIMSTONE that gets the award for sexiest episode ever.<br/><br/>\nThe UK didn't order a season five, but the US did. The series moved from B&amp;W to color, the budget was even higher, and the action increased as well. Gone were the sloppy season four fights and the large male stunts used to double Rigg. Now, the fights were better coreographed, and Cyd Childs (Who looked a lot like Diana Rigg) would be in charge of the kung fu moves that would take out the female baddie of the week. Included were the \"we're needed\" introductions that were made in order to format the show a-la MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE. The US backers also demanded Emma Peel to be more femenine and Rigg decided to replace her leather catsuits with jumpsuits that woulkd go down in fashion history as Emmapeelers.<br/><br/>No doubt season five was fun, but the show went from spy adventures to spoof comedies. Just look at the plot lines: THE HIDDEN TIGER dealt with cats progammed to attack their owners. ESCAPE IN TIME was about time-traveling! And FROM VENUS WITH LOVE was about an alien beam that would kill scientists! You just couldn't watch the show as a thriller anymore.<br/><br/>\nEven Rigg got tired and decided to leave the series. Linda Thorson was cast as Tara King for season six. Of course, the only reason was that Linda was the girlfriend of then-producer John Bryce. The character of Tara King was the femenine partner that the US backers wanted. The girl was so dependent of Steed that she carried a brick on her purse. It looks like Venus Smith all over again. The fact that Linda was a totally unexperienced actress didn't help. Season six began, with quite good rantings that kept up the standard.<br/><br/>Most fans usually hate season six because of the absence of Emma Peel, but I dare say this season was a great deal of underrated fun. Not as silly as season five or as serius as the first three seasons, this era of the show saw Steed and Tara on trully good adventures. LOOK... teamed them against killer clowns (?). SPLIT! dealt with agents shifting personalities through brainwashing. And STAY TUNED is one of those rare episodes where Steed almost cracks!<br/><br/>Even the character of Tara King became more tolerable as the season progessed. She even had a Steedless episode (ALL DONE WITH MIRRORS) where she put both Emma and Cathy to shame. She soon didn't need the brick (*sight*) and her intelligence was also improved. In France, she is ten times more popular than Emma.<br/><br/>However, the show's rantings in the US were poor due to the bad time-slot of putting the show against LAUGH-IN.

What began as a cheap weekly live-broadcast B&amp;W thriller managed to become a major color series with quite high production values and also the first British TV show ever to be exported to the US.<br/><br/>THE AVENGERS began in 1961, as an attempt to cash in ABC's previous medical thriller POLICE SURGEON. The former stared Ian Hendry who became one of the biggest TV stars of the time. The show failed to be a hit however. So Hendry and his co-star Ingrid Hafner were called in to do a replacement called THE AVENGERS. The weekly show would pair up the widowed Dr. Keel (Hendry) with charming secret agent John Steed (Patrick McNee) as they hunted down criminals and diabolical masterminds while walking on the noir-like soaked London streets wearing raincoats. Hafner starred in some episodes as nurse Carol. Only two of these episodes are known to exist, and they have been rarely seen. After many videotaped episodes, the show became a hit and Hendry decided it was a perfect time to start a movie career. He quit the show and so did Hafner. This left co-star McNee all by himself.<br/><br/>\nThe second season started in 1962 and McNee was paired up with Dr. King (Jon Rollason), a temporary replacement. After shooting left-over season one scripts, King was dropped and Julie Stevens as jazz singer Venus Smith was brought in to be Steed's new female partner. A bad one by the way. Not only was Stevens a young unexperienced actress, but the character itself was a manipulative innocent teenager that would always become the damsel in distress and have to be saved during the climax. Weak material here. However, the writers decided to pair Steed up with a different kind of female partner. One that would be written as a male character on the script, and play it like a man. And so was born television's first true independent woman: Mrs. Catherine Gale. Played to perfection by Honor Blackman, the high-tempered Cathy would always have \"battle of the sexes\" arguments with Steed, hit him with outrageous answers and punchlines, (\"Good morning Cathy, what's for breakfast?\" \"Cook it and see!\") and always try to erase his sexist side. Also notable were Cathy's leather catsuits that launched an entire fashion in England, as well as her weekly judo fights with male thugs. The many Cathy Gale episodes have remained in obscurity during the years for the fact that they were videotaped on low production values and transfered into poor prints with lackluster sound. This makes them almost unwatchable. And the bad guest acting and all the technical bloopers that were never fixed during editing didn't help. But all the purists who try to avoid these episodes are actually missing a great load of fun. If you overlook all the negative elements, you are left with entertaining stories that always surprise you with all the wit, poison, and humor from McNee and Blackman. You would also be surprised at how superior the material is since back then the show took itself seriously.<br/><br/>Some episodes speak for themselves: MANDRAKE is a slow-paced but well done suspense with a great fight scene with Blackman and wrestler Jack Parlo. THE LITTLE WONDERS is a funny episode featuring Lois Maxwell (a.k.a Miss Moneypenny) as a wicked machine-gun shooting evil nun. DRESSED TO KILL is a well done variation of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians. THE MAN WITH TWO SHADOWS was one of the first spy stories to use the look-alike element. And THE CHARMERS is perhaps one of the best episodes ever.<br/><br/>It is true that these shows don't even come close to the wonderful filmed seasons that would start in 1965 and they do not hold up to today's standards when compared to other shows of the time. But the biggest reason you should go back to watch these episodes is Cathy Gale herself.

It began life as a medical crime drama called \"Police Surgeon\" starring Ian Hendry as Dr David Keel a pathologist working for the London police. When this failed to take on with the public, the character called John Steed was created. In the first episode of the revamped show renamed \"The Avengers\", John Steed helps Dr David Keel to avenge the death of his wife because he happened to be after the same man. Steed and Keel would collaborate many more times to rid the streets of criminals. The new show took on much better but Ian Hendry departed after the first series and was replaced by Honor Blackman as Cathy Gale, the first of the better known sexy sidekicks that would put the show firmly on the British TV show map. Blackman lasted two series and was then replaced by Diana Rigg as Emma Peel, a sexy auburn haired leather cladded woman who was expert at karate as well as having skills in a wide range of subjects such as chemistry. By now John Steed's English gentlemen image had been fully opened up, his bowler hat and umbrella was inspired by the film \"Q-Plains\". Steed's image also consisted of suave suits and he drove vintage cars, first a 1927 4 and a half litre Bentley and occasionally a speed six Bentley (circa 1926) and later a 1927 Rolls Royce Silver Ghost in the Linda Thorson series. In one or two episodes, Steed could be seen driving a 1927 Rolls Royce Phantom One. Emma Peel drove a 1966 Lotus Elan and Tara King was often seen behind the wheel of a Lotus as well.<br/><br/>By now the show had cracked the American market and it's success lead to the use of colour film for the last two series. Diana Rigg left in 1967 and her replacement was a young Canadian actress called Linda Thorson who played a young agent called Tara King. There was initial doubts about her suitability to the part, but the script writers modelled the character as a young agent who Steed was grooming and her skills developed as the series progressed. The series was a tremendous success in the UK, but in America it was less so. Therefore in 1969 the show was cancelled. However, in 1976, a revival series entitled \"The New Avengers\" surfaced co-produced by original producers Albert Fennell and Brian Clemens and a French production company (see separate review). Alas, financial problems saw the show cancelled after a year.<br/><br/>\"The Avengers\" is without doubt one of British TV's finest hours. In almost every episode superb character actors were drafted in to support Macnee and his co-stars. The plots were usually tight and the combination of fantasy and a unique brand of British humour rose the show well above the average sixties spy show. The most representative segments of the show are without doubt the Diana Rigg and Linda Thorson series. The Honor Blackman series has dated badly because the primitive video tape production techniques are less effective than the later filmed episodes and the style of the show was never really opened up until Diana Rigg joined the show. The writers most associated with the look of the programme are Brian Clemens and Philip Levene. There is only one episode of the Ian Hendry series left in existence and the majority of these were transmitted live.<br/><br/>Finally, here is a list of my recommended episodes, all are available on DVD.<br/><br/>Diana Rigg series: \"The Gravediggers\", \"The Master Minds\", \"What The Butler Saw\", \"Room Without A View\", \"Epic\", \"The Living Dead\" and \"The Forget Me Knot\" (in which Emma Peel left and Tara King joined).<br/><br/>Linda Thorson series: \"Love All\", \"Requiem\", \"The Morning After\", \"The Rotters\" and \"Bizarre\" (the very last episode in the series saw Steed and Tara take off in a rocket).", "rating": null, "helpful": "31 out of 35 found this helpful.", "date": "18 August 2004"}, {"title": " Chapeau Melon Et Bottes de Cuir !!", "content": "Bowler hat and leather boots, that's the French title for this series which has been very successful here and and the 140 episodes or so are available on DVD !!

What a revelation it was to someone who'd grown up watching American TV! It was unpredictable: it mixed mystery, adventure, science fiction, and satire in always changing proportions. The mysteries were truly intriguing, the adventures truly exciting, the eerie situations truly frightening, the fantastic explanations truly ingenious, and the jokes truly funny. In later seasons the show formularized its conflicting elements, like every other show. But in the beginning you couldn't guess what might come next.<br/><br/>And of course there was the sex and violence. It seems impossible now that there was once a time when there was too little sex or violence on TV, but what there was was dull and stodgy. The American network had omitted the most suggestive episodes, but left in a few lines of dialogue that startled at the time. The climactic fight scenes were much more exciting than those on American shows: dynamically staged and photographed, and with a satirical edge, which was lost in later seasons.<br/><br/>The writing was very good too. To us in the States it seemed even better than it was because we hadn't then seen a lot of British TV. The scripts were solidly constructed, tightly packed, and full of clever dialogue. Patrick Macnee has claimed in interviews that \"there was no clever dialogue\" except what he and Diana Rigg rewrote, but the lines of the supporting characters belie that.<br/><br/>The atmosphere of the show was new to me: a dark, bright, sharp, woozy, ordered, but unpredictable world where reality could be rolled like a die, figures of speech could become facts (a killing rain, an underground club), and you couldn't be sure that anybody was what he seemed. If I'd seen Alfred Hitchcock's early films at the time, I would have recognized this as an exaggeration of their milieu, to the verge of parody: those flower sellers and organ grinders seemingly hanging out on street corners but really doing spy business. The world of The Avengers extended beyond them to encompass killer robots and plants from outer space--but only a certain distance beyond. (The failure to observe that distance spoiled many of the later shows.)<br/><br/>That atmosphere stayed with me for years. It carried me through dreary jobs by enabling me to imbue mundane surroundings in schools and industrial parks with fantastic and sinister possibilities. Other shows tried to imitate it, but never successfully. How could they, when The Avengers itself had lost it and never recaptured it again?<br/><br/>The primary technical device for bringing about this atmosphere was the teaser. The Avengers made an art out of it. A man in a field is rained on, tries to escape, is rained into the ground. Superimpose title: \"A Surfeit of H2O.\" The title is the punchline. A man breaks into a house and opens a door; a lion jumps out at him. Title: \"The House That Jack Built.\" And so on.<br/><br/>The puzzle posed by the opener often suggested philosophical or metaphysical possibilities, but they were never followed up on. The solution generally turned out to be slightly science-fictional, and the climax, rather than expanding on the potential implications of the story's premise, was just a comic fight. But it was remarkable in itself that the series could progress from one to the other with such deftness, beginning with a cosmic inversion and steadily narrowing it down to a trivial joke. <br/><br/>The heroes were invincible (otherwise the stories would have been too horrifying), inexplicable (those of us who didn't know the show's origins had no idea why they were called Avengers), androgynous (Steed was the fancy dresser, Mrs. Peel did the manhandling), paradoxical (Mrs. Peel was widowed, yet somehow virginal), and timeless. (In subsequent seasons, they were turned into pop icons, but divested of most of the twists that had made them interesting.)<br/><br/>What was considered by common consent the best episode of all, \"The House That Jack Built,\" I didn't see originally (it was a choice between that and a screening of \"The Music Box\" with Laurel and Hardy). When I finally got to see it in syndication, five years later, it was like being taken back in time and watching the series for the first time. I was just as fascinated, just as mystified, just as amazed.<br/><br/>I set aside my Wednesday nights especially to watch the series. Apparently not many other people did. But that was always how it was with everything that developed a cult. At the time I seemed to be almost the only one who took an interest in it. Only years afterward would people write about it as if it had been a universally shared generational experience.<br/><br/>The following year the news came out that The Avengers would return. And so it did--sort of. But despite assiduous effort I gradually had to accede to an awareness that it was no longer very good. It had been dumbed down for Americans. It wasn't the same. It was gone. <br/><br/>And now, looking back on it forty years later, I wonder (and can never know for certain): was it really so good as it seemed to me, in that one happy season of my youth?

Emma Peel was devoid of the traditional female stereotypes that permeate the airwaves always in need of rescue and if not are total cartoons.

It was never the same after Rigg left the show in 1967 to pursue other interests particularly ending up as the wife of James Bond 007 in \"Her Majesty's Secret Service\" with George Lazenby(1969),and hosting a mystery show on Public Television Stations here in the states.<br/><br/>Interesting Note: They made a movie based on this as well with Ralph Finnes, and Uma Thurman that somewhat didn't fair with the public,but as for the TV series is concern..it was one of the best international hits ever devised and its still on the air in repeats!!", "rating": null, "helpful": "4 out of 4 found this helpful.", "date": "14 June 2000"}, {"title": " Despite Great Actress Talent Beauties, Steed Is Really the Star!", "content": "Started loving the show as a kid in the 1990s, teenager when the show was on the A&amp;E(Arts &amp; Entertainment) Network.

MacNee is John Steed, the proper gentleman in bowler hat, wielding his deadly brolly. His character and appearance are perfect for a vehicle like this. It isn't so much that he was never nonplussed, so much as that he was always plussed. Rigg is Emma Peel in her jump suits, zippered up front, with that tantalizing, over-sized ring dangling from the zipper just below her sternoclavicular notch. Diana Rigg has a curious beauty. She sports a pair of wide-set eyes, elevated cheekbones, a perfunctory nose and tiny lips, like a Hentai cartoon. She's a good actress too. Did a fine job as one of the bad daughters in Lawrence Olivier's TV production of \"King Lear.\" She was so popular at the time she left this series that she was whisked off to Broadway for \"Abelard and Heloise,\" which included a topless scene. I understand the theater was jammed, but then the story has always been immensely popular with the masses. There are Abelard and Heloise fan clubs in every dusty little town in the world.<br/><br/>The two of them work off each other very well, whether popping the cork of a champagne bottle or fending off evildoers. Their, um, relationship is never fully explained. They both work for some ultra-secret British government organization apparently. Each show opens with Mrs. Peel uncovering a message from Steed, coyly hidden in a box of chocolate or under some peeling wallpaper -- \"Mrs. Peel. We're needed.\" The forces they battle are absurd. Some fantastic organization is breeding a horde of robotic soldiers in a vast, excavated place under a cemetery, and they plan to emerge and take over the British Isles. Or another cabal -- P.U.R.R. -- has invented a device that turns ordinary pussy cats into demonic, homicidal beasts that will be used to eliminate the world's leaders so that P.U.R.R. can take over. Somebody is always trying to take over the world. And Steed and Mrs. Peel are always there to thwart their plans.<br/><br/>It isn't broad comedy. A viewer is more likely to smile than laugh out loud. But the scripts are quietly witty and suggestive. The episode about felines -- \"The Hidden Tiger\" -- has an uncountable number of references and puns on the subject. P.U.R.R. is run by a Mr. Cheshire. (Cheshire cat, get it? \"Alice in Wonderland\"?) The manager's name is Mr. Manx. Too many puns on pussies and cats to enumerate, but the last word spoken in the episode is \"cat-astrophe.\" The fashion is that of Britain in the period of the early Beatles, and Carnaby Street, and the general sense conveyed is that of a loose-limbed freedom from earlier conventions. Nothing is taken seriously. If a man drops dead in front of Steed and Mrs. Peel, they kneel down, check his pulse, and look at each other with a slight, quizzical frown.<br/><br/>The plots are convoluted, and it's easy to lose track of what's going on. At times, one's mind drifts. A series like this must walk a tightrope. \"Whimsy\" can too easily slip into \"cute\" or, worse, the abyssal \"silly.\" But the plot is never very important anyway.<br/><br/>Everything is handled with style and panache. Bowler-hatted or coiffed auburn, these episodes are heads and shoulders above most of the junk that fill the TV screens today.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "5 out of 6 found this helpful.", "date": "24 August 2008"}, {"title": " Mrs Peel-we're needed!", "content": "Ah, Steed and Mrs. Peel, the coolest couple on TV. From their elegant and stylish clothes, to their charm and wit; the skilled professional and the talented amateur thrilled us every week. The series combined imagination, thrills, action, sophistication, and wit into an unbeatable package.<br/><br/>Patrick MacNee was the linchpin of the series. He was there from the beginning and made the show what it was. He exuded charm and sophistication, with a devilish twinkle in his eye. MacNee played it straight, but always kept a smile on his face to let you know he didn't take it too seriously. He developed new relationships with each partner, creating a new chemistry each time. He also set a style that was counter to the counter-culture, without seeming outdated.<br/><br/>Diana Rigg was the marvelous Mrs. Emma Peel, a stunning combination of beauty and brains, who could also knock the bejesus out of the bad guys. She spawned more than a few kinky fantasies with her leather wardrobe and fisticuffs, not to mention her penchant for ending up in a bind. Ms. Rigg was an actress of the first level and brought strong performance to the role. She was adept at both the comedy and the drama, and a deft hand at the stuntwork; well, for the amount not done by Cyd Child and the other team members. Her presence was sorely missed in the later series.<br/><br/>Linda Thorson came on board as Mrs. Peel's replacement. She had a tough job from the beginning; no one could easily follow Diana Rigg. Although she was a bit stiff at first, she improved as time went on and developed a strong chemistry with Steed. Where there was a hint of a deeper relationship between Steed and Peel, it was obvious that Tara King worshiped Steed. The hints were closer to statements here. Tara was more inexperienced, matching Ms. Thorson's own skills, but she got there in the end. Her tenure was diluted by weaker scripts and less dazzling costumes. She didn't have Ms. Rigg's figure, but her clothes could have been improved.<br/><br/>Patrick Newell made a great addition in the Tara King series, moving up from bit player to become Mother, Steed and King's boss. He was pompous and grumpy and completely eccentric; perfect for the series. His office seemed to move around more than M and Q, in the Bond series. My favorite was the top deck of a bus, in \"False Witness.\" He was accompanied by his amazonian aide, Rhonda, who combined looks with a strong physical presence.<br/><br/>I never got to see more than a handful of Cathy Gale episodes, so I can't really comment on the series, except that those few left me cold. The studio staging and video recording detracted from the excitement. Perhaps I just haven't seen enough episodes to fully appreciate these series. I know that Honor Blackman set the standard for the women who followed.<br/><br/>The Avengers was great fun, with action and thrills working alongside comedy and the surreal. Some episodes were a bit slow and some had absurd plots, but even they had an element of fun. The best episodes featured wonderful characters and bizarre plans, combined with deft wit and charm. Those episodes never grow tiresome with repeated viewing. Some of my personal favorites are: The Gravediggers, The Cybernauts and Return of the Cybernauts, Girl from A.U.N.T.I.E., Quick-Quick Slow Death, A Touch of Brimstone, The Living Dead, Epic, The Forget-Me-Knot, Game, False Witness, and Have Guns..Will Haggle.<br/><br/>When it came time for a long-discussed movie, the audience was kicked in the teeth. Instead of our favorite John Steed and Mrs Peel, we were given the Bizarro World versions, bereft of charm and style, and nary an ounce of wit.<br/><br/>Watching it, I was sure the screenwriter and director had been watching The Prisoner instead of The Avengers. It was cold and bizarre, not warm and charming. Had they meant to do The Prisoner, the still missed the boat, as it's intelligence was not to be found either. It was an abysmal failure. Patrick MacNee was a genius for keeping his face off the screen, so that he emerged from this mess with his dignity intact. You just can't remake a classic.<br/><br/>Bravo to A&amp;E for bringing the entire series (except the Ian Hendry years) to DVD. The only quibble is the lack of extra features. A documentary would have been nice, commentaries would have been fantastic.

Linda Thorson is okay as Tara, but during her run on the show as Steed's partner, she pretty much played the young damsel in distress, unlike Emma who would probably beat the living daylights out of anyone who was threatening her.

Johnathan Harris was the villain we loved to hate as he became of another of the screen's most versatile character actors. The man showed great talent arguing with an inanimate prop and making it the hero of the show. The unnamed robot, ironically, became more dimensionally than anyone else in the show, and forget Mary Anne vs. Ginger, how many guys had crushes on Penny Robinson than on Judy ? Penny was the adorable ingenue next to the obvious Hollywood presence of Marta Kristen, the first Marilyn Monroe of the galaxy. John and June Robinson, however, slowly became less the leaders and heros of the series as they became closer to Ward and June Cleaver as they spilled out parental advice and punishments. Don West, however, remained mostly the same character without any developments in his character and past, but that can be directly blamed on the series focus between Will, the Robot and Dr. Smith while everyone else became just a little bit more than supporting roles.

It's pretty easy, because each season was very different from the others. The familiar characters included the Robinson family (John, Maureen, Judy, Penny, and precocious Will), the testy, short-tempered space pilot (Major Don West, played by Mark Goddard), the sinister, cowardly stowaway (Dr. Smith, played to perfection by Jonathan Harris), and of course the ship's robot, played by diminutive actor Bob May. The entire group took off in their ship Jupiter 2, and promptly got\u0085well, lost in space.<br/><br/>The first season (1965-66) was in B&amp;W and was very dark and serious in tone. There were several very good guest stars (including Michael Rennie, Warren Oates, Kurt Russell, and others), decent special effects, and sober story lines. The first season also had a very subtle love affair between Judy (Marta Kristen) and Major West. Still, the first season, though well done, was pretty boring. How many times can Guy Williams fly around with that jet pack? <br/><br/>The second season (1966-67) was in color and was markedly lighter and sillier in tone. The infuriating thing about this season was that the Jupiter 2 seemed never to leave the ground! Many of the season's stories never really went anywhere, nor did they make much sense. There were lots of colorful characters and absurd situations, with a few standout episodes, including my all-time favorite \"Trip Through the Robot\".<br/><br/>The third season (1967-68) left all logic and coherence behind, emphasizing silly situations with Will (Billy Mumy) and Dr. Smith always in peril. This is my favorite season, since the stories are mostly so absurd that there's no way to take them seriously. The series' nadir was no doubt \"The Great Vegetable Rebellion\", in which a giant carrot terrorizes the giggling cast. However, this season also included \"The Anti-Matter Man\", which was imaginative, dark, and very disturbing at times.<br/><br/>With \"Lost in Space\", I suppose you either love it or hate it.

This was a warm and caring family, and I liked that more then some of the silly plots. <br/><br/>That's not to say that I didn't like the plots: often they were silly and made me laugh-- probably when they were trying to be serious, and made more so by the limited budgets and special effects of the '60s.

From when I was very young when Mr. Keema scared me when he revealed himself, to rediscovering it in the late 80's to watching it now for the memories, the show has always entertained me. At my younger age, I loved Season 2. As a teen, I loved Season 3 and now, I find that Season 1 was simply the best. On a whole, the series is a classic.<br/><br/>Season 1 opens with 5 dramatic and suspenseful episodes that rival some of the best sci-fi / adventure stories out there. While this isn't \"good\" science, it is fun. Despite a road bump with \"Welcome, Stranger\", the first half of Season 1 was very dramatic in its impact. The family had to find food, shelter, water at the same time as battling the unknown and sometimes hostile creatures. Then, the show takes a lurching turn with The Sky Pirate and rarely looks back. From that point on, the focus of the show was \"comedic villain\" of the week and how Will, Smith and the Robot deal with plot. Despite the format change, the remaining first season episodes still had a lot of charm and excitement to them.<br/><br/>Season 2 picks right up where Season 1 ended, by keeping the \"comedic villain\" of the week. Despite a 3 episode stretch where you can feel a return to pure adventure, it takes the \"comedic villain\" of the week formula and adds on farce.<br/><br/>Adventure was at the forefront of Season 2. The opening episode, Blast of Into Space is an episode that rids us of the villain early to focus once again on the plight of their situation. \"Wild Adventure\", the best of Season 2 and one of the strongest of the series, is a great space bound adventure getting them close to Earth.<br/><br/>From the middle of Forbidden World on, the adventure element was nearly gone and we had fun, comical episodes. The first half of Season 2 is arguably the best. \"Prisoners of Space\" gave us a break from the visiting villain and while a flashback show, it was fairly riveting for the series. After that, we enter a stretch of bland yet still entertaining episodes. \"The Golden Man\" featured horrible masks and beach ball bombs but it was one of the stronger shows of the season.<br/><br/>The 2nd 1/2 of the season features 4 stinkers yet in their own way, they are charming. From \"The Questing Beat\" through \"The Space Vikings\", we are treated to space fantasy at its most absurd. \"The Cave of The Wizards\" features some genuine emotion from Smith toward his feelings for the Robinsons and a teaser about a possible lift off from the planet. And two great Robot episodes, \"Trip Through the Robot\" and \"The Mechanical Men\".<br/><br/>Season 3 of Lost in Space had a very ambitious start. You could feel the excitement of the new direction the show tried early in this season. From the exciting and grand new theme to actually going into space more often, Season 3 did start out very well.<br/><br/>The third season features some of the best episodes of the third season and a few approach the best or at least the most ambitious of the entire series. We start out with the action packed \"Condemned of Space\" where we see the Robinson's lift off, dodge a comet, loose the Robot in Space and come across a frozen prison. We move on to \"A Visit to a Hostile Planet\" where we feature one of the best of the series (though logic is out the window) where our crew returns to Earth of the Past. And even when stuck on a planet for a while, they to attempt new fresh ideas, most notably some bonding between Don and Smith in \"Space Primevals.\" Bad creature effects aside, \"Space Creature\" gave us one of the deepest Lost in Space episodes to date.<br/><br/>It would seem that toward the middle of season 3, that the writers milked all they could out of the return to action and adventure and had to settle back to farcical fantasy and the results not very good. We get three episodes in a row that pretty much sign the death certificate of the entire series; \"A Day at the Zoo\", \"Two Weeks in Space\" which features the Jupiter 2 as a resort for fugitive aliens, complete with a cash register and badminton equipment, and \"Castles in Space. If it weren't for the excellent \"The Anti-Matter Man\", the show could have ended there.<br/><br/>The final stretch of the Lost in Space series is definitely schizophrenic. We get the excellent \"Target: Earth\" where a group of uniform creatures want to learn to be individuals. Then we lurch over to \"Princess of Space\". Later we get \"The Flaming Planet\" had a decent story but the subplot about the radioactive plant was enough to curdle lunch milk a million miles away. \"Fugitives in Space\" was a different episode that actually felt fresh, despite the weird court they had. Enough has been said about the \"Talking Carrot\", so we won't even go there. And because of \"bad behavior\" from the filming of that episode, we rarely see Guy Williams or June Lockheart this season.\" The Promised Planet\" is far from the best ever but it is one of my favorites mainly due to the absurdity of it all.<br/><br/>Could the series have been renewed for a 4th season?

It was truly a unique decade for television. Series produced then are totally unlike anything produced previously or since. I don't know what it was (perhaps someone spiked the water back then), but TV in the 1960s was unique. There was a certain sense of wonder, a certain sense of the fantastic---and a definite 60s vibe of surrealism that crept into every show from \"Green Acres\" to \"Batman\" to \"Gilligan's Island.\" <br/><br/>And for my money, the best show in TV's greatest decade was \"Lost in Space.\" It's impossible to describe what watching this show was like in the 1960s. It's an experience that simply can't be re-produced today. For a start, America was still an optimistic nation and we had an ambitious space program that would soon take us to the moon. For everyone who was young in the 60s, it seemed highly plausible that, we too, would get a chance to ride a rocket into space within our lifetimes. Little could we fathom that, after 1972, America wouldn't even land a person on the moon for 35 long years.<br/><br/>Today's TV shows are stiflingly dull and seem to be created by committees that cynically use focus groups to create their sterile product. \"Lost in Space\" is a million miles away from this creative process. In fact, it's the total opposite (and all the more brilliant for this).<br/><br/>The greatest science fiction always had a sense of wonder and mystery. \"Lost in Space\" captured the mystery of space---indeed, the show itself was actually quite bizarre. It's a far cry from the over-rated \"Star Trek,\" which, instead of giving us a sense of mystery, followed an (increasingly stale) by-the-numbers formula.<br/><br/>And \"formula\" is precisely what one did NOT get in viewing \"Lost in Space.\" Indeed, this show is so strange that, viewing it today, it seems like a relic from a lost civilization. It's hard, in fact, to really even fathom who the producers were targeting as their audience.<br/><br/>Naturally, there are cynics who hate this show, and fall over themselves pointing out the plot holes and the ignorance of \"realism.\" To those folks, I say: Chill out. Even TV's \"realistic\" shows are NOT as realistic as they hyped to be. \"Star Trek,\" for example, has plenty of flaws in its science. Even a highly-praised show like \"ER,\" the medical drama, has plenty of inaccuracies (as any medical professional will tell you).<br/><br/>In many ways, \"Lost in Space\" does a wonderful job of capturing the essence of what made the 60s the greatest decade of the 20th century for TV, film, music, and culture in general. It's something we'll never re-capture in today's stale culture, dominated as it is by dull, overpaid celebrities.

First off, it was creator-producer-director Irwin Allen's second television series after the phenomenal success of \"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea\",and his first weekly television series for CBS. \"Lost In Space\" was the first big-budget, prime-time science fiction/fantasy action-adventure series for television that originally aired on its Wednesday night time slot in prime-time. \"Lost In Space\" ran for three seasons airing from September 15, 1965 until March 6, 1968 producing 83 episodes. Only the first season was in black and white producing 29 episodes that ran from September 15, 1965 until April 27,1966. The next two seasons of the series produced 54 episodes in color(Season 2 consisting of 30 episodes and the third and final season 24 episodes)that ran from September 14, 1966 until March 6, 1968 for Irwin Allen Productions/Twentieth Century-Fox Television and the CBS Television Network.<br/><br/>\"Lost In Space\" had a top-cast of well known and respected actors that included Guy Williams(\"The Legend of Zorro\"), June Lockhart(\"Timmy and Lassie\"),Jonathan Harris(\"The Third Man\",and \"The Bill Dana Show\"), Mark Goddard(\"Robert Taylor's The Detectives\",and \"Johnny Ringo\")and Marta Kristen(\"The Man From UNCLE\"),and two of the best child actors of the era Billy Mumy(\"The Twilight Zone\"),and Angela Cartwright(\"Make Room For Daddy\").Throughout it's impressive three season run and 83 episodes(more episodes than Star Trek on NBC)it was usually the highest- rated show in its time slot(going up against NBC's The Virginian and usually coming in neck to neck with Batman on ABC,believe it or not). The series boasted top name writers for some of the episodes ranging from Peter Packer to Carey Wilbur, Barney Slater, William Welch, Allen Balter, Jack Turley, Robert and Wanda Duncan, Herman Groves, Irwin Allen, and William Read- Woodfield. Top name directors ranging from Don Richardson, Sobey Martin, Nathan Juran, Ezra Stone, Harry Harris, Sutton Roley, Jus Addiss, to Leo Penn, Irving J. Moore, Leonard Horn, Alvin Ganzer, Paul Stanley, and Alexander Singer.<br/><br/>Big name guest stars ranging from Albert Salmi, Michael Rennie, Kurt Russell, Warren Oates, Michael J.

Travanti, Arte Johnson, Alan Hewitt, Lyle Waggoner, Al Lewis, and Richard Basehart. Spectacular art direction by William Creber(of Fantastic Voyage and Planet of the Apes),make-up by John Chambers(Planet of the Apes),and an iconic Robot designed by Robert Kinoshita(Forbidden Planet and Fantastic Voyage),and ultra-cool theme songs and music by John Williams(of Star Wars and Jaws fame). It had alien chimps(Debbie the Bloop in Season 1),one-eyed cyclopeses,and even talking carrots. What made the series stand out was it's cliffhangers during the first 2 seasons with the family facing constant peril and danger where it left viewers in suspense(\"To Be Continue...NEXT WEEK...Same Time, Same Channel)until the next episode and so much more. The format cliffhangers from the first 2 seasons would change over by the show's third and final season.<br/><br/>Getting to the episodes and let me say that the show's first season opens with five dramatic and suspenseful episodes that rival some of the best science fiction stories out there ranging from the pilot episode \"The Reluctant Stowaway\" to \"The Derelict\".

I was in second grade when this show premiered, and I never missed an episode. The stories were always interesting to me, and even at age eight the character of Dr. Smith absolutely captured my imagination. There are aspects of this fellow that are so very interesting - here is a guy with a great deal of education who never seems to have learned anything from the mythology he is always reciting to everyone, as in \"All That Glitters\", my all-time favorite episode. He didn't remember the tragedy of King Midas when he was making his wish? His greed and his cowardice override any mental advantage he may have. He is truly the George Costanza of space exploration - whenever he stumbles upon a piece of good fortune he has to milk it for all it's worth until the whole situation turns on him. Then there are the children - Will and Penny. No matter what Dr. Smith does they still like the guy, and he does a lot. He bargains with aliens to take Will's brain for their experiments instead of his, and in another episode turns Penny into platinum, although he does feel remorse about the latter deed. In fact, the children are Smith's only friends. He is merely tolerated by the adults, and for good reason.<br/><br/>Finally there is the \"innocence and chastity beyond reason\" element that was part of Gilligan's Island and is part of this show too. Despite the only natural and healthy attraction between Major Donald West and Judy Robinson, we are to believe that nothing really happens between the two for years on end. Also like Gilligan's Island, although the group's first priority starts off as finding a way to return to earth, eventually they settle into a kind of domestic tranquility and seem to make peace with their situation of being \"lost in space\".<br/><br/>Of course, rewatching this series over forty years later, it is not quite as great as I remembered it, but it is still great fun and Smith is still a fascinating character. It's also interesting to see what people in the 1960's thought earthly civilization would be like in 1997. It's humorous yet somewhat tragic to see the optimistic viewpoint people had of the future in the 1960's pertaining to human nature. What the series' creators couldn't foresee is that today people are much more like Zachary Smith than the Robinson family - at least the people in charge of things are.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "12 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "23 November 2014"}, {"title": " Even though dated still a lot of campy fun", "content": "Watched this show growing up together with flipper and other great classics.

They have to be careful in their weekly dealings with aliens since some of them belie their intentions, often hiding malicious plans in store for the small Earthling party lost in space.

It is a classic piece of family entertainment about a family, friendship, love, adventure, cowardice, sabotage, betrayal, and endurance. Some of the characters return to Earth just a few times throughout the series, but circumstances require them to leave soon after their arrival. They never make it to their original destination, the star system of Alpha Centauri, or back home to Earth for good.

Starting out as a straight adventure tale of survival for a family of space travelers after their craft crash lands on an alien world, the show quickly moved into comic camp, heightened by the over-the-top performance of Jonathan Harris as \"Dr. Smith\", and then developed an odd blend of farce and fantasy in its third and final season.<br/><br/>It's no wonder than the show has an equal amount of defenders and critics.<br/><br/>The first black and white season, as mentioned earlier, is arguably its best, featuring its strongest episodes that showcased the performers to the best of its ability, based on the story lines. The rarely-seen pilot (\"No Place to Hide\") sold the show with its state-of-the art special effects, the brilliant use of Bernard Herrmann music (borrowed liberally from the composer's music for the classic \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\") and its ingenious casting of former \"Zorro\" Guy Williams, \"Lassie\" mom June Lockhart, television and movie darling Angela Cartwright, and Billy Mumy, who had appeared in film and a memorable \"Twilight Zone\" episode. Noticeably absent were Dr. Smith and the Robot, who were added to the cast on the suggestion of studio officials and sponsors.<br/><br/>Also, the pilot reveals that Maureen (Lockhart) was a notable doctor in her own right, but the series never made reference to that, relegating her to a \"cookie-baking\" mom. Even Judy (Marta Kristen) was supposed to be an aspiring actress that put her career on hold to make the ill-fated space voyage.<br/><br/>Obviously, Allen and company didn't know what to do with \"strong women\".<br/><br/>Besides the pilot, which would be used to form the basis for the first five episodes of the new season, there were some other standout installments. \"Invaders from the Fifth Dimension\" features some truly creepy aliens and a wonderful exchange between the Robot and Maureen. Also, the installment allows the viewer to see how really sinister Dr. Smith could be.<br/><br/>Angela Cartwright (Penny) would be showcased in \"My Friend, Mr. Nobody,\" featuring a brilliant John Williams' score, and \"The Magic Mirror,\" co-starring a young pre-\"Bonnie and Clyde\" Michael J. Pollard. Even the seldom-used Judy (Kristen) gets an episode, \"Attack of the Monster Plants.\" A boyish Kurt Russel would land in \"The Challenge\" and a strange homage to the popular \"Beverly Hillbillies\" would be played out in \"The Space Croppers, featuring a great turn from Academy Award-winner Mercedes McCambridge.<br/><br/>The season also features the best in the series: the only two-parter, \"The Keeper,\" guest-starring Michael Rennie, star of the aforementioned \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\". The production staff pulled out all the stops with several stunning scenes, concluding with a fight with a giant spider.<br/><br/>The final installment of the season was \"Follow the Leader\" wherein John is possessed by an alien spirit that makes life truly miserable for the Robinson family. Williams gets to again show his physical skills in a tense duel with Don (Mark Goddard).<br/><br/>Though the second season would be the series' first in color, it also would be its silliest, with many of the episodes unbearably awful in their execution. There were genies, Vikings, dragons, pirates, and enough silver-faced aliens to start a cosmetics firm. Even with this barrage of silliness, there were a few commendable episodes: \"Blast Off Into Space\", the first of the season with a good performance from guest Strother Martin and some great pyrotechnics; \"The Golden Man,\" a Penny-inspired episode that involves a war between two alien species; \"Cave of the Wizards\" wherein Dr. Smith is taken over by an alien computer; \"Trip Through the Robot,\" an interesting journey as Will and Dr. Smith must restore the Robot to normal size after a mysterious gas has caused the machine to grow enormously; \"The Astral Traveler\" returns Will to Earth and the boy finds himself in a haunted castle' and screen veteran John Carradine appears in the season-ending \"The Galaxy Gift\", an episode that also marks the return of the black-faced aliens, seen in the earlier \"Wreck of the Robot\".<br/><br/>Based on cast complaints, the third season would be an unbalanced one, trying to blend the first season adventure with the second season camp, making for a truly schizophrenic blend. While there were commendable episodes as \"The Anti-Matter Man,\" \"Space Creature,\" \"Hunter's Moon,\" the popular \"Visit to a Hostile Planet,\" \"Target: Earth,\" and \"Time Merchant,\" there were turkeys like \"A Day at the Zoo,\" \"Collision of Planets\" and the politically-INCORRECT \"Castles in Space.\" Season three also had the infamous \"The Great Vegetable Rebellion\".<br/><br/>All in all, however, \"Lost in Space,\" though not one of the great television shows, still ranks as one of the most memorable, for all its pros and cons.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "14 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "9 September 2006"}, {"title": " Best Science Fiction Series of All Time", "content": "This sci-fi adventure series was \"Bold in concept, Brilliant in execution\". From the Robinson's departure from Earth to their encounter with the Junkman I was kept on the edge of my seat.  Virtually every episode had some great moments.  Among my least favorites are: Space Vikings (however, this one did have good special effects), Space Beauty, 2 Weeks in Space, and A Day At The Zoo.  The rest are top rate -they dealt with such topics as: time travel, environmental problems one may encounter on alien worlds, cryogenics, matter transfer, espionage, sabotage, national security, and human survival issues.  What also remained intriguing was the fact that the greatest danger they faced came from within - namely, Dr. Smith.  Why they didn't \"kill him\" is obvious - they couldn't bring civilization to the stars starting with the uncivilized act of murder (not to say that it never crossed anybody's mind). Cool special effects and equipment were: lazer battles (and their weapons), explosions, flying belts, the force field, weather stations, the Jupiter 2, the robot, and the charriot. I too, like many people, wish that \"Lost In Space\" would have remained a more serious science fiction epic, but the 2nd and 3rd seasons did produce some outstanding episodes like: Blast of into Space, Wreck of the Robot, Collision of Planets, The Colonists, Space Creature, The Anti-Matter Man, Hunter's Moon, and Visit to a Hostile Planet. Jonathan Harris' decision to make Dr. Smith a more comedic villian may have been more fun for him, but I think it would have been better if he had remained the evil agent he started out being (but there were some humorous moments between him, the robot, and Will).  When I was a kid I attributed to this change in character to a complete mental breakdown due to the stress and strain of isolation in space (of course he was crazy from the beginning and it wouldn't require a lot for him to snap). Even though people remember Smith, the robot, Will, and their relationship the best, there were plenty of episodes where the main focus was the Robinson family as a whole and their plight.  Guy Williams was among my favorites and I always looked up to him.  He was my hero in this show. There is no comparison between LIS and Star Trek.

I have always found the images of the Jupiter II heading for a crash landing on the next hostile planet haunting and beautiful. John Williams' scores are sublime, ranging from beautiful (\"My Friend Mr. Nobody\") to chilling (\"Follow The Leader\"/\"The Anti-Matter Man\"). There were so many amazing episodes that truly fired the imagination and instilled a true sense of wonder in us all. I will never forget Will Robinson taking a time machine back to Earth where he is deposited on a snowy roof. I will always love and be haunted by the screeching of the monster Angus as he chased our heroes through an old Scottish castle (\"The Astral Traveller\") surrounded by the darkest, murkiest sea. I have forever been haunted by the black, sequin-faced, robot-like denizens of a fake town who mumbled \"We want the mechanical man...\" I always weep when Smith gains a skullcap and loses the last of his human qualities and becomes part of an alien machine.

In the first season, when it was in black &amp; white, it was ridiculous and unbelievable. In its second and third seasons, it was ridiculous and amusing, in a cubist sort of way.<br/><br/>LOST IN SPACE was originally intended (to use programming parlance) to be \"Swiss Family Robinson in Space.\" Schlockmeister Irwin Allen got the idea to send a typical American family into space, but get them lost on a deserted planet. CBS bought the show and took it into production.<br/><br/>Soon afterward, the show received a lucky break when another writer- producer sent them a proposal for a show he described as \"Wagon Train to the Stars.\" CBS read the pitch and pulled Gene Roddenberry into a lengthy meeting, where they asked questions about what the ship should look like, what type of music to use and stories he might run.<br/><br/>Among other things, Roddenberry told CBS that his music would probably borrow from Bernard Herrman's score for THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL and his ship might be based on something like the United Planets Cruiser C57-D in FORBIDDEN PLANET.<br/><br/>CBS thanked him for coming in and explained that they already had a show they liked better (their show had kids). But LOST IN SPACE took Roddenberry's advice about Herrmann's music, and borrowed the look of the ship (and, soon, another element) from the 1956 movie.<br/><br/>The show hit a bump when the original pilot, which showed the ship getting lost due to mechanical failure, was rejected. In the 19690's, the US was trying to beat the commies to the moon, so you DID NOT make a TV show that even hinted our rockets might have ANY problems.<br/><br/>Allen's solution? Make the cause a saboteur hired by a foreign government.

But it was too dark for a 60's show aimed partly at kids, so the show asked the audience to believe that members of a government mission-- which had been successfully sabotaged-- would bring the saboteur along, trust him and take risks to save him.<br/><br/>The show got abysmal reviews and wasn't very popular-- and by the middle of season one, it had exhausted both Roddenberry's ideas and the limited vein of creativity of its staff.

Even six-year-olds realize that won't happen.)<br/><br/>Looking for a fix, someone noticed that LOST IN SPACE was about a group of people trying to get home-- and CBS already had a hit show about a group of people in pretty much the same fix.<br/><br/>So the evil Dr. Smith got turned into the intergalactic Willy Gilligan, the Robot became Jonas Grumby, John Robinson the brilliant scientist became Roy Hinkley-- and the show became \"Cretin's Island In Space.\" The three women and extra man got swept aside as SMith, the robot and the cute kid had adventures.

At some point, you began making fun of the idiotic premises and stupid plots while being amused by the comedic performances and campy one-liners. In effect, it was like watching MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER. <br/><br/>And some of it grew on us. If my brother doesn't want to throw something fundamentally worthless away, he \"My cosmonium-- never!\" (Episode 30) I wakened my college roommate by saying \"Get up little master!\" and pumping my foot up and down on the bed like the space hippies drilling in #68. <br/><br/>When I wanted my brother to sell me some stereo stuff, I brought him a plate of plate of beef stroganoff (Dr Smith trades the ship's control system for this in #83). When he wants a beer, he says \"Moisture! I need Moisture!!\" (as the giant talking carrot does in #82).

Most kids my age just loved the show and I think this was due to the quality of the ensemble cast and their amazing talents, especially Jonathan Harris and Billy Mumy.

But in the case of \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" I will make an exception. This is because of one character: Jed Clampett, played by Buddy Ebsen. Jed Clampett is one of the most endearing yet complex characters ever created by the television industry. Superficially, Jed Clamptett doesn't seem to be the type of character that warrants much serious attention. After all he's just a simple, uneducated backwoodsman from the hills who's lived in a shack all of his life, and by pure dumb luck comes into a pile of money which doesn't seem to change him one bit. Which is what makes Jed Clampett such a wonderful character. For Jed Clampett has dignity and integrity and nothing will divert Mr. Clampett from remaining true to himself or altering the way he treats everyone - with openness, honesty and a real desire to be hospitable. Further, Jed Clampett commands respect, and is respected, not only by his immediate family who are utterly devoted to him, but even by that crass and conniving banker who, despite his air of superiority, reveals, episode after episode, what a buffoon he is compared to the calm and self-assured Mr. Clampett. Also, it should be noted the Jed Clampett protects and cares for not only his daughter, but his nephew and mother-in-law, the latter two a constant challenge to Jed's patience, which he never loses.

It surely stands among the best of its genre. The series revolves around the sidesplitting culture clash that ensues when the country bumpkin Clampett family moves to Beverly Hills after father, Jed Clampett, stumbles upon oil on his land and becomes a multi millionaire. The rest of the family joining him at their new Beverly Hills mansion include Jed's mother-in-law Granny, pretty daughter Elly May, and nephew Jethro Bodine.<br/><br/>The Clampetts are of course...something else...as they enter this alien world, where their mansion has every luxury imaginable including a cement pond. The superstitious &amp; feisty Granny makes certain her kin always have lots of vittles, especially such delicacies as hog jowls and possum belly. She hangs out her shingle for the purpose of imparting her unique brand of down home doctoring &amp; dentistry, and firmly believes that the South won (or at least is winning) the Civil War. Much of her time is spent chasing her great nephew, Jethro, out of her kitchen with a broom, trying to curtail his endless appetite. The dim witted Jethro is a scheming would be playboy, who's all proud that he graduated sixth grade and can cipher. Jed's sweet, innocent, &amp; beautiful daughter, Elly May, has a penchant for critters, including a pet chimpanzee named Bessie. Granny is terrified that Elly's destined to become an old maid, as alas, she's still unwed at the ripe old age of eighteen. Much of Granny's energy is put into seeking out suitable beaux, although any courtin' &amp; sparkin' in the Clampett parlour must be suitably chaperoned (or rather, cheered on) by spying through the closed door's keyhole.<br/><br/>The gem of the series is Jed, around whose unfailing integrity this ongoing saga revolves. He always seems blissfully unaware that he's wealthy, feels and acts no differently than he did back in the hills, and treats everyone the same (whether rich or poor). He gives generously to country folk and city slickers alike, is equally kind to both neighbours and total strangers...all the while dealing with the crazy antics of both Granny and Jethro and seeing to the lovely &amp; rich Elly's various suitors, not all of whom have the most honourable of intentions. As another commented, if only everyone was like Jed Clampett! <br/><br/>In dramatic contrast to these hillbillies are the wealthy and status conscious Beverly Hills citizenry, as personified by Jed's banker, Mr. Drysdale, whose life revolves around maintaining the favour of his bank's main customer, Mr. Clampett, and protecting that thirty million dollars (or whatever the figure). His wife, Mrs. Drysdale, is a superficial &amp; snooty dame who comes into frequent conflict with her neighbour, Granny. Jane Hathaway is Mr. Drysdale's very properly spinsterish but man hunting and bird watching secretary. She is the constant victim of her boss's greedy schemes and actually becomes quite a genuine friend to the Clampetts.<br/><br/>The actors are all stellar in their roles...Irene Ryan (Granny), Donna Douglas (Elly May), Max Baer Jr. (Jethro), Raymond Bailey (Mr. Drysdale), Nancy Kulp (Miss Hathaway), and especially the wonderful Buddy Ebsen (Jed).<br/><br/>It's a hilarious and side splitting romp, each episode funnier than the last. Through it all, Jed's integrity and honesty always shine through. The humble and good hearted neighbourliness of the Clampetts stands in sharp contrast to their affluent environment. It's Jed Clampett's desire for the simple pleasures of home, family, friends, and hard honest work versus Milburn Drysdale's blatant materialism. Every viewer realizes that, despite all the absurdity and the utterly ridiculous scenarios, the Clampetts know exactly what's important in life and that this family of uprooted hillbillies has a real life lesson to teach us all.<br/><br/>If only there were more TV shows like it today!

Contrary to what some reviewers here have said, the Clampetts always seem to come out on top of every situation by simply being themselves. If that means they're stupid and backwards, then I'd rather be that than something else. By being themselves, decent and simple, they unintentionally expose everyone else's agenda's, phoniness, and crookedness, whether it's Mr. Drysdale's love affair with Clampett money or just some interloper trying to seduce Elly Mae, or whatever. I also find their unabashed Southern pride to be refreshing in today's stifled and overly-militant PC world. Again, they're simply being themselves. Maybe it helped that Irene Ryan was from Texas, Donna Douglas was from Louisiana, and Buddy Ebsen was from rural Illinois.

This one is single, has no children and is much younger.<br/><br/>In the opening episode his sister is murdered; inevitable he sets about finding those responsible. Shortly afterwards he is recruited by a government agency run by Christina Hart. Over the course of the first season this agency tackles various terrorists and villains leading up to a cliff hanger ending where Mills is captured and ends up in a Mexican prison. The second season is almost a whole new show... by the time Mills gets free the agency is no more and Hart is setting up a new private security firm that does similar work. She and Mills are the only characters remaining; they are joined by a Hacker named Kilroy and another operative, Santana. Once again they take on threats to the United States, many involving a shadowy, rival organisation.<br/><br/>I can understand why the creators would want to associate this with the successful films... unfortunately as it has to be toned down for television and clearly doesn't have as large a budget it will draw negative comparisons. This is a pity as it wasn't a bad show. The episodes are mostly of the villain-of-the-week variety but they do provide some solid action in every episode. Clive Standen does an impressive job in the role of Mills and the rest of the cast are pretty good too. The way most of the cast were cleared out at the start of season two was a bit of a surprise to say the least but the new characters did seem more important to the show. One can accept that TV series that are set in global locations won't actually film where they are set but this frequently didn't even try to hide the fact that it was made in Canada but set in the US... at one point Mexican villains supposedly flying from the US to Mexico use a float plane that doesn't only have a Canadian registration; it also has a large maple leaf and the word 'Canada' painted on it!

There were several strong male actors in the 1st season who were replaced by the 2 man/2 woman team in Season 2, I assume for budgeting reasons. It would have been better to kill the show after Season 1 than to dumb it down the way they did.<br/><br/>Season 1 has a love story intertwined. Bryan's love interest simply vanishes between the two seasons, which was horrendous writing. Bryan is pretty boring alone as he's almost robotic at an emotional level (the actor seems like a very nice guy, but he doesn't emote much at all). Lots of sighs and near clinical depression in Season 2, but little passion.<br/><br/>If you saw the movie \"Taken,\" you know that Bryan had a bunch of close friends from his \"old life,\" which is what I suppose this show was trying to reveal to us. The fact that they removed his big group of buddies to trim the budget in season 2 is simply sad. Watch Season 1 and save yourself the time and skip all of Season 2. It's almost all mechanical action sequences with very little heart. There are also some horrific supporting actors in season 2 as well that just make things worse (no names!). They are cookie-cutter bad guys. Laughable really despite the sometimes long and tedious fight scenes.<br/><br/>I love Jessica Beals as a person and way back as the \"Flashdance\" star (amazing), but she's almost stone cold in this one and to me not believable. I believe she was miscast for the role. She's at best passable, which is just not good enough, especially in the setting of the four person team in Season 2.<br/><br/>\"Kilroy\" gets so repetitive in his attitudes, it was difficult to watch his scenes. At the start he was like the tech character in \"Italian Job,\" but a neurotic version of him vs. the bold and out there version in that movie. Guess which one was more interesting to watch? I think Adam Goldberg is a very good actor, but his role became tedious. Characters need to evolve or change to some degree over the course of a series. Let's blame the writer for that.<br/><br/>There is another core flaw in Season 2. How the writer and director theoretically conceived of carrying out anti-terrorist missions with TWO operatives in Season 2 in the first place is beyond comprehension.

A high-class call-girl, Hannah also appears all natural (lack of plastic surgery not abundance of body hair) which makes her appear more normal and likable. She's not a call- girl because of any psychological issues just for the good pay for the little hours, therefore making this show an opportunity for a normal college graduate to love sex, love her job with no shame. Her ex- boyfriend, current best-friend, Ben is the only one outside the business that knows of her ventures.<br/><br/>The sad thing about this show (as I find true of most British shows) is that it's episode to episode. I can watch this show with no urge to find out what happens next episode. This is especially true for the first two seasons, but the third season is an improvement. But still, there is no strong pull. Only sex. Surprisingly the sex is not too soft porn like (unlike The Tutors). It focuses more on the specific tastes and desires of people, from the kinky to the normal.<br/><br/>Hannah, unlike her call-girl counterpart Belle, is less interesting.

No character developments or a care in the world.<br/><br/>Although, Belle is extremely attractive at certain angles in certain outfits and makeup, at other angles she looks like a porn star. Although, her parts look real, they looks artificially exaggerated in certain outfits.

UNLIKE Sex in the City , I do not care for the plot or any of the characters. It's neither pretty nor sophisticated. Hannah is selfish and fails at being vulnerable.

It's not simply the skimpy clothes and raunchy seductive sex scenes, but the confidence of the character, the idea of her being special is always there and Piper never wavers. Her story is wonderfully told and we get an insight into her character through her camera facing turns, giving us her insights into the business and into her emotional connections.<br/><br/>Whilst each season has a serious guy in Belle's life and this can feel slightly mundane at points, its the dirty little secrets of the business you'll be hooked to, exploring the client's fantasises, seeing how the money changes hands, how call girls interact with one another and the fun they have with their clients and the drama that goes alongside the demanding profession.<br/><br/>Some great moments include wrestling turn-ons, movie portrayals, book scripting, fancy dress parties and exploration of various fantasies (fantastic James Bond montage) The diversity of the show is constantly shifting from simple location shots to exploring America to the darkness of clubs and the seedy realism of the human spirit is frequently mesmerizing. The fact the camera shifts from Belle in her moment to her facing the camera and giving us some cheeky quote or divulging some intriguing business information, this invites us right into the story.<br/><br/>But the bottom line is that this is a programme about sex.

There is a lot of nudity, a lot of flirting and innuendos, and graphic bedroom scenes that justify the nature of the industry and indeed, life.

I suppose this would be the book's \"N\". With whom she in the book has long discussions about anal sex and fisting, for example. The series' Ben doesn't even know what she does for a living. <br/><br/>The Belle of the series then is nowhere near the cool, funny, and sexually explosive Belle I've got to know through the book.

The first series follows the trials and tribulations of her life, as she copes with the pressures being a call girl entails whilst dealing with her problems outside of work.<br/><br/>The secret diaries of Belle de Jour, who claimed to be a high class escort in a series of memoirs, has caused a stir for years, with claims she doesn't even really exist or is a secret identity who simply made it all up for publicity. This glossy adaptation of her books also created quite a sensation when it came out, rather too explicit and saucy for terrestrial telly and so confined to the more remote sector of digital TV channel ITV 2. It was even more shocking that former squeaky clean teen pop singer Billie Piper was taking the lead role.<br/><br/>However hard it tried and whatever other pretensions it may have had, whether it liked it or not, the first series almost certainly succeeded more as a piece of seedy voyeurism (watching Billie being a dirty, bad girl!) rather than being an intelligent, sharply written comedy about life in the sex trade. Which is a bit of a shame, since it does succeed at times with some quite funny sitcom moments (including Belle being quite graphically introduced to the joys of being a dominatrix prostitute!) and sharp pieces of comic writing, and this does help it along a lot. Whether it's all just a load of make believe is debatable but the writer of the original source material was definitely a bit fantastical with her claims. I doubt very much that any escort really has an apartment as swanky as Belle's, or lives a life as glamorous and exciting as she makes it out to be. Some abused ex hookers were up in arms about claims the show glamorized prostitution and I can sort of see where they were coming from. I've never known an ex hooker with a traumatic past/experiences but...In the lead role, Piper carries the part with the right amount of class and style, a little bland at times but the role's all hers now. There's some pretty good support too, from Iddo Goldberg as her ex lover/best mate and Cheri Lunghi as her hard faced cow boss, who at 55 still looks incredibly attractive herself as an older woman (could maybe still pull a few punters herself...) <br/><br/>More anticipated as a piece of free porn from ITV 2 (well, about time subscribers got some value for money!) and quite divorced from reality indeed, but not as bad as some might say. ***<br/><br/>SECRET DIARY OF A CALL GIRL-SEASON 2<br/><br/>Belle's still getting by in the world of high class prostitution.

Curious to know what a 'normal life' of dating and relationships would entail, she meets up with him again and becomes close to him. But complications with her work and other aspects of her personal life force her to question what she wants out of and where she's going with her life.<br/><br/>The show obviously garnered enough of an interest on it's limited subscription channel to warrant a second series, and here it is with the original lead star. What's surprising is it's lack of faithfulness to the original's style. Those tuning in for more perverse titillation will be sourly disappointed as the racy sex scenes are kept to a minimum this time round and the series focuses more on the human dramas Belle faces. It plays like a corny daytime soap opera and is all the less interesting for it.

Finally some people who get it", "content": "WKRP is the show that I may have the toughest time reviewing.  I would like to make my love for this show clear without simply stating it was the best show of all time, but there may be no other way.  I Love Lucy, MASH, Cheers, Seinfeld, Mary Tyler Moore, and any other sitcom regarded as classic all pale in comparison to WKRP in Cincinnati.  This show focused on eight characters, rarely devoting too much time to any one individual.  The cast did not change in four years.  They didn't even add anybody for a few episodes to play a love interest or something like that. They didn't have to.  Each one of the eight could have carried the show by themselves.<br/><br/>\nI was born during WKRP's initial run and I have grown up in an era where almost every sitcom is populated by characters whose personality is exaggerated beyond reality, and who can't seem to laugh at anything that doesn't involve sex.  KRP had its share of these types of jokes, but they never dominated the show.  There were rarely any episodes trying to figure out who's dating whom.  There was never a season ending cliffhanger wondering which two characters were going to get together.  In fact, the episodes where this did happen are some of the show's weakest such as Andy's country western girlfriend, and the episode where Johnny stays at Bailey's apartment prompting rumors around the office.  That being said, there is not one single episode of WKRP in Cincinnati that isn't funny.  Even the two I referenced earlier have their moments.<br/><br/>The character development and subtlety of this show is unmatched.  Each character built a relationship with the other seven, and the writers were able to tap into those relationships whenever it was needed.  There are episodes that you have to watch several times to get the full effect of what is going on.  The union episode is one of the best because of the way Andy deals with the other characters, but this is something that goes unnoticed unless you pay attention to all the little details that you can see watching the episode a second time.  Everything down to his wardrobe is just perfectly crafted.  Another great KRP moment comes when station critic Norris Breeze refers to Jennifer as a \"total airhead\" in front of Mama Carlson.  The one person Mrs. Carlson considers her equal, and she is called a \"total airhead.\"  What a great moment.<br/><br/>The final episode ties everything together perfectly. It was not guaranteed at that time whether KRP was returning, so they made an episode that could be the last, but it didn't have to be.  Johnny's explanation of how KRP is supposed to lose money explains why Mrs. Carlson went along with the new format in the first place four years earlier.<br/><br/>There has certainly never been a more socially consious sitcom, and there are many great dramas that didn't deal with as many issues as WKRP.  Every political issue that is important even today is tackled in a KRP episode. Abortion, racism, homosexuality, censorship, unions, alcoholism, drug abuse, and education to name a few.  There are also episodes involving the rich vs. poor, and a classic involving lying, scheming politicians.  I have literally tried to think of an issue that wasn't addressed on WKRP, and I can't do it.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that none of the eight actors ever made a real splash after WKRP.  Tim Reid, Howard Hesseman, and Loni Anderson have had their moments, but none of these actors are considered to be big stars.  For four great years, they created a show that a lot of people missed.

The funniest moments happen when well-defined characters are in unusual situations in which they react as themselves. One of the funniest scenes in \"The Graduate\" is Benjamin Braddock trying to avoid drawing attention to himself when he wants to check into a hotel because he's having an affair. Or when muggers accosting Jack Benny say \"You're gonna give us $10,000, or we're gonna break both your legs\" to which Benny replies, \"Does it have to be both?\" (Benny's character in both his radio and TV shows was that he was stingy and would do anything to avoid giving or paying money.) <br/><br/>WKRP was lucky to have the kind of writers who also understood the power of character to create comedy. The characters of WKRP rarely make self-conscious wise-cracks. Herb Tarlek would sometimes try to be witty but often with catastrophic results. The chemistry that made WKRP work was the writers' understanding of their characters which in turn manifested dialog that appeared spontaneous yet funny. The humor evolved from the characters simply being themselves without the writers having to force jokes into the script. This is the most effective kind of comedy writing in the narrative style but it depends on interesting and quirky characters.<br/><br/>A few quick examples: when Les Nesman is asked what he thinks about radio stations in Cincinatti playing mostly \"rock 'n' roll\" music he replies that \"it must be some sort of conspiratorial plot.\" When a visitor asks to see Mr Carlson (in front of Mr Carlson), Carlson (trying to avoid people in general) replies \"He's dead.\" And when Jennifer the receptionist is asked to do some note-taking and filing she says \"I don't do typing. I don't do filing.

The only two sitcoms that were truly great after that were Cheers and Seinfeld. MASH relied more on the wise-cracks but that was an attribute of Hawkeye's character. (I have never felt the writing in \"Friends\" was that strong relying almost exclusively on wise-cracks rather than situations although it is very popular.) WKRP is one of the few shows that still seems fresh and lively despite having been first broadcast almost 30 years ago.

Now, while it isn't even close to the actual historical Da Vinci, it  doesn't mean that you should write off this series as drab. On the  contrary, there is nothing wrong with basing yourself off history and  build your own story around that. If you want historical accuracy,  please go watch a bloody documentary. If you go into this series  expecting a history lesson (and then complain about the fact that it  isn't), you might as well walk around with a sign reading \"I am an  imbecile\". It is classified and described under the genre \"historical  fantasy\" for a reason.  Further more The setting and the costume works is absolutely beautiful,  showing Florence's extravagance in an exaggerated manner. The CGI, just  like Starz' previous series, Spartacus, was in some places quite  jarring to say the least. A good example of that would be the  helicopter shot near the beginning where guards are marching across a  courtyard. But that is negligible in my personal opinion. While I do  like the more extravagant, arrogant Da Vinci, none the less I find his  performance sub par in certain scenes. Especially those where he is  acting out a scene of pain, or fear. It isn't convincing enough, it is  once again far too exaggerated. But then again, that seems to be the  entire theme of this series. The mythological elements worked into the  series is interesting to me, it adds a magical aura to the storyline,  to the point where it is the the stereotypical thing of \"You are  destined, fate has chosen you.\", which doesn't make it bad, but it  isn't original either.

The writers's biggest mistake in Da Vinci's Demon, increasingly common  in Hollywood films, is to have taken the audience for idiots, showing  total condescension for its ability to think and appreciate challenging  TV. Rather than depicting the fascinating personal life of one of the  greatest minds and artists of all time, they took the route of  presenting Da Vinci as a modern 21st century arrogant know it all  prick. The viewer is now supposedly unable to take an interest in a  main character who is not a moronic pretty boy sleaze bag, who sprouts  anachronistic inanities all day long. I really blame vampire shows and  films for this, notably True Blood and the twilight series; da Vinci  looks and acts like the typical vampire that all teenage girls twists  their panties in a bunch up for: violent, brilliant, mad, metrosexually  good looking, drugged up (whether on blood or other), passionate, not  afraid of death and a touch of superpowers. Make da Vinci realistic?  get a good professional actor, slightly older? No way, that doesn't  sell, the real guy must have being a boring old fart who spent all his  time working or praying. The writers don't realise the joke is on them,  especially if the show gets cancelled, that da Vinci's life was far far  more interesting than these frankly boring and oh-so-familiar story  lines ( guy likes girl of powerful guy, so guy gets closer to powerful  guy to get closer to girl).  But the blame does not only lie with the main character, but also with  all the show's other elements: insulting disregard for historical  accuracy (down to the Orwellian police garb or the nauseating lack of  etiquette - da Vinci would not have had a long life if he addressed  nobles the way he does here -), cheap looking costumes, gratuitous  nudity, cardboard CGI, plain bad one dimensional supporting characters.  The most adequate way to describe the show is to compare it to the  shows it unashamedly badly steals from: Sensationalism: sex and blood  combined, a trend popularised by \"True Blood\" and found in most peplum  and historical dramas ( \"Rome\", \"Spartacus\", \"The Tudors\" \"The  Borgias\", \"Vikings\" for e.g) or fantasy (\"Game of Thrones\") A facade of  openness: the depiction of homosexuality, found again in the mentioned  shows. But here the hypocrisy is complete, as the writers felt that it  would not sell enough to paint da Vinci as a homosexual, whereas there  are records that he may well have been.  Brilliant but slightly clinically deranged or drugged up lead male  character. Recent shows always portray, as a form of social realism,  the downside of genius: either the main character is socially inept (  Aspergers syndrome or whatnot, ie \"Big Bang Theory\", \"Fringe\", new  \"Doctor Who\" etc..) or having to resort to drugs to deal with his  problems ( the new \"Sherlock Holmes\", \"elementary\"). Here da Vinci is  both: a bit mad and a bit drugged up. Just pathetic. Why not show da  Vinci as he surely was, a brilliant man with human flaws living in  dangerous times? Does not SELL.  Heck even the recreation of Florence is ripped of from Assassin creed  2. The traumatising childhood well scene from TDK.  Avoid this crap like the plague.

Also, when really awful things happen, the characters don't act like they \"should\"; there is no weight to the loss of important people.<br/><br/>Overall it is a lame series that does nothing to make it worth watching over the thousands of other mediocre shows like it.", "rating": 4, "helpful": "13 out of 22 found this helpful.", "date": "10 February 2020"}, {"title": " Great art and music... That's it", "content": "Akame ga Kill is basically about a boy from a small village, Tatsumi, wanting to work for the capital in order to send money back to his village. His dreams are crushed when he realizes that the empire is corrupt and the rich killed his best friends. He joins up with Night Raid, a revolutionary army of assassins designed to fight against the empire, in hopes to getting rid of that corruption.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>Nothing really new about the plot itself, just a corrupt government and the people rebelling. A new idea was the imperial arms that the empire, about a 1000 years ago, created so his empire will prosper. The anime itself had great animation and art style. The well drawn characters and background and the fluid movement all make this a beautiful anime. Even the beautiful imagery present throughout this anime was beautiful and excellent. The music was very good and really shaped the mood at times.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>I felt like the art and music was wasted on this anime. Even the idea of the imperial arms could have been moved to a better anime. My, where to start...<br/><br/>Pacing: this is a basic story, but they manage to screw it up. Each episode felt like filler with fight scenes. I didn't even feel bad about the characters because they would kill them as soon as we got to know them.<br/><br/>Characters: they were horrible stereotypes. You have the average protagonist guy, the cold assassin, the tsundere, the leader, the best breasted wild girl, the wild older bro type, the clumsy girl with glasses, and the perverted comedic guy. At least, I think the guy with the green hair was supposed to be the funny stereotype, they didn't flesh him out enough. Let that sink in. They didn't flesh out a character enough for him to be a STEREOTYPE. I also didn't like Esdeath because of her weird crush on Tatsumi. It would have been interesting if she had a crush on Bulat or even Najenda to create something interesting. Nope, it has to be the main character (because we all know this is a self-insert). Seryu had this weird twisted obsession with justice while killing people for stealing a few items. Chelsea was also a horrible person because she picked on Mine for NO reason, it wasn't even logical.<br/><br/>Tone/Genre: This anime doesn't know what it wants to be. Does it want to be a dark fantasy? A comedy and action anime? A romantic comedy? A harem? Pick a genre and stick to it! Tatsumi's friends died and seconds later we have slapstick of him joining Night Raid. Each time a character dies, we have a light hearted scene playing right after. Even after Tatsumi died at the end, characters were talking about him coming back, like the writers wanted to have some sick ironic joke. <br/><br/>Everything, except the art and music, sucked. I almost rated it lower because of the art and music being wasted on this crap.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "33 out of 66 found this helpful.", "date": "13 March 2017"}, {"title": " Wasn't Even Worth Finishing", "content": "I'd heard mixed reviews about Akame ga Kill!, and thought I'd check it out anyways. Its only 24 episodes right? How hard could it be to get through it? Harder than I thought. <br/><br/>Akame ga Kill! has a decent start. The characters seem interesting enough, the action is bloody and over-the-top, which is exactly what I was expecting, and the way it's presented is actually pretty good. But as it progressed, it became less and less interesting to the point where I just didn't care anymore. I stopped watching about halfway through, and have no interest in ever finishing it. Now the reason I stopped is mostly because of the sexuality throughout the show, which I didn't realize was there until getting to where I did. I'm not saying nudity and sex makes a bad show, I'm just saying it limits who watches it due to moral standings. If that stuff hadn't been in it, I'd probably have finished it. <br/><br/>The characters in this show are alright, to start at least. Tatsumi has an actually realistic goal, and the rest of Night Raid (the group) has their distinct character traits. That's where the problem occurs. All the characters only have one or two traits. They aren't particularly well-developed, and follow the same development formula every anime seems to these days: with back stories. I'm not saying back stories are bad, but Akame ga Kill! didn't even try to weave them into the story, they just kind of threw them out there as quickly as possible. Characters would be talking casually, then suddenly, \"Let me tell you about my past\" would come out, and all this emotion would be forced upon you for someone you hardly even know anything about, and it all just felt fake. With a title like 'Akame ga Kill!' you know that people, important or not, will die. But it doesn't really create a fear for the characters. In shows like 'Attack on Titan' no one's overpowered or anything, and that really helps create a sense of fear for the characters. Not only that, but 'Attack on Titan' manages to make the characters very interesting from the second you meet them, only to have them torn away from you before you could really learn to care. And that's why 'Attack on Titan' did so well with it's characters, while Akame ga Kill! suffers. The characters are just okay at the beginning. They felt a little clich\u00e9 (which isn't necessarily bad) and I never felt like they were in any real danger, considering the sizes of their weapons and amount of skill they seemed to possess. <br/><br/>The plot itself started out sounding interesting, but resulted in just an excuse to overdo the violence as much as possible. Sure, I like over-the-top violence (why do you think I started this show?), but violence with no story is just boring. I often found myself watching and thinking \"Man, this is cool. But why are they doing this again?\" Maybe I just wasn't paying enough attention, or maybe it's just unclear. Either way, I felt like there really wasn't any purpose to the fighting that filled up so much of the series. <br/><br/>Now one thing that I did like were the weapons, or Imperial Arms, as they're called. I thought it was cool how technologically advanced they were for their time, and yet how they still felt like they fit into the time in which the series is set in. Or at least, most of them did. Lot's of the Imperial Arms introduced later in the series started making the show feel more magical than it was technological. Before, the weapons had simple hints of magic here and there, which was cool. But the later weapons were just full-on magic. I don't want to spoil any of them to you, but it was clear that the creators just ran out of ideas and started throwing crap at the screen at that point. And that really took away from the feel of the series. <br/><br/>Overall, Akame ga Kill! has a decent start, but by the mid-point I was done. It lacked realistic or engaging characters, a decent (but promising) plot, and a little too much magic. The fights were quite well done, however, and the first few weapons introduced are cool and fit right into the universe of Akame ga Kill! You may think I have no right to write a review, having never finished it, but I know and have seen enough to know that this show really just isn't anything special. I'm fine with them killing off characters, that doesn't take away from it for me, I just didn't care enough when the characters died. In the end, I wouldn't recommend Akame ga Kill! But if you liked it, then that's fine. If you don't, that's fine too. If you still want to watch it, though, then go right ahead.

So let's start with the main character, don't let his outside appearance fool you, his constitution as well as his personality is very basic and just stupid, one of the reason I hate this show, with a burning passion is because of the unnecessary plot twist and how the show adds comedic effect at the end of a really depressing scene, it really makes no sense. Then there's the romance... it's really bad, no positive things to say about it. The antagonist actually falls in love with the protagonist, very odd right? But it gets worse... the protagonist ends up dying with multiple love interest to which he ends up forgetting about them in the end, anyway. And actually dies with the supposed main love interest who is actually the main villain... Do I need to say more? So needless to say the romance aspect of this show is just terrible, but then there's the plot, the characters, world building... they're all executed terribly. Oh! did I mention how all the the characters in the show die, from beginning to end they are treated like pawns in a chess game, no actually pawns would be killed for a logical, and strategical reason, and this show kills off the characters for no apparent reason. like about the only character who survives is the leader of the group and she was the weakest one with her puny little arm machine or whatever it was, I can't be bothered, honestly. And the whole time I was watching every character get killed off, I thought to myself \"nah.. there's probably gonna be an Arc in the show were they all come back to life... right?\" I seriously don't get it, and if this show is trying to set a gothic tone, then they've executed it so badly it's not worth even batting an eyelash for.

The main reasons are simple: Characters and Story.<br/><br/>The main protagonist, Tatsumi, is a bland and boring character in both design and personality, to the point where there is no reason to care about him. The beginning is just that when he finds that his two friends are died, didn't care at all. The group known as Night Raid also has characters with no depth and are just stereotypes. It's easier to distinguish them by hair color than anything since they are so worthless. The Yeagers are no different and often have really stupid characters doing stupid things. You have a character who is a sadist, but also falls for Tatsumi, for some reason, as if that's how people work. Justice B**ch is even worse when she has two different personalities that doesn't mesh at all, and that she has to be the worst character I have ever seen in an anime. Everyone else is just comically evil just for the sake of being evil and don't care about any of these people.<br/><br/>The writing is definitely its worst points. Not only is this anime terrible at establishing the world, but it often relies on dumb characters doing stupid things in order to move the plot and relies WAY too heavily on magic as a plot device. Even though I find this anime to be trash, one thing I liked was the idea of the main characters facing death, unlike other anime that prevents characters from dying. But it does this a lot and it becomes predictable after you hear their pointless backstory, which doesn't matter since they're dead. This anime also tries to be dark and edgy, but fails miserably to takes itself the least bit seriously.<br/><br/>Overall, this anime is nothing good and not something I would recommend to anyone.

The dialog and plot go nowhere fast. They can't seem to pull off the \"I've got a big secret.\" no matter how hard they try. The series has a lack of suspense. Almost all the problems are solved by talking them out. Very few seem to have ethical issues even when innocent lives have been lost.<br/><br/>So if you haven't watched Haven, you are not missing anything life altering or even thought provoking.

The town has a tiny population measured in the hundreds, but non-pivotal characters are dying left and right with little concern from pretty much anyone (not even the main characters). It's apparently 5 seasons in, and I can't imagine there being more than a dozen people left in the town. That's just how often the locals die.<br/><br/>Every episode is another formulaic crime case for 2 cops to solve. Here's the formula: someone else has another power that's killing people, and it's up to the 2 cops to figure it out. The new twist on this superpower theme is that it's not like Heroes or 4400 where the people are learning to use their powers to do amazing things and choosing to become heroes or villains. Instead, these superpowered people are uncontrollably and accidentally killing others. No one is actually ever arrested because the writing is done to either make you sympathize with a murderer who is unintentionally and uncontrollably killing people with their powers... OR the superpower person makes the conscious decision to become a villain (even though they haven't figured out how to control their ability), and they die shortly after. Don't worry, there's always a formulaic twist where the prime suspect is clearly exonerated late in the episode (often by their own death). Turns out it was someone else all along!<br/><br/>Some of the actors/actresses are okay, but it's really held back by the writing. People regularly speak out loud while alone, which is usually a sign of really bad writing... they couldn't figure out a way to convey what's going on or what a character was thinking/doing. So instead, the lone character on screen suddenly loses their internal monologue and is forced to speak what they think out loud.<br/><br/>If you like terribly formulaic and predictable shows (House, CSI, Law &amp; Order, etc) this is for you. If not, this will be insulting to your intelligence. The serial story lines are barely addressed in any of the episodes. You could probably skip an entire season and not miss anything meaningful.

For some time, I heard people raving about its outstanding animation techniques, never seen before fighting sequences and humor. Curiosity and anxiety surrounded my mind, wondering if it really reached or even surpassed the standards set by Dexter's Laboratory and The Powerpuff Girls. Incidentally, Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of this new show, has worked on the previous two before and based on my knowledge, his vision upon the animation industry is pretty unlike anything any other animators have seen before.<br/><br/>Not long after its first run, I managed to witness an episode of Samurai Jack on Cartoon Network in my aunt's house. In fact, in my first viewpoint, the show really seemed a bit simplistic, focused more on battles and at some points, a sense of humor to keep the audience's interest. Yes, it bears similarity to other Genndy's older works. However, I'm just talking to one of the episodes shown on the channel. Initially, the similarity ended when I began to watch the rest of the episodes.<br/><br/>The plot itself is quite simple: Samurai Jack (his original Japanese name remains a mystery) lives in ancient Japan where his homeland is being ravaged by a mightily powerful but weird-looking, sometimes insipid demon named Aku. Jack used his mystical sword to fight him and eventually he defeats him after a few bouts. But before Jack manages to destroy the demon once and for all, Aku casts a spell that sends Jack into the future, a time when Aku reigns supreme. Now, it is up to Jack to find a way to go back into the past by wandering around the futuristic cities, barren wastelands and ancient ruins inhabited by aliens and other bizarre creatures you haven't seen before and most importantly, meeting allies and friends (like the crazed muscular Scotsman) to give our struggling hero spiritual hope and motivation to reach his destiny (the maturity of Jack can be seen throughout the seasons, as he seems to be more confident and has the right to call himself 'The Legendary Samurai'. Something like that). The character designs and the environments are extremely odd in Genndy's favor but perhaps these are the reasons why Samurai Jack is such an appealing show to watch at. Firstly, unlike the typical Saturday cartoons we usually see, it is almost an ambiguous cartoon with really abstract elements (specially when you watch a peculiar episode for the first time ever). You have absolutely no idea what is going on there: the creatures, the aliens, the bizarre skyscrapers, the contraptions. They are all refreshingly cubic and bizarre and yet have a reason for their existence. Despite its subtle and uneven premise, Samurai Jack is simply a straightforward action show with easily identifiable objects (toon experts will know that for sure) and characters (its basic concept is mostly derived from the Star Wars universe, in which Genndy also directs under the name Clone Wars). At one case, some of the elements of Samurai Jack are derived from Akira Kurosawa's movies, anime (both state-of-the-art or clich\u00e9) and on another point, famous American icons and world cultures. Some even serve as a precursor to Craig McCracken's Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends with bits and pieces from Dexter's Lab and PPG. Sure, most of the episodes don't capture the scope of full-length movies but the slowness of its nature allows the audience to accept the fact that it almost feels like a movie, in a shorter form at least. If you ask whether the show's appropriate for kids, well, Samurai Jack is a surprisingly violent cartoon (that's beyond the boundary of Dex and PPG) but that otherwise proves that Genndy's skills to handle a particular context has matured.<br/><br/>What really fascinate me are Genndy's abilities to master the essential film-making techniques such as pace, flow, mise-en-scene and mood, smooth animation and most importantly, character appeal such as Samurai Jack himself. Some sequences are even squeezed in to a particular ratio aspect to provide a cinematic point of view as well as to increase the tension of a situation. Creative editing techniques also helps to build anticipation, fasten the pace of the action sequences (mostly beautifully choreographed despite the fact that they are just frames of drawings!) and create decisive matters as Jack faces frequent pandemonium. The artwork of the show is equally impressive albeit a bit kiddy oriented. That essentially leads to one of Genndy's strongest trademarks and principles: simplistic designs tend to have greater impact compared to realistic models (of 2D and 3D) by conveying constant exaggeration, ridiculous laws of physic and common sense and doses of good slapstick humor while maintaining its 'logical sense' without losing direction. The show's crystal clear colors and tones also manage to reflect the overall mood of a particular environment, whether you can feel the serenity of ancient Japan or the unknown danger of the dark and barren wasteland.<br/><br/>If it weren't for Genndy, cartoons cannot evolve into newer forms. If Gene Deitch gave birth to 'limited animation' via Gerald McBoing Boing, we all could say that, in my opinion, Genndy Tartakovsky gave birth to 'cinematic limited cartoons' or simply, 'Cinematic Toons'. I know these terms don't sound right to some people but through Samurai Jack, he has created something that proves to be revolutionary since the era of the Renaissance (Batman, DuckTales and Tiny Toons).

Not since the Batman series, or perhaps ever, has a American cartoon flaunted such daring visual bravado, intelligent cinematic storytelling, intense action, and a revolutionary spirit so confidently - it's a warmly welcomed shake-up to the monotonous humdrum continuum of TV animation in this country.  Genndy Tartakovsky (creator of Dexter's Laboratory) has captured lightning in a bottle with his latest brainchild, and in doing so has demolished the mold for cartoons both present and future.  Indeed, calling this show itself a cartoon seems somehow disrespectful and stereotypical.  Here, the freedom allowed by the medium brings the story of Jack and his vendetta against a millenial nemesis named Aku in the far future feverishly to life.  Every background, set piece, character, and detail are all strikingly imagined, almost shocking in their originality.  The minimalist nature of the animation itself gives the program a unique and powerful vitality, and the abstract and sometimes surreal stylization is unlike anything ever seen in cartoons.  Tartakovsky avoids the clunky and often lifeless quagmire of more detailed and lifelike approaches to action animation and instead opts for he intensity and impact of a comic book in motion, and the results are both awesome and beautiful.<br/><br/>More than anything else, Samurai Jack truly feels like a work of art, like something that is crafted rather than produced.

The first two seasons especially have some very egregious problems, specifically with the animation.<br/><br/>In the first two seasons, the animation is especially choppy and stilted. The animators decided to go style-over-substance in many of these early episodes, using changing frame rates, slow-mo, and other stylistic choices hoping to mask the long portions of reaction-shots, very choppy and non-fluid motion, and almost uncanny movements (or lack thereof) by the characters. That is to say nothing of the character design. I think many are ascribing the geometric body shapes and odd proportions undeserved artistic merit, not to mention the uninspired designs for a myriad of villains and aliens. Not to say that the show is artistically bankrupt, but sometimes it seems obvious that it's not trying as hard as it could.<br/><br/>The episodic structure is a little grating at times, with some continuity ignored.

I think it was some of those early season 3 episodes where I could really catch the vision of what the creators were trying to do with the show. As I said before, the show is far from artistically bankrupt, and some of the show's best episodes are also from those first two seasons: Jack and the Three Blind Archers; Jack and the Scotsman; Aku's Fairy Tales, among others. The show also had some great comedy. Mako's voice acting (which was probably around 60% of all the voice acting in the show) was tremendous, and the soundtrack was truly superb. I think the show really does hold up as a classic, but there are some errors that are overlooked.

I didn't start it until after the fifth season. However, just because I wasn't a long time fan, doesn't mean I can't watch the show, and love it for that matter. And when I watched it, it became my favorite animated series of all time.<br/><br/>The Story:\nSamurai Jack centers around a samurai named Jack, who is lost in the future. After the demon Aku, sent him there, after the samurai nearly took his life. In the future, Aku rules all, and Jack had to find his way back to the past, and prevent this timeline.<br/><br/>Samurai Jack is one of the most creative shows of all time. From it's meshing of so many different genres, such as, science fiction, fantasy, action, adventure, comedy, and animation. To the original take on the fish out of water story. With interesting characters, surprisingly descent comedy, and entertaining stories.<br/><br/>The Characters:\nI enjoy the characters, all of them are interesting and go through changes, and have their own complete stories.<br/><br/>Let's start with Jack. Jack: is the hero of the story, lost in a time he isn't fimiliar with. And it's very easy to mess up this kind of character. However, this show makes him both interesting, and likable. Jack is a man willing to save people, that it's a flaw. Like the time there was a time portal, but if he went in, he wouldn't be able to save someone. So, he ended up saving the monk, and loosing his opportunity to go back.<br/><br/>Another flaw is that Jack can often let his anger get to him, when under stress. Which adds an element of relatability. Jack, is one of my favorite protagonists of all time.<br/><br/>Although I love Jack, Aku's my favorite character. He's both threatening and hilarious. From the great vocal performance by Mako. To the great screen-presence, Aku is just fun to watch.<br/><br/>He's the ruthless dictator of Earth. And man, does he pop off the screen his great design, and of course, performance and writing, as I mentioned before.<br/><br/>I love Aku. And he's one of my favorite villains of all time.<br/><br/>The Animation:\nThe animation of this series, is simply beautiful to look at. Well drawn, wonderfully rendered, and smooth movements: allowing for great action scenes, and stunning visuals. Look at it, and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Conclusion:\nI don't know what I prefer, Samurai Jack, or Death Note. But it's definitely in my top 3, and basically a perfect television show. There's so much I didn't talk about. But to cut it short, this show's worth watching. I've seen every episode at least 5 times, and I don't regret a thing.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "7 out of 8 found this helpful.", "date": "27 June 2019"}, {"title": " Making the Cut", "content": "Samurai to my are my second favorite type of warrior, their always fascinating from their swordplay to their philosophies and principles they live by; despite the chaos they deal with somehow they like the sword sheved always remand peaceful or find peace though the chaos.<br/><br/>This is another one of my favorite animated shows of all time. In a way it almost is like a shonen anime only it's one made in America which makes it really cool. I'm a person that love martial arts as well as pulp fantasy and sci-fi, this show put both those genres in a blender and they make a very tasty drink.<br/><br/>The characters are great despite not deep and are really there to serve their functions they do it very well.<br/><br/>Jack is an awesome protagonist he's sort of a pulp hero up there with Doc Savage, Buckaroo Banzai and Doctor Who. He's a bad ass, this guy never says a whole lot, in fact in some episode he sometimes says nothing at all. But that's because he's a man of action, this guy can just cut though the odds and any opponent of any size like butter. He has the fastest and swiftest moves I've seen in any animated character that fights, and their not superpowers but Martial arts techniques which makes it all the better, since superpowers I personal feel is a slightly overused concept. And Phil Lamarr one of my favorite voice actors is great, his voice fits like a glove.<br/><br/>Aku is a good fun villain, I like that he is clever, psychotic, and he's kinda funny. Even like Jack's number two that he sometimes runs into The Scottsman. His character is fraking hilarious he has some of the best lines in the show. It's true he's not the brightest bulb and he's kinda crazy but his heart is always in the right place if not his head. The back and forth between Jack and him is great and feels like a functional friendship, it's the buddy cop motif of two people working together despite being on the fence in both persona and ideology. The Scottsman always give Jack at times some unintentional grief and Jack we see at times is just rolling his eyes as he know The Scottsman is pracitally leading him on the road to Hell but he goes with him anyway out of respect. The Scottsman though is also a bad ass, from welding his sword, having almost Hercules like strength, and my favorite feature is his use of his machine gun leg which in a way predates the gun leg in the film \"Grindhouse\" in the \"Planet Terror\" segment.<br/><br/>However this is a show that is really style over toping substance, and fully concerned about the ongoing action. Which is cool and that is most of the time what I like in action films/genre, where their just simplistic and straight to the point.<br/><br/>Each episode is always a new adventure and it's true it's a bit random which is part of the fun. Just like Doctor Who Jack is just traveling to any period in time from the past to even the far future. It also provides a great sense of creative freedom where it literally feels like you can just put this character anywhere and the show could go any direction it wants which is a great feeling.<br/><br/>Music is very good and fits the show, I like the theme song and some of the music which is in the use Japanese old style tune and hip hop; and this show was before the anime \"Samurai Chapaloo\" which is cool and another story.<br/><br/>The action is excellent, in a way it's sort of a swashbuckling actioneer. As we see Jack wield his sword and he wields it well, the chirography is great some of it based of some real Bushido. I love that the violence isn't milked down to insult the viewers intelligence you do see the actual slices and kills mainly consisting of a colorful variety of evil robots, which is cool it's reminiscent of the comic book series \"Magnus Robot Fighter\". And the pacing is excellent, each episode despite being only about 20-25 minutes long I hardly noticed the time at all which is a great feeling.<br/><br/>The art is excellent, it's sort of a Japanese expressionistic art style which fits for this show. At times they blend in a few other art styles sometimes depending on the episode. This helps create a fun but also kinda surreal and expressive atmosphere.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great animated show that is worth unsheathing, Samurai Jack makes the cut.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars", "rating": 10, "helpful": "7 out of 8 found this helpful.", "date": "19 March 2015"}, {"title": " Jack's back!", "content": "I remember back when this show first premiered over a decade ago and being swept away by how incredible it was. All I needed to see was the first couple of episodes to get hooked to this show. I think the best thing is probably the animation. I noticed and recalled the animators saying that they flat out omitted the usual black lines and simply show the bare colors. It was a pity this show ended before reaching an actual conclusion...that is until now over a decade later! I am simply overjoyed this show is finally back and there's probably no better time, seeing as how we're in a golden age of animation with this decade.<br/><br/>Possibly the most fascinating thing about this show is how epic it is but yet how it manages to be fairly minimal. What I mean is that there's tons of great action scenes to spare and a huge scale of fighting, but yet there's only about two or three characters in the entire show! The main character Jack and his archenemy Aku. That's really all you need to know. Episodes always brought something different to the table with fantastic robot and creature designs. I hadn't even heard of the voice actor Mako before this and am sorry that he passed away before this show continued.<br/><br/>It really does have a bit of everything. Some of the episodes seem a bit out of place. A couple don't fit much into the continuity and were more like self parodies. In a show that works wonderfully serious, the more light-hearted stuff works surprisingly well. As someone who watched a lot of \"MadTV\", it was weird for me to not recognize Phil LaMarr's voice.

Fans of his stand up acts will be able to associate the jokes which he cracks about him going all out to woo his crush &amp; him running around Avantika in the show. Zakir's comic timing &amp; dialogues are hilarious. The other show stealer is veteran actor Zakir Hussain. His acting is brilliant. He is brilliant as the hapless father. His dialogues especially \" Zindagi main Salman Banna, Radhe Mohan nahi\" will be remembered by fans of this show for years to come. The character who plays Avantika looks pretty. Ronny's cronies do a good job. Rest of the supporting cast too is decent.<br/><br/>There are no flaws that we can think of. At barely 25 odd mins per episode, there are barely any time for your mind to wander. The script writers have done a fab job of keeping the viewers glued to their screens throughout. Amazon Prime has a good track record &amp; they do not disappoint.<br/><br/>It is a show which should be enjoyed with your entire family.

It must have been Shanti or something in the mid 90's when cable television was yet to reach India. If there was an apocalypse and hindi television shows were the only shows that survived I would rather just stare blankly out of the window. That is how much I look down upon hindi shows. <br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Zakir Khan either. His pitch modulation irritates me. It goes from normal to inaudible at times. I have tried watching some of his standup sitting mighty close to the computer but then I gave up. Comedy is supposed to be relaxing and if you have to strain your ears to figure out what is being said then the whole purpose of it gets lost. <br/><br/>So I was really not looking forward to watching the show but Amazon keeps reminding me that there are unused services on my prime account. So one fine day I decided to give an episode a try. I was genuinely expecting it to be one of those try-hard shows that I could shut down after 5 mins but I was wrong.<br/><br/>What was most impressive about the show is that it is an absolute breeze to sit through. I love Jim Parsons The Big Bang Theory &amp; Gavin Belson's Silicon Valley but I struggle to sit through 20 mins of those shows without taking a few breaks. I finished watched Chacha Vidhayak Hain Hamare in just 2 days. its not exactly a comedy but more of a comedy-drama with some seriously funny bits. I had to rewatch the scene where they tie him to the back of the car and drive around in circles coz I couldnt stop laughing. <br/><br/>Another impressive thing about the show is the casting though at times you can tell the seasoned actors from the novices. The actor who plays the father is a brilliant casting. They generally cast him in negative roles in Bollywood and I hope that based on this show they give him bigger and better roles in movies. The lady who plays the mother is also a good actor. The sister is really beautiful. Zakir Khan holds his own but as the season progresses and the episodes become serious you can tell that he is out of his depth.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of the ending but they seem to have laid the groundwork for next season. Lets hope Zakir Khan can emulate himself though it will not be easy. If the average hindi televison shows that air in India were half as good as Chacha Vidhayak Hain Hamare then the collectibe IQ of the viewers would definitely improve. <br/><br/>Very impressive show.

All of a sudden plot holes become so important to the general public, they use every single one of them to burn the show down, even if these plot holes haven't had a chance to be explained by the writers because the show is only half-way in it's first season.<br/><br/>The entire show is based on a fictional future where every single piece of electronic equipment started failing, all at once, by some mysterious and unexplained force. Being thrown back to medieval means of living for several decades, the story picks up when several individuals start looking for answers to this mystery, helped by rumors of one of the governments being able to 'turn back on the lights' shortly. In the years following the black-out, governments worldwide have fallen, lacking their entire infrastructure of communication and transportation, thus unable to govern millions of people. Civil wars lead to the formation of several smaller governments, those who came out on top in the struggle for survival in the aftermath of the disaster. <br/><br/>What follows is a pattern of discoveries, solving the mystery piece by piece by a band of unlikely heroes, ranging from kids to grown ups, each with secrets of their own. Every episode answers some questions but raises even more. <br/><br/>This pattern is hard to find when you first start watching the show. In the first few episodes, the writers overwhelm the viewers with tons of questions. This strategy isn't yet paying off, a lot of viewers stopped watching because they find the show too mysterious, too full of unexplained plot holes and unlikely character motivations. <br/><br/>But here's the thing: Most of the things criticized about this show actually makes sense, as long as the viewer is ready to suspend his disbelief for some time and allows himself to emerge into the world the writers have created for the viewers. It might feel like a pool of quicksand at first, but giving this show time to develop is key to enjoying it the way the writers intended. <br/><br/>To be honest, I cannot understand almost all the negative reviews on this show. Based on what reviewers tend to write about the plot holes and seemingly impossibilities, I bet every single one of them structurally dislikes fiction, especially science fiction. How do these people not dislike movies like Star Trek, the Jacket, the Fifth Element, Mad Max, Escape from New York, Blade Runner, the Terminator or RoboCop, to name just a few? These are filled with plot holes, fictional future governments, unlikely characters and unexplained mysteries yet these are all loved by many or called 'cult', rarely being criticized like \"Revolution\" is. <br/><br/>Add to the equation this show is written and produced by people responsible for hit series like Lost and you know on forehand most questions will be answered only after many episodes, in a very slow pace, if at all. Try watching 10 episodes of 'Lost' and ask yourself: Do I understand what is going on? Because you simply won't. That's the point, you must allow yourself to be emerged in the mysterious world created by the makers of this show, suspending disbelief until they think the time has come to answer some questions you've had for over 20 episodes or so. <br/><br/>For me personally, all this show lacks is a feel of a solid team of writers, producers, directors and actors: the first 10 episodes or so feel a bit sloppy, like the entire crew couldn't really get used to the scope of the show's heading. But trust me, it gets better and better, and after several episodes the characters seem to feel more at home in this strange world of mystery, improving the quality of the show on each episode. <br/><br/>Is this a great show? It is - if the people behind it get a chance to steer clearly towards their goal and so far, it feels like the show is hugely underrated by so many, criticizing it on every minor plot hole. <br/><br/>Or else, maybe those people should stop watching science-fiction altogether...", "rating": 8, "helpful": "83 out of 106 found this helpful.", "date": "13 May 2013"}, {"title": " It's not as bad as everyone says...", "content": "In 'Revolution' the power is out, militia has taken over and the government has fallen.

Miles dropped out from power and Monroe has now gone insane with his power, after killing thousands they are both pretty much cold- hearted, which leads to some gruesome deaths. They keep dropping clues and hints about how and why the power was turned off. The characters have good links with each other and every episode is more entertaining.

Henchmen firing muskets? Why? You don't need complex technology to make bullets for the mechanical repeating rifles. They had those in the wild west before electricity. (FAQ on this is false: yes, making modern ammo is difficult without electric machinery but that doesn't equal revert to musket - in fact revert to musket poses huge problems because even if ammo can be anything, you need to first manufacture the weaponry as existing weapons have rifling bores, moreover to make simple rifle bullets you don't need the same process as the more modern ammo and they would still be compatible with a lot of modern guns).<br/><br/>Next. Can these characters be any less likable? A hot-headed teenager and her brother, a Justin Bieber-lookalike?<br/><br/>Next. Lacking electricity, how can people be alive? (most cellular processes require electricity - passing electrical charges along, brain processes are completely dependent on this) How can anything be alive? If you rub some material on your hair, is there any static left? Hell, since we're at it, what keeps molecules together? Have electric charges been replaced by something else? If so, and in fact those mysterious amulets just regulate this state, it means people can be alive only around them.<br/><br/>Next. How does that woman communicate using her computer? It would mean that an entire network runs continuously from her house to her counterpart. That means, the entire line has electricity running smoothly between her computer, to whatever router she is using, to her counterpart's computer (assuming a simple setup) is allowed to have electricity (otherwise the signal would die as soon as it got out of the range of her amulet).<br/><br/>Halfway through the pilot I was truly hoping that at least the Bieber- double would die in agony and soon after came the simply horrible hotel fight where I saw the evil henchmen pause for almost an entire minute to give the wonder-soldier time to stare in disbelief at his teen niece. Almost a minute the brain-dead henchmen just stand there not taking a shot.

However, is that really the show's premise? Moreover, there are twelve devices where each one allows electric current to flow in a local area around it, and, apparently, having all twelve of these objects could let electricity flow again all over the world. While the show hasn't explained all the particulars--almost all of them really--it works because those who make have kept it plausible. It also works because of the premise, something I appreciate very much--so far at least.<br/><br/>One recognizes the similarity characters in _Revolution_ have with others in the sci-fi genre, but like similar traits appear in different species, is it caused by similar traits occurring in evolution along different lines, or is it borrowing or developing from past characters--developments in the same species in other words? Many have noted the similarity of the Charlie Matheson character to the Katniss character in _The Hunger Games_. Did they develop independently at the same time, or did the Charlie Matheson character come from trying to build on the success of Katniss? Is it like Leibniz developing The Calculus at the same time as Newton, or is it like Einstein further developing Newtonian ideas on physics? Again, it's both simple and complex, but I hope the show can keep it plausible, something that's going to continue take knowledge of electricity and how it works as well.<br/><br/>Some questions about electricity came to mind, some of them resulting in more knowledge after research. Has just alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) power gone out, Man's ability to produce it? What about its existence in nature, lightning and static electricity for example? Online research indicates lightning's a form of static electricity, so can we differ static electricity with AC and DC? Neither AC or DC will work then? Can _Revolution_'s writers and others involved in making the show keep it simple, complex--and plausible? So far, the show hasn't confronted obvious or complex pitfalls, but it's not out of trying to avoid them. At least it doesn't seem that way yet. However, I don't remember any lightning storms for instance, and what about electricity working somewhat. It didn't all go out instantaneously in the pilot. How can only man-made electricity not work, or is it all forms electricity? One idea that comes to mind is having all electricity fail to work down to a certain altitude, but even that would make people wonder. What about someone jumping off a cliff with a glider? Would electricity work? Does lighting stop completely or at some level before the ground? Again, does the fact that the power went out as in a quick but rolling blackout get into the mix here? Further study shows that lightning and static electricity, while DC in a way, also are not even DC, current but an \"accumulation of electrical charges on the surface of a material\" (School for Champions, n.d.). Moreover, while DC in nature, static electricity \"is called 'static' because there is no current flowing, as there is in alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) electricity\u0085\" (ibid.) Anyway, the show's going to require research to keep it plausible.<br/><br/>This review has asked some of the complex questions. _Revolution_ remains plausible in my eyes, and I'd like to see it remain so. Electricity has a lot of importantance to all of us in one way or another,and I hope the writers research it so that the show's premise remains plausible. From the effect electricity in the real world today has on those who don't have it to those who design things that use it, the lack of electrical current at least and the exceptions to this in the show's version of the world interest fans and potential fans alike. Who's to say it isn't plausible with the way science works, the exceptions Einstein found in physics for example? Does the show already have some consultants with knowledge about electrical engineering? Though it seems those who bring us _Revolution_ have knowledge about the premise, they really should have advisors with the right background if they don't already. The show's writers, directors, actors, and producers must endeavor to keep the show plausible. Really, instead of the premise being that electricity does not work, so far we've only really seen the premise be that electric current does not work.

Next I have to wonder how, after fifteen years, people can still be wearing fresh, white, machine-made clothing. I guess it wouldn't look good to have everyone walking around in sheepskins. Bu why not leather? Last, but not least, there is the JJ Abrams specialty. Billion-to-one coincidences. Again, in his absolute drek of a reboot of Star Trek, one coincidence (among so many) was having Kirk marooned within walking distance on the same planet as Spock and Scotty. In Revolution, the three questers enter a random building after entering Chicago.

But countless shows with huge plot-holes managed to stay on air because of the level of entertainment they produced. Off the top of my head Stargate SG-1 which ran for 10 season made 2 spin-off shows and straight to DVD movies frequently showed English speaking aliens with American accents. In my opinion that hasn't got anything to do with science or fiction it's merely something they had to do to make the show work in long-term. Revolution is doing the same thing with \"diesel engines not working without electricity\" and \"batteries working after just sitting there for years\".<br/><br/>More about the show, Revolution has a very unique way of story-telling. Flash-backs often surprises with hard-to-guess past events that led each character to different points in present. Actor Billy Burke is a natural at portraying Miles Matheson, a highly trained ex-military man with unpredictable emotions towards his peers. Action scenes often include well choreographed sword fights, gun fights and a lot of explosions. The show in no-way seems low budget or badly directed and has the perfect balance of violence and family-friendliness.<br/><br/>If you skipped this show because of any technicalities or potential clich\u00e9s of post-apocalyptic earth, you might have read.

The actors are bland at best and annoying at worst. They neither look nor behave as though they come from a dangerous post apocalyptic civilization. The action is terribly repetitive and formulaic. The dialog is boring and only serves as a filler between overly long fight scenes, which themselves do not serve the plot.<br/><br/>In the end what we get is a lot of nothing with a smidgen of plot that is revealed in dribbles and we are supposed to be tantalized enough to keep coming back for more. I might dvr it and watch the last five minutes of each show.<br/><br/>The idea of a post apocalyptic world without electricity excited me, but this show is a real loser. It is more the pity as there are some fine actors involved.<br/><br/>I do not understand this trend of formulaic sci fi with expensive budgets and excellent producers etc. turning out high tech versions of Space Family Robinson.

My only complaint is against NBC. Revolution should have been given a 2 hour time slot to premier its concept. I feel it was unfairly rushed, but the writers were absolutely without flaw and brilliant to work the amount of time they were granted. For those of us that enjoy shows that are not predictable, Revolution delivers. The fact that the power goes out sequentially points to the fact, this is a man made phenomena. It was planned. Why? The first episode clearly divulges how man has abused the power of electricity. Engines that are powered by batteries go into vehicles that are used to wage war. Missiles can be launched! To me it sounds as if it was all perfectly planned and orchestrated for those that understood how to shut the power down to avoid all catastrophe. Sure there would be losses due to loss of power, but in the long run seems more survive since there is no immediate threat of someone making a mistake and pushing the wrong button! For some is strange the story jumped 15 years to the future, to me adds to the mystery. You have to watch the show every episode to gain more insight to what has happened. This is not a show for those that want to figure it out in 5 minutes! Scenery is well done and planned beyond belief! When I look at areas that have been left to waste for a few years, the depiction this show has is perfect! As far as I am concerned this show is the best. I just hope the writers will continue on their path of brilliance keeping us in suspense but feeding us the bits and pieces. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it a 20! Revolution destroyed the scale is way beyond shows I have seen. Til now I have never had a show that stuck to my mind and left me thinking about everyday as it has!

The show is packed with action and drama, with interesting plot twists, and emotional wrenching events when key characters either die, or turn traitor on their friends. <br/><br/>There is some flaws to this show though !!! Given the knowledge most people have today scientifically and otherwise.<br/><br/>1. After 15 years the electrical grid would not just come back on like nothing ever happened. If anything it would cause more chaos with transformers exploding from the sudden power surge after that amount of time and deterioration and lack of upkeep and maintenance.<br/><br/>2. Helicopters, and all other vehicles after 15 years would not be able to run like they do in the show with those amplifiers and pendants. All vehicles military and domestic not only run on computers, but today need computers in order to diagnose and maintain them through maintenance. It would be impossible for them to maintain these vehicles in prime condition till they got these power adapters.<br/><br/>3. Also I have to say although I like the character of Aaron, there is no way in end of the world like times this show is placed in, he would be able to maintain an overweight physique. If anything he would be more like Miles or some of the other characters if he was going to be able to survive for 15 years in that type of existence.<br/><br/>4. In the show you see the children like Charlie and Danny grow older, but the other main characters don't seem to age a day since the blackout. You would expect to see some gray hair something, but no from Miles to Rachael they all look just as young as they did before the blackout. <br/><br/>To be fair they could explain this away as being a side effect of the nanobot virus that wiped out the electric grid, since they were already explained to have healing properties for the human race in the show already. But that should explained further to fill the hole.<br/><br/>Overall I like the show it is highly entertaining with a great cast.

OK the acting was a tad wooden, and I agree with another reviewer's comments about why the buildings/cities were in such a mess, I mean, people should see how old some buildings are in Scotland, and see some of the people that live in them, yet they don't look as badly kept/overgrown as the buildings in this show. Yes, the premise of the story is a bit far stretched but really people, give it a go, I can see so many ways they can take this show, and I genuinely don't think it's meant to be as serious as perhaps AMC's The Walking Dead, which another reviewer refers to as the way to go with this show.

This series is absolutely such a production, but make no mistake it neither lags nor allows your attention to waiver.

As far as season 2 is concerned, it does not possess the intensity, the menace (yes there was nuanced menace underlying the first season that gave it such intensity), and the powerhouse performances from the supporting cast. Season 2 is slow burn and meanders a bit during the middle. But it is still good and I enjoyed it. If you compare second season to the first season it does not hold candle to it. But as a standalone it is an enjoyable watch. It has meaningful suspense, it has character development, good performances and a plot with some merit. It lacks in direction.

Higher-ups seem to be behind the crimes, and the script certainly gives the impression that the Korean culture is dominated by title, authority and political favors on the part of elitists in the Police Force and business. Huang, though, is relentless and strictly business. He has a personality defect that causes a lack of empathy or emotion. So, he shares only what he needs to, and in as few words as possible. I haven't quite finished the series, but I don't expect to see him in a passionate affair with any of the available female characters.

Doona Bae's Lieutenant Han is a model of the wise woman professional in a career dominated by knuckleheaded males, but not so cliche since many of the male characters were portrayed as comfortable with her authority and respectful of her superior sleuthing. Seung-Woo Cho's junior prosecutor has a fascinating mental quirk that Cho plays with subtlety. You can't help but sympathize with him even when he's at his least empathetic. The unbelievable becomes believable as the motives and methods behind the crimes are revealed, and the overarching theme of pervasive corruption in democratic capitalist society is relatable to an American audience. It's going to be a while before I get over the end of this series, but there was a suggestion in episode 15 of Seung-Woo Cho's character getting a 10-month assignment in the USA, travelling from state to state.

Here, I will neither lead off nor delve into what I see are the minor short comings but instead try to elaborate on the secret of this show's success.<br/><br/>The story revolves around how a prosecutor unearths the details and convoluted dealings that is behind an initial murder of a shady character. <br/><br/>One of the key element of the story is that this prosecutor has a unique physical (and thus related emotional) flaw. This flaw allows him to be almost devoid of emotions, but brilliant (almost to a fault) at deductive reasoning, theories correlation, and stone-cold, unrelenting, unapologetic, and unflinching resolve. This character flaw also provide the storyline with one of the most explosive yet unusual, non- action based climax (1 of 2 near the ending). For this, the audience is the scapegoat in soaking up all the tension in between. This character trait, I believe is absolutely necessary, to serve both the seriousness of the subject matter, and the 'burden' of the plot.<br/><br/>This leads to another great component of the show and that is the overall tone. The constant pressure, mystery, event after event (constructed in great detail) that unfolds seemingly backs the 'good' guys into a tight corner. All this done in a serious, nonchalant, no extra fat, point to point, manner. While there is only just a small, right amount,of understated comic relief. This goes against most other formulaic Korean detective show of over the top funny characters.<br/><br/>A third key of success is the balance of characters. The balance of the female lead oppose to the male lead. Officer Han is just as tough, physically and mentally, has a sense of justice that pairs along with a sense of doubt. This does not mean she is weaker in any sense, but instead more human. A fine touch is how she likes to sketch and scribbles with a pencil. Also must be noted is subtle variation of characters in both the prosecution and police staff. The writing provides its characters with varying level of moral, ethical, and conscientious standards. Some people change, some don't.<br/><br/>Other elements that are not so common in K dramas. No clearly stated development of romantic relationships for the main leads. No prolong, repetition of pop-song heavy based, unnecessary flashbacks. No over sentimental gratuitous tug of the heart strings. No over stylized cinematography. No must see next episode ending to every episode. And there is no over the top, fantastic human feats, or earth shattering twist of the plot. <br/><br/>Lastly, but to a lesser extend is the reduced dependence on dialogue. But instead through use the camera angles and movement, specific thoughts and facial expressions of the characters to move the storyline along. This is especially so in the first few episodes. That means some information are not from given through the exchange of dialogue, not a directly feeding of the plot line to the viewer, but instead implied or visually taken care of.<br/><br/>And as the mystery slowly reveal itself, the audience is not taken for a ride but instead is going along for the ride, side by side with the task force.

The crescendo in most scenes as they climax is breathtakingly complemented to say the least.<br/><br/>The Directors: Its always easy to make a story , however it takes a vision to make History. This series will easily go down as one of the best ever made , just because of the vision and Character portrayal.<br/><br/>Loved this show.

Its an excellent series, complex and gripping, and full of twists and turns which keep things interesting. The two leads work really well together, her warmth and humanity versus his aloofness. Brilliant characterisations and the same excellent acting I am beginning to see across many Kdramas ( in truth, the same actors too, as there seems to be a pool of actors reused across many series! - and why not, they are great). Nail-biting finish, which is an achievement after 16 long episodes.

It shows both parents working as most families do. It's more realistic and most teens can relate to. And the audience of which it is directed towards is more of the older teenage group, like myself, 17. Instead of \"Hannah Montana\", \"Wizards of Waverly Place\", \"Sonny with a Chance\" or \"JONAS\" which has teenage problems, but more directed at the pre-teen audience who still have a huge imagination. Overall the jokes are quite funny, and there is minimum cheesy moments. All the actors, are amazing. And the youngest, Mia, they put in her situations, that a normal baby would experience. I think this show could go far. It almost relates to \"Full House\" without the corny moments and music.

This show brings us back to the good ol' days of Lizzie McGuire when your mom would sit and watch an episode with you because it was a cute show that managed to provide a lesson without shoving it down the viewer's throat. Then came the era of the suite life, hannah montana, wizards of waverly place, and the creme de la crap, shake it up. These are more shows your mom rolls her eyes when she sees you watching them and after a while you start feeling embarrassed about it too. These shows mostly were all cute when they started out but as they progressed they got stupider and stupider. It's because these shows all have a gimmick, a shtick they need to make them work and ensue crazy plot lines, usually which involves someone trying to be famous. <br/><br/>The buck stops with Good Luck Charlie because the closest thing they have to a gimmick is that they have a baby sister. It's like on some shows like Fresh Prince, Malcolm in the Middle, Family Matters they have a surprise baby when they run out of ideas, GLC makes an entire show out of that. And it works, for a lotta different reasons:<br/><br/>IT'S A FAMILY SHOW. This might not seem that important but in terms of Disney Channel over the last few years it's a big improvement. Every show has families but they rarely interact and everyone is off doing their own thing. But GLC is about a family and everyone has equal story lines and all their plots all involve each other. Next to that, every member of the family is likable and believable. The main character Teddy is a goody-goody who loves her family, her older brother is stupid but sweet, her little brother is a prankster, her mom thinks a bit much of herself and their dad is a goofball. Every member of the family you could believe is a real person.<br/><br/>The supporting characters have lives of their own! Again, this doesn't seem like a big deal, but Disney Channel has gotten reallllly lazy. In not one, but two of their shows when they got tired of not explaining why the best friend was always at the star's house, they had the bestie move in with the star! To do this on one show is pushing it. When you do it on two, it's pathetic. But we see Teddy's best friend Ivy's parents, she has a family and a house and we see them semi-regularly! Again, it goes back to Lizzie McGuire days when we would see Miranda and Gordo's parents occasionally enough to know they existed. We even see Teddy's boyfriend's parents. It's not the biggest of deals but when they acknowledge that the supporting characters don't go sit in storage lockers when they leave the Duncan house it says something about the show.<br/><br/>It doesn't take place in California. Again this is my personal preference but when they have a show that doesn't take place in California (or New York but it's not the same, New York at least has weather) but this show takes place in Colorado! That means they can have mountains and snow and other things most shows on Disney are too lazy to touch. <br/><br/>Bottom line, it's a great show and just what the doctor ordered on Disney Channel. It's an innocent enough family show that a family can watch it together without the parents feeling like morons and if they have older kids reminisce about Lizzie McGuire. Home run, Disney Channel!

I like the fact that this show is not as over acted as most of the other Disney shows like Wizards or Suite Life or Sonny. The biggest issue I have is that the baby, Charlie, is supposed to be 9 months old, but is obviously more like 2 years old. I mean she is up running around and has hair longer than her oldest brother (played by Jason Dolley who does clueless so well). But, having an 8 month old myself, I can understand how it is easier for the show, an older child can do more and can do it on command, but I don't see why they don't just say the baby is 18 months instead of 9, that I would believe. Bridget Mendler is great as Teddy. I thought she was a huge boon to Wizards and I was quite sad to see her leave, but I guess she couldn't do both. She is very real as a teenage girl trying to be the responsible child in the family, yet still have fun with friends and boys. The casting of the parents is great. I really like the mom. It is possible that I enjoy the show partially because I can relate to her. I really enjoyed the part in the pilot where Charlie dumps a plate of bananas on her own head and later Teddy asks her why they had to have another baby and she answers, \"Because 3 kids was just too easy, 3 is for quitters!\" The one character that is sort of just OK is Gabe the youngest until Charlie came along, who is feeling a bit neglected and jealous. Unfortunately so far he could be lifted out and the show would be just as good, at least from what I have seen so far. The writers really need to put more into him, otherwise he is just filler. I know that Bridget and Jason's characters get more screen time/lines because they are the ones people already like from previous Disney shows, but that is what the draw is, they should still try to make him stand on his own.

While they remain funny, they also seem like they could be people you'd find in real life, and you enjoy TV much more when you don't find yourself constantly questioning the characters existence. For example, many Disney shows use the \"Dumb character\" gag, but feel the need to play him up as the worlds STUPIDEST PERSON. This show has a slower character, but he still remains funny, bearable, and plot relevant. Basically, he can still have good one liners while still being likable as a character. The leading girl (Older) is good too, she isn't played as the super popular or unpopular girl like most Disney shows do, you feel she's somewhere in the middle of the social chain. She actual acts like a teenage girl, not a boy obsessed monster, or super-nerd. She goes through normal teenage issues and the few serious plots are well handled. The parents are done the best. THEY ARE ACTUALLY PLAYED AS COMPITANT PARENTS. That is my biggest issue with Disney parents, they are always either never there, or incompetent at their job as parent. The parents in GLC are stern, but understanding at times, they actually seem like good parents. They even manage to be funny at times.

Obviously GLC is nothing compared to the genius of AD, but the comedy is good enough to be reminiscent of the show, which is shocking.<br/><br/>All-in-all, the acting is decent, the comedy is shockingly decent, and the characters are good.

An absolute hit", "content": "I love Good Luck Charlie. I really think that this is a very funny, very well done family show.<br/><br/>I think GLC embodies a different wave of family comedy than we had seen in previous generations. You can also see this in sitcoms like ICarly, which is another well done family show. That's not to say that the 1980's and 90's didn't have some great ones (\"Step By Step\", \"Boy Meets World\"). Both great shows, and very funny. But I think that I like GLC so much because it's even more cynical and sarcastic than either of them. It's the direction that I would take if I were to write a family show. Get away from the whole \"Full House\" and \"Saved by the Bell\" kind of mold that a lot of family sitcoms followed.<br/><br/>What GLC doesn't do (which many children/family shows tend to do) is treat you like you're stupid. It's as if the writers and producers are more concerned with being family friendly than they are with being funny. Well, GLC isn't risqu\u00e9 at all. There is nothing about this show that I would consider too objectionable for young kids. But it's still a hit. It isn't so terribly watered down so that it may provide a \"moral\", or a family/child friendly plot. It's not hard to suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>What this show does do (and what I mean by this different wave of family comedy) is that you can catch the cynicism and sarcastic wit of the show outright. You don't need to have a \"moral\" layered on so thick that you drown in it. In fact, this show pokes fun at the fact that every character, to include the parents, can take the low road sometimes. It doesn't take life, or for that matter itself too seriously. The Duncan family has no shame and little surprise for their various antics. And that makes the show gold. But with that, there's nothing objectionable about it.<br/><br/>The dynamic between Gabe and the neighbor Mrs. Dabney in particular is funny. Amy Duncan is just overall a great character, and I give props to Leigh-Allyn Baker for playing her so well. Bob and PJ Duncan are also great characters as well.<br/><br/>This show would fare well as a prime time show on a national network. And while a show like ICarly is also great family show, I just can't see it on a network like ABC for instance. I'm sure it would perform well. However, I personally think GLC would \"fit in\" better on a prime time national slot, if you will. Well written, with a great comedic formula. You will laugh just as much as your children do.

So, how does a man, whose job is to take lives in order to protect others, makes a relationship work with a woman who is sworn to save lives, no matter who they are or what they've done? That is one of the central themes of the series as well as Dr. Mo-Yeon's constant grappling with her heart over a man who is always putting his life on the line.<br/><br/>Joong-ki Song brings a wit and charm to the very likable Yoo Shi-Jin. He never takes things too seriously except when the people he cares about are in danger. He has a wonderful sense of humor. He, and best friend, Sergeant Seo Dae-Young, seem to get into trouble a fair amount, leading to some fairly humorous situations.<br/><br/>The equally charismatic Dr. Mo-Yeon is a woman dedicated to her work. She has dreams of becoming a professor but quickly finds herself in a situation that sends her and her medical team to volunteer in the war-torn fictional country of Uruk.<br/><br/>What makes Descendants of the Sun special is that it never gets bogged down in melodrama. It never takes itself too seriously, but delves just deep enough to care about the characters and what might become of them. While there are a few tense situations, the series is equally light-hearted and, most of all, sweet.<br/><br/>I can see why so many people around the world have quickly become enamored with the series as well as with its characters. There are enough moments to make you laugh, make you cry, as well as make you wonder and hope if it is possible for two characters in seemingly opposing professions to be together. It's a fascinating character study into this dynamic.<br/><br/>I have only recently gotten into some Japanese and Korean shows, and for me, Descendants of the Sun is easily my favorite.

The person who showed me the song was speaking very highly of the drama and was even generous enough to provide the episodes. Then I started watching in gratitude mostly and to be honest, I didn't regret that for a moment - but the opposite!<br/><br/>'Tae-yang-eui hoo-ye' belongs to the type of drama that carry a simple story but with its emotional scenes, heartwarming music and soft touches makes it remarkable and attaching to a viewer. It has powerful sub plots running alongside and the visuals including the cast as well as the venues are also an eye candy.<br/><br/>What I liked the most in the story is not the main love story between Shi-Jin 'big boss' and Mo-Yeon - 'the lady doctor' (although it is also emotionally appealing) but the power struggle and the demanding relationship between Dae-Yong and Myeong-Joo. I beleive the actors playing those two roles have done more justice to the roles compared to the main duo. But overall the story is empowered and flows nicely with typical lover quarrels and romantic moments placed perfectly between occasional humor and action. Yes you read right, Action ! \nI'm not talking about the Adrenalin rush you might have felt when Myeong-Joo's recording was played on loudspeaker which was a much needed breakthrough that came with humor. But there were plenty of military scenes and rescue scenarios I was very happy to watch as a boy. One more reason to drop a star in the rating is the poor budget that the producers have got when they have such nice action scenes which are diluted with careless visual effects and props.<br/><br/>But overall this drama is excellent as a love story because it has the perfect blend between pain-joy, hope-disappointment and expectations-reality which is true in a real world love story as well. Yes, there are some over exaggerated moments of romance or maybe action, but it is essential for us to bond with the characters, hope them to do things that we want and to take pleasure in them getting what we want( and occasionally not getting it to break 'our' hearts). It is indeed an emotional roller coaster ride for a spectator and I really liked it. Anybody with a heart , anybody who have loved before can relate to at least one small incident that happens between the couples in the drama and indulge in their own memories - which can be eventually painful - but we embrace that pain with love.<br/><br/>The only exceptional and unnatural character developments that I saw are of the rich-kid doctor and the unearthly attractive tech-mech-doc guy. But that is tolerable ~ it's fun. It also had its emotional moments with bitter truths of life - like when the disaster struck power plant worker took a decision about his life, which is a nice touch additional to the romance, comedy and action in the story.<br/><br/>So to sum up <br/><br/>(+) typical but rich romantic scenes<br/><br/>(+) humor that doesn't bore you<br/><br/>(+) picturesque backgrounds ( I didn't know Urk was at Greece right till the end :/ )<br/><br/>(+) last but not the least ~ Awesome music<br/><br/><br/><br/>(-) can be improved action scenes<br/><br/>(-) a bit more less filler plots<br/><br/>makes 'Descendants of the Sun' a nice story to watch and a pleasant gift to share.\nPersonally I enjoyed a lot watching the sweet romance and love struggles in a drama - which I thought I might never do again.

Boy meets girl... girl instantly hates him... but we all know how it will end.<br/><br/>Our hero is a special forces soldier and our heroine is doctor. Fate sees them thrown into a war torn fictitious country (actually locations were in Greece in some rather stunning locales).<br/><br/>There is, as is usual a buddy to our hero who has relationship with the general's daughter and father does not approve.

The genuinely beautiful Song Hye Kyo and her co-star the handsome Song Joong Ki fell in love ultimately marrying in 2017.<br/><br/>Despite the sometimes trite story line and the unlikely elements in the plotting at its core it is a love story.

Till episode 13, though the plot really didn't let her flourish, she was outstanding. All those complicated emotions was perfectly expressed by her...there was no way to bypass her and bring the other romantic counter part to be the final love. But that's what happened and ruined the whole tension that was built through the previous episodes. There was more chemistry between her and the main character than Kim Da Mi and him.<br/><br/>Ending was really messy, villains lost their charisma, Kim Dong-hee's character(Jang Geun-soo) didn't receive any understandable closure and the final revenge and happy ending was totally shallow and out of the blue, not convincing at all. Kwon Nara's character was totally ignored where she had amazing potential and Park Sae Joon's character was totally lost by the end.<br/><br/>But for the first 11 episodes it deserves applause, the views of Itaewon was eye catching at times and the music brilliant.<br/><br/>It was that unbelievable wrecking ending which just ruined the amazing show that it could become.", "rating": 4, "helpful": "85 out of 108 found this helpful.", "date": "1 April 2020"}, {"title": " Awesome awsome awsome", "content": "Korean.

The skipping forward years in the future prevented the characters from having any character development and it just didn't help the romance at all. Especially the 14th episode was just bad, as it felt like they were trying to present the current situation of the characters in a fast and furious way, editing scene after scene and just blurting out that the main character now loves this girl, out of the blue, but that's that. No explanation was provided for their actions, no background and those four years in the future seemed like they four empty years (I mean even the flashbacks that the male lead was experiencing were from four years ago or of the same day, like nothing happened in those four years). Another factor that didn't really help with the love story was that the couple didn't have chemistry. They didn't have any solid heart-racing moment either. So, them getting together was just too random and forceful.<br/><br/>Finally, the characters remained the same as they were presented at the beginning of the drama. We knew the bad guys were bad and that didn't really change, although, the son did have some potential to demonstrate why he was the monster he turned out to be, a potential that was never really properly explored. The big boss and enemy of the male lead felt also more like a promise of a bad character after all. He sure was mean to the main character and seriously unlikable, but, in the end, his actions were left in the behind the scenes grey area. The main character, in addition, showed zero development. He even got a bit boring after a while and felt a bit too bland in others.<br/><br/>Now, for the good part of the drama. The beginning was just perfect. If you like melodrama, like I do, where the main character hits bottom and gets unfairly treated in order to stand up to his own two feet again and take matters into his own hands, then you are going to love the first half of the drama. The revenge plot was very satisfying as well, with a solid ending that was nicely presented. Though, it would have been nice if they showed how they actually managed to succeed, as the first part of the drama had focused on the struggles of them setting off. Another part of the drama that was pretty good was the characters. The members of the crew were unique and the drama didn't shy off from issues like racism and gender identity. So, it was refreshing to see those elements added in the plot. The female leads were delightful too. They were strong women, the one beautiful but a tragic character, and the other young, fearless, reckless and somehow, likable. Sure, she did some questionable things, but she was young and just too full of herself, so it was nice to see how the others helped her realize that her attitude wasn't always right and to grow up. I've also seen some other viewers not really liking her looks. Sure, she isn't the classic beauty, but, for her character, who was cool and interesting, I think she was just perfect.

You learn a good part about her each episode, which that's saying something considering how much time they have to work with.

I was very pleased to see come back from the pilot episode, and not to worry, he's in nearly every episode so you'll get your fill of him!

Cartoon Network recently debuted the 10 episodes, during a 5-night special event. Streaming platform Stan has an exclusive deal with the network in Australia, and thus released the entire first season altogether.<br/><br/>The ride we're about to embark on, sort of looks like an animated version of the train in Snowpiercer. We follow Tulip, a young girl who spends most of her time designing and playing video games. She wants to attend a coding camp to be able to make the most mind-blowing video game anyone's ever seen, there's only one problem: getting there. Her parents aren't able to take her to the camp and so she decides to run away from home in the middle of the night. Glowing green lights pierce through the dead trees as Tulip arrives at the small town train platform, and boards a mysterious train.<br/><br/>Tulip quickly realises this train isn't headed to camp and finds herself in a dreamlike fantasy world where every new car is a new environment with its own inhabitants and challenges. A giant snowman with a door as a belly, opens his doors and all of a sudden she witnesses a hellscape riddled with cockroaches hunting her down. We're not in Kansas anymore. The other weird thing is a fluorescent number on her hand, which gives Tulip the idea she's here to solve a game. She just doesn't know what the rules are and why there aren't any other players on this train.<br/><br/>She does meet a few other creatures, who will guide and help her get through the endless amount of carriages. The first one to join her is One One, a robotic ball with a British accent. One One can split into two - Glad One and Sad One - this wholesome character is looking for its mother, but is clearly as confused as we are in what or who mother really is. While solving puzzles and moving forward through the train, Tulip and One One meet Corgi King, an actual King in the land of Corgis who is able to talk, but never lost the charming mannerisms of an actual dog - treats and belly rubs included. An interesting trio, that wins you over in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>Tulip meets many other characters on her journey. Some briefly when passing through these truly inventive worlds, some a little bit better when she actually stops to interact with them. In one of the episodes she meets The Cat, a merchant with a double agenda. The game like levels and universes are so fantastical, going from a crystal forrest - crystal giants included - to an underwater society of lubricant blobs.<br/><br/>Random as it might sound, Tulip's story has an emotional core that makes Infinity Train for every age. It addresses the difficulties of divorce and how a child suppresses certain feelings they can't deal with or talk about with a parent. The train seems to be the perfect place to deal with these emotions, as Tulip gets confronted more than once with herself - once even in a mirror world where she has to deal with her reflection. As far as character development goes, this is a feat some live action series can take notes from.<br/><br/>After Adventure Time and Steven Universe, Cartoon Network has another hit on their hands that leaves you wanting more.

For me, book one hit the hardest because it appealed to a lot of specific emotions I had over topics they explored. While my friend who also loves the series had the most attachment to book 2.

One of the running gags throughout the series involves her inability to prepare anything other than \"hotcakes,\" and even those leave much to be desired.

Some think then that Hooterville must be somewhere in the Illinois or Missouri sticks. Others back their way through what they suppose to be the origins of the Beverly Hillbillies and think it must be somewhere in Tennessee and even a few others point out that some of the place names used on the show can be found in central California -- which would explain the 81 degree Christmas temperatures experienced one year in Hooterville. Some of the posters on the board who harbor more sensitive, philosophical tendencies are eager to persuade that Hooterville isn't in any state in the U.S.-but is only a state of mind.

They invented the word 'chic' for Eva Gabor, but she too was at a loss dealing with her environment and by the rural folks who just didn't quite get her as she didn't get them. Of course it helped to have the best hooters in Hooterville, beating even Bea Benaderet's three daughters from Petticoat Junction.<br/><br/>The interchangeable regulars were a trip though. My favorites were Alvy Moore as the brain dead county agent and Pat Buttram the ever scheming Mr. Haney who even got the best of Wall Street lawyer Albert from time to time.<br/><br/>Eddie Albert was one of the most versatile players that the big and small screen ever knew. That man could play everything from gentle hero to some of the slimiest villains the screen ever saw.

The overall premise of \"Green Acres\" started on radio under the title \"Granby's Green Acres\" that was broadcast on CBS Radio as a replacement for the Lux Radio Theatre that aired for 13 episodes from July 3, 1950 until August 21,1950. Created and produced by Jay Sommers and starred Gale Gordon and Bea Benederet.<br/><br/>The television version that it was based on was also created and produced by Jay Sommers and Paul Henning(who served as executive producer) the series lasted six seasons and 170 color episodes until April 27,1971. The overall premise was built around a big city lawyer Oliver Douglass(Eddie Albert),and his fashionable wife Lisa(Eva Gabor)that abandon their upscale Manhattan Park Avenue penthouse and affluent and hectic lifestyle for the rustic and more \"civil\" world of farming in the fictional Midwestern town of Hooterville. Though Oliver is happy to make the transition to farm life,his upscale wife Lisa is less enthusiatic,though she adapts the best she can in spite of her thick Hungarian accent. Of all the running gags that this series had involves her inability to prepare anything other than \"Hotcakes\", and even those leave much to be desired. The other running gag centers around the frequent visits by Oliver's mother(Eleanor Audley) who begs with Oliver to go back to Manhattan to the law business but in turn sides with her daughter-in-law in regards to her son's desire to live the simple life.<br/><br/>Having the series set in the same locate as Henning's \"Petticoat Junction\"(which there were several crossover episodes)that allowed frequent appearances by Edgar Buchanan, Frank Cady, and others. Frank Cady did double duty on \"Petticoat Junction\",and was a guest star on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" before he became a series regular on \"Green Acres\". Oliver's assistant and Farmhand Eb(Tom Lester)was \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" version of Jethro, a doofus who was shorthanded on brains and no muscles. The other mixed bag of weirdoes were The Monroe Brothers(Sid Melton and Mary Beth Canfield)were the carpenters from hell,forever causing chaos wherever they had a project to do but would never quite finished it. Then there was the biggest scam artist of them all,the slimy and unpredictable Mr. Haney(played by veteran cowboy sidekick Pat Buttram who was a regular of the Gene Autry movies of the 1940's and 1950's) who was forever pulling a fast one or con scam out of Mr. Douglass who was forever plying his oily wares at unreasonable prices. Other characters were the County Extension Agent Hank Kimball(played by veteran actor Alvy Moore)who was always giving Oliver Douglass fits when it came agricultural things which the agent had no experience about.<br/><br/>Another inspired bit that was also part of a running gag of jokes was the opening credits of one installment and this went on in several episodes where the names of the episode's writer, producer, creator, and director were listed. One of the directors,veteran Richard L. Bare was part of this. Bare,who was a director of \"B\" movie 1950's standard fare and his work on several television shows,directed more than 166 episodes of \"Green Acres\" that aired between 1965-1971. The writing and production of Jay Sommers(170 episodes) and Dick Chevillat(152 episodes) were also listed on the opening credits as well. Other directors that contribute to \"Green Acres\" episodes were Ralph Levy, Bruce Bilson,and Vincent Sherman. Comedical writing came from Al Schwartz, John L. Greene, Elroy Schwartz, Phil Leslie, Joel Kane, Bob Marcus, Dan Beaumont, Lou Huston, Buddy Atkinson, Joel Rapp, Larry Scott Anderson, along with Stan Dreben and Bobby Bell just to name a few.<br/><br/>Big name guest stars appeared on \"Green Acres\" too.

By the 1969-1970 the network moved the series from Wednesday nights to Saturday nights in an earlier time slot opposite \"Adam-12\" and the long-running \"The Lawrence Welk Show\". And in it's sixth and final season for the 1970-1971 season saw the show moved again from Saturday nights to Tuesday nights where it was opposite \"Julia\", \"The Don Knotts Show\",and \"The Mod Squad\" where it was clobbered in the ratings. The series that replaced \"Green Acres\" for the 1971-1972 season was \"The Glen Campbell Show\" aka \"The Glen Campbell Goodtime Country Hour\",and \"The John Byner Comedy Show\". \"Green Acres\" when it was abruptly canceled in the Spring of 1971 was the victim of CBS' \"rural purge\" of shows that also included \"Hee Haw\"(2 seasons), \"The Beverly Hillbillies\"(9 seasons); \"Petticoat Junction\"(7 seasons), \"Lassie\"(17 seasons); \"The Ed Sullivan Show\"(23 seasons); \"Mayberry RFD\"(3 seasons); \"Hogan's Heroes\"(6 seasons); \"Family Affair\" (5 seasons),\"The Jackie Gleason Show\"(19 seasons), and \"The Red Skelton Show\"(18 seasons).

And for the record, I'm not one of these \"paid\" individuals at the url posted in the review before me (I didn't click it, but urls in posts make me weary anyways). Stargate Universe is a drama about a group of individuals who are trapped on a ship half way across the known universe. The idea behind this show is that the people on the ship are attempting, to the best of their own personal abilities, to find a way for day-to-day survival and how to gain control of this massive intergalactic spaceship. Many on the ship are either scientists or military personal, with a few civilians littered in.<br/><br/>Now where most would say this show is garbage, I disagree. This show is a welcome break from the standard Stargate TV plot line. So far, this season and last, the only goal has been trying to gain control of the ship. They've dealt with some alien life forms and other assorted baddies, but the main arc has always been trying to control the ship so they can get home. Yes, it is incredibly slower paced than the other Stargate programs, but it wasn't intended on being like them. It was suppose to be different, dealing with the intrapersonal and interpersonal issues these people face while staring potential death at any wrong move in the face.<br/><br/>This show gives me a sense of realism (well, as well of one can hope for when watching a science fiction program) when they are faced with problems. There's no room for error. There's no intergalactic space police that can come swooping in to their rescue at the convenient time right after they come back from commercials, they have literally no help what so ever beyond consultation from people on Earth via the Communication Stones. This isn't the hour long show where Daniel Jackson and Jack O'Neill run through the Stargate, pick a fight with someone, someone gets caught or incapacitated or whatever clich\u00e9 tension builder they decided to use this week, they get rescued by their friends and run back through the gate to Earth. It's almost like their playing a universal game of \"Ding Dong Ditch\".<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed Stargate SG-1, I watched all 10 seasons, but after awhile the story structure got stale and it was just the same thing with different people every week. The episodes I enjoyed the most were the ones where someone had to make a personal sacrifice for the betterment of their friends. That's what it's like in real life. It humanized them for me. And that's what SGU does for me.<br/><br/>Now granted, I will admit that the creation of SGU after the success of the new Battlestar was pretty evident, but fact of the matter is that it works for some and doesn't for others. Think of all the shows that got canceled in the late 90s, early 2000s that everyone and their dog has breathed life back into? Family Guy, Futurama, even American Dad. These programs failed on their first run, but had such a successful run in later years that they're now part of the main stream and people are enjoying them once more.<br/><br/>This show isn't for everyone, it's not. If you're looking for fights with aliens or saving the world after the 10 p.m. news is over, you're going to be disappointed. But, if you're looking for something a little different with something familiar to relate with, you might enjoy it. I know I do.

While I certainly don't disagree that it bears a striking similarity to Battlestar Galactica, I don't count that as a strike against it.<br/><br/>Prior shows are always going to have an impact on future shows. Film-making (whether it be TV or Feature) is an art that builds upon itself, and stands on the shoulders of those who came before it. The fact is the Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, and Lost are all GOOD shows, regardless of your impression of it or whether or not it struck you the right way, they were the best of their genres at the time, and even bent their genres into something new.<br/><br/>That being said, to call this show a 'rip-off' or 'carbon copy' of any of those shows is grossly over simplifying things and intentionally misleading. Perhaps we should just create a new genre name, like 'Adult Sci-Fi', so we can get over all these intellectual property theft allegations.<br/><br/>2) Dissimilarities to other Stargate franchises: This review will probably take a lot of heat for this, but - past Stargate shows actually weren't very good. Don't get me wrong, I've watched every episode of SG1, and most of Atlantis (still working on that), and enjoy just about all of it, but even while enjoying it, I was fully recognizant of the fact that it wasn't actually good. It's campy. The acting is sub-par, even when there are good actors in the shows. The sets are generic and bland, reminiscent of the original series of Star Trek, the scripting is packed with fromage, and the plots, no matter how original, were all clearly predictable.<br/><br/>But to a niche crowd (myself included) they were thoroughly enjoyable through a mixture of silly humour, sci-fi gratification, and a unique self-aware self-deprecation. But even so, the cinematography was regularly lackluster, the effects unconvincing, and the ratings carried along by loyal fans.<br/><br/>SGU lacks most of these shortcomings. There is the occasional campy humour, though typically coming from the same character. In that way this one character, Eli, has come to be the only vestige of the old Stargate franchises. This is made believable, though, because this character is quite similar to the people (like myself) who enjoyed the camp of previous Stargate in real life.<br/><br/>3) The mood: Many would say it's much too dark, both in production design and in mood. I say that it's about time. In past Stargate series', no matter how far gone a situation was, no matter how much danger they were in, the show was never EVER tense. It never mattered. Nothing ever really mattered. The characters were always too happy and fun and funny and confident and amicable to be capable of expressing any kind of peril. As such, the plots were always completely hollow. Nothing mattered, because it would all be fine in the end.<br/><br/>The only episode in both original Stargate series' that managed to capture any kind of deep emotional commitment or tension was Heroes, which just happened to be filmed in the documentary style similar to that of SGU. I don't solely blame the cinematography for this effect, though, but instead, for just once, the characters were encouraged to be vulnerable and hurt, like real human beings.<br/><br/>When people are in a serious situation, they get serious (mostly), and their flaws become more apparent. This is evident in this series, as it should be in such situations.<br/><br/>4) The set/production design: As for the dark set design, it makes some sense, as the ship is very old, and trying to save power. In past Stargate, no matter how old something was, it always looked like it was cobbled together the day before. The ancient city of Atlantis looking like it was maintained by a team of maid-bots and carpenters right up until the team's arrival. I will admit that the purposeful gloom goes a bit too far at times, but as far as I'm concerned, that's better than skirting the edge of cardboard box grade production.<br/><br/>SGU is simply a great show. Yes, it shrugs off its past franchise for the sake of its artistic intent, but it does so with wonderful results. The acting is largely superb, and even the episodes that in other shows would be considered 'in betweeners' come off as being some of the best episodes on television (like the episode Human).<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this show to anyone, and I absolutely recommend that past Stargate fans try to leave their preconceptions at the door, and respect it as its own show.<br/><br/>UPDATE: You will no doubt notice a massive spree of negative reviews on top of the 'helpful' pile on IMDb. Please take these with a grain of salt, as they are largely spam generated by a select few alienated Stargate fans who are working very, very hard to get this show cancelled.

It is vast, filled with new, unknown creatures, and emphasizes the basic struggle for human survival in a radical environment.

If you were a fan of the other Stargate worlds, then it is a significant departure. SGU is a drama, and has no intention of using sarcastic humor to make it interesting. It uses the story line and the conflict to make it interesting. You don't have larger-than-life enemies singularly capable of destroying worlds anywhere.<br/><br/>There are glaring differences between this show and Battlestar Galactica, to which this SGU has been compared. In BG, there was one primary enemy (mixed with a good bit of internal political strife). In BG, their home was destroyed; in SGU their goal is to get home.

Now we're venturing into the unknown depths of the universe, and the ship of Destiny is just the right vehicle to take us there.<br/><br/>With the support of the fans, and the network, Stargate Universe may soon have its place among the classics, as a science fiction epic that explores humanity's infinite potential in the universe.

SGU was a mash of Battlestar Galactica and Days of Our  Lives.  New direction? More like lack of direction. Good camera-work? Closer to  vomit-inducing cameraJERK. The story moved along at a snails' pace,  with no subtle or intricate plot developments to make up for it.  Lengthy dialogues ensued throughout the show only when characters were  hurt for no apparent reason. Quite a few scenes were a complete waste  of alloted air time; such as the sex scene between one  barely-introduced character and another unknown character. In a  scenario where teleportation beams are a part of life, logic entails  that the brain of the operations (Dr. Rush) wouldn't treat a mundane  flying camera as if it were completely foreign and marvelous. The  characters' efforts throughout the show amount to nothing in the end,  as everything could be solved if anyone amongst the brilliant team of  SG personnel would think to dial back to Earth. But perhaps the extras  are simply playing themselves, as half of the supposed 'personnel' that  walk through the stargate are dressed like civilians. Where were the  costume designers?  Universe's predecessor, Atlantis, had a far better cast of likable  characters. Strong, smart and talented characters were dropped from the  air so that non-relatable characters could take their place. The  Senator was so annoying and useless throughout the show that when he  sacrificed himself, you couldn't help but feel a wash of relief. The  Senator's daughter did a great job of taking on the role of 'annoying  character of SGU' when he died, as a whole 15 minutes of airtime was  devoted to watching her cry and mourn over a character with no  reputation with the audience. Dr. Rush was presented as more of a  villainous weasel than a genius who imbues the show with a sense of  authenticity -- as SG:1 and Atlantis both had.  Where there was once a quality franchise with a 10-year reputation,  there now stands a truly awful show with complete disregard to longtime  fans of SG, or anyone with eyes, ears and a brain for that matter.", "rating": 2, "helpful": "356 out of 675 found this helpful.", "date": "11 October 2009"}, {"title": " An insult to SG fans and its history", "content": "After just finishing the episode \"Time\" I am left with an uneasy feeling in my stomach. It was seriously painful to watch but having been a fan of Stargate since its beginning I perservered. Unfortunately I was not rewarded for my perseverance. This episode has had all the same problems that its previous episodes did and it compounded on another with their \"brilliant\" idea to do everything through the lens of a kino. This horrible idea gave me flashbacks of the annoying Blair Witch Project movie.<br/><br/>Lets talk about the other issues that have arisen in this cheap knockoff of Stargate. I've already mentioned camera work so we can start with this. The movement is nauseating, and their angles are often half obstructed. When we move on to characters we all know that there has to be someone that you don't like. BUT, there should be someone you do like. That's not the case here. Every character here is out for their own well being with the exception of David Blue's character Eli. Unfortunately, his character is constantly stepped on and is therefore irrelevant.<br/><br/>This show craves two things. A common enemy and control. Many people are comparing this to Battlestar Galactica but even they had a common enemy. SG Atlantis had the Wraith, and SG-1 had the Gould, Ori, and Replicators. In SGU they are their own enemy. They haven't faced off against an intelligent being yet and its been 8 episodes! Now, in order for them to actually have an enemy to face on a repeated basis they do need to actually be in control of the ship otherwise they'd be sitting ducks. So I wonder why the writers don't allow them to be in control of their destinies instead of just fighting with strange circumstances to barely stay alive.<br/><br/>I(and the other viewers) could really care less that Col Everett is having marriage troubles a million light years away. But, they decided to show that in not one but two episodes. Or, how about that Chloe is mad because her ex-boyfriend and her best friend are together a million light years away? The character development is forced, not naturally flowing.<br/><br/>I could go on but readers get the idea from this and the other 122 negative comments. I will continue to watch this for a couple more episodes but I truly think that the Creators/producers have a decision to make.

Its pathetic attempts at trying to draw more demographics towards it by adding unnecessary drama made it neither a good sci-fi show nor drama. Any attempts by the show's writers to make the audience sympathise with the crew of destiny and its plight fail miserably mainly because the characters are schizophrenic. Col. Young starts by declaring that the mission is to get everyone home then goes on to agree with Rush that everyone should see Destiny's mission through to the end.<br/><br/>And then there's the striking similarities with Galactica. Mind you I stopped watching Galactica midway through the 4th season as I couldn't stand the drama anymore. There's this guy Rush (Carlyle) who if he was called Baius Galtar in SGU it wouldn't surprise me as these two characters are almost identical in terms of morality, paranoia and even their hallucinations. <br/><br/>Then there's the science geek, fat boy, virgin Ely. Another demographic ploy no doubt who finds himself in an impossible situation. An indication of how bad the drama is in SGU is Ely's character. You see, almost everyone in the crew start pairing up and having great intergalactic sex but poor Ely. Then the writers introduce a Lucian Alliance chick, former enemy soldier btw, who gets turned on by his brains. Our man Ely finally gets some action after being blown off by his platonic love Chloe, but then she is killed and her consciousness is downloaded to the ship's computer, BUT WAIT that's not all. In the end she is put behind firewall software by Ely (!!!!) to make sure she behaves with the ship's systems. For that alone SGU DESERVED ITS FATE. If the whole plot of the series was replaced by \"Kino\" (i.e. camera) footage of Ely getting some action the show might even be worth wasting some time on it. <br/><br/>It goes without saying that SG1 and Atlantis had the right idea. The Stargate franchise OWES its existence to actors like Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, David Hewlett and their characters. The fanbase was attracted to such characters and despite the weak sci-fi plot of saving earth for the Nth time people loved it. <br/><br/>SGU tried to rip off the drama elements of Galactica and failed miserably. It's like a game I used to play called Star Wars Galaxies which tried to copy from World of Warcract and then tripped, fell on its own crap and choked to death. Same here.

Stargate Universe is a poorly written soap opera which is set on a derelict spaceship out in the boonies of the universe. The show has had an entire season to grab me and it failed in a very big way. I was a big fan of the Stargate movie written by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, and then I was treated to an excellent 10 years of the Stargate: SG-1 series. After that, the even more enjoyable Stargate: Atlantis series came out and followed the same exciting action/adventure format. But then something terrible happened. The producers of this show (Brad Wright, Robert C Cooper and Joseph Mallozzi)saw the re-imagined Battlestar Galactica series which was trying to create a space based soap opera niche within the science fiction genre, and it has been a dismal failure. That style killed the new BSG, and also its spin off Caprica which was canceled last week. Stargate Universe is a soap opera, make no mistake about that. Its not a very good soap opera either! The ratings for this show in season 1 dropped from an almost acceptable 2.4 down to 1.2 million viewers, and this season it has dipped below 1 million viewers...TWICE. There is a reason for that: the show sucks. Most of the reviews for this show on IMDb are spot on, and the vast majority of them are negative, and that is because the show sucks. Why does it suck? Well, the characters are totally unlikable, there is no science in the show, but there are \"visions\" and magic stones which can swap the consciousness of people on this ship with people on earth. But are there scientists brought aboard? No, there aren't. Those stones have already been used for the \"stranded\" crew to go clubbing and get drunk in other people's bodies, to deal with soapy lesbian relationship issues (yes, lesbian relationship issues), and to check up on cheating wives. The stories aboard the ship are uninteresting because they make no sense and they leave too much unresolved. Its forced drama involving unlikable characters on a boring ship which has no real purpose.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: This show was created as a marketing trick to draw in the orphaned Battlestar Galactica fans by taking the already successful action/adventure format of Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis, dumping that for soapy drama and gratuitous sex scenes and religion and politics, and FAILING to either draw the BSG fans or to keep its original Stargate fanbase. As a result, the show is on the verge of cancellation due to horrible ratings, and the producers have evidently HIRED people to go out and write reviews and pump up the shows. I found proof that they are doing this here: http://sgurocks.com/?q=node/226 and IMDb is specifically mentioned.<br/><br/>This show is not art, it is not for thinking people, it is not for science fiction fans, and its not good enough for the soap opera fans.

Ever since the new producers took it over (Texas season), it has made my blood boil. So sad to let go.

I think the show is designed to challenge the chefs in ways that they are not accustomed to but yet, the effect is the same as things that happen every single day in the kitchen. THe challenges force the chefs to look deep within themselves.

I was surprised when I read that three seasons were already over over there. And therefore, I cannot comment much on the second season and the later season of the show.<br/><br/>Top Chef is a light-hearted show. It doesn't focus too much on drama like other reality shows do. Many people want more drama in reality shows in America, I think so- that's because many of the shows over there focus more on humor.<br/><br/>But once they have a trip to India, they would realize how much drama the audience is being viewed to in the countries. Daily soaps bring with them tons and tons of melodrama and utter rubbish that now has made me red with fury. Only a few shows are hilarious and make you laugh. Therefore, I have got tired of watching old grannies weeping on the television screen all the time.<br/><br/>Even the reality shows have adopted the new policy of including melodrama in them. We have fights during the shows between the judges and the contestants, with judges walking out of the show, people fainting, everyone weeping and judges yelling at the contestants in a hammy voice that hurts your ears. People are so gullible that they actually believe in these and gives more votes and watch the show with more drama persistently.<br/><br/>Therefore, when I saw Top Chef, I was relieved that it didn't focus too much of drama. The idea is simple, twelve people or rather cooks compete for winning the coveted title of the 'Top Chef' and winning some prizes.<br/><br/>The idea of this reality show isn't that new or unique. We have heard of such shows based on cooking before. Yet, it offers a mild pleasure as you watch the delicious dishes made by the contestants which make your mouth water. <br/><br/>The episodes aren't boring, dull and mundane but not even that great but just good. The manner in which the judges converse with the contestants is sophisticated. They do not yell at the top of their voices but discuss the pros and cons of the contestants in a well-behaved manner. Though there are some snide remarks by the judges, they're not hurting the feelings of the contestants that much ( remember Simon of American Idol).<br/><br/>The problems with this show are mentioned below:<br/><br/>1) Katie Lee looks beautiful but she is a bad host. Her speech seems rehearsed and monotonous and her behavior is like a Barbie prototype. She has no expressions on her face, even when she tells the contestants to leave the show and her conversation with the other judges about the contestants and the food is about nil.<br/><br/>2) The judges don't seem to guide the contestants even that much; they just point out their pros and cons. Unlike Hell's Kitchen, they don't go to the kitchen and assist the contestants and thus, are not their helping hands in any way.<br/><br/>3) In the reunion episode where all the contestants are called back together, there is unnecessary drama created which looks absolutely fake. You can see some of the contestants smiling as they argue with the other contestants. Plus, as there is not much drama in the show, why show so much drama in the special episode? I mean, highlighting the fights and calling them controversies is 'silly' as none of the fights have that much effect to cause a controversy.<br/><br/>Overall, its a good show that is entertaining to watch and a upliftment for a person like me who is exposed to the abominable drama of the daily shows that make you doze off. 7 out of 10.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "8 out of 26 found this helpful.", "date": "13 December 2007"}, {"title": " Would be a good show if not for Colicchio's Bro-Culture", "content": "Let's all be clear.

Each week they have a challenge and a \"cook off\" with the winner lauded by the panel of judges, while the individual deemed the weakest is sent home and takes no further part in the competition.<br/><br/>Yes, here we are in familiar territory with the reality contest model of a group of gradually dwindling people competing for a dream job. Fans of America's Next Top Model will recognise it and I'm sure it has been done many times in other guises in shows I just not aware of. Like ANTM, the contestants want to get a major jump in their chosen career and compete to get it. Each week we have the challenges, the in-fighting, the tensions and then the removal of one of the group. It is a winning approach so I can understand why others have just tried to apply that model to other disciplines \u0096 in this case cookery.<br/><br/>As with ANTM, the subject isn't really important because it the show is driven by the tension tensions between the characters. It may be clever editing but the most is made of the minor snaps at one another and the \"diary room\" comments are used to feed the minor fire. As such it is engaging enough guff that I find easy to watch without actually having to commit any emotion or brain power in watching. Everyone hates some characters and likes others and this is where the entertainment comes from. I confess that I found the judges quite dull and lacking in the sort of character and extremes that other similarly structured shows tend to have.<br/><br/>Overall then a fairly derivative affair perhaps but it is a formula that works and those that like this short of show will enjoy it.

The fact that they shop at Whole Foods rather a normal supermarket would have saved them some money. I was rooting for Ariane Duarte in this season and thought she might make it to finals. I won't spoil who gets eliminated when. I think the fact that your colleagues are not voting you out helps a bit. I found them to be supportive of one another during those tough times like students in a class. In fact, Ariane started out on the bottom and suddenly redeemed herself by cooking turkey, lamb, etc., and she won Martha Stewart's choice during a quick challenge and a guest spot on the Today show. But Ariane's luck can change in a matter of days on this show as it does for some other seasoned chefs. Unlike other reality shows, this competitiveness is rather healthier and more entertaining. During their time, they live together while they are working. Their views and comments are often enticing. The culinary world is tough in itself and fiercely competitive just as it is on the show.

You can't find it on DVD, can't find it on cable, and can't even locate it late at night in local syndicated reruns. It's hard to guess why the powers-that-be at TV Land or Nick at Nite haven't realized that this show would be popular as part of their lineup.<br/><br/>Anyway, this show set itself apart from many of its era by its semi-unpredictability. Every plot didn't have a happy ending, and there wasn't necessarily a \"good\" lesson taught to the viewer by the end. For example, in one episode when Flo enrolls in night school to finally earn her high school diploma, she has trouble concentrating on her homework, and is \"forced\" by Alice to stay home and study. Rather than provide the viewer with the happy and P.C. ending where Flo realizes the value of an education, the episode concludes with her sneaking out the window to go on a date. Presumably, Flo never gets that diploma.<br/><br/>The show did a good job presenting a blue-collar \"diner\" setting. None of the waitresses were beautiful, and outside of the endless parade of famous guest stars, the clientele shown in Mel's fit well with that of a '70s greasy spoon in a city like Phoenix. Supporting characters such as Henry and Earl -- everymen in all senses of the term -- fit in well with this motif.<br/><br/>Each character brought something to the show. Alice was the sensible single mom with big hopes and dreams. Vera was the childlike ditz. Flo was the outspoken, aging, oversexed country woman. Mel was gruff and selfish, but was kind-hearted beneath the surface. \"Kiss my grits\" became a household phrase.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, with Flo's departure, the show took a steady turn downhill. Diane Ladd's Belle and Celia Weston's Jolene were nowhere near as colorful as Flo, and as a result, the plots started to slip, as well. A lot of the later episodes were stupid and downright embarrassing. Many of the early elements that made this show great were simply missing in the later years.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a very entertaining show, and it's a shame that it can no longer be found.

Theme sung by Linda Lavin.<br/><br/>Based on the Oscar winning 1974 film directed by Martin Scorsese and starred Ellen Burstyn and Dianne Ladd under the title,\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\",this was to become the front point of the television series \"Alice\",which was basically done under the same title,but with a different cast and different setting. For the astounding nine and half years that it ran on CBS from the premiere episode on August 31,1976 to the final episode of the series on July 2,1985 after producing 212 episodes,\"Alice\" was one of the shows that was part of the network's powerhouse lineup of shows during the decade of the 1970's,which included \"One Day At A Time\",\"All In The Family\", \"The Jeffersons\",\"Kojak\",and the medical drama \"Trapper John,MD\".<br/><br/>\"Alice\",was basically the forefront of the selection of \"Good Blue Collar Comedy Shows\"that emerged during that decade. This was a show that got to see the goings on behind and in front of a working establishment(a family diner)with the situations that occurred between each of the characters. It may have been a trashy sitcom to some of its critics,but for one it didn't rely on politics nor for that manner a lot of slapstick neither. But it was the focus of everyday people and everyday situations that kept the show in top of the Nielsens for the nine years that it ran on the air. Not to mention audiences also got the chance to hear Broadway sensation Linda Lavin singing abilities to boot as well as her acting chops. Also during its run,\"Alice\" garnered 16 nominations including several Golden Globe wins for Linda Lavin,Polly Holliday and not to mention here Vic Tayback. Not bad for a show that was CBS' top rated sitcom during the mid-1970's and well into the mid-1980's when the show was at the peak of perfection. <br/><br/>Here you had a host of characters that were sensational to watch as Alice Hyatt(Linda Lavin)puts up with Mel Sharples(Vic Tayback)and his male chauvinistic ways of thinking better than any woman on television. In other words Mel may have the upper hand,but in each sly and repulsive remarks he gives her,Alice gets him right back! Also,there were others that worked at the diner as well...you have dingy,innocent simpleton,naive and strangely weird(but cute)Vera Gorman(Beth Howland),then you have the Texas firecracker and the true definition of Southern country and Southern pride Florence \"Flo\" Jean-Castleberry(Polly Holliday)who was dynamite at getting back at Mel's views of thinking and the ONLY one that Mel couldn't keep her mouth shut,since she always had an opinion of what was on her mind at any time and would relate to the others about it. In other words,she was an high-octane nymphomaniac and the perfect foil for the street-tough New Jersey-bred Alice Hyatt. In other perspectives,Flo was an even better foil for Mel,and never hestitates to retort him with some valuable advice.....The phrase,\"Kiss My Grits\"!,became an national outcry when it was mentioned. However,the show did have a split personality until 1980,when Polly Holliday left the series,and went into her own spin-off of \"Alice\" titled \"Flo\",which lasted one season,and after that fiasco,Holliday was never heard from again. It was Polly Holliday who kept the show in the top of the ratings for the first five seasons of the show(1976-1980)and then the unthinkable happen.<br/><br/>After Holliday left the series in 1980,the show started to declined in the ratings and likely so. During the 1980-1981 season,Dianne Ladd(who was in the original 1974 film)appeared as Belle which was basically okay,but the show slipped even into a abyss during the last four seasons of the show. During the 1981-1982 season,a new waitress named Jolene was just as dumb as they come(Celia Weston)who remained on the show until the final episode of the series in 1985. Only actors Linda Lavin,Vic Tayback,Beth Howland,and Phillip McKeon(who played Alice's son Tommy)remained on the show for the remainder of its run. Cameo players such as Andy(Pat Crenshaw),Travis(Tom Mahoney),and Henry (Marvin Kaplan)were valuable assets which went great with the guest celebrities that were on the show too like George Burns,Martha Raye, Telly Savalas,Art Carney,and Ruth Buzzi. The final episode of the series came after a nine and-a-half years on the air on July 2,1985 where they had a montage of some of the best episodes and also all of the celebrity appearances. It also showed Mel leaving his diner after years in the business and selling it to someone else. At the end,Alice buys the diner and restores the business after Mel calls it quits.

I had no knowledge of the related movie,\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\", but it didn't matter,I just knew it was funny! <br/><br/>There were two 70s TV mom's that reflected my mother's situation at that time,Alice Hyatt and Ann Romano of \"One Day At A Time\". Like Hyatt my mother moved our family out west but it wasn't due to losing a husband, it was a divorce like Ann Romano's. So,I could relate to what Tommy,Alice's son,was going through being raised by one parent. <br/><br/>Alice was a wanna-be singer and never said no to a chance to belt one out. Similar to other sitcom leads back then,she was always the one that everyone asked advice from. (Others were Benson &amp; Alex Reiger of TAXI).<br/><br/>Flo was of course,the first female on TV (aside from possibly Rose Marie on Dick Van Dyke) to be totally open about the fact that she fools around and is middle aged and single. Vera was the almost unbelievably naive' woman in her early 30s,who seems to not have to good a grip on reality sometimes. Like when she thinks George burns is actually God,like he played in the movie \"Oh,God\".<br/><br/>Vic Tayback does a great comic turn as Mel (he played him in the film) and showed that he could be funny. A big change from all the \"heavies\" he played in movies and TV cop shows. <br/><br/>My favorite show was,\"Good Buddy Flo\",where Flo has Alice teach her to drive a rig to impress her trucker boyfriend. Only to end up driving right smack through the front door of Mel's Diner! I saw this in a rerun a few years ago on the now defunct \"Nashville Network\".<br/><br/>After Flo left yes,the show lost a very funny character. Then came Belle (played by Diane Ladd who had played Flo in the movie),she lasted a season and was replaced by yet another Southern accented waitress Jolene. <br/><br/>In the last few seasons it was moved all over the schedule (sometimes Wednesdays!)but I still kept watching until it's end in March 1985, when Mel sold the Diner. <br/><br/>Alice in her early to mid-40s, finally getsthat big break as a singer she's been waiting all her life (and 9 years as a waitress) for. <br/><br/>Vera &amp; Husband Elliot (a policeman) were expecting a baby and told Mel it would be named after him. Jolene's future was uncertain but she and the other waitresses received $5,000 farewell bonuses from Mel. <br/><br/>They all left the diner in the final scene with Mel,turning off the lights,putting the closed sign in the window one last time and locking up.<br/><br/>10 stars for this show,a classic,which is now (2008) being rerun on ION-TV.<br/><br/>P.S.: I still live in Phoenix and 1130 Bush Highway where the diner is supposed to be is actually stretch of road on an Indian Reservation, although...there was a Mel's Diner near downtown Phoenix but it's long gone.

Linda Lavin has stretched as a character actress whether in small, supporting, featured, or leading roles. Linda Lavin is a comic gem. Doug McKeon who plays her son, Tommy, is the brother to Nancy McKeon better known for her role as Jo on \"The Facts of Life.\" Whatever happened to Doug anyway? Well, Vic Tayback is brilliant as Mel Sharples and the casting of American legendary entertainer, Martha Raye, as his mother is something I have never forgotten. The show re-introduced Martha Raye as a sharp-tongued wise mother to Mel. The show I remember aired on CBS Sunday nights with the likes of \"The Jeffersons,\" and \"All in the Family.\" After 9 years on the air, it came to an end. I loved Polly Holliday as Flo with one of the most memorable catchphrases \"You can kiss my grits.\" I never had a grit. The show was memorable also for lovable Vera, likable Jolene, and Diane Ladd's role. Although it worked best with Vera, Flo and Alice, Flo's show never took off and she should have returned to the show.

It made you want to move to Phoenix which is probably one of the reasons that Phoenix is over a million in population.

To be truthful, if Holliday and Vic Tayback had done the show without Linda Lavin, I wouldn't have been upset. I have always believed Lavin was responsible for Holliday's departure. Was hasn't E! done a \"True Hollywood Story\" on a show that can rival \"Three's Company\" on cast changes? Surely if they have the budget to profile porn stars, a one hour \"Alice\" special can't hurt.<br/><br/>Diane Ladd was a good replacement as Belle on the show, however, she was terrific playing Flo in the movie \"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,\" which the show is loosely (and I do mean \"loosely\") based on. When Celia Weston first appeared as Jolene in 1981, I changed the channel. It's amazing that the show went on for more four years before being cancelled in 1985.

So far, my favorite was where Adam Scott played John Wilkes Booth in the recreation of the Lincoln assassination. Some recognizable names play some of the historical figures; Jack Black was great as Elvis, Dave Grohl as Elivs's lackey, Jonathan Ames, Adam Scott, and Will Forte as Junius, John Wilkes and Edwin Booth, and Fred Willard as 'Deep Throat' in the recreation of the Watergate scandal. The funniest part, to me, is the dialogue the drunken historians give the historical figures that the actors then lip sync.

Acting drunk is likely not easy while at the same time having to recite lines that I guess are meant to become lamer by the minute.

And it's great to remember what being a kid is -- kids love fantasy, stories, the unusual and fantastic. Add too much explanations and you loose the charm of a comedy. Well, this just to put in in perspective.<br/><br/>Personally, and as an adult who loves both good family comedy shows and then stuff like Sherlock BBC or Supernatural, I thought the show was funny, charming, engaging, and got better with every episode. Sure Nora's laser eyes at the pilot seem cheesy at first, but when you let yourself sit back and enjoy the show for what it's intended to, well, the family grows on you real quick. Especially the kids, they're the most ridiculous things. I ended up seeing the entire first season in one night, and that's a lot, considering I'm not the target audience, right? Anyway, I can't wait for the next episodes and really hope the show gets renewed for more seasons to come, my rating for it ranges between a 7-8, but as a kids show, I'd give it all 9.<br/><br/>Enjoy and ignore the person who gives off the idea that art is a joke to them, no show objectively deserves a 0, people have been putting time and effort and love in creating this thing.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "29 out of 44 found this helpful.", "date": "8 December 2013"}, {"title": " Much better than the usual", "content": "The Thunderman's doesn't pretend to be allegory or high art, it is what it is, a whimsical, cartoony half hour of fun. It successfully combines the family sitcom with the Superhero genre and creates a happy middle ground that has the requisite absurdity of a teen/preteen sitcom. The basic idea is simple, a superhero family, much like the family in the 'incredibles,' right down to the young boy who's superpower is speed, retire to the suburbs. <br/><br/>The main protagonists are the Twins: Phoebe and Max. Good girl Phoebe is being prepped to enroll in Superhero U, while Max the black sheep of the family has plans to be a Supervillain. <br/><br/>Max even has his own secret lair( the basement ) and a sidekick, Dr Colossus, who once was his fathers arch enemy but somehow has been turned into a cute little Bunny and steals most of the scenes he's in.<br/><br/>All of the characters are stereotypical, in the usual sitcom way, augmented with super powers which gives the show its edge, as does the idea that Hank may be the typical ineffectual TV Dad but at the same time use to be a guy who was out saving the world. <br/><br/>The show doesn't pretend to make sense, after all a dad who can fly( with no Plane or nothing ) to Bangkok for some real Thai takeout dinner isn't supposed to make sense, so a fantasy aspect is baked into the cake.<br/><br/>11 year old billy is a bit naive while his younger sister Nora is the typical Nick/Disney little girl who is much wiser then her years. She can shoot lasers out of her eyes, which of the five Thunderman is probably the least power, but she makes up for it, with her boldness. When she and Billy team up, she's the brains and he's the Muscle, which is fine with Billy.<br/><br/>The Stories don't pretend to be life lessons, it's the typical Nick/Disney fast paced tween thing. A breezy half hour, in the usual 2 story format.<br/><br/>Max is hardly Supervillian material, he loves his family too much to be truly evil. It seems to be a phase he is going through. <br/><br/>The true stand out is kira, she lights up every scene she's in. <br/><br/>The show is light and breezy and never makes the mistake of getting too heavy. It's a quick paced half hour of cute entertainment full of uncomplicated humor .

Most of the cast is also well-chosen, and every episode offers an interesting plot. The show has a pretty good sense of humour, and the idea of a family with superpowers incorporated into their daily life routine is refreshing and worthwhile. Although I do feel that the characters of the Thunderman family are a bit oddly matched (the two younger siblings look and feel very different from the two older siblings), every character does a pretty good job of playing out her/his role. In addition, the sitcom focuses on the relationship and love between siblings for the most part. This is very refreshing and different from what most sitcoms do.<br/><br/>8/10", "rating": 8, "helpful": "10 out of 15 found this helpful.", "date": "14 February 2016"}, {"title": " Thundermans Has Proved To Be The Best Current Nickelodeon Show", "content": "When The Thundermans premiered, I thought it was just another show about a family with a secret. I may have felt like it was a copy Wizards of Waverly Place. But Thundermans proved me wrong. It proved that it had its way of taking a seemingly common theme and making amazing twists with excellent character moments that make you appreciate their creativity level.<br/><br/>At first I wished they focused on saving people. But as time went by it started making sense. We've seen them grow. We've seen Phoebe training to become a superhero through multiple episodes. We've seen Max develop through a phase of trying to be evil. He spent season 3 working on an evil chronicle to prove that he was supervillain material; then he got the chance to be supervillain, but made the right choice.<br/><br/>What makes The Thundermans super isn't just the superpowers, it's the chemistry between the characters that comes off so seamlessly thanks to the excellent acting of cast. The writers, the producers and the cast have mastered their characters so well that the show pretty much runs itself. That's what I call great writing. Despite their differences, Max and Phoebe have one of the best brother- sister chemistry on TV. They tease each other, prank each other but if you mess with any of them or any of their siblings, you face the Thunder Twins. Of course Max wouldn't admit he cared about Phoebe during his evil phase but he was always there for her when it mattered. Speaking of excellent acting, the Thundermans cast portrays their characters so naturally. They come off as real people with dialogues that you can actually expect in a normal life situation. Both Kira and Jack have mastered Phoebe and Max so well such that they're basically a version of themselves. Addison Riecke plays Nora in a way that makes you want to rewatch her scenes, not just because Nora is hilariously evil but also because of the way the actress delivers the lines. The Thundermans cast knows how to show emotions and changing situations through tonal variations and expressions unlike many Nick characters who talk in one tone throughout. For example the Henry Danger and Game Shakers characters basically shout their lines throughout. Dan Schneider used to write great shows but now all his shows do is shout, scream and run around the entire episode. I don't know if the problem is the actors or writing and directing. The only other Nickelodeon show with great acting at the moment is the underrated Nicky, Ricky, Dicky and Dawn despite their young ages.<br/><br/>Unlike most Nickelodeon shows that find their humor in stupid plots, jokes and dumb characters, the Thundermans' funny moments stem from smart jokes and cleverly constructed plots. Thanks to almost everyone in the Thundermans family being super-smart, sassy and competitive, they try to outsmart each other, which results in hilarious moments. The only Thunderman who isn't smart is Billy but his funny moments come off as genuine and natural. This is in contrast with dumb characters we find in other shows like Dez (Austin &amp; Ally), Max (Wizards of Waverly Place) etc. All those other shows have an unrealistically dumb character who makes annoying jokes even at serious moments. The Thundermans know how to treat important plots seriously and how to mix humor with action without ruining the importance of a serious moment.<br/><br/>The Thundermans excels with creative, complex plot lines with a lot of details and changes that makes you wonder who they managed it all in 22 minutes. A regular Thundermans episode usually has 3 plot lines but characters are often shared across multiple plot lines and many of the plots intertwine at some point. Yet, despite many plot lines, they manages to accomplish so many plot points such that by the end of the episode, too much has happened. This is not usually the case with shows like Henry Danger and Game Shakers which often have a small bit of a story and spend over 10 minutes doing the same thing such as running around, screaming, shouting, beating a clown or arguing about how to pronounce something. Basically, very little happens in Henry Danger episodes and most of them can be summarized within very few sentences without leaving key details. If you try to write a Thundermans summary, it's not easy because there are so many key details that happen, making it unfair to leave it out. Every moment on the Thundermans are well calculated to add a significant plot and/or character development such that missing one minute would make you lose key plot details. <br/><br/>The Thundermans embraces continuity and consistency. The show runs numerous story arcs across multiple episodes. Something might appear small and insignificant in one episode but then it shows up in another episode and eventually become a major plot line like the Nose Hairalyzer, Max's Chronicle, Cousin Blobbin and Doggin, Chainsaw storyline etc. In most shows such things are brought up to serve that episode's plot but after that you never see them again. The only other show in Nickelodeon and Disney that respects continuity as much is Disney's Liv and Maddie. Very well written. Shows like Henry Danger are so bad at continuity and consistency that they've even managed to give their characters superpowers in one episode but after that, the characters become normal ordinary people. For example, they made Henry Danger indestructible in an episode and gave Charlotte super- strength in another, after which none was ever mentioned again.<br/><br/>Those are just a few of the many reasons that convinced me the Thundermans is an outstanding show that everyone should be watching. If all the Disney and Nickelodeon shows had the level of smart, creative writing that's on the Thundermans, we'd have great kids television.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "9 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "25 October 2016"}, {"title": " Not that good", "content": "I must admit I only got through about half of the first episode.

The depiction of a simple life with hard work, long days, and well deserved rest at supper is perhaps fantasy in today's world, but good to strive for. Micah as a no-nonsense sheriff who has lost an edge to old age, and compensates by packing a sawed-off scatter-gun and common sense to keep the peace. No blood or gore, no entry and exit wounds, who cares? That's why I like this genre of TV, it's simple and plain, but sends a good message of hard work, simple life, and good overcomes evil in the end.<br/><br/>Chuck Connors showed more acting in this show than he did in any other, and seems to have been made for the part. Forget all the gibberish about guns and TV. I love this show, and other westerns, and have never owned a gun, nor do I plan to (unless I take up hunting). That's not the point. The point to me is the lessons taught in these shows, good overcomes evil in the end, and justice is served. Real life? No. But that's why I like to watch these shows - good overcomes evil at least for a Saturday afternoon.<br/><br/>This show, and a couple of others - Virginian and High Chaparral were some of the best TV viewing for me growing up. Emphasis on character building, the Western scenery was just window-dressing to me. Even Bonanza (after Michael Landon started to influence stories more) became a great show emphasizing character building. As a father, I learned from all the fathers in these shows (as well as from my own father) how to be a good father, and help to build good character in my own sons.

Lucas McCain taught his son by example NEVER to use a gun or fight unless it was self-defense.

If the video is colorized, that would be a good reason to not buy it. And I'm not particularly against colorized reprints. It's just that this show truly shined in its B&amp;W mode. <br/><br/>As was demonstrated by Frankenheimer's The Train, a few cinematographers and directors reached a peak of artistic visual clarity during the late 50s-early 60s. This TV show was a good example of that artisanship. Such quality continues to be rare in TV production. You could say it's because TV production has always been a low-funded affair, but such fine art doesn't cost any more than the expensive stuff. What it takes is a highly talented cinematographer and director. That's the rarity, in both films and TV.<br/><br/>Viewers were certainly not jaded back then, nonetheless when a show aired on TV that was clearly well produced, in terms of b&amp;w visual clarity, you can bet we uneducated viewers noticed it, if we weren't yet aware of why we were noticing it. The Rifleman was that kind of show. The screen of our old Zenith b&amp;w console, not a high tech unit by any means, really lit up when this show came on. Like a musician who can take a shabby instrument and make it sing, this quality of production could somehow make our crummy old TV look better than it was worth. A real value, for free and on the air.<br/><br/>The opening sequence to every episode was exciting enough to suck any of us into the TV screen, with the camera dollying backwards in sinc with Connors moving forward repeatedly shooting/cocking his modified, cut-down rifle. No music yet. Nothing but bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam\u0085 `The Rifleman' the seriously over-concerned voice-over would announce. We were hooked, and the western styled orchestral music would begin to play.<br/><br/>What is most striking as I vividly remember this shot now almost 40 years later, is the utter smoothness of Connor's walk and steady gaze as he moved forward step by slow step. I realize it is the exact same style of strong, silent type walk which Clint Eastwood was making a trademark. Funny to think that Connors, not a highly respected actor in circles, was doing this bit just as well as Eastwood did so many times later. Hey, if it works, work it. They had similar body types, and their plain, button-down western shirts fit in the same way. These were not the heavily muscled heroes today's boys are led to appreciate. They were tall, sinewy men, and it leant their characters a certain degree of intelligence along with the brawn.<br/><br/>Westerns were such a solid part of Hollywood movie studios' profit revenue, that's why artistic license was allowed the directors of these independently produced film/TV productions. Leave It to Beaver, believe it or not, was another great example of intelligent writing allowed into a stagnant arena of suburban styled family serials. Just check out the difference between Beaver and Dobie Gillis, as compared to Ozzie and Harriet and Gilligan's Island. The latter were undeniably stupid, one dimensional shows, while the former brought intelligent satire into play.<br/><br/>As I look back, a fatherless child at the time, Connors' brave good guy/bad guy characters really worked on me. This was where I managed to develop a diverse sense of humanity, because the directors and writers were allowed to make these characters and their stories somewhat multi-dimensional. The 60s was a great time, in terms of expanding a very innocent TV audience's view of the world outside our sheltered lives (there was never anything closely resembling CNN or Howard Stern, of course).<br/><br/>Two years after The Rifleman finished running there started a new Chuck Connors cowboy series called Branded. Where The Rifleman was certainly the most violently provocative show on TV, Branded was even more sadistic. As kids we ate it all up. In what is now understood to be a sort of Peckinpah tradition of graphic violence, these shows were the directors' training grounds for such sadistic style. They were really pushing the envelope of censorship.

If you want period realism, go read a book\")as it was an interesting show with GREAT background music by Herschel Burke Gilbert, one of my all-time favorite TV composers. I've noticed that people usually have pretty strong opinions about the show....they either really like it or they hate it...usually those who hate the show focus on the violence (they claim Lucas would kill over nothing, which certainly never happened in any episode)...and those who love the show tend to focus on...well, the violence! I've heard comments like, \"If there were N number of Rifleman episodes, the body count during the show's run would be &gt;N\"...a funny quote, to be sure, but simply not true. In fact, there were episodes where a bad guy would draw on Lucas, he'd sense it, and fire near him to show that \"I've got enough firepower to cut you in half\"..there'd be other episodes when somebody would draw a gun and Lucas would \"sting their hand\" to keep from having to shoot them. (hokey, yeah, but that's TV for ya). You have to remember that the TV audience and the ABC network in particular expected action in its Westerns and crime dramas. The ABC network wanted a lot of action in its shows at that time because they were trying hard to get established as a network and compete with NBC and CBS. Some claim \"The Rifleman\" was something of a gimmick show. It slipped close to becoming one from time to time but the warm interaction between Connors and Johnny Crawford as his son Mark were part of what kept the show from becoming a \"Colt .45\" or \"Hotel de Paree\" period parody. Fans of the show often mention the cinematography. Yes, it was good, indeed. In fact, until I started seeing episodes on DVD, I didn't know just how good the film work was. Was it a grim show? No. Those who really don't care for dramatic, near-baroque background music probably get that \"grim\" idea. Was Micah the sheriff near-useless? Yes, I admit that. Lucas usually ended up being a one-man North Fork SWAT team, to be sure. But man oh man, could a viewer get revved up! They got great character actors like Jack Elam, Martin Landau, James Coburn, and John Anderson to play bad guys...and they'd just work you to this crescendo, just get you where you couldn't wait for Lucas to get out that gun and wail on' em! I'd recommend by-passing most of the last-season (1962-63) episodes of the show. By then, Johnny's Mark was now into puberty, Chuck looks bored and tired of the show (he, in fact, WAS tired of doing it and afraid of being typecast by the Lucas character by then)and although Patricia Blair looks great, the shows are pretty uneventful and stale and they tried too much to play to the Ricky Nelson angle and give Crawford an excuse to sing. \"The Rifleman\" has really aged well, from the dramatic opening sequence right down to the Four Star Banner logo at the end.

Sometimes the show was almost too preachy, but for kids growing up in the late 50's and early 60's it was terrific wholesome entertainment. Lucas McCain taught his son (and all of us) that it's not OK to make fun of people who are different, that sometimes it's better to walk away from trouble, and that the strong should defend the weak. Rarely was anyone shot who not only deserved it but left no other way out. This kind of violence does not, in my opinion, leave any kind of bad impression on youth.

I didn't anticipate the amazing storytelling or the subtle underlying themes. I fell in love. The only thing is, I'm not sure whether it's Lucas McCain, Chuck Connors, or Sam Peckinpa that I'm in love with! Although, Chuck Connors does look a little like Eomer, so there's that. My four-year-old self never appreciated just how lovely-looking the show's scenery could be (and I don't mean the 'New Mexico' landscape!)<br/><br/>Each episode on Prime is given a two-hundred character precis, and many of the are terrible: misrepresenting the episode a giving me a dread that this next episode would ring phoney or cheesy to my now-sophisticated self. Nearly every time I was delighted when the show took a sharp turn just before the moment of cheesiness, and took viewers instead to considering a new perspective, many times a perspective that replaced looming libertarian clich\u00e9s about the independent pioneering spirit of the Old West, with themes of social justice and the need for kindness and community among people. Taking into account that Chuck Connors was a lifelong Republican, a friend of Ronald Reagan's who even campaigned for Reagan, the actual themes and moral lessons of the Rifleman illustrate to what degree the \"Republican\" party of Trump and Pence and the NRA have betrayed their voter base and twisted Republican values into a garish self-serving lampoon. The Republican values of The Rifleman include the equality of all persons regardless of race and immigration status, a faith in justice and its institutions, the effectiveness of gentle non-punitive child-rearing, and the importance of a nation's \"growing up\" beyond the need for citizens to carry guns.<br/><br/>Because, taken as a whole, *The Rifleman* is not a \"western\". It is an epic coming-of-age story. Over five seasons we watch Mark McCain grow under Lucas' guidance, from a cute-as-a-button ten-year-old, to a fourteen-year-old capable of making his own opinions and choosing and working for his own livelihood (while we also get to watch Johnny Crawford grow from cute-as-a-button 12-year-old to teen heart-throb and singing cowboy.) That's pretty good on its own, but it's not the whole story. We get to watch Lucas McCain -- a man with a violent past, a hot temper, and bucket full of grudges and pain -- grow into a man capable of forgiving and trusting and agreeing to disagree. Who fills the r\u00f4le of mentor to him, as he does to Mark? His love interest, of course; and I don't mean Joan Taylor or Patricia Blair. Without ever showing her and with only the rarest mentions of her name, every episode showcases Margaret McCain; and only the most obtuse viewer would miss the clear implication that, with every subjugation of his temper and every grudge forgiven, Lucas McCain is living up to the standard of his long-dead wife.<br/><br/>And there's a bigger picture to this coming-of-age story as well.*The Rifleman* is about New Mexico's coming-of-age.

We see immigrants from the world over coming together as Americans. And we see, and hear overtly, Lucas McCain's hope that the territory will grow up to the point that people no longer need to rely on a rifle or six-gun. It's a message the NRA would like you to miss. It's a vision that neo-fascism wants you to close your eyes to.

The Legend. Remembering The Rifleman television series on it's 60th Anniversary.", "content": "\"The Rifleman\" was the saga of Lucas McCain, a homesteader in the Old West struggling to make a living off his ranch and make a man out of his motherless son Mark McCain. The series was set during the 1870's and 1880's in the fictional town of North Fork, New Mexico Territory. \"The Rifleman\" was the created brainchild of producer Sam Peckinpah along with the production team of Jules Levy, Arnold Laven, and Arthur Gardner who served as executive producers of the series and was produced through Dick Powell's Four Star Television for ABC-TV that lasted five seasons producing 168 episodes all in black and white and ran 30 minutes in length airing from September 30, 1958 until the final episode of the series on April 8, 1963. The series was on Monday nights for the remainder of it's run at the 8:30 eastern/7:30 central time slot. \"The Rifleman\" was historical as well becoming the first prime time Western to show a single parent raising a child.<br/><br/>Chuck Connors, a former professional baseball player and coming off two big major theatrical movies \"Old Yeller\" and William Wyler's \"The Big Country\" won critical acclaim for his portrayal of Lucas McCain and young Johnny Crawford started his career on this series as Lucas' son Mark McCain. Also along with the cast were Paul Fix as Marshal Micah Torrance. But the real star of the show was Lucas' rapid action Winchester rifle that was customized to allow repeated firing by cycling its lever action that can be fired in three tenths of a second which was helpful in taking down the bad guys each week. Though quite successful during its first two seasons the show began to slip by the third season due to the ratings and by the show's fifth and final season it was out of the top ten of the Nielsens,.<br/><br/>Joesph Lewis directed 51 episodes of The Rifleman television series along with Arnold Laven who directed 22 episodes of the series. Other directors were Gene Nelson, Arthur H. Nadel, Don Medford, Richard Donner, Lawrence Dobkin, Paul Landres, Don Taylor, Ted Post, Jerry Hopper and even Chuck Connors directed an episode. Fantastic writers came from Arthur Browne, Calvin Clements, Robert Culp, Albert Aley, Ed Adamson, Bruce Geller, Lawrence Dobkin, Tom Gries, Sam Peckinpah, Chuck Connors, Christopher Knopf and Margaret Armen to name a few. More than 500 guest stars in over 970 credited roles appeared during The Rifleman's five season run with many veteran character actors cast in recurring roles along with some new Hollywood faces that were just starting out also made guest appearances as well...among them Buddy Hackett and Sammy Davis Junior. But the real tone of the show was the kinship and the relationship between father and son provided the balance against the violent backdrop of the frontier. The result was several Emmy nominations including a Golden Globe nomination for the show resulting in one of the best television Westerns of all time.

The music!), left me scarcely able to contain the tears that would have freely flowed had my girlfriend not been around at the time...lol.<br/><br/>In the interest of full-disclosure, for some reason, I seem to be enamored with period pieces such as this.

Too often creative people, especially those who've tasted success (and the monetary rewards) decide to continue with a project past its logical, and worthy conclusion. This explains why we get so many dreadful movie sequels, or, in this case, why TV producers insist on running a show too long - and unfortunately into the ground.<br/><br/>Through nearly three seasons the Cable Girls had everything going for it - likeable characters, good scripts, strong plotlines and quality acting. You couldn't help rooting for the cable girls - and coming back to see how they got out of so many predicaments. The pacing of the show was, like most soap operas, a mix of touching personal moments and big drama. It also touched on many important themes including gay and lesbian rights, abortion and so forth.<br/><br/>Somewhere in season three the writers decided to take an engaging soap opera and go off the rails a bit, jumping the shark as they say in TV, and blowing up the series. It was clearly losing touch with what made the stories engaging and going for over-the-top plot lines at a frantic pace.<br/><br/>After time off, my wife and I decided to give the show another chance and watched season four. Something must have clicked with the creative team behind the show's success and the series returned to intriguing stories within the scope of reason and actually ended season four at a clear and logical place for all the characters. They had redeemed themselves and if you have yet to watch the series, watch the first four seasons and you'll feel good about watching a quality program.<br/><br/>Warning if you watch season five - you're watching at your own risk.<br/><br/>The story shifts to the Spanish Civil war and suddenly we're watching Lidia on the front lines impeccably dressed with high heels and perfect makeup while dodging explosions and gunshots all around her. It's almost as comical as the constant heightening level of danger from one scene to the next as the show becomes a soap opera on steroids.<br/><br/>Seriously, how much can you pack into an episode without it becoming idiotic? And while Carmen, who should have died ten times over, becomes the evil leader of a brutal prion camp at the age of 110, it becomes impossible to take anything seriously as the show intends.<br/><br/>Then comes part two of this absurdly over-the-top soap-gone-bad with five final episodes that range from creepy to the point where you seriously want to bill Netflix for the hours you've spent watching this travesty. Yes, this is a soap opera that has morphed into an absurd action drama (on a mission) now moving too quickly for any level of common sense or logic.<br/><br/>In the end, you have three and a half good seasons and one that absolutely sucks, leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

I've read my share of comics, absorbed my childhood's worth of cartoons and PBS. I've seen the movies everyone else has seen. And yet 'Robot Chicken' is still consistently awful. Like, 'Mad TV' awful.<br/><br/>The appeal of 'Robot Chicken' is it indiscriminately rips from the movies, TV shows, and toy aisles of the last 30 years. It takes set-ups that would have no inherent humor apart from the references, and expects that the references are enough. They aren't.<br/><br/>'Family Guy' has been trying the same thing for years. It isn't that the sketches are seemingly Mad-Libbed into existence - 'Mr. Show', 'Monty Python', and 'Kids in the Hall' took their share of left-field potshots. But those shows brought more to the dialogue than the same catchphrases and traits we already remember. On 'Robot Chicken', Mr. T pities the fool for the millionth time and we're supposed to laugh. Don't be fooled - these aren't 'inside jokes'. If you've kept your eyes and ears open for the last ten years of self-referential popular culture, you'll get 90% of the references. Minimum. Reading the comments, it seems that a lot of people watch this show to catch the references and congratulate themselves. Is that all we expect from a comedy now? Why not just watch your average VH1 special? At least its comedians are funny one out of five times.<br/><br/>Is it edgy? Not by a long shot. Not anymore. 'Wonder Showzen', which could have been a decent couple episodes of 'Mr. Show', is still dragging on with its tired shtick of puppets and children saying calculatedly offensive things. 'Family Guy' is aimed at the kind of audience for whom MY HAIRY AUNT isn't bothersome at all. Who's offended when the Duke boys share a longing gaze? Who thinks the Coreys are sacrosanct? Marvel not at the celebrities fearlessly taking on their public personae... people were jabbing them when they were firsthand famous, and 'Robot Chicken' doesn't even require them to show their faces. It's a chance to grab a bit of attention and an easy paycheck. Almost as easy as tossing a bunch of toys in front of a stop-motion camera and having them fart.<br/><br/>Wit is scarce on this show. The great line delivery of Adult Swim's 'Tom Goes to the Mayor' or 'Aqua Teen Hunger Force' is absent, which kills even the most promising of premises. Even 'Sealab 2021', despite its absurdist tendency to stretch silence into laughter, managed a crop of 'what the-?' plots. 'Jonny Quest' was masterfully inverted into 'Venture Brothers', with plots and characters that stand on their own, apart from their sources; 'Robot Chicken' would have effected a homosexual glance between Race and Dr. Quest. Perhaps it already has. I'm not watching anymore.<br/><br/>'Robot Chicken' is a show for people who own the toys and have a fetish for watching them get snuffed, or people who like watching massively popular culture thrown at them for the same jokes again and again. If Seth Green really wanted to entertain us, he should've shown off his precious toys on 'Cribs'.", "rating": null, "helpful": "9 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "23 April 2006"}, {"title": " Somehow, \"this suuuuucks\" doesn't seem emphatic enough.", "content": "I watched the series back when it was funny; which is to say, when they weren't calling the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee for plot ideas.

And if Seth Green or Mr. Senreich had an ounce of objectivity, intelligence or independence of thought, they'd have had Papa Smurf way up in the New Orleans Hyatt Regency Tree refusing all the help the King offered and basically letting 2-3000 Smurfs die so he'd have something to gripe to the press about.<br/><br/>Just one in-depth example of why Robot Chicken began to really SUCK in its second season... all the raunchy satire about Bush and his daughters, and NO sketches about Obama and his very troubling church life, his early friendship with two SDS bomb-throwers... if they really WANTED to push the envelope of political satire, they could have.<br/><br/>Instead, it's pretty clear that beginning in the second season, Green and Senreich decided to gut Robot Chicken and turn it into a propaganda vehicle to help Barack Obama get elected and rape the American middle class.

Professional smart-ass Seth Green's stop motion twist on the sketch comedy series is certainly random and certainly nonsensical. Enlisting many of his \"Family Guy\" co-stars (Mila Kunis, Seth MacFarlane) as well as anyone he has ever worked with (Jessica Alba, Breken Myer, Sarah Michelle Geller \u0096 the show's credit list reads like 6 Degrees of Seth Green) to voice many of the non-descript characters, \"Robot\" is made of a lot of private jokes and inside baseball that is surely busting up Green and all his buddies, but will leave many others dumbfounded.<br/><br/>Those random flashbacks, once so fresh and original on Seth MacFarlane's \"Family Guy\", get milked of all their initial charm by \"Robot\". The show stacks one random bit after another ontop of each other, several are visual jokes only lasting a few seconds before moving onto the next, until the last half of the show where a particularly elaborate bit of nonsense takes us to the end. Green isn't commenting on the ADD generation, he's playing to it. Nothing wrong with that structure, in fact the show's short attention span and a mercifully short 10-minute running time afforded by The Cartoon Network go a long way to make the show work as well as it possibly can. Green has apparently learned well from McFarlane and his mimic ability to know how short to cut a bit as well as a bleeped-out obscenity from an unlikely character lend the show its best laughs. That MTV-fast style may first appear to be the cure for the common sketch comedy skit that overstays its welcome.<br/><br/>It is where Green chooses to focus the show that doesn't work for me. As if he watched MacFarlane strike gold with late 80s sitcom parody and said \"I don't know we could do that\". Some of the one-joke gags are not bad, but the majority of \"Robot's\" targets are limited to sitcoms, cartoon characters, and commercials from the late 70s and 80s. In Green's creative regurgitation, all the childhood generation-X targets get a retread here. Optimus Prime and the Transformers? Yep, they are here. Endless Star Trek, Star Wars, Superman and Ghostbuster jokes? You know it. An idea that simply making a reference to William Shatner is funny? Lots of mileage out of that. \"Dragonball Z\"? Check. Corky from \"Thirtysomething\"? Hey, what lame Gen-X show would be complete without making fun of Corky\u0085 again. It's all here. We have seen this stuff before and if it can be done better - it has been.<br/><br/>The show gets a big kick out of referencing things that will go over the head of an older generation. But I'm part of the generation it is aiming at and it strains to make me laugh on its good days. And that is the stuff Green does the best. When the show delves back into something before its time the jokes reek of a 3rd hand \"I'm told I should make fun of this\" feeling. On the brief occasions when it tries to take on something in this century (the occasional George W. Bush joke), it falls even farther onto its face.<br/><br/>\"Robot's\" animation style, part clamation and part plastic doll stop motion, is visually fun to sit and stare at. There is a giddy little thrill to watching cereal box characters blowing each other's brains out in a screaming bloody gun battle. But that's all you get. Icons associated with innocence given a violent or raunchy twist. Rinse and repeat until the novelty wears off. That single-joke stretched to series length would be derivative enough, but mix it with Seth Green's own insufferable brand of smug, smart-ass, call-me-clever, style and it mutes all of the many possibilities for really clever laughs.<br/><br/>* * / 4", "rating": null, "helpful": "9 out of 18 found this helpful.", "date": "21 October 2006"}]}, "/title/tt2155025/": {"title": "Please Like Me", "reviews": [{"title": " Well rounded and surprisingly touching", "content": "Do not judge this show by the first episode.

Josh only begrudgingly comes to terms with this and he doesn't really feel like really having a proper coming out because the concept is 'so 90's'. As it happens, his best friend's colleague is only too happy to help Josh on his journey of self-discovery. This despite him seeming to be out of Josh's league looks-wise. That's not me being mean, that is something repeatedly stated in the series, by Josh himself.<br/><br/>Josh is an interesting character. He tries to avoid conflict, but is also outspoken, and he keeps finding himself in situations he does not quite want to deal with. He is a bit aimless still, apparently studying \u2013 though we never see him do it \u2013 and he doesn't have a job. His parents keep him afloat financially. He's smart, funny, stubborn and maybe a bit lazy.<br/><br/>The other character who plays a central role, especially during the second season, is Josh's mum (Debra Lawrance). She is suffering from manic depression. This leads to scenes that are sometimes funny, sometimes heartbreaking, and she gives Josh plenty to worry about. We see her at her worst and also as the ultimately normal person at the core, who is just trying to cope with her illness. Rounding out the main cast are Josh's anxious, ineffectual dad and his feisty new wife, Josh's ex and his roommate best friend who is amusingly bad at expressing himself when it comes to emotions.<br/><br/>They're a sympathetic bunch, well-portrayed and dealing with relatable crises.

You will enjoy hanging out with them, even if you may be happy that you don't have to live with them full-time.

Cow violence, though a grave matter, are heavily exaggerated as the official policy of the government cause of radicalisation among muslim youth whreas in actual there has not been a single instance of such radicalisation (remember the series claims to be inspired from real events).

Believe it - Comedy Central wasn't paying him ridiculous money because the show was just good. It was and will always be LEGENDARY.<br/><br/>Most sketch comedy shows are hit and miss. Kids in the Hall and SNL in its prime in the late 80s and early 90s are the closest that shows have come to the hilarity that is Chappelle's Show. Only Chappelle can turn an already legendary figure Rick James into a whole new level of legend, absolutely REAM R. Kelly, beautifully spoof both Law &amp; Order and the reality of white collar crime vs. ghetto crime in one fell swoop, and after leaving the show, have a 2Pac skit that's easily among the best skits he's ever done solidify his legacy (notice the tremendous irony in that?!). There is no unwatchable Chappelle's Show episode...even if some skits aren't THAT funny, almost all of them are at least somewhat funny, and there's generally at least one very funny skit in each episode if not most or all of them. There's more than enough horrible entire shows of SNL, Mad TV, and Frank TV.<br/><br/>Most shows start off weak before they hit their stride (most pilot episodes of shows are ironically pretty bad compared to the rest of their runs) but Chappelle had probably one of the strongest outlandishly funny pilots of any show ever (South Park is pretty close). There was no doubt that something special was going on right from the get-go, and Chappelle never failed to deliver.<br/><br/>Some people would say perhaps it's best that the show didn't live a long life because most shows that have age like an old ballplayer still believing they can outplay everyone else. I think any true fan of the show would disagree...Chappelle has been a funny guy since back in the Robin Hood: Men In Tights and Half-Baked days and I'm pretty sure he would have still kept his knack for comedy for many more years if he kept the show going.

I was introduced to the show on The Comedy Network in Canada, where I started seeing ads for it, and eventually started watching reruns. Obviously, it didn't take long for me to see that it was a crude, very politically incorrect show, but I had seen and enjoyed that type of comedy before, and found this show pretty funny overall. It was basically the same when I recently decided to watch episodes on DVD after not seeing any in a while.<br/><br/>Each episode in seasons 1 &amp; 2 begin with Dave Chappelle coming out in front of a live audience. As the host of the show, he does some brief stand-up comedy and presents a series of sketches. Each episode features a number of sketches, often involving racial stereotypes, and sometimes also involving drug addiction, sex, toilet humour, political satire, movie spoofs, celebrity spoofs, etc. These sketches feature characters played by Chappelle, and characters played by others, sometimes recurring ones in both cases. Some of the episodes have a performance from a hip hop artist to close it off. Season 3 contains only three episodes (the \"Lost Episodes\"), each featuring sketches filmed before Chappelle quit, with Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings (two cast members of the show) as the hosts in front of the live audience.<br/><br/>As I stated above, the sketches often involve racial stereotypes, so there's lots of controversial content. Stereotypes of different races, such as Black, White, Asian, and Hispanic, are included, so you can't say it's one-sided, but it still has offended. Personally, I think some of the sketches are uncomfortable, such as the one where a white guy moves in with a bunch of black roommates, and they torture him in different ways and kill his father. Fortunately, however, it doesn't usually get this rough. For the most part, I have gotten a good amount of laughs out of the show, and have sometimes found hilarity in it. Highlights for me include Tyrone Biggums, the recurring crack addict character (didn't care much for the first sketch with him, where he talks in front of a class, but his second sketch, where he comes to what he thinks is a free crack giveaway, I think I could call hilarious), the clever sketch suggesting what the Internet would be like if it were a real place, the \"Deep Impact\" parody, Lil' Jon (another recurring character who shouts, \"Yeah!\", \"What?\", and \"Okay!\" repeatedly, which I find funny, though some could find it annoying), and the R. Kelly spoof (even though it's pretty juvenile).<br/><br/>Apparently, Dave Chappelle quit the show during the making of Season 3 for a variety of reasons, including stress, an uncomfortable work environment, and loss of creative control. Later, he was considering the possibility of returning to finish the third season, but not if Comedy Central aired the material without him, which he said would be a \"bully move\". Unfortunately, that's just what they did in 2006 (though I have to say some of these sketches are highlights, such as the one where he gets revenge on his ex-girlfriend), and I guess that made it official, it was over. Too bad Chappelle had to go through so much trouble, leading to a tragic end for the show, but fortunately, some very funny stuff was made for the show while it lasted, and it can be remembered as the bold, edgy show it was (or is). While the show may overdo it with the controversial subject matter (or just not do it very well), toilet humour, etc. at times, and I'm definitely not as big a fan as many others, I have to give it credit for making me laugh, and probably for pushing boundaries as well.

The characters are strong and able to draw you in, the atmosphere and setting are captivating, and the music is simply top-notch. When all are tied neatly together it makes for a wondrously entertaining season. <br/><br/>And how could one forget: the comedy! Whilst of course it is entirely subjective, I found every episode to be wholesomely amusing. Every character is entertaining in their own right and not a single line seems unfit for purpose. The humour was exactly to my liking and did not fall into the trap so many comedies today do in which they attempt to be hilarious and unfortunately end up just being silly.<br/><br/>As expected, however, it is not perfect. One particular instance in which I found myself to eventually drift-off was the Rodrigo-Anna Maria sub-plot. I did not find this to be interesting, rather I thought it tiresome. Despite both characters being excellently written and the acting being spot-on, this didn't quite engross me like the rest of the show did.<br/><br/>In addition, a criticism I have (perhaps a minor one) pertains to the memorability of the characters. Specifically: their names! Maybe it was just me but halfway through the season I still only knew a couple of the characters' names. This could be in part to blame on my binge-watching manner, or, more worryingly, the writing. Regardless, I consider these to be minor blemishes upon the finished product.<br/><br/>Let us end on a high note: the music. The music is what makes this so fresh. If it weren't for the music, I do believe this would just be another average comedy. The music adds something more, a passion, as Rodrigo may say.

There are many interesting themes of art and its patronage and the every-day people who have committed themselves to a purpose not often understood. <br/><br/>The acting is superb all around. I personally loved Lola Kirke, and thought she was a fresh take on an often boring trope as far as female leads go in comedy shows. While slightly naive, her character still possessed a great amount of self-awareness, perseverance, and depth to set her apart from so many other female characters. Gael Garcia Bernal was fantastic throughout. I have to disagree with others who thought him to be over the top. I felt that his character was very genuine, and a great contrast to his wife, who showed a slice of his previous self. The supporting cast are also fantastic, without a weak leak in the bunch. Even the \"quirky roommate\" (which is an exhausted character) is played with new layers and a refreshing depth by actress Hannah Dunne.<br/><br/>I will admit some of the writing comes across as clich\u00e9d.

I expected pop, rap, rock, house, bebop, and even disco, glorifications and total dismissal of all classical. How luckily wrong I was!! These series are probably one of the best and closest presentations of classical musicians' struggles to make it, to get known, to survive, to bare their soul for food, to do anything and everything and to forgo any pain and any doubt for the privilege to play music, to agree to any music job so they can live, and to serve and worship at the alter of music without any commercialism.

A brief segment showing the children's orchestra sawing out Beethoven's 5th is the more familiar experience we have in concert halls. This is a show that puts classic music on the altar it deserves, omitting the sacrifice and hard work that produces it. It makes us believe that all of us could raise a baton transport ourselves and an audience to Nirvana, and that's okay with me. \nAs well, the production itself is superb. When we leave New York for Venice, Mexico and Japan, nothing is lost. But there's nothing better than watching Bernadette Peters strutting through the Guggenheim like she owns the place (she owns just about any space she inhabits). And spending time in Venice with Ana Maria Martinez is all too brief but the farewell episode with her floating on a barge down the canals of Venice to collide with Placido Domingo was epic.\nI was smitten by Lola Kirke's awkward portrayal of Hailey Rutledge. But compared to Bernal's extravagant performance, as well as the rest of the cast (peppered with New York's glitterati), she gets a little lost in the swirling magic that producers Coppola, Schwartzman, et al., have bravely assembled. They deserve our thanks. This was a long shot that has a grand pay off for viewers..", "rating": 10, "helpful": "9 out of 13 found this helpful.", "date": "10 March 2018"}, {"title": " Pitch perfect", "content": "This review is based on the first six episodes of the first season. I like this series so much that it's hard to see it objectively. I like it so much that I'm not bingeing but rather rationing myself to a meagre 25 or so minutes each day. So, what makes it quite so enjoyable? Firstly, it's genuinely good - a perfect cast delivering tonally perfect performances with a script that delivers reality plus a few extra percentage points. Occasionally, it's laugh out loud funny but mostly it's genuinely affecting. This is no guilty pleasure in which you know you're being manipulated but you're going along for the (very fun) ride. This always feels real, grounded. There are a few stereotypes amongst the smaller roles but the big ones, the roles that anchor this series, are well written and perfectly cast. Lola Kirke is a wonderful lightning rod, if gaining weight by the episode; Saffron Burrows is fine, if somewhat less interesting than in her pre plastic surgery roles; Bernadette Peters is terrific; Malcolm McDowell is the perfect exiting Maestro. And then there's Gael Garcia Bernal. As an outsider, I have no idea how much of his character was on the page and how much was his own invention but the results are spectacular. He makes this series. His portrayal of Rodrigo, the infant terrible of the conducting world, is nothing short of brilliant and creates, most appropriately, the bright star around which everything revolves. Mozart in the Jungle is not highbrow entertainment. It doesn't challenge or confront. It works its magic more subtly, and sometimes more effectively. It's a feel good show in the best possible way. Real, not fake. It likes its characters, for all their flaws. You could do worse.<br/><br/>ADDENDUM I've now watched the final four episodes, during which I mentally knocked off a point (episode 8) and put it back on for episode 10. Episode 8 is by far the weakest. It's not that it's bad, it's just that its sensibilities suddenly resembled humdrum American TV and thus became deeply unnerving. It's as though the writers had forgotten, or worse had never understood what made this series so wonderful. Episode 8 was an attempt to broaden the humor at the expense of the humanity. As though someone had pointed out that this was meant to be a comedy. For the record, episode 7 had been a delight and 9, if not special in its own right, at least an improvement on 8. And then there were, or rather was, 10. The finale. The performance towards which everything had led. It's a masterpiece. The perfect summation of and climax to everything that's come before. It's heartstoppingly brave, rolling the emotional dice again and again. It left me breathless, quite literally. Compromises? Not really but we must prepare for a second series and so are denied absolute closure. That final episode was so close to perfection that I hesitate to anticipate a second series. But of course I will. I do.

Then, in the last season everything goes to pieces. The talented oboe player decides to become a conductor, which is a more ridiculous ambition than being a member of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and when she fails due to her own psychological problems she ends her relationship with the charismatic conductor and he goes completely insane. A spiteful ballet choreographer convinces him that he is participating in a conceptual art performance with no audience, no music, and no other dancers, so the Maestro dances around Central Park all by himself in the throes of total madness. Meanwhile somehow his former girlfriend gets to contuct the New York Philharmonic in a new piece by a famous composer which ends with a long standing ovation. It is as if the entire series was written by a deranged feminist whereby what is happy about the ending is that the underdog character grows throughout the seasons as her hair gets shorter, and her genius partner sinks deeper into madness as he becomes more dependent on her presence in his life.

In the irreverent tradition of \"Spitting Image\", \"The Windsors\" takes aim at the Royal Family and to be honest, absolutely roasts them. I'm no monarchist so this hilarious harpooning of the hand-shaking, hand-out-taking hooray Henry's and Henrietta's is absolutely A.O.K. with me.<br/><br/>I've only lately discovered the show and am working my way backwards through it but have yet to find a single episode that didn't make me frequently laugh out loud. Everyone bar, from what I can see, the Queen and Philip and the infant children are fair game for the satirists here.<br/><br/>On the male side, Charles is shown as a bumptious crank, desperate to ascend to the throne, Andrew a money-grabbing spiv, Edward an effete bungler while in the next generation, William is a feckless wimp and his brother Harry an illiterate, boozy, rugger-loving boor. Each of them is immediately identifiable by their characteristics, it hardly mattering that there often isn't that strong a physical resemblance between the actors and their blue-blooded counterparts.<br/><br/>Funniest of all though are the scabrous portrayals of the female members of the family. Anne is a ghostly frumpy stuffed-shirt, Fergie a lush trying to recapture her 1980's youth, Kate a robotic non-entity with a gypsy-past, her sister Pippa a money-grabbing vamp and new insurgent, Meghan Markle, a naive but Harry-controlling innocent abroad (love how she pronounces the word \"Suits\").

I have also seen the TV series with Richard Chamberlain and Ben Casey with Vince Edwards as well as every other one to come along with the exception of the Soap General Hospital. I think this program's writers have taken a new approach and even though one critic has written a very negative review saying they didn't like it and compared It to Burn Notice. I think that is completely wrong and missed the differences between this and other shows. For one thing it already looks like if there is going to be a love story it may develop normally without all the pit falls that keep up the sexual tension but get old fast in most series.

The stubborn patient doesn't follow Hank's instructions and gets itself in repeating trouble, keeping Hank busy for the duration of the whole episode. Some boring love cr*p is happening in the background between the other characters, but that's pretty much it. <br/><br/>I think the biggest problem is the characters (except Hank) are not given anything to do. They do not develop, the relations between them are stuck since episode 1. And the characters do not have room to break out of the stereotype roles they are given to play. This is a shame, since I sense great potential in some of the actors. Anastasia Griffith especially, (she plays Dr. Emily Peck), she does a hell of a lot from the little the script allows her, further I really like Paulo Costanzo (Hank's brother), though the writers are especially mean to him, not giving him anything to work with, but the role of the silly clown that everybody likes.

There were a few shows which started to break with that trend early on in this decade, most notably House, which showcases doctors performing medicine as opposed to a show all about the doctors and not about the patients. That may have changed, but my point remains that it was the original premise of the show.<br/><br/>Royal Pains is a sort of hybrid. The plot revolves around a doctor, Hank Lawson, who, after performing emergency heart surgery on a wealthy donor to the hospital who dies due to complications, is fired from the hospital after he checks upon another patient who was crashing fast due to a heart attack. Despite the fact that Lawson probably did the right thing, and the man's death was likely not his fault, under financial pressure and legal threats from the family of the dead man, the hospital uses him as a scapegoat. Having been blackballed from essentially ever performing emergency medicine in a hospital again, his life descends into chaos, his fianc\u00e9e leaves him, and he loses pretty much all of his possessions. His brother Evan picks him up for a weekend of partying in the Hamptons - yes, THE Hamptons - and end up inside of a party where Hank performs an emergency procedure to save a person's life.<br/><br/>I'm willing to accept the implausibility of the whole situation, that a guy who has just lost his job and all of his assets liquidated, would go and party in a rich neighborhood for a weekend. For now. With that out of the way, he goes back to his motel, and gets a call from someone else who got into a car crash with his girlfriend. He performs another emergency procedure that saves his life, and word travels even faster when another woman calls upon him to... do a boob job.<br/><br/>Two minor characters are introduced here. Divya, a young Indian woman, believes Hank is trying to set up in the Hamptons as a \"concierge doctor\", a traveling physician who goes to the patients' houses and gets paid directly for his services. Hank is initially disgusted by the idea and believes it's reminiscent of a system where the rich treat doctors like servants (despite the considerable profit). The other is Jill, the hospital administrator to whom Hank develops a certain attraction, who believes that his actions which got him fired were kind and that he could have done nothing to help.<br/><br/>In this sense, the show seems to revolve a great deal around Hank's personal life as much as it does around the medicine. The show isn't immune to breaking the fourth wall, either, as Hank makes quips about learning emergency techniques from Macgyver and remarks that he \"saw something on House\". He remains a fairly likable character throughout, with a disdain for the over-opulent lifestyles of the filthy rich. When confronting the kid who was driving in the car crash, he is appalled to hear that the kid would rather just buy a new car for his dad (this car being a rare, million dollar commodity) than go and get it fixed. Instead of the rich and handsome doctor, you have the... well, still handsome doctor who values his ethics over money.<br/><br/>That being said, the show isn't without its flaws, since I find the medicine to be unreliable in its depiction, and the Hamptons are rather caricatured - only about 15 percent of its residents are of the filthy rich type and the rest are anything from boaters to fishermen to commuters who work in New York City. As long as the show doesn't devolve into trying to flaunt too much of the lifestyles of the rich I think it'll be successful.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "12 out of 19 found this helpful.", "date": "11 June 2009"}, {"title": " A new breed of TV Serial", "content": "Last month late night I happened to watch two hour special of this series.

Immediately I was taken with the story. The writers create instant sympathy for emergency room doctor, Hank, who loses his job because he wouldn't cater to a wealthy patient over another lower paying one. He does however manage to help both of them, but in the end the wealthy patient dies. He is sued by the wealthy patient's family and is unable to find a new job. Then his shallow fianc\u00e9e leaves him, since he's not making anymore of the big bucks or has a promising career. Hank sinks into depression until his brother, Evan, a fun quirky character, helps pull him out of this by taking him away to the exclusive Hamptons for the summer. <br/><br/>I found myself rooting for Hank as he winds up unwittingly becoming an overnight success as a doctor to the rich - the very type of people he was most hurt by and lost his job over. And Hank's character truly cares for people, no matter who they are. He is smart, definitely the new \"MacGyver\" (as the show happily pokes fun at \u2013 anyone up for a Richard Dean Anderson guest appearance? Hint \u0085hint to any writers of the show if you're reading this.) of medical shows, and it's also loads of fun getting to travel into the wealthy lifestyles and adventures of Hampton residents. <br/><br/>One of the most enjoyable characters Hank meets is Tucker, a lonely rich kid whose father you later find out is mostly absent or when present battling a serious prescription drug addiction. Hank becomes a sort of substitute dad and I can't even describe how deep and powerful these scenes play. Great acting, and great writing. The episode where Tucker asks Hank to help get his dad get free from the addiction is one that truly inspired, and showed that this show is not to be taken lightly (though it is smattered with some fun comedic moments too.) <br/><br/>Another brilliant character is Boris, Hank's mysterious and super wealthy landlord. And when I say brilliant, I don't use the word loosely. Throughout the season the writers keep his character shrouded in secrecy, and the casting for Boris is perfect, as Campbell Scott plays the mysterious tension with such smooth finesse that honestly he has become one of my favorite characters. I truly hope he returns, and the respected friendship they have grows. Hank can use all the friends he can get.<br/><br/>Evan, Hank's brother is also a well rounded character portrayed with uncanny humor by Paulo Costanzo. He plays the fine line between funny sidekick and caring bro well. And if you haven't caught some of his side comments go back and watch for them \u2013 I wonder how much of that is from Costanzo's improv? <br/><br/>Sadly along the way, it seems as if the writer's have forgotten what a smart, intelligent character Hank really is and have strayed from keeping the character consistent. There is no way he would fall for someone as fickle and shallow as Jill. Although some efforts were made to make it seem like we should root for her (she feels him losing his job was unfair and somewhat gives a care for her fellow man by trying to start a low income free clinic), she treats Hank like a plaything that she can use whenever she wants, no matter that she's still married. And the amazing thing is that the writers allow Hank to be so stupid. He just got out of a relationship with a shallow woman. He's a likable, sincerely dedicated guy, not a foppish immature idiot; we already have his hilarious brother for that. In order for me to want to keep watching please get rid of Jill. Hank continuing to grovel to her is embarrassing. <br/><br/>I look for the next season with excitement and trepidation. I hope we're given more chances to explore life in the Hamptons.

It got a little intense near the middle of the series with some of Boris' drama and Milos and all, which I was really excited for. But then after all that dissipated, we were left with virtually nothing. Divya gets married between seasons to Raj, and seemingly had no second thoughts about that whatsoever.

Boris just got annoying after Milos because he just hides weird secret nonsense and that can basically summarize every plot of his. <br/><br/>In summary, this show lacks emotion; very dry. There are a lot of missed opportunities for characters to be more dynamic, which is especially necessary in a medical show such as this where you can basically never understand the medical plots anyway unless you happen to be a doctor watching the show, which is inevitable simply by its nature. He's also the only doctor who could magically not lose a patient in literally years. It's like the show is trying it's damnedest to avoid delving into any deep emotional conflict, and suffering for it, moreso as the show progresses. It gets so bad that near the end of the show we basically don't see any of the conflict; the characters just have explicit discussions with each other about the issues they face, which is a snooze fest. Otherwise, it's at least interesting to see some of the medical stuff happen.

Long story short, first season was much better than the second. -see it for yourself and you'll know why- i give the show 8/10 because it's the first season that makes the show great. the second was SOMEWHAT ALRIGHT, but very confusing with UN-liking stories as well as characters. but hey, who knows what you would like.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "10 out of 12 found this helpful.", "date": "2 September 2009"}, {"title": " A star is born", "content": "In a post apocalyptic world, Max Guevera (Jessica Alba) is a bike messenger in Seattle.

Barnum exhibit. It was intended to be Fox's answer to \"Buffy: The Vampire Slayer,\" but unlike the latter show, \"Dark Angel\" never lived up to the potential which it displayed in the pilot episode.<br/><br/>The lead character, Max Guevera/X5-452 (Alba), with her enhanced feline abilities was interesting enough despite the all-too-familiar \"I just wanna be normal\" superhero formula lurking underneath. Gratuitous shots of Alba in a skin-tight leather outfit was undoubtedly a major selling point with the teenage male audience but cheapened the series to the level of a D.C. comic book.<br/><br/>The overarching plot involving super-soldiers whose DNA had been artificially engineered, inserted as fertilized eggs into the wombs of surrogate mothers, born under military supervision, and then escaped as children was clich\u00e9, but still interesting. This was tacked onto a futuristic setting in which a dystopian Seattle has been devastated by an electromagnetic pulse. These two premises were mildly compelling, and the show was at its best when exploring them, but the moment it would veer into bizarre subplots, it would fall from an average weekly thriller to a stinking pile of fungus.<br/><br/>The ensemble cast that populated the show was by far the worst failing of this short-lived series. The supporting characters were stereotypes painted in broad, one-dimensional strokes (i.e. Original Cindy) and sounded like imbeciles. The point of using slang is to make communication quicker, not to use it so much in a sing-song fashion that basic conversation becomes ridiculous. Apparently, middle-aged creators James Cameron and Charles Eglee were trying so hard to make a hip show that appealed to teenie boppers that they didn't realize being too trendy is just as detrimental as being too normal.<br/><br/>Coupled with the annoying overuse of rat-tat-tat-tat dialogue, a \"battle of the sexes\" theme existed throughout the series which could have been wickedly amusing if it hadn't usually lacked wit. Max saying lines such as, \"Girls kick ass, it says so on a T-shirt\" was humorous. Max saying lines such as, \"Guys are the weaker sex\" to a grieving widow who has just lost her beloved husband only makes the audience groan. Comedy is a difficult art. The Dark Angel writers should have remembered Mel Brooks' famous advice, \"If I cut my finger, that's tragedy. If a man walks into an open sewer and dies, that's comedy.\"<br/><br/>For the action scenes in which Max displayed her \"dizzying\" superpowers, the Dark Angel crew often utilized a simple fast-forwarding technique. This is an effective trick if executed correctly, but instead it often came across as sped-up footage from a shaky hand-held video camera. In retrospect, far more interesting combat effects could have been created using wire stunts ala the choreography of Yuen W. Ping.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the corniness of \"Dark Angel\" became more and more insufferable; the weekly episode writing didn't improve; the characters became so posh they were snotty. Midway through the first season its Nielsen ratings began to slip. Seeing no quality improvement, viewers abandoned \"Dark Angel\" like rats from a sinking ship. By the second season, the once-promising series had degraded to having Max slaying Buffy-like monsters and encountering freakish mutants that seemed borrowed from X-Men comics. If only the series writers had aimed for a wider demographic audience other than teenagers and focused less on being devastatingly hip, \"Dark Angel\" might have lasted a few more seasons.<br/><br/>Tsk!

In order for these types of series to succeed, the producers, in my humble opinion, need to tie the various subplots at some point to THE main plot of the show and relegate the good cop vs. bad cop episodic plots to the back burner.Of course this would mean, one suspects, that at some point the series would be over, because the main plot would be solved. The other thing that bothers me about Dark Angel is the hunter vs. the hunted theme: we've already had this in The Fugitive, The Incredible Hulk, The Pretender, to some extend in The Profiler, and probably others that I haven't even heard of. Can we get rid of it? It is the biggest cliche on TV right now.

At first I though it might be a hit with the Tweens because there was a possible romance and some bright, flashy colors during a motorcycle race that ended in a poorly staged dance scene where Ms Dushku was all gushy in love with some guy who gives her a hearted pendant, but then the show got down to business. That business was an episode of My Own Worse Enemy not starring Christian Slater, but Eliza Dushku. Not a format for those who flock to tween movies like High School Musical 3 or read tween authors like Stephanie Myers, because there is just not enough distribution of inane characters that have no purpose in life but to strike a pose and have some deep feelings about the death of puppy love. Sure Joss Whedon takes a swipe at that dribble in the opening, but then it becomes an adult drama. So who is your audience Joss ? Is it the Buffy/Angel crowd now grown up (wasn't that Firefly ?) or are you trying to cross that threshold into the Adult Drama World. Following Smilovic's canceled show into oblivion will not help such a career move.

Grab some Buffy feminism, add a little Firefly anti government paranoia, insert some of Angel's brooding self analysis. It had a \"Xander\", a character that should've been left out upon final analysis and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth when you realize that Wheadon needs to put a Xander in every show.

In season two, Joss wrote episode #1 - \"Vows,\" but has remained absent as a writer until now. So along comes episode #8 - \"A Love Supreme.\" If you know the works of John Coltrane, everything you need to know is in the title. \"A Love Supreme\" was Coltrane's masterwork. I suspect that \"Dollhouse\" -- short-lived as it may be -- will be regarded in the future as somewhat of a similar masterwork.<br/><br/>Jazz is improvisation. You start with a theme, a concept, and then -- if you have the balls -- you take it and get all Nike on its ass and Go For It. Coltrane did that with his \"A Love Supreme.\" Joss did that with his. It's not just that every note of the basic theme led up to but could never predict the eventual epiphnal moments when the piece took flight and became something else, something transcendent to the theme. It's that every note of the first few bars in which the theme was established were *essential* to it taking flight. What came before didn't just precede what followed; what came before *enabled* what followed, and allowed it to happen.<br/><br/>\"A Love Supreme\" is not a one-hour segment in a 26-hour television series.

All of these writers' novels were *serialized* in cheap pulp fiction magazines. Readers bought them for pennies and rarely realized that they were reading great literature. And what could be cheaper and more pulp fiction than broadcast television, on the FOX network, no less? And yet.<br/><br/>\"Dollhouse\" is great literature. Besides, it's funny.

The only thing I that comes to mind are 12-18 year old guys who just happen to think Elisha Dushku is hot...what else is there? Coming from the man who created Firefly, one of the most innovative, well written shows I've ever seen, I really hoped Dollhouse would capture some of that same \"magic\" that Firefly gave to it's viewers. Unfortunately, I think Joss Whedon must have used all of his good ideas on Firefly and all he has left is Buffy scraps...<br/><br/>First of all...if I hadn't known Joss Whedon had created Dollhouse and was watching it, I NEVER would have guessed that he was behind this show. I'm sorry Joss but this show is just crap...the concept is ridiculous, the acting is marginal at best(Sorry Joss but Miss Dushku isn't exactly much of an actress), and the execution of the show is something any first time director could have pulled off.<br/><br/>If Dollhouse was written by the guy behind the Weekend at Bernie's movies then I might be impressed as at least it would show a small amount of creative growth...but to go from a show like Firefly with dialog that I can still recall off the top of my head to this day because of it's imaginative tone, to the hollow, emotionless banter between the Dollhouse characters...well it's like Da Vinci painting the Mona Lisa and then deciding that \"finger painting\" is his true passion! This show is not catered to intelligent adults...maybe not even intelligent teenagers...each episode I watch seems unplanned...as if there isn't even a written script and the actors are just \"winging it.\" If I had to pick one thing in particular that made this show difficult to watch it would be the premise...I mean seriously, even in the sci fi world, this \"Dollhouse\" organization sounds completely ridiculous. Who in their right mind would finance something like that? The fact that the people in the \"Dollhouse\" are basically zombies until they receive a new \"personality\" or whatever they call it makes for little interest in who the characters are personally. I could give a crap about Eliza Dushku's background and where she came from because the writing gives me no reason to do so...<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is one of those shows that just \"is\"....in no way do I feel any connection to any of the characters and the story lines are so weak that the only way I could watch something like this is if I was too drunk to change the channel! My opinion is that since Joss was burned by Fox with Firefly, he feels the need to come up with a show THEY would like and not him. I think he was hoping a hot girl kicking people's butts and stuff would appeal to the \"Fox\" audience given his former success with Buffy. We already have that Joss and it's on an hour before your Dollhouse...and oddly enough it's Summer Glau from your very own Firefly series.

There's the two competing stars for the lead role (Megan Hilty and Katharine McPhee). The writing duo (Debra Messing and Christian Borle).

Mostly though I appreciated Smash for what it gave me besides the songs. <br/><br/>The plot and dialog were solid and made sense. The pacing was was fast enough to keep my attention, though the time skips could've been made a bit more clear maybe. It didn't really bother me, but I imagine it might get a little confusing for the average viewer (if that just made me sound like an intellectual snob, so be it).<br/><br/>The acting was very good. The show obviously has a very strong cast with people like Anjelica Huston and Debra Messing in it, but the one who surprised me most was McPhee. As far as I'm concerned she is the break- through star in this show. Her acting was right on par with the other, more experienced, costars, but more than that she has that star quality Simon Cowell always like to blab about. She is captivating and steals almost every scene she is in. IF the show becomes a hit, it will catapult her career to the Hollywood stratosphere.<br/><br/>As for the obvious comparison to that other \"musical\" TV-show, Glee. Don't bother. As far as musical TV shows go, these two are polar opposites. Glee is a completely over-the-top, unrealistic, hyperactive, musical comedy. Smash is a realistic musical drama that focuses not on the songs, but on the story and the acting. I urge all of you to not dismiss Smash simply because you do not like Glee, it would be such a shame.<br/><br/>Of all the new shows coming this spring season (and I've seen all the pilots) Smash is the 2nd best of the bunch, coming only behind the completely ridiculously fantastic mind-blowing Awake (also by NBC).

However, anyone involved with the theatre industry can attest to how the majority of the promotion and development of a show is based almost entirely on drama. From the funding (or lack thereof) to changes in casting all being somewhat surreal, so it lends itself to this type of plot. <br/><br/>Someone referred to the sound not being good. Um, I had my surround sound speakers picking up a Dolby Surround signal and it was quite good audio. <br/><br/>There were some moments that did seem a little too \"Glee-esque\" where everyone seems to suddenly break into song..... but I accepted that this was a program about a NY Musical being produced for Broadway. That said, the productions numbers were quite good if you actually paid attention to the interaction during the numbers because it was many times letting the viewer in on changes that were occurring or background for a change to the plot. For example in one scene the director was trying to figure out who was going to play the lead role. He started looking at the costumes for different numbers and you saw excerpts from the numbers and who he saw playing the role. It ended up that the person who was the front runner wasn't selected, not because she wasn't good, but because the director couldn't picture her doing it.<br/><br/>All in all they were finding their way, but season 2 went somewhat off the rails with the plot line where it was difficult to connect the dots until the very end of the season.

The only relation this show has to Glee is it includes occasional singing and dancing (which all revolves around rehearsals/auditions for the musical). The show is not built around musical numbers. It is more a procedural that gives an insider perspective of Broadway and all the drama/reality of theater production. Also, not an American Idol fan so the idea of a runner-up being the star, also turned me off. Again, I have to stop assuming. Katherine McPhee was pretty good.

Previously, NBC joined the bandwagon after the major and continuous success of American Idol and produced a singing show of their own, The Voice, which has had mixed fortune. So NBC has now seemingly decided to bank on the success of Glee, with their own musical number. For obvious reasons, viewers will approach Smash from Glee's perspective and try to draw as many comparisons as possible. In truth, the only thing they have common is that both have a music connection. While Glee banks on a themed episodes and covers of famous songs, Smash has taken the opposite direction and composes originals (except for that one Christina Aguilera number and maybe one other). Smash also has a story which will stretch the length of 1st season at least. Anyway, here are the 5 main points from the pilot episode.<br/><br/>2. Cast:<br/><br/>The cast for Smash will be its biggest weapon, with Emmy winner Debra Messing leading the line. I had never followed Will &amp; Grace religiously, but, I still found Debra to be a very likable actress. In the pilot, she plays a lyricist for musicals, who has supposedly vowed to stay away from theatre in order to focus on her family.Next big name of some sorts is Jack Davenport. He plays a theatre director with a massive attitude problem and possible debaucher, who gives away lead roles to females via his bedroom. He does a decent job at looking like a tool we would grow to despise, which I believe would be a success for him. The chief protagonist for Smash is, Katharine McPhee, the runner-up of one of the dozen seasons of American Idol. One would assume that she has a wonderful voice, but, in the pilot I think it was Christina Aguilera's voice (I'm pretty sure it was Christina). Her acting seems to be suitable for the role as well. She's playing the do no wrong, innocent girl, who's struggling to fulfill her dreams. Other cast members include: Christian Borle, Megan Hilty, Raza Jaffrey and Anjelica Huston plays some of the other major characters. Nothing out of the ordinary there; nothing appallingly woeful there either. Oh and UMA THURMAN is joining the cast as well. <br/><br/>3. Plot:<br/><br/>I admired how simple the plot was. At the end of the pilot, we see in a short 2 minutes clip, what we will see through the season. It's going to be a straight battle between the two ladies fighting to play Monroe in the musical. It will involve giving the director some extracurricular favors as well. The lyricist will have problems with her family at some point, it could involve an affair as well. A few other sub-plots will run in parallel. All in all, they have kept things simple, which I think will work for them.<br/><br/>4. Music, Choreography and Direction:<br/><br/>Music wise, I expect Smash to be better than Glee. They are performing original numbers mostly, and it is also rumored that in total they have already put together 13 original tracks for the first season. Having Broadway experience would help them in the backroom staff. Michael Mayer is the director for the pilot, he's done a decent job. I expect the quality of the direction to maintain through the season. The focus of Smash would be on musical numbers and choreography more than direction. That being said, if it lacks direction, the whole mix could look laughable. Choreography would be the crucial aspect of this show and could turn out to be the wild card. We only saw a glimpse of it in the pilot episode, so I cannot talk a lot about it. But, it might play a major part in making this show a major hit.<br/><br/>5. The Monroe Angle:<br/><br/>Don't we all just love Monroe? well to be honest I haven't seen much of her myself. But, America, I hear is a big fan of her. The creators/writers have very smartly banked on the Monroe factor. They have tried to play all their big cards to have a hit first season. They seem afraid to take a chance with this not being a hit.<br/><br/>In conclusion, NBC may have found its first hit drama of the season. Maybe not surprisingly, NBC's fall drama slots have been woeful. Prime Suspect; cancelled in the first season. The Playboy Club; cancelled in the first commercial break of the pilot (well I seriously hoped that was true). So the network really wants this to be a success. Yes, viewers will compare this to Glee. No, it's nothing like Glee. Will that be a good thing or a bad thing, is a question NBC will seek answers to. I believe, if this had come to us last year, when Glee's success was still fresh, this might have been a blockbuster. Regardless, it seems compelling enough for me to put on the 2nd episode.

It was better than 1 star, but not up to the level of 10. I gave it 7 mainly because I was seduced and couldn't say \"no,\" but 6 is probably closer to my true feelings.<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>1. Nice to see several of my favorite characters return to reprise their roles from the original, along with some engaging newcomers, especially Dani (Arienne Mandi) and Nat (Stephanie Allynne).<br/><br/>2. Let's admit it -- Generation Q is a really nighttime soap set in an atypical milieu. It's not that far from the original in it's absurd story lines, it's just that the original had more finesse. If you're expecting an objective view of the lesbian scene, then move on. Plus the story lines aren't that far off from those in the original series, so let's not fault the producers for that. Enjoy the ride for what it is.<br/><br/>3. Despite it's flaws, each week I kept looking forward to the next chapter and wished there were at least two more episodes this season.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>1. Unlike most of the lesbian and gay couples that I know, there are no long-term, stable relationships shown here. This was true of the original series, too. There are no hardcore butches, either. You know, girrrls who sport crew cuts and wear chain draped leather jackets and Doc Martins. While I can relate to several of the characters, in my experience most of them represent the social exception, not the social rule. On the other hand, that's what makes drama dramatic, n'est pas?<br/><br/>2. There were some truly annoying new characters -- mainly Finley (Jacqueline Toboni) and Jose (Freddy Miyares). Were they one (or two)-dimensional or what? Perhaps it's not their fault. As Jessica Rabbit famously said, \"I'm not bad, I'm just drawn that way.\" (See Bad Rap Number 3, below)<br/><br/>As for the acting, a lot of it seemed under-rehearsed or perhaps the product of one or two takes. I have to blame the directors for many of the cringe-worthy performances or for settling for whatever the actors gave them, but it could just have been questionable casting.<br/><br/>About the casting, I wonder how many better or more experienced actors didn't audition or turned down offers because of the frequent graphic sexuality -- deep kisses, lot of gratuitous nude scenes, and mucho faux sex. In the original, Jennifer Beals as Bette was never exposed past her underwear or she discreetly covered her breasts when she was shown naked in bed with a lover (true, too, of Marlee Matlin, Cybill Shepherd, Jane Lynch, and other A-listers). So, clearly she had enough star power to draw her own lines, while newcomers had to accept what they were offered -- it's better than waiting tables forever.<br/><br/>For the record, I don't have a problem with sex scenes, graphic or not, but they need to make sense in the context of the story. There was something about the graphic sexuality in the original L-Word that seemed more right, especially in the early Jenny Schecter story line when she's finding her voice as a writer.<br/><br/>3. Much of the dialogue has real issues. When I can sit on the couch and practically mouth the next lines word-for-word before the characters speak them, there's something's wrong. Many of the conflicts between characters were so cliched, that I could barely wait for the next scene -- Bette vs. her lovers, Danni vs. Sophie, Alice vs. Nat and Gigi, MIcah vs. Jose, and so on down the hellish verbal rabbit hole.<br/><br/>This also refers back to my criticism of the directors. A good director knows how to motivate their actors, even when a scene is poorly written, or at least knows when to send the script back for a rewrite. Granted there must have been time and budget constraints, but the script should be polished before shooting begins and the writers should be on hand to make revisions when it's clear that something isn't working.<br/><br/>4. The music truly sucks. The background music, the soppy ballads, and the opening and closing credit tunes all suck. Who listens to this crap, anyway? Where's BETTY when we need them?<br/><br/>And the...<br/><br/>Finally, what is it about Showtime, the HBO wannabe, that keeps their dramas from realizing their full potential. Unlike HBO (\"The Sopranos,\" \"The Wire,\" \"The Night of\"), AMC (\"Breaking Bad,\" \"Better Call Saul\"), Amazon (\"Mrs. Maisel,\" \"Fleabag\"), and FX (\"Fargo\"), among others, Showtime's series are always straining for the top shelf, but never quite reaching it. Watching episodes of \"Dexter,\" \"Californication,\" \"Masters of Sex,\" \"Shameless,\" and \"Ray Donovan,\" I come a way with the feeling that they're drawing on a pool of B-list writers or that the showrunners keep underestimating the audience's level of sophistication. [Aside: When did \"showrunner\" become a thing, anyway?]<br/><br/>Do the other networks have more generous budgets or is it a cultural thing at Showtime's executive level? Granted, HBO has had it's share of turkeys (Alan Ball's awful \"Here and Now\" and the unwatchable \"Hello Ladies\"), but when they're good, they're very, very good.<br/><br/>Back to Generation Q.

I didn't love the first episode of Gen Q, at times it felt like it was trying too much to hit its marks, but I certainly didn't hate it and I find it odd that people dislike it so much.<br/><br/>Not sure if the series can create in 8 episodes the same must-see television that season 1 of the The L Word did, but I'm interested to see what happens; I like the storylines; and love seeing the more mature versions of Bette, Shane, and Alice, as well as the younger cast members, who offer a new perspective.<br/><br/>A very strong 7/10 with lots of potential.", "rating": 2, "helpful": "37 out of 58 found this helpful.", "date": "9 December 2019"}, {"title": " Abysmal", "content": "I really tried liking this show but honestly the writing is just too bad.

I know that the new showrunner who is of this 'gen Q' generation is someone that the series creator, Ilene Chaiken personally handpicked to write this reboot and was told to 'do as she wished'. Well, not the best idea was it? The whole premise of this reboot is mired in PC agenda with a very awkwardly placed trans character storyline. I mean, yes, the original series was heavily criticized for its arguably bad treatment/portrayal of trans characters. So, is this new one supposed to remedy that? If anything, it just looks like they have a trans character just for the sake of having a trans character. The only saving grace is the original cast who unfortunately seem to appear stiff and wooden too at times purely because you'd (I, as a fan of the original series) never expect their characters to say those kind of lines. It puts off the dynamics of these characters too who used to have a very natural flowing banter between them. Just telling of really bad writing I suppose.

If I were watching this show separate from the original, I wld just find it boring and underwhelming; I'd rather watch Lost Girl, Wynonna, Orphan Black, Sense8 which are way more interesting even Work in Progress which is fabulous and has found a way to portray new queer culture just via plotline.<br/><br/>The reboot is no longer oddly even a lesbian-centric show. It's about random things happening to people that just happen to be gay but cld just as easily be hetero and I get that's the truth in real life: gay people do all the same things straight people do - have jobs, friends, families, lovers, hobbies, passions, etc. But this is supposed to be entertainment and the whole point of bringing back the show was because they said that one gay character on a show isn't enough and they were filling a void that no other show took up after the OG went off the air and they are yet to fill that void. But..there is a BIG difference between being straight and being gay; it's why we have gay pride not straight pride. The gay spots and girl parties in NYC look nothing like what my straight friends do when they go out. The original showed that. So far Q hasn't (where's the fun too?). I get that the original L Word was like gay 101 and this isn't the original but shouldn't there be some connection to the original beyond Bette, Alice and Shane at least in tone. This new iteration barely talks abt gayness/being a lesbian and what that's like.<br/><br/>Additionally...We have no idea why the newbies are even friends. We've heard very little about any of the missing original cast and they're dragging out plot lines like why Bette is running for mayor and what has Shane so down (I won't spoil it). There's no lesbian meetup spot like the planet and I get all those places have closed in LA but create one (which I think Shane is going to do). But even Bette, Shane and Alice are disjointed in this new iteration. Alice is still fabulous but what is her s/l really? Her purpose? Finley is so F'in annoying and a poor excuse for a human being let alone a supposed Shane 2.0. She's merely a caricature. She acts dumb and immature and is a moocher and awkward with women which is a real waste of Jacqueline Toboni's acting prowess because normally I love her.<br/><br/>Overall, you know that when the best s/l on a supposedly lesbian show is about a trans gay man, Micah, then there's a problem. Why even call it the L Word? Again, I get that it can't be dyke 101 like the original but they could at least discuss the new wave of queerness facing the community.<br/><br/>I hope to be proven wrong and that the 6 epis remaining leave me loving the show but IDK if that'll happen. It seems like they are trying to be overly diverse and so the diversity gets lost. It's trying to be everything and portray everyone and a show just can't be expected to do that.<br/><br/>The end of the original 2-hour pilot did two things. 1) Left me wanting more; and 2) was the catalyst for my coming out. So far 2 episodes into the reboot and it has done and wld not have done either of those things for me. We waited 10 years for The L Word to come back but not in this form.

It's surprising how good he is he in this, as he will surprise you a bit. Don Johnson, plays a more reckless cop than his Miami Vice days, which he played a much more controlled character. Johnson, an underrated actor (Django Unchained, Machete are any indication) is very good here, and steers the show well, where you some other likable supports. In one episode, he actually had his MV co star in it. Nash is a SF cop (although you don't fee like your in Francisco most of the time) who does his things his way (sound familiar) to get better and more quicker results, and he likes it too. Cheech does still provide some comic relief, and a couple of his own devised lines. He's an asset to the show, it'd only be, half a show without him. Although the show, does have stereotypical traits and some ordinaryness (my word) to it, what you get is quite a good sufficient hour of cop drama, with some action, although it's a long way from the loud, cool glitzy style of Miami, but this one kind of retains a style of it of it's own.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "3 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "4 November 2017"}, {"title": " Bring back Nash Bridges", "content": "I really enjoy watching Don Johnson in all the shows he's done.

I read it in the Enquirer, and most of that stuff, believe it or not, is true. The supporting cast was composed of boring character actors, not the least being Cheech Marin. The balding, pudgy actor was a mere shadow of the funnyman of the 70's and 80's. He was a humorless, bland, chubby, depressed-looking guy. So when this 5'1\" dynamo married a sexy Swedish bombshell on the show, credibility took another hit. And what about the police station or city hall or whatever it was?

She expresses empathy for Annie, sharing that she gets trolled, herself, by her fellow gamer geeks on the basis of her gender. When Annie and her work friend mention that they're going out to an event, the computer geek colleague shows that she's feeling lonely and excluded, as well, and might like to be invited. In return, Annie and her colleague roll their eyes, give that micro-aggressive expression that says, \"Ew, we're better than you,\" and quickly leave. She's clearly used to filtering out such micro-aggressions, and accepting her plight, the same way Annie was in the beginning. So she swallows the insult and devotes herself to finding the troll, even though she's clearly overloaded with work. This scene instantly turned my opinion and my stomach.

Immature about being a friend, a daughter, a girlfriend (or rather, a prospective girlfriend/someone who is dating), and an employee (especially as an employee). She is also highly self centered. I'm glad she stood up for herself, in many situations, but a lot of the time she was overly hostile imo. And often hypocritical. And her decisions are very poor. She doesn't act like an adult.<br/><br/>Yes it's very bad that the pharmacy didn't tell her that the morning after pill wouldn't work for her (and I am shocked they don't offer a version that would work for everyone), but she also wasn't using it responsibly in the first place. That pill is supposed to be a last resort, not something you take super often. If she was so insistent on being with a guy without a condom, then she should have been a responsible adult and gotten a prescription for a bc pill or implant or something, or found some other way to protect herself.<br/><br/>And then there was her reaction to the troll, which I suppose I shouldn't spoil it for people, but it was just.... Wow. Ridiculous. Dangerous. Idiotic. I could go on. And then there were no consequences to her actions, which made it even worse.<br/><br/>Finally, how she acts with her boss is just... it's unrealistic that he never fired her. She was disrespectful, going over his head constantly, and then playing victim when he got mad at her for it, especially when she made him out to be the bad guy in her article (which, yes, he was to her). Highly unprofessional. And I know she wants to get ahead, to be challenged more, to write what she wants, but as he reminds her, she hasn't paid her dues yet. Why does she think she gets to be the exception??<br/><br/>Idk, I really don't know what to rate this. There were aspects I liked. I liked Fran (and her brother, and the episode with her whole family). Ryan was in the beginning, but he was occasionally sweet and a decent character. Annie was just... more unlikable than likable for me. For even more reasons than I described above. And I liked Amadi, who she was a bad friend to, and who acted a lot more mature than her.

If the producers don't have a home shelf full of classic slasher titles, I'd never know, because \"Slasher\" feels like it was made by a fan, for fans.<br/><br/>The series, in classic slasher style, is set up to be a \"whodunnit\" (something its sister shows had in common), in which the audience will presumably discover the killer's identity in the season finale. But what makes the trip more bearable this time out is that, unlike MTV and Fox's offerings, we don't have to sit through a bunch of teenage angst and bad gags in between the mayhem. Whoever made the decision to have this story focus on adults (and I mean the house-owning kind, not the \"I'm away at college\" variety), the audience thanks you. Oh, the drama is there, but it's lacking the Dawson/Joey element.<br/><br/>As any effective slasher is only as good as its ability to create suspense, have a good amount of gore, and give us a menacing killer, the series pleasantly gets all of these crucial aspects right. We have ACTUAL suspense (P.S. young, pretty women in these things should never go out walking alone). The Executioner, the show's debut villain, is an imposing cross between the hook man in \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" and Ghostface (he proves he can run).<br/><br/>Add in a nice machete kill that I was surprised made it past the censors, and there's your gore aspirations being met.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also worthy of mention, as it's even better than \"Scream\" or \"Scream Queens.\" A Chiller TV series having better production values than a Ryan Murphy production on Fox?

This has some growing pains as a show, as television shows can be difficult to plot even when it's an anthology, especially when it comes to horror since horror is difficult to do effectively sometimes. Here's my rundown of the seasons thus far:<br/><br/>The Executioner:<br/><br/>This was fun and while it was slow at times, it had really great characters and a nice storyline. I didn't really expect the killer to be who it was, which is one of the strongest points of this series as a whole. You don't expect it for the most part.<br/><br/>Guilty Party:<br/><br/>I didn't like this as much as the first season but this still was effectively done. I like the idea of the group being in isolation and the potential this has for scares. Not to mention that people returning to a former camp is really intriguing. The killer was a little surprising but the real gem here is the character interactions.<br/><br/>Solstice:<br/><br/>I have a bit more to say about this since I saw it more recently and it's fresher in my head. The story here was well done and for me was the best season so far. I absolutely loved the character of Kit (the murder victim that sets the show off) as he's really a kind of tragic character. He was generally fairly honest about who he was and in another city or group he may have had an entirely different ending. I also really loved that there was such a wide variety of characters here and that the show tried very hard to show why they acted the way they did, turning characters that would otherwise be seen as wholly unsympathetic into characters with surprising depth. They still do terrible things to themselves and one another, but ultimately they're very human.I have to say that other than Kit, the standout actor in this series was the one who portrayed Amber. She was fantastic and I really hope they bring her and some of the other actors back to the series for other characters.<br/><br/>As a whole this series is what I think we all hoped American Horror Story could be at times, focusing more on the horror instead of on the drama and soap opera story lines that AHS tends to let dominate.

The town caused an \"I want to go to there\" response in me, even if the landscape was littered with corpses.<br/><br/>The actors were adequate. They may be capable of much better, but no actor can rise above bad writing. Unlike MTV's Scream, which was continually reinventing itself and kept us guessing to the end, this had the feeling of episodes of As the World Turns with gore effects and an occasional mild sex scene.<br/><br/>The last episode, though, was way too talky. A subplot about summer camp many years ago did nothing to raise the suspense level and a main character who survives (I'll name no names) does things in the last scenes that are completely out of character, lower that person to the level of the Executioner, and make you wonder how no criminal charges were filed on that character.<br/><br/>If there's going to be another season of this show I'll watch it.

There's several scenes where she walks along the street and it's like she thinks she's in a music video. She just aimlessly wanders around looking ...well...who knows what? Because she emotes nothing for the audience to connect with. The message boards on IMDb hate her, and with good reason. She is awful. She wears an ENORMOUS watch which we must assume is product placement as she wears it in every scene, no matter what else she is wearing, even if it clashes. She doesn't even take it off in a sex scene, and given how bad her acting is, maybe we should be happy that at least we had the massive watch to look at. Clearly they felt that giving her a huge watch would make her interesting. <br/><br/>It does not.<br/><br/>It just left us saying: \"What is the deal with that massive watch that doesn't suit her at all?\"<br/><br/>2 - the writing is lazy and borderline plagiarism. Watching Season 2 of SCREAM on Netflix has really highlighted the amazing difference of just half decent writing and half decent acting. Both so sorely lacking from SLASHER. The writers have claimed that all the blatant, scene for scene rip offs of horror movies is 'homage' to the genre. But really, they are just taking entire plots and scenes from other horror movies. Sorry but that is not homage, you are basically too lazy to come up with original ideas and are just reshooting old movies.

Clearly somebody had kept her hidden away all that time. Detective Inspector Cadi John, who has recently returned to Wales to look after her elderly father, is put in charge of the case. While we see her investigating the case we also follow the kidnapper as he sets about getting a new young woman to keep locked in the remains of a derelict out-building at his remote home.<br/><br/>This series proved to be rather different to what I expected; mostly because the kidnapper was identified early on. This didn't reduce the tension though; if anything it drastically increased it as we see him kidnapping another woman. One episode was devoted entirely to her situation at the kidnapper's home and to his strange family life. He lives with his domineering mother who knows of his proclivities but doesn't help his victim escape and his daughter... presumed to be the child of the dead girl. This single episode was incredibly tense; more like a horror than a drama as we just wait for something bad to happen. The general feel of the series is fairly downbeat; watching this one would think Llanberis is a rough area to be avoided rather than a tourist-town in the heart of beautiful Snowdonia! The cast does a fine job with Sian Reese-Williams impressing as DI John; Rhodri Meilir was genuinely disturbing as kidnapper Dylan Harris and Gwyneth Keyworth was equally good as his latest victim. Young Elodie Wilton also put in a fine performance as Dylan's daughter and Gillian Elisa is suitably unpleasant as Dylan's domineering mother.

A woman with an ugly ugly heart - whose routine coldness toward her husband is matched by his obsequious submissive behavior.<br/><br/>The single man - is as promiscuous as anyone you'll ever see in movies or television - needing sex as much as air - willing to sleep not only with best friends of his girlfriend, but to do so the day he's sleeping with the girlfriend. He lies to obtain sex, deeply hurts others' feelings to get sex from others, accepts back the killer of his child so he can have more sex. Perhaps some of the motivation is that he's nothing else in life- he's very dim mentally and works at a no-hoper job. What an ugly ugly personality.<br/><br/>The only likeable person is the husband whose wife loves another and fantasizes about him all day long - yet the husband is routinely insulted, and disparaged by men and women.<br/><br/>The series does however hold one's interest because it establishes one embarrassing situation after another - and the situations are sometimes skin-crawlingly funny - but it should have been called \"Appalling Women\" or \"The Despicable 30s\".

But no one ever takes into the consideration what the wives and families of these soldiers must sacrifice for the same cause. Year long or better deployments, in harm's way, forced into single parenthood, the worry of ever seeing the man you love alive again.

I can't tell you how heartbreaking it is to see women at my church week after week, holding their heads high, keeping it together for their children.

Every couple or family has their own special uniqueness and personality that draws you in and keeps you coming back each week for more. In the beginning you're introduced to five different families and each episode you learn more and more about their lives and what they've lived through and each one tells their own story.

There are some supporting characters: Dr. Mac a George Sand like woman doctor who prefers dressing in men's style clothing; and Bert and Cec her two men Friday; and a butler, Mr. Butler, who somewhat reminds you of Bruce Wayne's Alfred. <br/><br/>Miss Fisher has a quite thrilling life tracking down cocaine dealers, stopping Latvian anarchists, dealing with Zionists, and even a ghost to mention a few. Of course along the way she beds a number of men who might be suspects but for proprieties sake turn out innocent. Not Rene but he wasn't a murderer when she bedded him. Our Miss Fisher is a tad promiscuous which is to suggest she is a totally modern woman.<br/><br/>Some threads are picked up and dropped without explanation such as her domineering Aunt Prudence and a waif, Jane, she \"adopts\" but who sort of vanishes off to school. At least until the last three episodes where she plays a crucial role. In general Miss Fisher tends to aggravate and enchant the local police as established in the character DCI John 'Jack' Robinson who finds her frustrating yet admirable. And while there are plenty of hints tossed about regarding their relationship, Jack is married if somewhat unhappily. Jack's assistant, constable Hugh Collins is smitten with Phryne's maid and their romance, although clouded by the fact Dot is a Catholic and Hugh a Protestant, seems to be more likely to be consummated as the episodes move forward. <br/><br/>The last three episodes are an arc which completes the story line and allow Miss Fisher to confront her nemesis, Murdoch Foyle, the man responsible for Miss Fisher becoming a detective. Unfortunately these episodes wrap up the series so well they almost make the need for a second season superfluous.

It's \"all right\" as far as having a strong heroine goes, but I admit to being disappointed when they went the romance route with Phryne and Jack instead of a solid friendship. It's such an overdone route, and undermines everything that delighted me about Phryne to begin with - her frank enjoyment of sex, singlehood, and being an independent woman in a time when women were still expected to give up working when they got married. I much preferred having a 20s female James Bond type of character, who bedded men involved with the case, and solved the cases stylishly and coolly. It would have been a much fresher and more unique take on a \"lady detective\" than what actually happens. Also, now they have to find ways to drag it out, which just means continual irritating side stories taking time away from the main story of each episode - Jack's jealousy, Jack's ex-wife, etc., etc.<br/><br/>I also didn't really enjoy the ongoing background stories much. Being filmed as short individual stories, I think they should have been kept as short individual stories. The longer ones just cut in and out too sloppily. Jane, for instance, is adopted, and then only ever seen again when she's useful to the story. This makes Phryne come off as selfish in the worst way, taking in a kid that she then ships off to school and never has anything to do with except when she's needed for a case. The child killer story and Phryne's father's story, like Jane, dropped in and out of each episode if and when necessary, but dropped out again a moment later. And frequently this was combined with cutting straight from solving a brutal, vicious murder to Phryne throwing yet another party. Again, makes Phryne (and co) come off as heartless.<br/><br/>AND YET despite this, I loved it, believe it or not. Every regular character is a delight, and for each instance of the issues above, there were plenty of instances of fantastically enjoyable story, dialogue, action, etc. I love that Phryne frequently saves herself during a situation of her vs. villain, with Jack bursting in only in time to see her dusting herself off and waiting for him to make the 'official' arrest. I love their friendship. I LOVE the evolution of the relationship between Dot and Hugh, which is a much more satisfactory relationship than Jack and Phryne's. I love Bert and Cec, Mr. Butler, Mac, and good god, I adore Aunt Prudence, who is one of the delightful frequent recurrences in the series, and who dances on the line between \"likeable\" and \"unlikeable\" with style and grace, never falling definitely on either side.<br/><br/>I also really enjoy the modern issues that show up - including but absolutely not limited to transgenderism, gay and lesbian relationships, various disabilities, and Phryne's attitude toward them all goes a long way to highlighting how despicable attitudes toward them were then, and how despicable they still are now. It's never awkward or forced, it just is a part of the people's lives and they are parts that Phryne accepts them as who they are.

As for the changes in the \"Legend\" series, as you will read in Terry's letter, they are mainly ADDITIONS to use up all the time they are afforded in a full TV series. People seem to be uninformed of this and are making snap judgments. Now, I don't know about you, but I can't think of anything better than watching my favorite book series in live action with even MORE content and background, from, and approved by, Terry himself. I'm beside myself with happiness at this and hope everyone tunes in and avoids the uninformed negativity, and that it runs for 11 seasons to tell the expanded stories of every single book in The Sword of Truth series.<br/><br/>Some are also comparing this to Hercules and Xena simply because some of the same people happen to be working on it. Hercules and Xena this is not. Those shows were entertaining in their own right. I enjoyed the episodes that I saw. However, they were mainly a bunch of campy, individual fantasy-based shows that happened to form a series. They were meant to be that way for people who enjoyed that type of show, and I don't fault them for that, at all. Legend of the Seeker is a continuing story of amazing vision, that of Terry Goodkind's first book, \"Wizard's First Rule.\" If you enjoy epic fantasy, trust me, keep watching.<br/><br/>I hope you found this helpful.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "203 out of 274 found this helpful.", "date": "10 December 2008"}, {"title": " Legend of the Seeker", "content": "I for one think it is great to have something like this on television.

Nah, not really. It's a fun series, a bit heavy on the comedy on some occasions, and it's taken a while to get the story rolling, but its good fun to watch, beautiful scenery, good main actors that feel believable. It doesn't take itself too seriously and in my opinion, neither should the viewers.<br/><br/>In conclusion: The naysayers say, No! Horrible! Goodkind sells his soul to mammon!

I missed having a great adventure, swords blazing, fantasy including and hero adoring show on TV. I immediately looked up the first two episodes that I missed online and watched them. <br/><br/>I loved the fire that lingers between Richard and Kahlan, the Confessor (I love that title/name). Zed is perfect, he adds that hint of humor while still maintaining his powerful presence. Now the action....it was great and captivating. I am a fan of taking bits of slow downed fighting snips within a fight that just make the scene grander (alla 300), and I adore me some sword play. I think people who liked Lord of the Rings, Zena, and just plain fantasy adventure stories will love this series.<br/><br/>I personally have read the books but never became an obsessed fan (I have enough obsessions) and I have been reading a lot of hating from fans of the book , saying that the show gets away from the books' story line and that Richard's character has been dumped down a little and he is also physically smaller. Both these things I do not have an issue with. I to thought he was stupid at times in the first two episode, but I think that they did that to show character progression and growth. He will learn in his journey (by the fourth he already seems much wiser). I like him smaller as well because is makes him a character to root for even harder, he may not look like a all menacing warrior ( alla Hercules) but don't underestimate him. He comes off more as a young man that destiny has chosen to become a hero but a hero that was bond to have a great destiny. <br/><br/>Although, as an obsessed fan of other books that have been adapted I understand the fans feelings, but I am also one that lets things go. When adaptations are not all I imagined, I take it as a separate thing. The show is just inspired by the novels and does plan on keeping the main story line. However, it is not a movie or a mini series but a TV series it will not follow the book to note and can not be expected too.<br/><br/>All and all I thought it was a great action adventure show to satisfy the fantasy lovers in all of us, just enjoy it.

But you have to keep in mind that no film/series/miniseries is ever exactly the same as its source material.<br/><br/>When the first episode began, I scratched my head as to why Dennee (Kahlan's adoptive sister) was A. alive, and B. riding with Kahlan to find Richard, as the book starts with her having already been killed. But it was interesting to see someone else's vision of the story I'd all but lived (as books tend to do that), and what the people in it looked like.<br/><br/>It became a bit of a novelty at first; to see the changes, the visualisation of worlds, peoples, and situations (nevermind swords and magic *wink* *wink*). And while some things bugged me; Kahlan being pronounced Kaylan, as the 'H' in her name would flatten the 'A' so that it sounded like the 'A' in \"apple\", rather than the 'A' in \"sway\" - other things did make me smile and take note, as it was interesting to see characters reference people and places and things that readers of the book would know intimately (it was kind of a wink to us who had stayed with it all this time).<br/><br/>WHAT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER IS THIS: what has been created on screen is not the books, but rather one interpretation of them. It feels like I'm peering into another dimension that runs parallel to the books, where the characters in both had roughly the same starting point but are making their way down the road at a different pace, and stopping to see different sights.<br/><br/>In all honesty, you cannot with the mindset: \"This had better be just like the books or else\".<br/><br/>Personally, I really enjoyed the story of the books, but I'm also enjoying the series as it comes out, and I find myself checking for when the next episode is on.<br/><br/>The story in itself is timeless because a lot of the themes are ones that have been with us forever, and I feel a lot of the same spirit exists in the series as in the books.<br/><br/>What's been done has been done to bring it to a larger audience (and in some cases a younger one), and while it sometimes gets to me that the fights are done like the movie \"300\", or that a wounded enemy will fall down and have no wound whatsoever when he hits the ground, the series was never intended to be the books. To have tried to make it exactly so would have been foolish as not only are the mediums so different, but the audiences as well.<br/><br/>Any reader who picks up Wizard's First Rule is probably already a fantasy reader, where as people can and probably will enjoy the series as a more light thing than sitting down to read a novel.<br/><br/>So the facts are this: The books are so well known because they are THAT good for what they do, but the series is also top notch by a fantasy series standard (nevermind a Disney standard - as Disney standard its far more intelligent and grown up than you'd expect). The series, like the books, will not suit everyone, so its time to stop protesting its existence because it isn't exactly what you may have read. Those who watch it as they're first introduction to the Sword of Truth world will get a kick out of it for the same reasons we all did reading the books.<br/><br/>So if you haven't seen it, give it a go, but don't expect it to be the books. And if you're just interested in a fantasy TV series or a fun series for the family or for whatever reason, you'll probably have a blast.<br/><br/>Seriously, I wish it had been around when I was a kid, it would have slotted right in next to Thundercats and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and I would have been well-pleased.<br/><br/>The fact is, if Terry Goodkind can still remain a driving force behind the writing of the series, and remain happy with what's going out, why can't you? WE may have visited the world, but its creator had to live in it, and breath in and out with every creature in that world, feeling every inch of that reality. It would have been the hardest thing for him to let go of, but if he's still as happy as he is with what his baby is growing up to be... maybe it deserves a little pause for thought.", "rating": 6, "helpful": "63 out of 93 found this helpful.", "date": "8 January 2009"}, {"title": " The best serie I think", "content": "That is a special serie.

They were terrific actors and had great chemistry as James and Florida Evans. They had three kids: J.J., Thelma, and Michael.

Michael was a near child prodigy who was well-educated on social issues and was destined to become a lawyer.<br/><br/>In 1976, the producers made a huge mistake by firing John Amos, literally killing off his character. This really changed the focus, and not for the good I might add. The shows began to focus more on J.J. and his buffoon-like behavior which angered black viewers as well as series star Esther Rolle, who left after the next season. Instead of a show that focused on key African-American issues that existed in society at the time, viewers got shows that were overloaded with skirt chasing and fat jokes.<br/><br/>Once Esther Rolle left, the quality of the show suffered even more.

That theme got a little over done at times, but it was the 70's and blacks were still seeking equality. It was actually quite funny&gt; All references in the show had to be \"black\". For instance:  Every book report had to be about black history, every movie had to involve black people, every politition had to be black, the list went on and on. All posters in there rooms were black people, furniture pieces were African. All guests were black people. Man, I can't remember ever seeing a white guy in that show! Common, Chicago wasn't all black! Actually I loved the intro and ending to each show; the painting at the end, the camera sky-views of Chicago, the theme music, the bike rider and citizens. Very cool. What I liked about this show over Sanford and Son was that whites weren't portrayed as idiots, like some stupid attack against shows in the past that put blacks in an Aunt Jemima mode, please! It also dated politics, recession, wages, history. It was great. The best episodes were the first few years with James Evans, the father. He was tough, but loving and kind. He took no bull from any of the kids. He worked hard. He loved his wife. The way he was written out of the show was very abrupt. He was out of town, got hit by a car, and died. This funeral episode was excellent. Ester Rolle was handling the death all well untill the end. As she was putting away dishes from the wake at their house, she saw a flower James had left her and kept working, she finally stopped and smashed a bowl on the kitchen floor as she swore and then broke down in tremendous grief over the loss of her husband. Her children(who were shocked she hadn't grieved in front of others but was laughing) then ran from their rooms and comforted her with a family hug. The show ended. No canned laughter, no music.

If you didn't like the show, fine, but some of your reasons for disliking it are totally erroneous. To wit:<br/><br/>1. \"Thelma dressed like a slut\": These must be the HBO episodes! I was always surprised that, considering the way Bernadette Stanis was built, they kept her covered up most of the time. She hardly showed any cleavage, the hemlines of her skirts and dresses were quite low. Her pants and jeans may have been tight but then again, in the Seventies, WHOSE weren't?<br/><br/>2. \"(The Evanses were) living like animals\": Not hardly. I can honestly say that our family was a little bit like the Evanses and we DIDN'T live in the projects neither. If, as you say, the head of the household is always losing his job, it's going to be kind of hard to keep a roof over your head and food on the table. It's kind of hard to eat fillet mignon on a hot dog budget.<br/><br/>3. \"(James) threatened with violence for everything. I don't remember him sitting down and explaining (anything)\": You must have missed those episodes, I can remember numerous times when James sat down and talked things out without yelling or threatening to take off his belt. In fact, there was even one episode when he apologized to Michael, which in turn led to Michael feeling as if he could apologize for acting up in school.<br/><br/>4. \"James got in front of white people and did that stupid laugh\": Wrong! If you look at the show again, you will see that James would do the laugh (A-heh-heh-heh!) only when he got caught in a lie by Florida. Usually about an old girlfriend.<br/><br/>5. \"Michael . . . would get put down (for his militantism) and made to seem foolish . . .\": Those scenes were done to show to Michael that everything wasn't as simple as black-and-white, so to speak. Example: Florida's rich cousin announces that he had just been laid off from his high-paying job. <br/><br/>Michael: \"I'll bet the only reason you were fired was because you're black.\" Cousin: \"Well, if they did, then they also fired six other men because they were white.\" Get the picture?<br/><br/>6. \"It says we're content to live like . . . animals\": You could say a lot of things about the Evanses and Willona, but you can't say that they were content with their lot in life. James was always looking for better paying jobs. J.J. (yes, I will admit that he was a BIT much) kept working at his painting as well as looking for artistic jobs. Thelma wanted to be a dancer (and, no, not a stripper). Michael let a street gang know that he wanted more with his life than to settle for being a ghetto resident. To paraphrase Florida in one episode: there is no such thing as a waste of hope.<br/><br/>For the most part, I liked the show during the \"James Years\". The humor was believable and came from the heart. After John Amos left, the quality of the show really went down. When Ester Rolle left, it took an even bigger dive. Adding Janet Jackson did NOT help things any. When Rolle returned, the damage had been done too far to repair. Mr. Wall, I hope you will look at the show again and think over your past comments.

James was the father figure everyone like,and he was always providing something for his family even though they was struggling through tough times,but they came through. I was very sadden when James Evans was killed in an auto accident,and that was the show's very best episode and an emotional one as well in what the family was going through without a father figure for the children,but they continued on with J.J. stepping from a kid into manhood and the fatherly role after John Amos' character left the show. Micheal (the youngest of the Evans children) was always the militant of the family and always keeping the family together even after the mom(Florida played by Esther Rolle)had a emotional breakdown after James' funeral. Sad part though: the guy who played Micheal(Ralph Carter) recently passed away....but his character was a symbol of black pride and black progress towards black success,and against racial intolerence in with he quoted that the word \"boy\" is a white racist word.

I've taken away two for the dip in quality this series suffered after season 3. You'll read why in a bit.<br/><br/>In February of 1974,a really great sit-com (with dramatic overtones)premiered on CBS. It was a TV first,a show about an African-American family living in the Chicago Projects in the 1970s.<br/><br/>Created by Norman Lear as a spin-off of \"Maude\",he once again struck the right chord with viewers. <br/><br/>Not since this show, have I seen a situation comedy directly talk about the struggles of inner-city families. (Well,there was Fox's \"South Central\" in '94 but was not renewed.) <br/><br/>John Amos as James Evans Sr. was the ultimate father figure for this family and acted as any father should to keep his family together and his kids from going down the wrong paths in life, which in their situation, can be all too easy.<br/><br/>Esther Rolle was a wonderful no non-sense mother figure who was on the same page as her husband when it came to their kids upbringing. <br/><br/>Ralph Carter as Michael a young but very bright young man for his age but stuck in a school system that doesn't meet his academic needs. His character's name is the same as the show's founder Mike Evans (best known as Lionel Jefferson on \"All In The Family &amp; \"The Jeffersons\". (Mike Evans passed away Dec. 2006).<br/><br/>Thelma is a young girl of 16 or 17 and has to deal with the dangers of being a young woman in the streets of the ghetto. She is strong but at the same time, a sweet girl looking for her Prince to take her out of the ghetto.<br/><br/>Jimmie Walker as J.J. Evans Jr. is the typical young wise-cracking jive-talking kind of young man who does not take life seriously enough. yet at the same time, is a gifted artist who can paint wonderful things on canvas. <br/><br/>After the demise of the James Evans character (aka the firing of John Amos) the show lost a good deal of it's stability. Many viewers departed. Esther Rolle left (after Season 4) for an entire year, not wanting to play second fiddle to J.J.'s smart-aleck Dyno-mite's.<br/><br/>As well as the writers lack of quality story lines. She returned after securing a guarantee that the writer's would even things out.<br/><br/>Florida's neighbor Wilona Woods was a divorced woman who ended up adopting an abused little girl Penny Gordon (played by a then 10 year old Janet Jackson). Penny's abusive mother was played by Totie Fields,Kim Fields' Mother.<br/><br/>The final season brought the character Keith. A young Pro-football payer who falls for and marries Thelma and (for awhile) ends up living with the Evans's. With this addition and Rolle back in the series, the episodes were the best they'd been in sometime.<br/><br/>....but, in August of 1979 the show came to an end,with all leaving the projects for a better life. J.J. the artist had sold an idea to a comic-book company, Michael went off to live on campus at college. <br/><br/>Wilona's financial out look changed, allowing her to find her &amp; Penny a place to live uptown. Keith knee fully recovered and he signed contract with the Bears &amp; also get he and Thelma a new place. Thelma made it known she was going to have a baby and that she wanted Florida t come live with them. <br/><br/>As it turned out, Wilona and Penny's place was the 'very' same building Keith &amp; Thelma were moving too.

When it first aired it seemed promising... despite the reverse discrimination and broad sweeping hatred of all whites by the youngest son Michael, who they called the militant midget.<br/><br/>But as time passed, it became a mockery of itself. The crown jewel of catch phrase based comedies. The first step down was killing off John Amos. The second step down was when Esther Rolle left because she felt the show negatively reflected on black youth by how it portrayed JJ Evans as a womanizing self absorbed goof. Then the final blow, after the 2 stabilizing figures left the show, was the addition of the character Penny, horribly played by the young Janet Jackson and the sudden focus on family friend and relentless insult comic, Willona.<br/><br/>Even before then, the script writers had degraded to a formula: write an entire script around JJ's many catch phrases.

Things were bright, gritty, funny, and honest until they changed the course of the program. James dies and JJ took over the show. <br/><br/>Flo was still mom, Thelma was blossoming into a lady and Michael was still the militant midget but JJ was the show.

His emotional age is about 11 or 12 even though he looks like a guy in his early twenties.

J.J. is an aspiring painter but unlike his younger brother is never serious about getting a college degree, or more important to the family getting a job to help support a household that is just above welfare status.<br/><br/>Two classic episodes of Good Times was the one where the Janet Jackson character is running a fever of 104, and Florida Evans is desperately seeking good medical help for her can't afford anything but a clinic doctor who is very professional yet doesn't want to give a family from the projects any more attention than she legally has to. The other episode is the one where James Evans can't afford the rent a paltry low $104 a month. The Evans are about to get the largest of family setbacks, being thrown out of the projects with no where to go. Florida Evans goes downtown to the board of social services to try to get either a loan or a grant to help her family.

Let me just give some bits and parts of the show that made it lose a lot of cool points.<br/><br/>Joan's behavior was completely rotten towards William when they returned from New York, and she was a bit immature, trying to play games, setting him up with both Monica and the other girl. Those that watched the show avidly saw her conduct towards him.<br/><br/>She was actually jealous of Toni when Toni was about to get married. What was that all about? I thought they were true friends. She took out her anger on Ellis, and later cheated on him and lied to him. She was an extremely stink girlfriend. A lying, cheating, jealous, immature fool. Ellis was never that great anyway. Their union, as many other unions on this show, should have never happened.<br/><br/>Maya's conduct was similar, especially when she was William's assistant, and even after she was rightly fired. The episode where Reverend Al Sharpton guest starred made me cuss. William asked her to do one thing, she did something else, and made a spectacle of herself in front of the Reverend. She failed to remember that she was the one who was rude and inefficient, and tried to make William out to be the bad guy. She was an ingrate to both William and Joan. The whole ghetto, sassy act was not cute and not cool. She always felt she could do what she wanted when she wanted where she wanted.<br/><br/>She also wanted to make Darnell miserable after they broke up, calling him over to pick fights with him Wasn't she the one who cheated? <br/><br/>Her friend also acted like a total jerk towards the father of her own children when he came to pick up the kids.<br/><br/>Did Lynn say she wanted to burn down Joan's house after she was kicked out? Did she also want to do the same after Toni fired her as her assistant at her new real estate office? That was supposed to be funny? Don't even get me started on Toni Chlamydia Childs and Monica the Control Freak.<br/><br/>There is so little respect for one another that I sometimes question the friendships. The writer of this show is another writer I wish I could talk to face to face. If there is anything that I am not understanding, then she can show me. I want to go through episode by episode and drill her.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "11 out of 20 found this helpful.", "date": "20 February 2008"}, {"title": " High class minstrel show", "content": "I'll admit that Girlfriends didn't look so bad for the first 5 episodes. Im not sure why I watched this junk for at least 3 seasons but I guess I was just being optimistic that this show might have gotten better as it progressed but it didn't. There are times when this show blatantly rips off elements of Sex and The City. In this review I'll state everything that made me despise this show. The characters are pretty obnoxious and as the show progresses its hard to like them because they do some pretty stupid things to jeopardize their lives. Joan Clayton(Tracee Ellis Ross) cant keep a steady relationship with a man to save her life. Maya Wilkes(Golden Brooks) doesn't know if she wants to be with Darnell or not and she drives him as well as the viewers of this show nuts with her high strung antics. Lynn Seacy(Persia White) is the most likable character in this show but she is not without her flaws. She does not know if she wants to be with men or women(and she drives them both insane), She is very scatterbrained and when people depend on her she is likely to fail them. Plus I found it very typical that the most likable character of all of them is the one of mixed heritage. Toni Childs(Jill Marie Jones) is the most reprehensible of all characters. As a matter of fact she is probably the most insufferable character in sitcom history. She is a high class gold-digger that puts poor Todd Garrett(Jason Pace) through hell. So much so that when he took her to court that I was ecstatic but unfortunately the idiot had to feel sympathy for this loathsome tramp and dropped the case. William Dent(Reginald C Hayes) would be a likable character but his moronic horn dog ways makes it virtually impossible to like him. He ruins what could have been a decent relationship with his boss(played by Anne Marie Johnson) to be a pig and is constantly running back to that gold-digging self-centered trollop Monica(Keesha Sharpe), even though her love for him was only on a financial level. Pluss episode after episode is wasted on him chasing after Donna Williams(Jill Scott) and we all know that wouldn't have worked out at all. Darnell Wilkes(Khalil Khan) seems somewhat smart till you realize that only a fool would put up with Maya for so long. There are plenty of episodes that make me disgusted with this show but there is one episode that is stuck in my mind eternally. The episode where William forgets to pose as Santa Claus(or Satan's Claws) for Jabari and the the girls were mad at him for that made me sick to my stomach. First of all we all know that Santa Claus is an imaginary character so you're going to get angry at William because he doesn't cater fairy tales to a little boy that needs to be fed truth in order to grow up to be a mentally stable adult? How insane is that? And we wonder why these kids grow up to be so self- destructive. If they are fed these poisonous fairy tales all their lives how can they deal with reality? Any Black parent that feeds their kids these harmful tall tales needs to be locked up for the rest of their natural lives. <br/><br/>In closing, Girlfriends is wildly overrated and symbolizes everything thats wrong with modern Black sitcoms. Back in the day bourgeoisie morons criticized shows like Frank's Place, Different World, Roc, The Cosby Show and Parent Hood for being unrealistic and preachy but those shows were way over their snooty heads and were leaps and bounds over the rubbish that passes for sitcoms now. As for the comparisons to Living Single, don't make me laugh. Living Single might not be deep but it had class and you don't despise the characters of that show. Sure they were pretty goofy but they were likable characters. The characters of Girlfriends are so repulsive that you just want them to get trampled by a stampede consisting of the starting lineup of every team on the NFL. You cranks that want to be entertained instead of being \"preached to\" have found your mindless junk food. Enjoy it and savor every bite. Pretty soon there will be a Black Michael Bay to satisfy your appetite for mindless action movies with no substance. As for me I will not go near another Black sitcom. I am always anxious to see Black people on the TV screen but when all I'm getting is chittlin circuit trash like Girlfriends, Eve, Cuts, The Game and Half and Half , I begin to lose hope for quality Black shows because every show that was cool like All Of Us is countered by dreck like the shows I just mentioned.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "13 out of 26 found this helpful.", "date": "10 March 2009"}, {"title": " Great", "content": "Many of you are taking this show way too critically.

It made not have the spunk of \"Living Single\",but the full charmastic charm and wit of HBO's \"Sex In The City\" and it shows. The minute I saw this show I was immediately hooked.`The show did have some flaws in its first season,but as the second season progressed,it improved totally. This concerns three well educated sistas living and working in L.A. as we explore there ups and downs on relationships and etc. As for the characters themselves are a trip and each week they can't figured out why they can't keep in man in company let alone dissect him in pieces. First off,you have Joan(Tracee Ellis Ross)who is always interfearing in somebody else's concerns as well as her own and can't keep a man in check. One episode in particular shows how Joan gets a taste of her own medicine here in which she talks down to a guy she loves but he walks out on her after she says something pathetic in front of him. Second, the golddigger Toni(Jill Jones)who is always dead broke but is always high class,but is always begging a guy for attention especially when it comes to money or in other cases stealing someone else's guy for her own greedy self,but is dead broke and she is part country too. Third, miss ghetto fabulous equals attitude Maya(Golden Brooks) who is married to Darnell(Khalil Khan)and has a 8 year old and has martial problems but she is also cheating on her husband with another guy behind his back and sometimes is the leader of the girl group and the one with the most common sense some of the time. Finally,the freeloader and sometimes lazy as hell Lynn(Persia White)who is a lot like Lisa Bonet who always talks down to a guy but will sleep with anyone she claims with and like Toni also wants attention for her own selfish greed,but also she has a hatred for guys and is the bisexual part of the group(One episode dealt with Lynn coming to terms with her own sexuality when one of the girls catches her in bed with another lover---a woman!)...Lynn is a vagabond and will make a home whenever she fits. These inconsistencies in their personalitites make the characters come alive and it makes the show very watchable as we see girls go through the motions each week. The casting is excellent here and it comes to my attention that the only brother on the show (Reginald Hayes) is just a joke in between the girls,but he does help them out in tight situations. Let's hope that UPN keeps this one for several seasons,because its one of the many shows the many sides of women working together through good times and bad.

Despite always looking as though she is being goosed, Tracee Ross-Ellis is as good if not better as any other comic actress in recent memory. She also conveys intelligence and even manages to be somewhat sexy at times. The real sex appeal on this show comes from Golden Brooks and Jill Marie Jones whose quirky characterizations are appealing despite the flaws and air of self-interest written into them. Reginald C. Hayes manages to pull off his role as the series main male regular character with humor and likability. This role might have been a more traditional 'eunuch in the harem' part save for the fact that Hayes seems to have slept with every one of the female characters on the show. <br/><br/>\"Girlfriends\" is much more clever and adult than one might expect and the airwaves and cable lines are filled with many much less enjoyable shows.

If I had to compare this to another anime, I'd say the setting and the fight scenes are similar to Gurren Laggan, while the drama is similar to Spice and Wolf, in that it is as intense as Spice and Wolf, but with a little more focus on the web of connections between characters, not just 2 of them, while it does an excellent job displaying the fact that these pilots are not hardened adults, but growing teens with their own issues of relationships and learning the truth about the world and themselves. and this anime made me tear up ad much as Plastic Memories due to all the gripping drama scenes.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "18 out of 25 found this helpful.", "date": "1 July 2018"}, {"title": " DARLING in the FRANXX review", "content": "Darling in the Franxx is an original anime by a collaboration between Trigger, A-1 pictures and CloverWorks. It has 24 episodes and aired over the Winter and Spring seasons in 2018. Elements of all three studios shine through the project in a variety of ways, especially along the lines of animation, drama and romantic themes, which are characteristically A-1 and CloverWorks. However, Trigger's presence in the Action, Sci-Fi and Mecha themes are prevalent and have a commanding presence that easily outshines its partners. This is why Darling is heavily considered another staple in Trigger's legacy and gets them most of the love...and the hate. However, we should keep in mind that this was a joint effort and the hard work and dedication of all three studios should be praised.<br/><br/>Darling is set in a futuristic world where humans have thrown away their emotions and rudimentary desires for the chance to live immortal lives without the troubles that the civilizations of the past brought them. Thanks to a new group of leaders known as APE, they were able to maximize their use of a special Magma energy, which fueled their cities and made their complacent lives possible. However, as a consequence, they were constantly attacked by a force known as Klaxosaurs, forcing them into highly secured cities known as plantations. To combat these beings, they began experiments, which led to the creation of children called parasites. These parasites were able to operate special mechanized weapons called Franxx, because unlike the \"adults\", who were the humans that choose immortality, the parasites retained their ability to use their sexual organs, which was required to pilot the Franxx. Their sole purpose was to fight for their \"Papa.\"<br/><br/>Plantation 13 is a special team of parasites that were even more unique than the standard parasites because they also retained emotions. This made them act quite differently from their fellow parasites and they often felt as though they didn't belong because of these differences. Hiro was the most out of place, being unable to link up with his previous partner and pilot the Franxx, making him feel as though he had no worth. However, he soon encounters a rouge parasite with horns, named Zero Two, who is part Klaxosaur and has a bad reputation for draining her partners' life force, getting her the nickname, \"the partner killer\". During a surprise attack by the Klaxosaurs, Hiro is given the opportunity to become her partner and is surprised to find that not only can he fly, but with Zero Two, he can achieve impossible heights. From this point on they vow to do whatever it takes to always pilot together, despite outside opposition and interference, but they soon find that their freedom and newfound love will come at a higher price than they could've ever expected and they will have to go through much hardship, to protect their home, their friends and their future.<br/><br/>With that said, let us now take a look at the most talked about series of the year so far and discuss what it got right, where it went wrong and the ugliness of the fandom.<br/><br/>The Good<br/><br/>For much of the first half of the series, the focus was on Plantation 13 and the growing relationship between Hiro and Zero Two. We began to discover a world in which children were not allowed to ask questions, explore their world, know themselves or pursue interpersonal relationships with each other outside what was necessary to pilot the Franxx. They were not allowed to voice their opinions or reach for anything more than what they were made for, piloting the Franxx and waging war against the enemies known as the Klaxosaurs. However, we soon learn that the children of 13 were meant to be different from their peers. That they were an experiment of Dr. Franxx, the genius behind the Mechas and the various uses of Magma Energy. They were essentially a case study and what we, as the viewers, saw in the first half, as a result.<br/><br/>We saw that by being allowed to retain emotions and desires, the children acted in strange ways. They experienced sadness, pain, rejection, depression, confusion, jealousy and anger. They struggled to find their self-identity, suffered from illness both physically and mentally at times and came to discover that they were starting to feel the greatest emotion of all, love. Love was the one emotion they were never taught or allowed to acknowledge, yet it alone created a frenzy within the group and started a chain reaction of conflict and drama. We saw triangles start to form, we saw puberty begin to influence their sexual desires and we saw some struggling to understand why they were different. The catalyst of all these changes, was Hiro and Zero Two, who quite naturally fell in love and became the example to the others of what it really meant to be human. This idea in fact, is what the series was really after, and is what it perfected by its end.<br/><br/>The relationship between Hiro and Zero Two is also something the series got exceptionally right. From the start, the love between them was raw and deep, and their feelings never wavered, even when there were many forces working to keep them apart. Even when they were separated, they yearned to be together and worked to return to each other by any means necessary. They were portrayed as a unit that could no longer live without the other, literal halves of one existence. The theme explored by referencing the Jian, a species of bird that cannot fly without one lending the other a wing. Zero Two desperately wanted to become human for her Darling and Hiro in turn was willing to lose his humanity for Zero Two. They were destined soulmates and from start to finish, their relationship was developed, crafted and nurtured so delicately and perfectly, it can easily be seen as one of the greatest examples of true love in anime.<br/><br/>Last but not least, the most unexpected development of the series, was the reveal of homosexuality with certain key characters. While one character was hinted to be possibly Bisexual, another character was confirmed to be a lesbian. This character was shown to struggle with their homosexuality throughout the first half, starting subtly, but soon after by the climax, her struggles came crashing down and she could no longer hold back her feelings. She confessed to another girl in 13 and what we saw was a beautiful example of support for those who may lead alternative lifestyles. Her crush did not express disgust or belittle her feelings. She didn't make her feel as though she was a freak and embraced her. Even though it was a soft rejection, she was supported and allowed to feel safe and comfortable. She was allowed to feel valid and normal. She no longer felt there was something wrong with her. She was allowed to hope that she might one day have her love returned or in the very least would be able to be herself without fear of being outcast or crucified. I found this to be a beautiful moment and I respect the creators for representing such a critical and important topic so well.<br/><br/>The Bad<br/><br/>The second half of the series is where things started to truthfully become unstable. This was largely due to the fact that they introduced a very unexpected new enemy into the fray of this war. Those who are familiar with Trigger shouldn't have been too surprised, but despite this, the development was still a bit odd and frankly out of place. To go from fighting the planetary beings that were the Klaxosaurs, to suddenly being faced with the threat of a massive alien race, was a rather ridiculous jump, even for Trigger's standards. I think this is where we perhaps saw a power struggle between the studios, namely A-1 who likes things to be dramatically contained and Trigger who likes things to be explosive and grandiose. Or maybe it felt more like they needed a way to pump up the action and so they pulled a ludicrous plot point from out of a grab bag of flair. This is all to say, this development was a bit off the mark and may have cost these studios a chance to have a collective masterpiece under their helm. They'd have been much wiser to keep things in line to the first half and focused on Papa, who truthfully is the enemy in any sense. A coming of age into rebellion story would have been a more sensible outcome.<br/><br/>Another negative aspect was the fan service and lewd innuendos the show began with. It gave the impression that this was going to be a bit of a trashy mecha series and so it made people take it less seriously and undermined the beauty it would later exhibit. It may have been an intentional tactic to bait in a certain audience, but it also backfired a bit because when it went in a different direction, this same audience became the biggest of critics. They managed to pull in a whole different audience midway in the series, at the crux, but then turned them off by again switching their focus to the extreme. It made them seem incompetent and honestly just confused everyone. It seemed to have lost its identity somewhere along the way and had to struggle to bring it back. It was only by the finale that we saw where they wanted to go, but the path they took to get there was too inconsistent to have as much of an impact as they may have intended and hoped for.<br/><br/>Finally, the plot called for the pretty non-negotiable need for the Franxx to be piloted by a male and female pair, making it seem that same-sex pairings were invalid and heterosexuality was superior. While not the most glaring example, I will agree that this is slightly heteronormative, despite being a valid plot point. I feel that the fact that male and female pairs were the norm was not the problem, but rather their lack of exploration of same-sex pairs. I think if they had a scene or two showing that same-sex pairings could pilot together if there were romantic feelings between them, it would have been better. It seemed as though they might be going there with that Bisexual character I mentioned and Hiro, but they didn't seem to f", "rating": 7, "helpful": "4 out of 4 found this helpful.", "date": "14 October 2020"}, {"title": " LOVE IT!!!!SO NICE :)", "content": "Best Anime in my life OMGGGGGG:))) l'm soo excited", "rating": 10, "helpful": "23 out of 34 found this helpful.", "date": "20 April 2018"}, {"title": " The best anime series I've every watched", "content": "So i'm currently 22 episodes in (2 more left) and it is by far the best anime series i have ever watched lol, absolutely fantastic", "rating": 10, "helpful": "14 out of 20 found this helpful.", "date": "26 June 2018"}, {"title": " i love it !!", "content": "This anime is one of the best anime. and It deserves a second season", "rating": 10, "helpful": "10 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "11 July 2018"}, {"title": " Perfect", "content": "This anime is just awsome!

Instead, TTG is a very entertaining mixture of usual superhero romp (with the gratuitous violence) and self-deprecating humor, with characters that represent several human foibles, especially when it comes to how Robin is portrayed: as the power-mad leader of the Titans who is capricious, eccentric, jealous, paranoid and spoiled rotten. Most of the humor is the type of pie-in-the-face you find in cartoons like Spongebob, but there are also plenty of jokes for us adults, especially for those of us who grew up in the 80s. I also perceive a libertarian streak in some of the writing; for instance the episode \"Nose Mouth\" clearly shows the dangers of abusing a great power (Raven's black magic) to fix apparent minor personality flaws in some of the team members, with things getting out of hand the moment Raven started to see problems to 'fix' around her which turns her into an evil entity quite rapidly. That has to be one of the best analogies about government abuse of power I have seen on a TV show. <br/><br/>Now I haven't seen the original show except in passing. I did read some of the comments from what I gather are very serious fans of the original talking trash about Teen Titans GO! These fans are taking things a little too seriously. Teen Titans GO! is obviously a comedy show which lampoons the original TT in particular and superheroes in general. In my view, if there was a bunch of superheroes that screamed for lampooning, it was the Teen Titans; the original characters themselves are quite ridiculous, especially the non-human Starfire and Raven which were invented back in the 80s as sensual \u00fcberfrauen. In fact I think the new characters are much more attractive and endearing that the original characters precisely because of how each lampoons the older and ostensibly more serious characters. There is an obvious sexual innuendo in the way the original characters in Teen Titans were drawn and portrayed, and in Teen Titans GO! they simply make it obvious in order to make fun of this sensuality (for instance, watch episode \"Legs\" and \"Mr. Butt\".)<br/><br/>I do recommend the show and recommend you buy the DVDs. The comedy is very entertaining and funny - not always, but most of the time. The inside jokes are hilarious.

On it's debut episode it made me laugh all of one time (the joke where Beast Boy gives Cyborg his drawing for a Birthday Present in the middle of an argument and a pie fight).

The line said by Starfire in the episode Dog Hand, which sets up the general feeling amongst the viewers who have declared this show an abomination, due to not following the original's compelling story and characters we cared about. Like many, I loved the original Teen Titans, which pretty much was up there with series like Static Shock, Batman Beyond, Justice League, and Batman TAS. The original Teen Titans will forever be a part of our childhood, and we as fans will go out in all lengths to defend the honor of the show, but many are missing the point to Teen Titans Go. In doing so, they are missing what seems to be a promising comedic spin on our Titans. This review will shed light on why Teen Titans Go is actually pretty good, along with the misunderstanding that needs to be cleared up in order for the show to have a puncher's chance.<br/><br/>Let's start by stating that this revival of Teen Titans was never meant to follow or be like the original series. Those who thought otherwise did not read up enough on the show's premise and details. Teen Titans Go takes our Titans and puts them in a skit. Much like the abridge series of shows like DBZ and Yugioh. Teen Titans Go is a comedic take on the daily lives of our heroes, and has taken a break from all the serious action and storytelling that we all loved in the original. The mistake that fans do is that they take the show too serious and continue to compare it to the original, thus eliminating any chance for the show to strive. Once the public separates the original from the new, then the show's genius will take off. <br/><br/>Now, you're probably saying that there is nothing special or great about the show. It's not funny or the animation is too grade school. That is all fair, perhaps the show is not your cup of tea, but here are some reasons why the show does excel. First reason; believe it or not, this show does a great job by paying tribute to its old counterpart. The episode Pie Bros highlights a familiar villain known as Mother Mae eye, which the old lady uses her customers as the secret ingredient to her delicious pies. Many Teen Titans Go episodes highlight concepts and villains that were present in the original, and put them into a comedic light. Raven's daddy coming to visit, Jynx hanging out with Raven and Starfire or Speedy challenging Robin for Starfire's love are but many episodes in which there are hints of our beloved series, but you have to have an open mind to see the hints to the original.<br/><br/>The DC Easter Eggs runs rampant in this show. You have to be a big DC fan to understand and spot the funny takes of Batman being portrayed as a Lazy guy or hints to other iconic characters. All over Titans Tower we see posters and plushes of many DC heroes and villains that pay respect to the universe. Ever notice the picture of Ra's Al Ghul in Raven's room? Or how about the Wonder Woman Teddy Bear plush that Starfire owns? Notice that Batman hangs out a lot with Jim Gordon? Wait, what, there was a movie called The Dark Knight Snoozes? The details are cleverly hidden, and will take a few sits downs to point out all Easter eggs and references. I bet not many appreciated when the Wonder Twins were featured, and how they ridicule Zan for having whack superpowers, but hey he makes a good receptionist. <br/><br/>The argument of it being way too kiddy can be true at times, but many miss the wit that the show presents in subtle moments. The episode La Larva de Amor pokes fun at milk mustaches. At one point we have Cyborg look like Mr. T. Raven sports the Gandalf look from the LOR, and Beast boy does his Chewbacca impression. In the episode Tower Power, Cyborg references to VHS, Different Strokes, and The Pointer Sisters. Not to mention that stereotype on Mexicans in the episode La Larva de Armor. These jokes and pokes would fly over a child's head. Teen Titans go has a little fun for all ages. <br/><br/>Lastly, the characters on this show make it all worthwhile. The original voice cast is here and that authenticates the shows respect for the original. Robin is portrayed as being a control freak and has moments of rage and insecurities, sounds familiar. Raven is still emo and has her sarcastic wit that feels like Raven of old. Cyborg and Beast boy are still pals, and they have their fun. Starfire is still innocent at times and loves her Silky. You see, the Titans are still there, but they have transformed into Toon versions, and are put into a new world where doing laundry can be a great evil foe.<br/><br/>Everyone has their tastes and by no means is this show perfect. However, the mistake is that going into a premiere with the expectations of a show being just like the original will set you up for disappointment. It's happen to a lot of revivals that are good, but are ripped because it's not the original. Teen Titans Go takes a step back from the original and focuses on lighter and wittier moments that make this show hilarious at times. The original will forever be superior, but this new take has its brilliance, you just need to let go for a moment and let the show take its course. Defiantly the show is worth a look or two, but by my standards the show is a solid 8/10 for doing what it is suppose to do, and that's being a parody of one of the greatest cartoon series on cartoon network.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "154 out of 280 found this helpful.", "date": "27 July 2013"}, {"title": " I'm utterly amazed at how many people aren't getting it", "content": "It should be very obvious in the first 5 minutes.

While I knew from the get-go that it was going to be mainly a comedy show, this was fine since the original series tended to be more comedic than action-packed anyway. Also, I found the Teen Titans shorts that were made for the DC Nation block to be highly amusing and assumed that this series would be similar to those. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I have found the series to be a complete and utter disappointment. The animation is of extremely low quality, the characters are all one dimensional, and their personalities are disregarded in favor of making a joke. For example, in the pilot episode, Raven is shown to be a fan of a show that resembles My Little Pony, something that would never have happened in the original series. While I did chuckle at some of the jokes, the humor overall is clearly designed for little kids (I would estimate that the target audience is 3-10 year olds). While I understand that it is a kid show, this does not excuse the poor animation and the overall lack of creativity. <br/><br/>One sad thing about all this is the fact that the original series was more amusing in my opinion. For example, in the second part of the pilot for Teen Titans Go!, Beast Boy gets a job in order to buy a video game for Cyborg. This is similar to the episode Employee of the Month from the original series. If one were to compare the two, the latter is far superior to the former and more amusing. <br/><br/>In short, this series is a disgrace to the original series and the DC Nation block as a whole. The only saving grace is that the original cast returns to voice the characters, but even that is not enough to make me want to watch this.

I didn't want this!! i wanted my old titans back and i wanted them to continue on from season 6 or start over with a new, even better incarnation of the original animated series. needless to say like everyone else i didn't give the show a snowball's chance in hell and flipped the channel whenever it started. <br/><br/>BUT THEN<br/><br/>one morning i was sitting down, sewing, nothing to watch on TV so i flipped it to cartoon network. eventually titans go came on, and i was too lazy to switch the channel (i wasn't watching it anyway!). I could hear the show in the background and i began looking up every now and then because the voices of the titans' rock star voice acting team made me feel so nostalgic about the original series. eventually i began to actively listen to the television, catching very interesting dialogs and jokes every now and then.<br/><br/>that day they ran four episodes in a row, by the end of the second episode the television had my undivided attention. I hadn't accepted it yet, but it was the first time i actually looked at the show with an open mind, deciding not to expect it to be a continuation of the original. by the third episode i was rolling and laughing until tears started to come out and when it was all over i was hungry for more episodes. <br/><br/>needless to say i am a fan and initially all of my friends branded me a traitor for coming to enjoy the show, but after reenacting some of the most iconic moments of teen titans go while talking about it to them, they all slowly warmed up and eventually watched it for themselves. now they all love it! and, the inside jokes and comic book references are just too epic. every time i even think of that cartoon i begin laughing out loud at those funny moments. if you want to start watching the show, don't start from episode one, choose a random episode that sounds interesting to you and watch that because the series did not kick off with a bang in my opinion but thats all changed now. I cant help but wonder what these writers are smoking or sniffing when they make the scripts because they are so outrageous and hilarious.<br/><br/>I hope that all of you can give TTG a try and understand that if you really do want teen titans back in full force, you need to show CN and DC that these characters are popular, well loved and worth further investment outside of the comics.<br/><br/>FYI, beast boy not being able to talk was unique only to the 2003 animated series.

However, this show is a major disappointment, and not only that, it is an insult to the source material.<br/><br/>The original series relied on lovable characters and creative scenarios to generate humor. And most of the time it was very funny! And not only that, Teen Titans was dark, it was clever, it was heartfelt. and it was suspenseful. It obviously had a lot of time and effort put into it.<br/><br/>Teen Titans GO! is none of these things. It is lazy, it is uncreative, and it is unfunny. Well, is it fair to compare Teen Titans GO! to it's predecessor? Of course it is. Why use the Teen Titans, and not some other characters for this show? If the Titans were swapped out with new characters, nothing would be changed. The new incarnations of the memorable super hero team add nothing unique to the show. All the characters in this show are portrayed as mean spirited and 1-sided. One of my biggest issues with this show is how nasty are to each other. In the original show, no matter what happened, the Teen Titans were best friends, and they really trusted and respected each other. This dynamic was one of the best aspects of the show. So why would they change that for the new show? All it does it make the characters unlikable. Robin is portrayed as a complete idiot, and nobody respects him. In one episode, they kick Beast Boy off the team, as if being a Titan is his job and he got fired. These kids aren't friends, they are co-workers who are only there because they get paid to do it. It is this kind of heartlessness that makes this show awful.<br/><br/>But what does this all matter? This show isn't trying to be dramatic or heartfelt, you say? It is supposed to be a comedy? Well, it fails in that respect too. I admit, I laughed a few times watching the first episode. But the rest of the humor, 9 times out of ten, makes me cringe. Robin doing the chicken dance for over 2 minutes is not funny, it is annoying and lazy. So is singing a dumb song about pie. \"Well its a kid show, the jokes don't have to be good.\" That right there is an excuse for being lazy. The original show was targeted at the same age group, yet it respected them, and put effort into there humor. <br/><br/>However, my biggest problem with this show is the obvious fact that the entire existence of this show revolves around cashing in on the popularity of the original Teen Titans. For years after it was canceled, people were begging for this show to come back. Go look at the Cartoon Network forums of the past, before this show. Nearly every page had someone asking for this shows return. So what does Cartoon Network do? They create a cheap knockoff, made in Adobe Flash, and give it to some talentless hacks to churn out on a low budget. The producers of this show aren't loyal fans who created this show to do there own spin on the show. They admit to not watching the original. No, they are doing this because it is profitable. And did I mention this show was made in Adobe Flash? That right there is a sign of how lazy this show is. Not to say that all Flash animation is bad. My Little Pony has some wonderful art created in Flash. But Teen Titans GO!'s art looks lazy. The backgrounds are very simple at are often mostly one color.<br/><br/>This show has no passion behind it, and it is a cheap insult to a great series. I hate this show.

Go, and for crying out loud, don't come back!", "content": "The Teen Titans are one of my all time favorite superhero shows, next to Batman: TAS, Superman: TAS, and Justice League. It was an excellent show that appealed to everyone of all ages and is highly regarded as one of the best shows of all time. The characters were complex and lovable, the story arcs were interesting to watch and see how they unfurl, and it balanced the show with comedy aspects and action aspects. After the disappointing series finale that was Things Change, fans like me wanted a continuation because it left the door open for another season. Well Stuart Snyder and the rest of CN decide to once again give us fans the middle finger and decide to produce this abomination known as Teen Titans Go! Teen Titans Go! is a take on the original Teen Titans show that continues to follow the lives of the Titans we've come to know and love. However, the show decides to go off in another direction instead of continuing where the original show left off. The show instead focuses more on the comedy aspect of the Teen Titans.<br/><br/>The first big issue already comes into play in this premise, this show abandons a lot of crucial things that made the original Teen Titans such a good show. There are no arcs whatsoever like in the original show at all. There's no story lines to follow, no characterization at all that changes one or more of the Titans, or anything griping that made you want to watch the show. The Teen Titans was never about being a silly show about some random things happening, it had characterization and good story lines.<br/><br/>Worse yet, the action is next to nonexistent in this show. The most action I have seen in this show is when the Titans fight Trigon, but almost every episode has no action in it whatsoever. There's no fighting Slade, or any of the other villains from the show. And for a superhero show, having very little action in it is inexcusable. Teen Titans was a comedy, but it wasn't just nothing but laughs all the time. It had great fight scenes against their enemies, and tossing that out the window is a big red flag. That would be like watching Spongebob Squarepants where all he does is just sit on a chair and read a book silently.<br/><br/>Character wise, almost every Titan we've come to know and love have been butchered and act nothing like the original Titans. Robin was a tough as nails leader who was always focused on a mission, intelligent, and was a brilliant tactician. In TTG!, Robin is more of a goofball slacker who acts more like a bumbling moron instead and even acts insecure because he's the only one without superpowers, which he had no issues with in the original Teen Titans.<br/><br/>Cyborg was the hotshot mechanic robot who was a bit of a joker, but always came through for his friends in the end. In this show, Cyborg is more of a jerk to everyone and always picks on everyone as well. He constantly makes fun of everyone and even acts like a coward for the most part.<br/><br/>Beast Boy is usually the goofball of the team, but he always knew when it was time to get serious and even underwent several character arcs in Teen Titans. That doesn't happen in this show though. Beast Boy acts just as bad, if not worse, than Cyborg. The only difference is that he seems to act more of a pervert, especially around Raven, making come off as a sleazeball instead of a hero.<br/><br/>Raven and Starfire are the only characters in this show who don't make me want to hit me head against the wall. Starfire is still acting like her cheerful self who is still trying to get used to life on Earth. Raven is still the foreboding and mystic girl who tries to balance her emotions. However, there are times where she does act out of character like letting her anger and other emotions get the best of her. Whereas in Teen Titans, she never really flew off the handle a whole lot. But at least she and Starfire aren't annoying like the other Titans are in this show.<br/><br/>The jokes are nothing to write home about. It pulls out almost every tired gag you've already seen before and reuses it. Very rarely will you ever find a good joke like when Robin smacks Beast Boy as a mosquito. Many of the jokes like when Cyborg or Beast Boy tell a joke are really stupid, especially when Robin asked them about how to ask a girl out and they act desperate. It's not funny at, it's just very boring.<br/><br/>The artwork is terrible to look at. The coloring seems overblown in this show and the set designs just look rather bland and generic. The character designs are also badly designed. Everyone seems to have huge heads and very skinny bodies, Raven and Beast Boy look like midgets, and Cyborg reminds me of Quasimodo for The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The animation is somewhat better and flows nicely, but there are times where its choppy with the character movements.<br/><br/>Well this show really ruined the Teen Titans. Why couldn't they continue the show where they left off with that depressing series finale and wrap up the plot holes in that show? It's just a big insult to fans of the original Teen Titans and a big disgrace to superhero shows everywhere. The only other positive I can take from this show is that all the voice actors came back to this show, but their talents are wasted in this show.

I was watching when it was first aired, and I turned it off in mere minutes.

Simple, I got there by way of Person of interest where Colantoni played an incredibly believable mafia type, and one day, I saw that ION TV was broadcasting the second episode that featured one of the leads in Desperate Housewives, and I had nothing else to do. I found it to be marvelous, and I felt the same about Mr. Colantoni's performance - believable, empathetic, and above all, real... not American real, perhaps, but so real on a human to human basis.<br/><br/>I was hooked. And I still am. In fact, as I write, I'm watching another of my favorite episodes - S4.E6, the Valentine's Day episode... truly amazing.

Plus the constant male characters accidentally winding up with their faces shoved into breasts or lifting skirts or walking in on naked women... It makes it feel more like a hentai with extra steps than a truly well thought out anime, and many of the female characters seem to have little personality to make them stand out compared to their male contemporaries. I do not want an intense fight scene to be interrupted multiple times in -one- episode so that the only woman in the scene can have her clothes torn off and have the male character faceplant into her breasts repeatedly. They also made a big show of having one of the male characters kick her for a prolonged period of time, and the top-down over-animated view of her crying really unsettled me because of the angles and the way it seemed to recall some of the less than savory hentai I've stumbled across.

This review is only after the pilot episode, so obviously I don't know how the series will turn out, but it looks like a very promising cyberpunk/cop hybrid series.<br/><br/>It is a time travel show in which future corporate \"Protector\" Kiera Cameron (Nichols) is unwittingly zapped back through time from an evil corporation-run 2077 to present day 2012 when trying to prevent a group of freedom fighters (or terrorists depending on your politics) from escaping execution through some kind of wormhole.<br/><br/>Not realizing the situation, Kiera tries to call for backup using her implants' encrypted transmission but instead reaches young computer genius Alec Sadler who happens to be inventing the future technology in his step father's barn. The escaped prisoners realize that instead of being transported back the six years they were supposed to be in order to stop the evil corporations from taking control, they've been sent back over sixty years.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, when they realize they can't strike against the future evil corporations, they decided the present ones will do just fine! Kiera realizes she must bring in the escapees before they start an all out war in present day Vancouver! Problem is she hasn't been born yet and hence has no jurisdiction. While investigating the transport site, she meets up with Detective Carlos Fonnegra and passes herself off as a Portland detective and the series begins.<br/><br/>It has a lot of cool near future tech like augmented reality eye implants, as well as recording and memory implants.

I was kept on the edge of my seat, and I can't wait to see more.<br/><br/>This show does indeed throw some wrenches into the mix. When I first started watching the show, I was confused at first. They immediately turn on the head the concept of \"good\" and \"bad\". The \"good guys\" revolve around a government in which the common people have basically been stripped of their freedoms. The \"bad guys\" are fighting to remove this corrupt system. Ultimately, I personally was unsure who to cheer for. I want to know more about the struggle in the future and how the government system came to be personally. I hope they develop this more, and from the first few episodes, seems like this will happen.<br/><br/>Something I didn't like: The main character (the protector) is likable, even though she serves a government that has stripped our freedoms. The terrorists, on the other hand, despite fighting for a good cause, are bloodthirsty, ruthless, very unlikable and some are borderline crazy. If we could change that about the terrorists, and perhaps give them more personality (other than just pure violence), and get us to like them more, I can't express how much that might enhance the shows overall plot. It would throw the viewer for a loop as we struggle to decide what/who we should be rooting for. The second show starts to show us that this could be possible, and I hope it takes hold.<br/><br/>I felt the cast is very solid, and has potential. The future tech is pretty cool and enjoyable to watch. Not overwhelmingly futuristic, but just enough to keep the sci-fi fans like myself interested.

(potential spoiler)", "content": "The first two seasons of Continuum did a great job of developing the characters and setting the stage for story lines on multiple levels. When I originally wrote this review I gave the show a 10 based on the direction change I saw in the beginning of Season 3. The story became less black and white, good vs. bad, and appeared to expanding with each show to another shade of grey and less certainty regarding what was good, what (and who) is bad and most important the actions that should or shouldn't be taken to \"protect the future\" and any related certainty for all parties.<br/><br/>After Season 3 all I can say is they hit the mark square on, if they don't choose to continue this show they are fools as there are many seasons left in this story line as season 3 did the perfect job of taking the foundation and leaving the story at a point in which it could go any direction. Best of all is they have it so volatile that regardless of the direction it takes, there won't be surprise just excitement as the entire cast is now a group from the future realizing that what they thought when arriving in the current time and what their actions were that would change the future to be what they wanted was way off. They are now a collective no longer refusing allying with anyone as they see that the changes as a result of there actions can be completely different than what they had expected, that there is no guarantee. It has the potential to be one of the best shows SyFy has put on if they'll give it the support. Just build it so we have the chance to watch!!! Let the word of mouth continue to spread that this show has something good, unique, and worth watching. Right now is the critical point. They can kill the show and it will go down as a show with an interesting foundation that didn't get the audience it needed to fully develop. That would be SO SAD given the potential for one of the best shows of its genre to be the result. The possibilities with where they have taken us thus far are now endless and this show could be built into a 8-10 season brain twister that sets a new bar for science fiction quality. <br/><br/>The great thing is it doesn't require a huge CG budget or a lot of reliance on the science fiction to tell the story. The whole premise is the actions in the present will effect the future, but in ways that are not nearly as predictable as originally believed. The notion that they can even get back to where they came from is virtually gone, and they all realize they can't think in those absolute terms but to only do what they can to improve the future by nudging current events and ideas as huge changes in the present will likely cause results far beyond what they originally thought and likely undo the very thing they want as there are simply to many variables they can't account for when trying to consider the exponential effect of change over time. The possibilities are endless, I pray the show continues for seasons to come so this potential can be fulfilled.<br/><br/>I'm now editing my review post season 4. I'm glad they chose to give us an ending, but the pace of events felt rushed as they had to navigate through the introduction of a force far more damaging than Liber8 while navigating to a reasonable launching point for taking down the new villains AND getting Kiera home. All things considered they did a reasonable job it giving the fans some closure. But I remain convinced this could have been a mind blowing show by simply sticking to the vision of the original writing. Then again after watching the last episode of season 3 for defiance I looked at my wife and said \"The show will be cancelled shortly\", which of course it was. They gave us a great ending with closure for the important characters all in an episode by having a few characters make the right decisions having it land in a place where continuation would make no sense. They could have done the same in Continuum; so the shame is in that there wasn't a fully developed story line through seasons 4 and a 5, 6, 7, 8... and it grew a natural end to a fantastic show.

The acting is unspectacular but not awful. There are numerous plot holes here, but none worth getting too upset about. The real thing worth talking about with this show is the extreme conservative viewpoint. Not only is the corporate control of the future not challenged, it is actively championed by the writers. Lack of privacy, restraints implanted into suspects that deliver electric shocks until they report to the courthouse for hearings, a total lack of anything resembling a bill of rights; not only are these \"realities\" presented as matter-of-fact for the future, but no one in the future is shown as having any problem with them whatsoever except lowlifes and blood thirsty murderers.<br/><br/>To sell this view the show has cast a pretty, sympathetic police officer as the main protagonist. Her sense of justice is unswerving, her bag of technological goodies apparently bottomless. She is the only one who understands how crazy these terrorists are.

The only people on the show shown to be opposed to this vision of the future are literally murderous sociopaths. At some point it hit me. The worship of the industrialists, the complete lack of sympathy for the downtrodden, these are the exact views of Ayn Rand. This is SciFi for neo-cons.<br/><br/>Now, personally I find this show so offensive I can't even begin to describe how much I hate it. At best I think it's thinly veiled propaganda with a pretty leading lady and plenty of guns and explosions thrown in to draw in the brain dead. But my conservative friends are always very earnestly upset about what they see as the liberal bias in the media. I don't agree, but I suppose that it's fair that neo-cons get their own show.

I remember in the early 60s, or is it slightly later, a theater that played one big success in London at the time in Charring Cross Road, \"No sex Please, we are British\". Times have changed and this series is quite typical of that change. Sex, sex and sex, stopping one inch from hardcore sex, and gay what's more. And yet that film is a lot more than these few erotic episodes. First it is deeply committed to diversity in sexual orientation. All the nuances and shades of gayness are exploited and shown in the most funny and comical way, never derisive, never aggressive, but always in a comic orientation of its own. You cannot imagine the diversity of shades and personalities you may or might find in this community. In fact you have to dip yourself in it, or even soak yourself in it to know. But be careful though to know what you're doing otherwise it might become another famous play on Charring Cross Road, viz. \"The Mousetrap\". Second it strikingly confront the problem of age in a sexual community that is too often marked by transience and instability, especially since these couples are not recognize by the law and do not have the right to marry and create a stable home. That implies gay people are more or less forced to cruise all their life, to be the hunter or to be the prey. That is so clearly shown with the main character who is practically never having two helpings of the same dish. But that is true till a fifteen year old boy he seduces decides to ask for more insistently. That makes the main hero Stuart think maybe he is losing something that will never come back, his youth and he maybe should think of the future and not only of the present, or at most the balance of the hunt and how many people, I mean men and boys, he has shagged. But Stuart has another problem with his childhood friend, Vince, who is gay too, who would like to get Stuart or who would like Stuart to get him, but he is shy and he does not want to find himself involved in the great unstable sexual looting of the vast world. So he gets attached to an older man and this episode, both for Stuart and his friend Vince, is a revelation, an epiphany. They discover they have something in common that they cannot find at all with anyone else, and that is exemplified with the various actors who played Doctor Who. They have a past in common, a tremendous level of personal commitment to each other, generally called friendship, and a sexual attraction and even passion they can easily release, provided they get away from their common environment that is a mousetrap to them, viz. Manchester. Third the series does not hesitate to show what sex is for young male teenagers (fifteen or so) and here the fifteen year old boy, Nathan, is our study case. Nathan, is the living example of that age. Provocative and yet shy, exhibitionistic and yet modest, passionate and yet reserved, light-headed by principle and yet over-thoughtful. In fact he knows one thing: he wants sex. He knows a second thing: he wants gay sex. He finds danger and difficulties exciting, so why not try the macho jock at school who is of course both straight and homophobic, even if\u0085 when he closes his eyes and lets himself go, he may accept a helping hand. But this young chick, Nathan, has to learn one thing: Stuart is too old for him. He, Nathan, can only be some kind of a cherry on a pile of ice-cream for Stuart's birthday or any other celebration. But he has nothing in common with Stuart except his sex and his sexual attraction and orientation. And that's the meaning of the second series. The first series had finished nothing at all and we were hanging in midair. But the second series gives an end to every character and the last episode ends up with a hot scene on a hot parking lot in the hot state of Arizona between the hot cities of Phoenix and Tucson with a hot gun and a not so hot contrite \"Sorry!\" from a hot muscular truck driver who could very easily get involved in some hot gay bashing episode, like at the beginning of Stephen King's \"IT\".

For example, the life of an actor is torn apart from the beginning between the need to become famous and the need to have privacy...sailing these waters is always a difficult thing, because if you get much of one, you loose the other.<br/><br/>I remember me constantly being astonished about those strange people I met then, and I think that was the reason why I took another path - those people can also be very strenuous.<br/><br/>Toast let us have a view at the struggles of an actor who has his little moments of fame, but never gets really successful. He fails at most things in his life, but nevertheless survives ridiculously proud.<br/><br/>And believe me, although I grew up with Austrian actors, where everything is much smaller, it's the same here and there, and as strange that may sound, Toast is not far from reality as it is to be lived as a member of the biz.<br/><br/>If you don't have a background like me, you can of course enjoy this little show, which constantly (and successfully) tries to surprise you, mostly with black humor, or disarming humor, always well-meant, never (or rarely, to be precise) disgusting.<br/><br/>It's a little gem, and the only thing I have to criticize is, that it's only six episodes a season.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "10 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "26 August 2016"}, {"title": " Probably the best British comedy in the last 5 years.", "content": "A genuinely eclectic mix of characters all mixed up in a vat of surreal comedy.

And thats only 1/3 of reasons to check this show out.<br/><br/>2/3 of reasons to see this is that the humor is very subtle, and sharp. Not particularly \"American\" humor, fans of British humor will appreciate the offbeat energy and situations. Rhys Darby is also very funny as the clueless, and loyal manager and friends of the duo. The premise of the show is simple: an up-and-coming folk duo work to develop a fan base in the U.S., starting with New-York. The juxtaposition between the duo's New Zealand calm, playful attitudes and their American acquaintances' brazen \"American\" demeanors.<br/><br/>3/3 of the reasons is the lesser of the bunch, but adds a quaint dimension which I appreciate, is the show's potential. Some may notice that this show has quite a lot going for it, and could be something special if it realizes its potential for an interesting take on the struggle of a band's success.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "31 out of 42 found this helpful.", "date": "24 January 2008"}, {"title": " Not Serious, Not Controversial, but Really Funny!", "content": "This show stars two characters Bret, and Jermaine who have traveled from New Zealand to New York City in order to make their band \"Flight of the Conchords\" the next big thing.

For fans of the band, it is quite amazing to see how they've found nice little slots for all these funny songs, most of which are re-worked with full band backing.<br/><br/>CONCHORDS music is folk, rock, electric, acoustic, hip-hop, anything that correlates with the topic of the episode, stylistically ranging from Hall and Oates, to The Monkees, to Pet Shop Boys, Bowie and beyond. And Episode 6 (\"Bowie\") shows off their genius in melding Bowie's many styles into a brilliant musical parody, with Jemaine appearing to Bret in dreams as David Bowie from different eras. Bret: \"You look like Jemaine.\" Jemaine replies in that airy, offhanded manner of The Thin White Duke: \"No, I'm David Bowie from the Ashes To Ashes video.\" For two characters who are so inept at everything (finding jobs, chasing girls, paying the rent), their virtuosity as comedic musicians is unmatched (well, maybe by Tenacious D in a different kind of way).<br/><br/>Their useless yet anal \"band manager\" Murray (Rhys Darby) works in the New Zealand Consulate and manages the band part-time (during office hours) with an iron fist for taking roll call.

John Marlott (Sean Bean) is a London river cop in the early 1800s. In the process of busting a smuggling gang he stumbles upon the washed-up corpse of a child on the banks of the seriously polluted Thames. Only this corpse is a composite of body parts of multiple children crudely stitched together. It could never have lived, yet it briefly grabs Marlott's wrist before lying still forever.<br/><br/>The Home Secretary (Robert Peel) charges Marlott with finding out who is responsible for the \"abomination\" and we're off full tilt into a Gothic world of fog, body-snatchers, rotting corpses, child prostitution and murder, bizarre medical experimentation and political intrigue.<br/><br/>Mary Shelley (Anna Maxwell-Martin) widow of the poet Shelley and author of Frankenstein and William Blake (Steven Berkoff) poet, writer and artist are key figures who pop up along the way and are instrumental in driving the narrative forward.<br/><br/>It is wonderfully creepy and disturbing stuff. So atmospherically shot and mounted that you can almost smell and taste the stench of death and decay as the characters instinctively recoil from it, covering their faces with whatever they can to blot it out.<br/><br/>Sean Bean gives a master-class performance as a good, honest man adrift in a world of physical and moral corruption. Marlott is an ex-soldier (from the same regiment as a guy called Sharpe, reference spotters), veteran of Waterloo, wracked by grief, guilt and despair after having unwittingly passed on syphilis to his wife and new born child, resulting in their untimely deaths. The illness is active within him, and combined with mercury treatment (a painful and pointless remedy) induces florid nightmares and vivid hallucinations. Anyone who ever wrote Bean off as little more than a movie rent-a-heavy, or sitting duck dead villain in waiting, should reassess on this evidence.

It started as a very gritty early 19th century police procedural, with an investigation of a strangely mutilated dead child led by Thames River police inspector John Marlotte (Sea Bean). It quickly became something much more. It intertwines many timeless themes, including guilt and redemption, the corrupting influence of power and greed, science versus religion, and the nature of the afterlife. Literary references and themes are liberally added, with glimpses of Frankenstein author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly and poet/visionary William Blake. <br/><br/>The lead actors inhabit their characters completely and heartbreakingly. Sean Bean's Marlotte is a decent man drawn into the most extreme and horrifying circumstances, who maintains his humanity even when it is taken from him by force. A new actor to me, Richie Campbell, plays Marlotte's smart and ambitious partner with great depth. A little surprisingly given the period of the show, a number of fine women actors play more than decorative parts in the series, including Vanessa Kirby (The Crown), Maeve Dermody and Eloise Smith.<br/><br/>The show's tone is very dark; sadness (and lots of blood) permeate each episode.

Audience might have an idea of what transpires from pop or literature experience, the series uses this as an advantage, teasing and making only vague connections to keep the interest.

The investigation takes a turn for the eerie worse as he finds more peculiar twists than expected. Marlott isn't the typical suave confident detective most shows opt for, he's just a simple working man with equal tragic past and drive to solve the mystery. Having a veteran actor like Sean Bean is a definite plus and he seems to fit the role living in faraway past remarkably well.<br/><br/>Visually, the series is engaging, although not in traditional gorgeous manner. There's only few beautiful Victorian era architectural majesty, instead this is a look of dirty roads without pavement and widespread poverty. Strangely, the atmosphere works well for a medium loosely based on popular reading. Many other movies have tired the faint fantasy visage, this murky approach serves as a more grounded witness to the era.<br/><br/>It also produces a greater focus on the social or religious aspect of things. The archaic paradigm creates deeper emphasis on the gruesome puzzle. Marlott is clearly a sympathetic man, although he chooses more passive stance and might look deceivingly detached. It's not often that a main character takes less dominating spotlight, which gives the series ample time to tease whether it will follow the famous story line or sew together different branching plot.<br/><br/>By using still air of the past and fragments of broken doll, it's a retelling of renowned fable from modest man and the era's point of view.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "23 out of 34 found this helpful.", "date": "3 January 2016"}, {"title": " Great surprise", "content": "I wasn't expecting much and it was a nice surprise!

In general, I watch it if it happens to be on, but more as background noise than for the actual plot content. But this series changed my mind about all that.<br/><br/>The first few episodes I watched were on Adult Swim. I liked the idea of magic being explained in a (somewhat) scientific fashion, so I found recordings of the aired episodes online (with subtitles) with the intention of watching them whenever I was bored.<br/><br/>I say without shame that I, who have not watched more than a half hour of anime in a single sitting, watched all fifty-one episodes in a single sitting. And it had me sitting on the edge of my seat every time. When a few of the episodes were corrupted, I even edited the videos manually with a hex editor to get them to play properly.<br/><br/>I was really turned off to Anime originally because of the way the Japanese animators use frame rates. You only really need one or two frames per second to show movement--and this contrasts with the relatively constant frame rate in American cartoons. It can look rather ugly if you're not used to it. For action scenes, though, they bring out the full 30fps, and the sudden contrast between 2fps, with the character standing there, and 30fps, where the character is executing these stunning martial arts moves, is an incredible sight to see.<br/><br/>But I would like to say that this series is a complete series. The last episode does, in fact, contain the conclusion--no premature terminations here. Most anime contains a \"Lead-out\" which gives the viewer something to think about. It makes it seem more like the characters are still doing something, still living, even after the series is over. I must say that makes the end of the series even harder to bear, because believe it or not, it's like saying goodbye to a close friend.<br/><br/>This series has definitely had a major impact on me. It is worth the time (or money) to acquire it. I wouldn't recommend watching all fifty-one episodes together like I did. The intrigue of the plot is intended to hit the viewers like a hammer, and it keeps them coming back week after week. If you watch them all together, it begins and ends so quickly you feel like you've been hit by a truck when it finally DOES end.<br/><br/>Full Metal Alchemist is a prime example of excellent story writing.

In a tragic accident, their mother is killed. Devastated, the boys decide to use the ancient art of Alchemy to bring her back to life - but there's one complication: The main rule of Alchemy. This rule of \"Equivalent exchange\" states that \"Nothing can be gained without first losing something of equal value.\" The boys succeed in resurrecting their mother, but at a horrible cost - Edward's left leg is taken, as is Al's body. Desperate to restore his brother's life, Edward uses his own blood to inscribe an Alchemic circle in a suit of armor, binding Alphonse's soul to the metal. In doing so, he makes yet another sacrifice - his right arm is lost to the demons of the abyss.<br/><br/>To recap - Ed loses his right arm and right leg, and Alphonse's body is taken. Now, you'd think that would be an equivalent enough exchange - two body parts and a whole body for their mother's life. But then you'd be wrong, of course. The thing they bring back is not their mother, but an inhuman creature composed of hastily put-together body parts - something that is human and yet not human. An abomination that cannot move or think on its own. From that point on, Ed and Al set out to learn the secret of \"Human Transmutation,\" the one Alchemic skill that would have any hope of bringing back their mother. But at a cost that they may be unwilling to accept...<br/><br/>Overall, the series is gripping. Well-written dialogue, intense plot, and the best voice acting I've heard in a television series in a long time. Vic Mignogna, the actor who plays Ed in the American cast is absolutely brilliant - the voice he provides is believable and emotionally charged, a task most voice actors tend to fail miserably at. Aaron Dismuke, the voice of the 14-year-old Alphonse is excellent as well - not only does the irony of an adolescent voice coming from a six-foot-tall suit of armor succeed in getting a few chuckles, but the voice represents the character well.

It just seemed so homogenized. The art didn't stand out. The characters seemed to be cookie-cutter determined types out to save the world. Even the name \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" seems completely avoidable with magic being the status quo in much of anime. I borrowed a disc anyways and watched it. I begged for the other discs in advance.<br/><br/>Fullmetal Alchemist has superb flow. 24 is the only thing in recent memory that has a comparable flow and that's only because that show supposedly happens in real time. In FMA, you have multiple reasons to continue each episode but the focus is not lost. It's always centered (unless if very appropriately not centered) on the two Alric Brothers who share perhaps the strongest bond in all of anime. This bond may be broken at any time, mainly because FMA takes place in a very dynamic world. A war may possibly re-surge. Fellow soldiers we meet rise in ranks and there are casualties. But amidst all this is a very pervasive mystery to which no one is safe. We are as blind to this mystery as the brothers and it's unnerving to stop watching, knowing that unseen forces may encounter our heroes at any time. Prepare to marathon. It's a continuous narrative, unlike that Cowboy Bebop crap.<br/><br/>Above all, FMA is a parable. We're told about the principle of equivalent trade, which is yin yang in other words, but we get much more than this taoist tidbit. We learn to deal with death. People do grow old and die. People do die for a reason. People do die for no reason. Some people may call FMA needlessly dark for a children's anime, but rather it's brutally honest. It's likely you will feel real pain. It's unlikely you'll forget the pain. Anyone we meet to whom a great misery befalls is so uniquely focused and blindly determined that the mechanics of his/her devastation become very clear. They seem proverbial, as though the Brothers Grimm were revived to create some of these characters. The series has enough fluff to get us through grim reality, but most of the time, it's really an opportunity to show how much heart many of the characters possess. It may seem odd for an anime centered around some teenage boys to have no sexual connotations whatsoever, but that'd just get in the way of the very strong emotions expressed in this anime.

This anime or that anime is the epitome of brilliance and beauty. But \"Hagane no Renkinjutsushi\"(translated as Fullmetal Alchemist) is one that really deserves the praise.<br/><br/>Slight spoilers may appear in the following paragraphs. The story, which easily becomes engaging and addictive, revolves around the young brothers, Edward and Alphonse Elric. They both study the powerful and complicated science of alchemy, which allows the user to create one object out of another, such as turning lead to gold, or water to wine. There are some natural laws and taboos of the world of alchemy, though. You must give something of equal mass in order to gain something. Turning lead to gold is not allowed. But, most importantly, transmutation of humans (Human, or Bio Alchemy) is forbidden.<br/><br/>When Al and Ed break the most dangerous rule of all, they pay the ultimate price. In a failed transmutation, Alphonse loses his entire body, and Edward loses an arm and a leg. They now search for the Philosopher's Stone, which which hopefully be able to restore their bodies.

Gorgeous, flowing animation, unique character designs, and some disturbing sequences that will stick with you for days. There is a brilliant underlying darkness in all the scenes, even when sometimes it falls into a little silliness. There are some very surprising twists, heart wrenching deaths, and some great observations on religion, science and government, all thrown in. Major praise also is deserving for the women that play the two brothers- Kugimiya Rie and Paku Romi. They handle the emotions of seriousness, fear, loathing and horror with such skill.<br/><br/>I'm very surprised that no one else has posted a review for this show yet.

It was a much different anime series than what I was used to at the time. It was dark and gritty, but it still had fair amounts of humor. It doesn't matter if this show wasn't faithful to the manga because the original is still one of the best. This is a show that has to be seen to believed and it is so captivating even over a decade after its original release that it's easy to forget that this show is animated. I call that a true testament to the writers, animators and director that poured their heart and soul into this series. <br/><br/>The story follows two brothers Edward and Alphonse Elric as they go on a journey to reclaim what they lost. Years before they tried to bring their dead mother back to life using alchemy, but it went horribly wrong. In the process Edward lost his right arm and left leg while Alphonse lost his entire body and had his soul bound to a suit of armor. That's the basic synopsis but the story gets more complex and engaging as the show progresses going into deep themes of war, family, corruption, genocide, and even religion. The story can be funny in one episode and then be dark in the next and still flow together. It is even heartfelt at times that it still makes me cry all these years later. The story is fairly faithful to the manga up until the Laboratory 5 arc then diverges and tells its own original story. Normally the story would have suffered in quality because of such a divergence but here its not the case. The story is still captivating and engaging. <br/><br/>Now the characters are what really drive the core of this show because without captivating and interesting characters then the show wouldn't be watched. Edward and Alphonse Elric make for one of the best anime duos of all time and maybe even in all of television for that matter. Their brotherly relationship is very genuine, warming and they play off of each other extremely well. The supporting characters are all great as well and each of them gets to shine throughout the show. The main villains are artificial humans called Homunculi named after the Seven Deadly Sins and a man known as Scar. These are not your typical two dimensional villains out to control the world. The original FMA is probably one of the only tv shows I ever watched that made me sympathise with the villains and that is something that few shows even, live action are able to pull off well.<br/><br/>The animation is great for its time and still holds up very well even by today's standards. The music by Michiru Oshima is very excellent bringing out the full emotion of the entire series. The most memorable for me was \"Brothers\" which serves as a somber theme to both Edward and Alphonse.<br/><br/>The show is very notable for having a fantastic dub done by Funimation which is almost if not just as good as \"Cowboy Bebop\". Vic Mignogna is excellent as Edward and he does a fantastic job of bringing out his hotheaded personality and genuine emotions. Likewise with Aaron Dismuke who plays Alphonse. Dismuke was actually 12 years old around the same age as Alphonse in the tv show which added extra depth to the character. Both Mignogna and Dismuke play off each other very well and you really do get the sense that these are brothers looking out for each other. The rest of the cast is great too all giving great performances with Laura Bailey as Lust and Travis Willingham as Roy Mustang being the standouts.<br/><br/>As you can probably tell I really love this series and I think it truly is one of the best animes ever made. I don't say that lightly. It really is that great despite it not being faithful to the manga unlike its sister series \"Brotherhood\". The show does a great job at telling its own original story and it is so captivating and engaging with each passing episode that its hard to stop watching. If anyone is looking into getting into anime, the original \"Fullmetal Alchemist\" is a great place to start.", "rating": null, "helpful": "3 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "21 March 2018"}, {"title": " My review of the original Fullmetal Alchemist anime series", "content": "Always been my most favorite show of all time and the only anime I truly love and care about. For a series that explores warfare and genocide, the darker tone and realistic atmosphere fits the series very well. I'm so glad that the directors and writers of this show adapted the mediocre stereotypical manga into a more philosophical, religious, and coming-of-age tale that is the original 2003 anime. I enjoyed how much the protagonists - those two alchemist brothers named Edward and Alphonse Elric - had more screen time which allowed their relationship and love for each other to blossom. The backstories, origins, and identities of the villains and were well done. Really loved how secretive, competent, and thrilling they all really were. There were numerous morals and sheds of gray throughout the show overall, rather than the usual lame old thin line of black and white seen in many other shows. The State Military characters were great as well, such as Roy Mustang, Maes Hughes, Kimblee, Shou Tucker, Maria Ross, Sheska, etc. Had the anime been following the manga directly from start to finish instead of deviating from the norm, it would have never had been this great. All of the major death scenes were handled extremely well and the ending to the whole show was beautifully bittersweet. The ending was by no means depressing and neither did it made you want to cry or anything like that. It was just simply bittersweet. Despite endless tragedy, the characters still believed in hope and made the best of their situations.<br/><br/>Not only was the show depicting warfare, genocide, sin, redemption, and overall human nature maturely and realistically, but also a character-driven series as well as a coming-of-age tale for the Elric brothers. Unlike in the original manga series of the same name and its 2009 anime rebooted version, Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, no character was a side character or a filler character. Each character played an important role, they moved the story on. The story felt neither too fast nor too slow. It was moving at a steadier pace, unlike many other anime shows, which allowed us to grow attached to the characters rather than the action. The show may have not had as much action, but when it did, it was so immersive and left a huge lasting impact, easily beating the several episode long fights featured in many anime, including Brotherhood. Each and every action caused by a character always came with a consequence in the end and tied up neatly, further proving how horrible the world really is. Each time there was an action scene, the characters were using their minds to think things through within the situation rather than just only their powers. The protagonists also often would lose against the antagonists, which made the show seem more realistic and believable. The show proved how much it didn't need conventional villains or fights being flashy/explosive or the characters being more bad-ass in order to be a good show.<br/><br/>The show also didn't constantly hammer every piece of information into your head in terms of character dialogue like you're a preteen; neither did the show overused those annoying chi-bi comedy faces during any of the serious moments because the directors and writers knew those things only work in manga format, so therefore they wouldn't translate well into screen because they wanted you to be heavily immersed into what's going on with the characters and their surroundings. It was very subtle and trusted you to get it on your own. It only needed to tell the most important information and that's it. It never over-clarified what you needed to know just so you don't forget. It's only a matter of paying clear attention so that you can get what you need to know while processing through the show. When you are watching the show, do not expect it to be a roller-coaster ride from start to finish. This show will always keep you at the edge of your seat, just to see what will happen next and hell, even by the end, it will leave you with wanting more. The first 34 episodes of this show are based more-or-less on the first seven volumes of the original manga, but numerous differences and foreshadowing clearly indicted that the directors and writers knew they were gonna overtake the manga as the show went on. So yes, the anime did caught up with the manga which led them to two choices: either jump to filler or make up their own original story, the latter was chosen. Anyway, I just wanted to tell the directors and writers of this anime that I give them a big thank you for producing this masterpiece. I don't even see anything majorly wrong with it at all, contrary to the popular belief. The show's second half seems perfectly fine...to me at least. Once again, thank you to the show's writers and directors for the wonderful story, characters, villains, and oh...can I just mention one last thing how awesome the somber background music in this show really is?!

The little brother's squealing cry is one of the most grating sounds I have ever heard.<br/><br/>The Ugly. With Peppa, my child becomes a little zombie. With other videos (Sesame Street, animated songs), we sing together, act, or talk about what is happening on screen. Not so here. He stares blankly at the screen. Unlike with other videos, he often cries and fusses after it's turned off. He asks to watch it all the time. I don't know whether the addictive elements are accidental or by design to sell toys. The simple animation, repetition of music and sounds certainly appeal to this age. The snorting my child picked up is weird, but mostly harmless. Then came the growling from the show. We're not waiting until he picks up baby George's mannerisms. He just doesn't act the same way with this show as with others.<br/><br/>Your child may not have the same reaction, of course.

And the end credits have the same music, except instead of introducing her family, our main character Peppa repeats the show's name three times.<br/><br/>The animation is very, VERY poor. The character designs are hideous and some of the worst I've ever seen in my life, most of the backgrounds are nothing but green hills and the movements are practically cheap and stiff Flash animation.<br/><br/>The voice acting is laughably bad, with the biggest offenders being the children.<br/><br/>The narrator is unbearable, as he either states what the viewers can clearly see or repeats what a character says.<br/><br/>The plots don't even try to put in any effort, for example, there is an episode called Suzy Goes Away where Suzy's Mum gets a new job far away (meaning they have to move to a new country) only to be lead by a very predictable twist ending where Suzy's mum gets told she didn't get the job (Rugrats, a much, MUCH better cartoon already did this). There is also an episode called Mister Skinnylegs that encourages kids to befriend Spiders, this may not be too bad in the UK, but Australia has some very deadly Spiders that can POISON AND KILL CHILDREN (can you see why this episode got banned in Australia now?) which a is very, VERY bad thing!<br/><br/>The characters aren't much better too, Peppa is a whiny brat who makes fun of her father for being fat (he does of course need exercise, but Peppa is just plain rude about it), George is an annoying cry baby who never shuts up, Daddy Pig only exists for fat jokes, Mummy Pig doesn't give her kids any sort of discipline when they do something wrong, Suzy Sheep is only there to be the main character's typical best friend and Pedro Pony is a typical airheaded idiot who dressed up as a Cowboy at a PIRATE PARTY and dressed up as a Superhero for the GYM!!!<br/><br/>Overall, I just don't see why this cartoon got such a big following, it's got tons of merchandise, books, DVDs, a theatrical movie in 2017 (The same year as The Emoji Movie of all films) called Peppa Pig: My First Cinema Experience (in fact, calling it a movie would be too generous since it's just a compilation of episodes with filler segments featuring a human and puppets of Peppa and George between) and even having Nick Jr. Too brand itself as 'Nick Jr Peppa' for short periods, usually one month, where the channel solely screens the show. Now you are wondering what I think of another cartoon by the creators, Ben &amp; Holly's Little Kingdom? While I'm not a big fan of the show, at least it tried to put effort into it, but Peppa Pig just feels like the writers gave up in less than a minute.

Because this show is the worst cartoon I\u00b4ve ever seen! Ok, ok, I\u00b4m sorry for that, let\u00b4s just talk about why is this show terrible.\nThe Characters: Oh jeez, the characters are just painfull, but let\u00b4s go them by group, and what better way to start off with the narrarator, ussualy in a kids show, a narrarator is used to help children understand what\u00b4s going on, thus giving an opportunity for them to learn, Peppa\u00b4s narrarator just keeps repeating everything that just happened in the show, as if the children watching the show are deaf or just too dumb to get anything that\u00b4s going on, now let\u00b4s talk about the babies, the babies are easily the worst characters in the show, why? Because they cry for stupid stuff, sure, they\u00b4re babies, but, usually in a cartoon, the babies or any other character should cry when something really bad happens to them, that way, we feel sorry for these characters, the babies in Peppa Pig just cry for stupid stuff like ice cream, a kite, a dinossaur, to even a freaking rainbow and it just get\u00b4s annoying. The kids are just a bunch of brain-dead rude people that know about things they should\u00b4ve known when comparing to their age, also, they just keep calling Daddy Pig fat and keep arguing with each other, but they\u00b4re fight is saved somehow because of Daddy Pig saying that they\u00b4re just friends and it\u00b4s solved, I don\u00b4t know if that really makes sense. The adults are really mean and really stupid, for starters, they don\u00b4t know how to be responsible towards there children and just keep calling Daddy Pig fat, when really, they\u00b4re all fat.\nSpeaking of which, the animation is incredibly lazy, the desings are just copy/pasted for each character, and the backgrounds just consist of MS Paint hills, clouds, grass, and puddles, and the movements aren\u00b4t even smooth.\nThe messages are really terrible in this, they just consist of: It\u00b4s okay to be rude to your parents because you won\u00b4t get in trouble, cry for everything because everyone around you will help you out, steal someone\u00b4s car and you don\u00b4t get in trouble, is okay to use the hands in soccer, because you\u00b4re the goalkeeper, now tell me, aren\u00b4t these lessons a horrible influence to your kids.\nSo that\u00b4s why I personally consider Peppa Pig the worst cartoon ever, now, if you do like this show then I respect your opinion, but for me, this is the worst show ever.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "37 out of 80 found this helpful.", "date": "17 February 2018"}, {"title": " Undeserving", "content": "Peppa is an undeserving brat who should not have had a movie made about her.

The idea of a little girl and her family learning life lessons could've been fine, but it turns out to be a complete chore to watch.<br/><br/>If you thought Caillou was bad enough, then Peppa Pig is right up there in terms of being an annoying brat. In almost every episode, Peppa is usually whining about something, being selfish, or being very rude to everyone. She constantly puts down what others, especially around her brother, George. She always acts annoyed with him and doesn't act like a good big sister.<br/><br/>Not only that, but Peppa is really irresponsible and never seems to learn anything. In one episode, she loses her stuffed bear, Teddi, again(Yes, she loses this bear on a regular basis). The mom tells Peppa she must be responsible about her stuff. Not even two seconds after Peppa gets Teddi back, she acts like she did nothing wrong and blames Teddi for getting lost, even though Peppa was at fault.<br/><br/>George, Peppa's little brother, is no better at all. It seems he's always got his mind on dinosaurs and only says dinosaur. He also cries constantly in a wailing voice that's like hearing nails scratching a chalkboard in surround sound.<br/><br/>Mummy is the only decent character, but only because she's the only member of the family who acts like the disciplinary one. She does lecture the kids and her husband about things, but she's also a complete airhead. She often allows her kids to do something like play in the mud, and doesn't do much to punish Peppa or George if they do something completely wrong.<br/><br/>Daddy, I feel sorry for in this show, but at the same time, he is a complete moron too. Everyone seems to always pick on him for no reason. His chair gets taken by Mummy and then he buys it back. Peppa and George act rude around him by interrupting him, calling him fat, or just being disrespectful of him. All the while, he takes this all in stride. However, he's pretty dumb and can't even get the most basic of instructions right. On the other hand, I feel really bad for him since he's always getting picked on by his own family. The fact that he hasn't lost his mind yet is also amazing.<br/><br/>The plots, if you can call them that, are really jumbled and most of the time, they go nowhere. A lot of episodes feel very rushed and don't offer anything to learn at all. The morals themselves, the few there are, are horribly handled or shoehorned in there at the last second. The episodes don't follow any kind of plot, but just some stuff happening and a few tidbits of learning here and there. There's no substance, there's very little stuff to learn, and the learning stuff in each episode is so small, kids won't even pick up on it. Also, the episodes usually end with everyone falling on their backs for some reason and laughing. Why? If these episodes have no point or moral, then what purpose is there to them? <br/><br/>The behavior in this show has got to be probably the worst aspect of this show. Everyone acts so irrational in this show. Peppa is always being rude and demanding to her family and friends and acts like a spoiled brat if things don't go her way. George is always crying over something minor and never stops talking about dinosaurs. The adults never get mad at their kids for being rude or disrespectful, but instead laugh it off. Nobody acts like a normal being and it sends a bad message to kids that being rude won't get you in trouble.<br/><br/>Not to mention the parents allow their kids to do stuff like jumping in mud puddles, eat their food loudly and slurp it all down. None of these parents do anything to correct their kid's behavior.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't bad enough, there is a narrator. And just like in Caillou, the narrator here serves no purpose but to point out the obvious like kids are too stupid not to realize something. When George cries, the narrator has to needlessly point out that George is crying. When Daddy said the dinosaur was lost, the narrator had to repeat that like kids are too stupid to remember something said less than a second ago. This narrator is as useless as the one in Caillou.<br/><br/>The artwork and animation is awful, to say the least. The character designs are so poorly thought out that you'd think none of these artists have ever seen the animals in this show. In fact, most of them look like recolors with different ears. The backgrounds and set designs are even worst. There's no shading at all in the show, no details at all in the background, and it's nothing but green hills with some trees and a few clouds. Everything looks so repetitive, bland, and uninspired.<br/><br/>The animation in general is just as bad. The characters move so weirdly and awkwardly that I've seen snails have more movement than these characters. It's very choppy, the lip syncing is off sometimes, and everyone moves like they have major arthritis or something.<br/><br/>In a sea of never ending bad kids' shows, Peppa Pig is only another example of how bad they've become. Its morals are few and far in between. The characters are not only rude, but they act insane. The plots make no sense most of the time, nor do they go anywhere. It's just another kids' show to add to the list to avoid. So unless you want your kid to learn to be rude, disrespectful, bratty, and whinny, then you'd better put on something else like Curious George.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "38 out of 94 found this helpful.", "date": "28 May 2014"}, {"title": " porcine based toddler hilarity", "content": "peppa pig falls into the category of children's programmes in which the stars are actually the children.<br/><br/>peppa's little brother who rarely has a word to say is the star of the show. his laugh is thoroughly infectious.<br/><br/>peppa pig has the requisite moral centre of course: sharing is good, don't lie, etc etc but it's all done with such an innocent joi de vivre that you don't mind<br/><br/>damn catchy theme tune too.<br/><br/>peppa also has a website where you can play the various snorts like a piano (sort of) (click family)", "rating": 9, "helpful": "19 out of 43 found this helpful.", "date": "27 April 2007"}, {"title": " No... just no", "content": "This show is complete GARBAGE.

Waking the Dead is a BBC series that focuses on a cold case murder squad. They probably could have chosen a better title, because I passed over this show multiple times after seeing the word \"dead\" and thinking \"waking\" was \"walking.\" (That was before I got my new glasses.)<br/><br/>Anyway, I just finished five seasons, but apparently there are many more. If you like British detective programs and love hearing, \"I'm DCI...\" whoever, you'll probably get into this one too. The British titles are so much cooler...Detective Chief Inspector.<br/><br/>It focuses around Detective Boyd, who runs the show, played by Trevor Eve (not bad looking for a man his age). Dr. Grace Foley, played by Sue Johnston, is always analyzing everyone as the profiler of killers and her coworkers. Like so many other shows, this one reminds me not to get emotionally involved with the actors and certain characters.<br/><br/>Claire Goose, who plays one of the detectives, leaves the show (via a horrific on-screen death), which totally changes the flavor of the team after her departure. Coupled with a change in the forensic team at the same time, it's a shocker. When that happens, I grieve the loss and often find myself loosing a tad bit of interest trying to get into the replacements who I often don't like as well. It was no different in this case either, but it's like work -- people come and go all the time.<br/><br/>After watching so many British detective police shows, this one carries the usual underlying themes in the series that I am finding occur over and over.<br/><br/><ul><li>The main detective is a bit wonky with either work or personal problems. They are either emotionally detached from others, unable to make close relationships, have some fault like yelling, drinking, or whatever.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The top guy always is a little rebellious refusing to obey orders, and there is usually someone on the force that is out to get them in the upper echelons.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Though the team works well together, there is always some undermining strife and rivalry in the ranks.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the crime stories can be downright sick, especially upon the discovery of a dead body and how gruesomely the poor victim had been killed. The newer shows go for the shock factor more than the mystery, and I wish they would spare me the gory details.</li></ul><br/><br/>Of course, these stories always leave me with unanswered questions:<br/><br/><ul><li>Is forensic science that advance it figures out everything?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Do DCI's ever carry guns?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>How much tea do they drink on the job and what kind?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When they are in the pub sloshing down the ale, are they on duty or off?</li></ul><br/><br/>I may never know the answer to these perplexing questions, however, it doesn't stop me from searching for the next BBC crime show. As you can see, I've watched a few. Do I have favorites? I am a bit partial to the older shows with less gore and murders of only stabbings, strangulation, and poison, which occur at night while the peacocks are screeching in the background. The more complicated the lead detective, the better.

It is intelligently written, tense and the actors are wonderful.  All of them.  I had known, just a little about Trevor Eve(Detective Superintendent Peter Boyd) before, but I had never seen anything of Sue Johnston, Holly Aird, Clair Goose, or Will Johnson's work.  It's a shame, because I can see they are all wonderful actors and actresses. Trevor Eve plays the head of the Cold Case Squad that investigates unsolved murders.  I don't know if it's by plan or not, but Eve presents the character of Boyd as an arrogant, egotistical, yet an  intelligent man with boyish charm.  Boyd is also haunted by the disappearance of his 16 year old son.  There was a fight and the son disappeared.  Boyd doesn't know if the boy is dead or alive.  This affects his job. Sue Johnston is Dr. Grace Foley, the profiler of the team.  I didn't know anything about her.  She presents Foley as a caring, intelligent woman. She is perceptive.  She and Boyd have been friends for a long time and understands his pathos.  When on a tyraid, Foley is the only one who will face Boyd down and make him back down. Holly Aird is Dr. Frankie Wharton.  She is the forensic specialist and is anal about crime scenes.  She even goes as far as requiring masks for the entire team when entering a crime scene.  She is intelligent and will also face down Boyd if necessary. Clair Goose is Detective Constable Mel Silver.  She is a fresh, eager detective who wants to be taken seriously.  She is fasctidious in collecting evidence and tries to cover all bases.  She also dislikes Boyd's patronizing attitudes as he often thinks, because of her young age that she can't do the job.  She usually gets around it by forcing her way through his perceptions and doing what she knows is right anyway. Wil Johnson plays Detective Sargeant Spencer Jordon.  He is an intelligent man who comes from the streets of London.  All he's ever wanted to do is be a policeman.  He is methodical and as he relaxes into his role, he is letting his imagination help him think about the crimes they come across.<br/><br/>I recommend this program to all who would like to watch an intelligent, well made, tense and action/mystery/cop show.

As an adult, I never realized that under the mod fashions and shiny sets, there were some grim and downbeat stories in that show.

Ed Straker leader of SHADO a secret organisation fighting a group of mysterious and hostile aliens. Anderson believed the series would lead on to bigger and better things for Bishop and make a major star, but sadly this was not to be.

Despite being continually told we are watching events set in 1980, there are many bits of 1960s fashions, hair style and attitudes on display. This is particularly amusing in one episode where Col. Foster (Paul Billington) is on leave and goes to a party where everybody is frugging and grooving to The Beatles 'Get Back', or another great episode where two hippies take acid and meet a couple of spacemen. The whole series mixes and matches styles from the time it was made with ideas of what it was going to be like ten years in the future , which of course, is now over twenty years ago... This means that 'UFO's 1980 is very unlike OUR 1980!  So the show has a unique retro-futuristic feel, quite unlike anything else before or since. Another odd thing about the show was that the supporting cast changed back and forth without a word of explanation. Early on the extremely foxy Gabrielle Drake (sister of doomed cult singer Nick Drake!) is in charge of the moonbase, then it's Foster, then someone else. And Straker (Bishop)'s second in command changes from the craggy faced George Sewell (Col. Freeman) to the more aesthetically pleasing Wanda Ventham (Col. Lake), and nothing is mentioned about it. Fans of British TV and movies from the 1960s will see several familiar faces as semi-regulars or guest stars, including David Warbeck, Steven Berkoff, Anoushka Hempel, Lois Maxwell, Shane Rimmer, and others. Also keep an eye out for 60s cult babe Ayshea, who is in  just about every episode but hardly says half a page of dialogue throughout the whole series. She mainly wanders around holding a clip board and looking beautiful. The real sex symbol of the show however was the utterly gorgeous Gabrielle Drake, complete with silver jumpsuit and purple wig. Hundreds of middle aged men around the world are still in love with her I'm sure. I know I am! The early episodes of the series are sometimes a bit uneven, but the quality improved as the series went on. Unfortunately the series didn't continue, but Anderson went on to make 'Space 1999', a more commercially successful series, but not necessarily a better program. 'UFO' is highly recommended to all SF fans, especially those that dig the 1960s.  It is by no means as mind-blowing and innovative as 'The Prisoner', or as consistently enjoyable as 'The Avengers', but personally I still prefer it to original Trek.", "rating": null, "helpful": "50 out of 54 found this helpful.", "date": "16 May 2003"}, {"title": " one of the most ambitious sci fi series ever made", "content": "UFO was one of the most ambitious science fiction series ever produced for television.

Producers - when making a sci-fi series, it is never a good idea to specify the year in which it is set. Gerry and Sylvia Anderson's 'U.F.O.' was made in 1970, but set ten years in the future, meaning it now looks bizarre compared to the reality. No Margaret Thatcher, for instance ( unless she slipped in unnoticed as one of the Moonbase girls! ). My first encounter with 'U.F.O.' came in the pages of the fondly remembered 'Countdown' comic in early 1971. When the series made it to my part of the world a few months later, I was already acquainted with its format and characters.<br/><br/>The premise is this; Earth is fighting a secret war against mysterious green-skinned aliens from an unknown planet, who travel in flying saucers that make a distinctive whirring sound. The aliens are not here to take over, but to kidnap people to use their internal organs as replacements for their own, as an unspecified catastrophe is causing them to gradually die out. Set up to defend us is S.H.A.D.O. ( Secret Headquarters Alien Defence Organisation ), headed by Commander Ed Straker ( Ed Bishop ). Its headquarters, concealed behind the facade of a film studio, is a male chauvinist's dream as its operatives are mostly female and shapely. Whenever a U.F.O. is detected entering our part of the Solar System, S.H.A.D.O. launches Interceptors from a base on the Moon. Should the pesky critters elude the Interceptors' missiles ( which was at least once a week ), the next line of defence were the Skydiver submarines ( though we only ever saw one ). Captain Peter Carlin ( Peter Gordeno ) would enter a hatch, gain access to the cockpit of 'Sky One' ( nothing to do with Rupert Murdoch, so don't worry ), the submarine tilted, and its entire front section detached itself and shot into the sky like a bullet. Should Carlin's aim be off, the U.F.O. next had to contend with Mobiles - huge, land-based vehicles not unlike tanks. The aliens knew of S.H.A.D.O.'s existence ( thanks to a number of people under their control ) and did their best to destroy it. In one episode, two of Straker's men are brainwashed and given orders to kill him. In another, a strange crystal found on the Moon drives insane anyone unlucky enough to touch it.<br/><br/>All this was tremendously exciting to my eight-year old eyes back in 1971. A war between planets, spaceships, submarines, underground offices, ray guns, cars whose doors opened vertically ( how we all wanted to own one! ), explosions, and Gabrielle Drake looking devastatingly sexy in a purple wig ( her dallying with aliens served her in good stead when she appeared in 'Crossroads' a decade later! ). Derek Meddings once more provided the S.F.X., making this one of the few British sci-fi shows of that period to stand comparison with the better funded American ones. Dinky brought out toy Interceptors and Mobiles ( and before you ask, yes, I had both these! )<br/><br/>Of the cast, Ed Bishop was superb as 'Straker', with George Sewell as lecherous 'Colonel Alec Freeman', and Michael Billington providing interest for the ladies as 'Colonel Paul Foster'. The guest-stars included Robin Bailey, George Cole, Adrienne Corri, Michael Jayston, Jane Merrow, Stuart Damon, and Patrick Mower.<br/><br/>I.T.V. did not know what to do with the show; many regions dumped it in late-night slots ( including my own - H.T.V. ). The few critics who bothered to review it predictably likened it to Anderson's 'Thunderbirds'. Very unfair, but what you would expect coming from the uninformed.<br/><br/>The last few episodes were made after a production break, and experienced film directors such as Cyril Frankel and Jeremy Summers came aboard, resulting in a superb run of stories including 'Timelash' in which Patrick Allen played a malevolent time-jumper, and 'The Long Sleep' with Tessa Wyatt. The latter episode was unusually strong for 1970 television, featuring a drug sequence and an attempted rape. Wanda Wentham replaced George Sewell as Straker's second-in-command.<br/><br/>A few years after it ended, 'U.F.O' became a surprise hit on U.S. television, and for a while a second series looked a certainty. But it never happened, and I'm glad it did not because I think the proposed changes in format ( making the Moonbase the focal point of the plots ) would quickly have palled.<br/><br/>As I write this, 'U.F.O.' is being screened on I.T.V.-4, and the series came out on D.V.D. some years ago.

I think he's one of the true originals of British Television and was lucky enough to be recognised as such by Lew Grade who financed a lot of his stuff and also took chances with other people's off-the-wall projects like 'The Prisoner'. Anderson seemed to have an instinctive understanding of what kids would find exciting and succeeded handsomely in realising his visions. He was backed by a brilliant creative team who did wonders with the allocated budgets, which were high for the day. Sylvia Anderson would flesh out the characters and contribute enormously to the programmes in other ways.<br/><br/>This live action series was a curious hybrid of the childish and adult which never quite came together but was the factor in making it memorable. I remember the first episode I ever saw involved the death of Straker's son and I couldn't believe it ended that way. Usually programmes like that always had positive endings which made this series quite radical. In fact, the series often ended with a bleak death. It also involved a lot of disturbing stuff about stolen body parts and mind control. Who could forget the whimpering, mutilated dog? The overall affect was curiously repugnant, like offering a kid some sweeties and then he or she finding something ghastly in the bag. Since Anderson's marriage bust up during the series, this may account for the jaundiced view of relationships in UFO. Any couple unfortunate enough to be in love often met with a sticky end. The series was well acted in general, although the quality threshold collapsed towards the end of its run in terms of plot and scripts. It was unsentimental but occasionally some interesting ideas would filter through the gloom, such as the meditation by Straker on the universe of inner space.<br/><br/>Being sold as an independent production meant the television stations never really backed it, not least because of confusion over its status, and because they preferred promoting their own shows.

I enjoyed watching it not so much for the plot or the<br/><br/>stories but for the typically stylish way an Anderson production<br/><br/>goes about its business.<br/><br/>For 1970 -- Remember: No Computer Graphics Existed! -- its<br/><br/>special effects were most impressive. Also top notch were the<br/><br/>show's snappy production design. This view of 1980 through the<br/><br/>eyes of 1970 is simultaneously fascinating and droll (since we<br/><br/>know how 1980 turned out).

I<br/><br/>recall reading in this same review that an \"authority\" of the time<br/><br/>made a grand pronouncement, \"UFOs do not exist!\" which<br/><br/>everyone took seriously.

Season 1 grabbed my attention. You could really feel the depth of family secrets in Season 1 and how outsiders played a role in the family drama. I felt Season 1 was also very realistic. Season 2 however lost me and kind of became a soap opera. Really over the top and the writing was heavy handed, lacked continuity, way too much time jumping, and dialogue and scenes were juvenile at times. And most surprisingly, I was highly disappointed in not seeing quite a few of the plots of Season 1 not be addressed in Season 2 and even some of the characters did not return? Imagine highly anticipating the outcome of a story and the storyteller just abandoning the story completely with no explanation. Not a good feeling. I also think the writers are writing for an audience they do not know in detail, nor have an affinity for, and that that is a scary thought.<br/><br/>Some examples of the abandoned stories include 1) Kerissa and her school. There seemed to be a scandal brewing in terms of taking tests and there was no mention of that at all in Season 2. Also, it was implied that she may have had an admirer at the school, what happened to that? Season 2 she was a housewife? 2) There was also the Ray plot with Grace. He was so intense regarding the safety of their daughter and taking custody, how was that barely addressed in Season 2, especially after Grace killed someone! Ray did not even show up? That shows a lack of continuity in writing 3) A huge missing story was NOAH! How was Noah not even mentioned nor seen in Season 2? He and Grace were such a major part of Season 1 and had such a passionate scene together (woo! Still hot from that). How did we go from that to her dating a random reporter? Who honestly looks too old for her. The interactions with the reporter (Darius) also have been very juvenile and out of place. A woman in her 40s having \"sleepovers?\" Plus, does Rick really match the tone of this show? I think he would be a good guest character, but him as a main character just seems off and odd and takes me out of the story actually, I just see Rick Fox. His reactions during the \"deep\" scenes with Grace felt like a bad actor in a high school play. The actress playing Grace is great, but Rick kind of brings her performance down due to him not being quite on that level. I think they should bring Noah back or bring in a more trained actor, fresh new face to be her love interest and good looking; not a former basketball player or a known actor constantly recycled. The new guy needs to be at least a B level in acting training so that we get some thought provoking scenes out of Grace and the possible new love interest. From there the scene would stay with you. I got nothing from Darius and Grace.<br/><br/>Casting for Season 2 felt like a Tyler Perry casting. A lot of the new characters just don't really fit the spirit of the show or the essence of their characters. When I look at Queen Sugar, each character IS that character, from looks to voice. Greenleaf, Season 2, had a sort of fakeness. <br/><br/>There were some highlights of Season 2. I do look forward to seeing how the Lionel, Bishop and Lady Mae saga turns out, now including Rochelle and of course Basie Skanks. And the Zora plot I feel is very much needed for young girls to see. Teen violence, particularly among black women, is a real thing. That is about all I look forward to for Season 3 coming. But I'm nervous that these plots will disappear as well. I had my hopes up for the plots continuing from Season 1 and got barely any of them Season 2. Oprah's character is such a joy. Loved her one liners, they could use her more, but maybe she's busy. <br/><br/>The low lights of Season 2. I felt Uncle Mac should not have died so quickly. He probably needed another season at least. I was shocked the writers did not put Grace through a trial. Missed opportunity for good drama. The Darius character just all around lacks. If he were just a reporter and again Rick just did a few guests spots, I could see it be okay but full time, he's throwing me off as her love interest. Noah to me was more fitting. He has more backstory with the Greenleaf world and he also had terrific chemistry with Grace. I'm surprised the writers couldn't think of something to enhance that relationship and give us more of where it was and where it could go. I also feel they under-use Sophia. Also the siblings of the family do not interact enough AT ALL! <br/><br/>Hopefully Season 3 brings more continuity and some of the flavor and characters of Season 1 return. I'm not sure I can stomach watching the new additions for another full season honestly. Jabari is also just another generic actor. There's just not much depth to his performance. Their stories don't seem to have much meat to them, nor much backstory. Darius definitely shared a little back story but it wasn't memorable. And it actually doesn't make sense that Grace would share secrets with an on and off boyfriend. Why does she trust him so much, just odd behavior? She seems smarter than that. I'm nervous however to see Rick Fox will be in almost every episode Season 3??...based on IMDb at least. Hmmm, I don't get it.

It offers excellent acting, dialogue, character plots and a unique perspective of behind the scenes of a megachurch family.<br/><br/>What I like most about this show is the drama! Just when you think things can't get more dramatic, they somehow always do. There is sibling rivalry, church rivalry, family secrets, mistresses! This show borders on being a soap opera, but I think what makes it different is in the excellent writing and the cast performance.<br/><br/>Like many shows, this series comes with a few drawbacks such as predictability and repeated plot lines. Although the series does have excellent writing, I find a lot of the plot lines to be very predictable. Often when I'm watching Greenleaf, I can predict what's going to happen with accuracy which is a little disappointing. The plot has many scenarios that are not new to television. A secretly gay husband, the pedophile uncle, the affair with the secretary. Come on; I've seen every one of these before in other shows.<br/><br/>Although I do love drama, some of the scenes are so dramatic that they make me laugh.

It's a huge problem, and Gigi takes him to court. The father gets custody for 90 days and takes Sophia with him to Phoenix. Gigi is distraught and contemplates moving back to Phoenix to be with her daughter. Season one ends with Sophia being driven off by her dad and Gigi distraught. In season two Sophia is back with Gigi, and there is no mention at all about the custody battle which surprised me.<br/><br/>Also, Charity was pregnant in season one with twins. Once season two starts, we discover that she lost one of the babies, but it is mentioned very casually in conversation. Last time I checked, losing a child is a BIG deal, and that should have gotten more attention in the show.<br/><br/>All in all, I do enjoy watching Greenleaf and tune in each week for the drama!

Her sister-in-law Kerrisa jumps on it, passive-aggressively asking why. Grace's mother insists on an answer, and the whole conversation devolves into a tense mess of resentment and jealousy. It is fascinating.<br/><br/>Much of my fascination with Greenleaf is that, for me, a white, big- city atheist, this world is so outside of my experience, in part because everyone's black, but more because everyone accepts Jesus as a very tangible figure in their lives. Only Grace is the sort of Christian I'm used to - the \"I'm more spiritual than religious\" type, and in her case she is torn between that and her evangelical roots.<br/><br/>Even though Jesus is so real for them, they are still human. One is clearly gay and trying hard not to be. The church head seems to be casually corrupt. Even Grace's odious pedophile uncle is probably a believer although he seems to flout everything in the bible.<br/><br/>There are some very interesting characters. Grace, her starchy mom and glad-handing dad, and most notably Kerrisa, played by Kim Hawthorne as a controlling, anxious woman resentful that following all the rules hasn't made her happy.

However, Greenleaf is not about entertaining the viewers. Instead, it appears to be an attempt to lobby for total acceptance of a gay lifestyle in the church.<br/><br/>The show seems to toss the Ewings' of \"DALLAS\" into the stew pot, add a couple of Megachurches, and stir in an LGBT Rally. The result is \"Greenleaf\" a modern soap opera with an all star cast and the controversial topic of Homosexuality at the forefront.<br/><br/>The first season kept me mesmerized as I followed the life of the Greenleaf Family, amid the aftermath of a suicide that brought a prodigal daughter back to the family mansion. As the family sat at the dinner table, I recalled the dinners of the Ewing family and the rivalries between siblings. While there was no JR, Grace, the lead character, came through as a Bobby Ewing character, beloved by all, but unable to overcome the influence of her powerful mother.<br/><br/>As the season progressed, we learned of a deeply buried secret of a perverted uncle who preyed on young girls. This appeared to be one of the main story lines through the first and into the early part of the second season. However, it would be only one story line, soon overwhelmed by possibly the primary agenda of the writing staff; homosexuality in the Christian Church.<br/><br/>The number of characters who were gay seemed to grow from week to week. In the end, one of the son-in-laws, a family friend, a church choir director, his spouse, and a counselor all \"came out of the closet.\" <br/><br/>While the introduction of gay characters is nothing new, the idea of battling the traditional church stance of frowning or even opposing homosexuality, became center stage. Even a meeting of local churches turned into a lobbying effort to overcome any opposition to the full inclusion of homosexual individuals and relationships, into the church.<br/><br/>Even if the story line stopped there, it would hardly be the first time that gay relationships entered our living rooms. However, the main plot now seemed to focus on a wide variety of caveats. There was the divorce of one of the Greenleaf family members because the husband was gay. A choir director was fired because they were in a same-sex marriage. But, alas it didn't stop there. Each episode brought the main story line deeper into the clash between Biblical Verses opposing a gay lifestyle and the New Testament concept of \"Love\" covers sin. I believe that this was not a creative accident by writers, but the main purpose behind the series. When Bible Verses are reinterpreted by characters portraying ministers, it is not just part of a larger plot, but the very theme itself.<br/><br/>While I enjoy a strong performance by a highly-talented cast, it seems that homosexuality in the Christian Church, has become a rallying cry of the writing staff. When any subject overpowers the show, it turns from a medium of entertainment to a protest rally.<br/><br/>I must step aside for a moment and add a personal dimension to this review. As a Christian, I do not believe that anyone is sinless. I also believe we should love one another. However, when any drama style show attempts to interpret scripture, it leaves the realm of entertainment and enters Theology. <br/><br/>Overall, the show is interesting but it is overshadowed by an effort to mold the writers view of the Bible into a soap box for gay rights.

The clergy of the church facilitate your spiritual and religious needs and also acts as instructors, telling you, the congregants, what is right and wrong, sometimes claiming their advice is from Heaven. The clergy of the church, almost regardless of the denomination, is there to support the church members and potential converts. However, what about those people who play the role of the clergy? Who offers pastors, bishops and the like the spiritual guidance they may need? And what if the people performing those duties are in some ways compromising what they're telling others? Are they practicing what they're preaching? <br/><br/>\"Greenleaf\", a relatively new television/cable series, focuses on a predominantly African-American Protestant Church called The Calvary Fellowship. The grand Pooh-Bah is Bishop James Greenleaf (Keith David), the most inspirational figure of the church during services particularly with his resonant but kindly voice. However, behind the scenes, the bishop has many personal problems and even hints of flaws in character. His wife and \"first lady\" of the church is Lady Mae Greenleaf (Lynn Whitfield) who is the unofficial matriarch. Although her husband runs the church, she runs the Greenleaf family so-to-speak. Most of the family are involved with church duties, helping out at services, conducting teaching programs (i.e. Sunday School) and even planning events. Because their church and congregation are very large, the family lives very well. Servants are constantly in attendance at the Greenleaf household. In other words, if you're a member of the Greenleaf family, you'll live in the upper middle-class, but the price you pay is you're going to be integral to the operations of the church. Else, you may have to get out of Dodge as did their wayward daughter, Grace.<br/><br/>The series begins when the Bishop's estranged daughter Grace Greenleaf decides to return to the family after 20 years of self-imposed exile. We learn that she had been a preacher for the church but decided to end her clerical life and live among secular culture. We also learn that James Greenleaf had designs for her daughter possibly to succeed him as the main voice of the church during services. She has returned to the family and to the church but at the beginning of the story she has no intention of standing at the pulpit and making grand religious-biblical pronouncements as she had 20 years earlier. Even before she's stepped back into their house, Lady Mae tells Grace \"not to cause trouble for their family\". Zing. We know this reunion of Grace with the Greenleaf family is going to cause trouble. Of course if there wasn't trouble, there wouldn't be a show!<br/><br/>At first Grace just agrees to answer phones at the church offices as the first voice heard by either church members or potential converts. When a grandmother enters her office asking that her granddaughter be baptized (without it seems permission of the mother or father), Grace decides to take the role she vowed she wouldn't play. She dons a white robe and performs the ceremony. This story may be about how Grace begins to rediscover and play the role she left 20 years earlier.<br/><br/>As the series unfolds, we learn there are many hypocrisies surrounding the Greenleaf family. Grace is not the only estranged family member. Mavis McCready (Oprah Winfrey) is an alcoholic lush and Lady Mae's estranged sister. She resides a ways away from the family, and they seem to disown her. Other skeletons lurk in the closet, some of whose bones begin to rattle. We learn about a child molestation case involving one of the parishoners which has been conveniently swept under the proverbial church carpets. Also, a senator is investigating churches and other faith-based entities who enjoy the privilege of not-for-profit status. The senator asks for their financial records, and after he has taken his leave, Bishop Greenleaf makes it clear he has no intention of revealing any church records. I am guessing this will have further implications in the future of the series.<br/><br/>A wonderful beginning to a masterful series. I think the main point of the story is that trying to juggle the problems of everyday life while maintaining a facade of \"purity\" may be too much for any family to accomplish. Consider the Bakkers of \"Praise the Lord\" who seemed wholesome until it was revealed they were engaging in fraudulent business practices. In the present series, we believe in the Greenleaf characters and their plights and their need to project an unstained veneer. The acting is outstanding, particularly David as the Bishop, Whitfield as the \"first lady\" and Dandridge as Grace. Honorable mention to Winfrey, playing against type as an alcoholic, the kind of character who might end up on Dr. Phil! While some of the situations might be perceived as melodramatic, other issues are dealt with, such as homosexuality, interracial sex, and even infidelity. For a family which is supposed to be holier than the congregation they serve, they seem to be digging some fairly large holes!", "rating": 9, "helpful": "8 out of 13 found this helpful.", "date": "7 September 2017"}, {"title": " Great show!", "content": "I was hesitant to watch this at first, but after starting the first episode I was hooked.

And Season 2, with the additional cast members and new stories did not fair well with viewers, obviously. Forget my opinion. The numbers show a huge loss in viewership. If I were network, I would demand changes by the producers and writers. I would demand they get back to what they had in Season 1, which was the Noah plot as well as other stories including Ray wanting to be involved with Sophia, Kerissa and her school drama and potential affair, as well as other plots that were dropped without explanation. They really should drop plots that are for the most part missing with the audience, which includes the Darius and Grace \"love\" plot and even the Jabari plot just seems out of place. They also show too much Skanks.<br/><br/>Oprah should also consider hiring a different head writer or give him a right hand person who actually understands the audience who is watching. They have major continuity problems as well on this show.

I saw the trailers for it and was actually looking forward to this show, thinking it would probably be good or at least decent. But this show completely took me by surprise. I did not expect this show to be as good as it turned out to be at all. In only one season, this has become one of my new favorite shows. It's incredibly unique. Sure, the basic premise of an antihero we're supposed to relate to and root for is nothing new and is actually what has driven a large amount of television shows since Tony Soprano popularized that. But the way they go about exploring that premise in this show is what makes it interesting. Without giving away too much, there doesn't seem to be an overarching story yet. We kind of get one that continues through some of the episodes, but for the most part, the show is just about following our main character, Ray, and the crazy situations he finds himself in. And this was a big draw for me. I find it interesting to watch a main character just kind of go through his life. There isn't really a main plot or any subplots. Just these different situations Ray falls into. It's more serialized than I thought it would be, but I'm fine with it because for the type of show it is, it works. The acting and writing can't go without notice either. The acting in this show is just beyond great. All of these actors feel so natural in their roles, especially Scott Ryan as Ray. He kills this role, which makes sense seeing as how he is the sole writer and creator of the show. His writing is in the same caliber as his acting too, with dialogue so well written and delivered it reminded me of watching a Tarantino movie the whole time. Just the way characters talk to each other about the simplest things that really aren't important to what's going on, but it's made interesting in the way it's written and with the delivery. This also is the biggest part of what makes the show so funny. This is probably the funniest show I've watched in quite some time. The show manages to deftly balance comedy and drama effectively, showing the brutality that comes with Ray's job as a fixer, but not taking it all that seriously, because even though Ray is really good at his job, he still manages to throw a joke or insult in the mix that works with the situation, and creates great humor. This also comes down to the direction from Nash Edgerton(brother of Joel Edgerton), who directs all six episodes in the first season. His direction is top notch as well, with the camera always having clear focus on what's going on. The camera is almost entirely handheld, but it's very steady throughout so it actually adds to the raw, sort of indie filmmaking style on display here. There are also a lot of really great looking wide shots throughout Season 1, and these provide some beautiful imagery. The show has also got a great soundtrack, with a great selection of songs that play over the credits of each episode, as well as the original score that plays during the episodes themselves. The music never feels out of place and always quietly builds up, perfectly accompanying each scene. Overall, everything in this first season of Mr Inbetween is perfect. The acting, writing, directing, music, cinematography, and characters are all worthy of heavy praise. This is real filmmaking right here and this is as good as TV gets right now. I would say this is easily the best new show of 2018, and the best show on at the moment, right next to Better Call Saul and The Deuce. Just high quality all around. Very pleased to hear that FX has renewed this for a Season 2 because it deserves it. I can't wait to see more of this show.

In crime genre on TV most plots have become a m\u00e9lange of well-used ingredients. Only through nuanced acting, competent direction, editing and camera-work the repetition can be tolerated and the show becomes watchable despite its lack of originality.<br/><br/>Two episodes into Wanted if you get the feeling of I've-seen-this-before-but-not-really, you're not alone. Wanted is so far a dive into a very familiar pool, yet I don't mind looking at the third offering and so on unless it runs out of breath in later episodes. The story is developing in the familiar unbelievably predictable and predictably unbelievable fashion, but it moves fast. So far, it is an \"odd couple on the run\" story with \"bent cops\" and \"the devil incarnate hit-man\" on their tail. There is also a hint of '24' style development with the baddies exposing themselves gradually in a stratified structure (how else would they sustain the chase for 12 eps?) No matter. It has Rebecca Gibney, maturing gracefully both as a woman and as an actor, and she is a joy to watch. We may have met her character, Lola, before on paper and on screen (attractive older woman with a compromised past and a big heart made bitter and cynical by time and fate), but she inhabits the character with such conviction that you can tell her inner struggles from the minute expressions of her face. Geraldine Hakewille, an actor I have never encountered before, is less subtle, but she manages to put some shade into her stock character (the younger, neurotic, less prim and proper than she seems foil/buddy to the older woman).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is equally capable in their stock roles. Notable also is Nicholas Bell who has the type of face that can appear avuncular or threatening simply by looking at the camera. I am not quite sure about Mirko Grillini as the dead-eyed-hit-man. He might have watched one Hollywood Mafia story too many.<br/><br/>Direction, sets, locales, camera-work and editing are near faultless.

This was equally true of daytime TV (\"Search for Tomorrow\"). The shows broadened out to include the impact of the business world on the domestic family life (\"The Donna Reed Show\") and sometimes the \"business\" was an equal focus (\"Bonanza\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\", Dick van Dyke Show\", \"Steptoe and Son\").<br/><br/>TV moved from the family focus to the business end of the family but there was always room for the domestic shows (\"Waltons\"). With few exceptions (\"Adams Family\", \"Dukes of Hazard\") the families were relatively normal (\"Happy Days\", \"Little House on the Prairie\", \"Jeffersons\", \"Eight is Enough\").<br/><br/>\"I Claudius\" (1976) is probably the first TV show to focus on a dysfunctional family, although this was a BBC mini-series and not a regular prime-time show. A few series were clearly featuring families with problems (\"Married with Children\", \"All in the Family\") but these were comedies, and as late as the 1990s most families were relatively wholesome (\"Cosby Show\", \"Home Improvement\", \"Wonder Years\", \"Fresh Prince\").<br/><br/>\"The Sopranos\" (1999) gave us our first family from a different point of view and series like \"Dexter\" (2006), \"Breaking Bad\" (2008), \"Sons of Anarchy\" (2008), \"Bates Motel\" (2013), and Ray Donovan (2013) continued the trend. In the new breed of family crime shows the crime elements far outweigh the family elements. <br/><br/>\"Ice\" is about a family involved in the jewelry business, but most of their time is spent beating people up or being beaten, killing people, having sex, using drugs, and roaming around Los Angeles. Jeremy Sisto plays the guy who gets in trouble and Cam Gigandet is the brother who bails him out. Neither one seem suited for their role. Ray Winstone mumbles his way through the scenes trying to help his nephews, and Raymond J Barry spends most of his time unconscious. Judith Shekoni is outstanding, but not for this series, and she seems out of place. The production values are excellent and the music is good. Photography is excellent.<br/><br/>I prefer my crime family series (or films) to be as much about the family dynamics as they are about the crime. It's why I enjoy \"Ray Donovan\" or \"Breaking Bad\" or even \"I Claudius\". When you focus too much on the crime you may as well make a crime film/series and take out the family element. It's a delicate mix and the mix in \"Ice\" doesn't work for me.

Firstly the production value is super high in this show. The music/audio is great; awesome theme song and equally good incidental music throughout the episodes. The cinematography set and production design is also superb. Long story short; phenomenal production. <br/><br/>This leads us to the actors. Once again, freakin amazing. I was worried Joe Thomas would play the same role as he did in the inbetweeners but the character is unique enough to realize it is not a clone of his old character. He is quite funny in this. <br/><br/>The other actors in the show also do an incredible job. Kimberley Nixon is my new favorite actress. She absolutely kills it in the series (as does her co stars). I really can't speak highly enough about the acting in the show, just give it a watch and see. <br/><br/>The writing is also amazing. Even though I'm an American I can recall so many similar personalities from my time in college here in the states. The posh rich guy, the eccentric girl who dresses completely over the top (Oregon) and the reclusive nerdy guy (mr.

I am probably a bit older than the typical demographic who like this show, therefore I try not to be too judgmental. <br/><br/>The thing I like most about the show are the diversity of characters. The six main characters are all completely different. It is through their sometimes awkward interactions the humor abounds. Then there are the consequences of the choices made by young freshmen in college. Add to the formula, the way the show mixes drama with the comedy to keep it from ever becoming too sappy and goofy. It's the perfect blend of both, with some very cool music replacing your father's laugh track in traditional sitcoms. <br/><br/>The humor can sometimes be dark, subtle, or downright lurking in the bushes outside like an intruder in the night. Sometimes it hits you in the face like a Three Stooges skit and other times it challenges the mind with sophisticated rapid-fire precision. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first three seasons and I am looking forward to a fourth and final season which is currently in production.

But as Dawn and Tim eventually got together, hopefully so will Kingsley and Josie. Even though their later interaction was a little difficult to watch, because it was obvious that it was their love for one another that was making them argue and fight so much, but one still felt rather uncomfortable that neither could defend themselves when the other launched into them - Josie experienced it in the early stages of the season, and Kingsley in the later part of the season. Vod and Oregon's interaction, though, was also particularly fun to watch - it was obvious that Oregon was trying to emulate Vod to disguise her privileged upbringing, even agreeing with Vod's open disgust for students who have cars, despite Oregon having one herself. Vod's reaction upon discover her best friend was lying about herself and was the very thing she hated was a very good idea indeed.<br/><br/>But I am also impressed with J.P. - for all the flak public schoolboys tend to receive, and the general perception of being prim, proper and well-mannered that's associated with them, it's nice to see a more realistic perspective of one for a change - yes, he is arrogant, but he is comically arrogant, and incredibly hedonistic. It was particularly satisfying for him to say outright \"Am I just the posh guy nobody wants to hang out with?\"<br/><br/>The best laughs, though, came from Howard. There's nothing people like more in a sitcom or TV show than a socially inept guy, and a guy with a regionally distinct accent, and, while I appreciated Josie's sweet nature and Welsh accent, Kingsley's insecurity, JP's arrogance and posh accent, Vod's forthrightness, and Oregon's insecurity over her image, none of those traits put together would've equalled Howard, who definitely killed two birds with one stone. <br/><br/>I'd say, meanwhile, that my favourite part of the series was the very final scene, where very few loose ends were tied up, but we were satisfied they would be answered very soon - it felt satisfying to see JP finally show that he was human by mourning for his father while in the shower, and to see Oregon and Vod's friendship at least partially resume.

From the creators of Peep Show, basically the series revolves around a group of six freshers, i.e. first year university students, who live together in their off campus home and attend Manchester Medlock University. These six are sweet natured dentistry student Josie (Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging's Kimberley Nixon), streetwise and hard living literature student Violet aka 'Vod' (Zawe Ashton), kind hearted and awkward geology/drama student Kingsley (The Inbetweeners' Joe Thomas), occasionally egotistical and self-proclaimed top man Jonathan aka J.P. geology student (Jack Whitehall), Scottish often socially inept and highly work focused non fresher geology student Howard (Greg McHugh), good natured and anxious but appearing cool literature student Melissa aka Oregon (Charlotte Ritchie).

More of a Curate's Egg", "content": "Sam Bain and Jesse Armstrong, creators of Peep Show. It was probably these names that drew many of the more mature viewers to Fresh Meat, but unless my eyes deceived me, they only wrote episode one. Got the ball rolling. Actually, I'd say many of the later episodes were funnier, but imho Fresh Meat Series One is a disconcerting blend of brilliance and incompetence.<br/><br/>What we have is the now pretty standard set-up of three guys and three gals plus a few ancillaries who come and go. Must not forget Paul, the unseen housemate, although the script often does. He's no Maris Crane. Six visible housemates at Manchester University. Their lives and loves, fears and insecurities, the ups and downs of burgeoning friendships.<br/><br/>Now, I didn't go to Manchester, but I did go to uni and not so long ago that I have forgotten that university is nothing like it's made out to be here. I'd say the behaviour of the characters was often rather more sixth form than undergraduate and the show doesn't concern itself much with actual study. Rather fortuitously, all the guys seem to be reading Geology, but I found Kingsley's decision to change courses, for highly spurious reasons, unbelievable both as a personal decision and as a choice the university would permit. Little comedy mileage is created by his new subject, Drama, although the little that is demonstrated is entirely realistic, as I know from personal experience.<br/><br/>I also had a problem with the idea that Vod could get into an English Literature degree course without the slightest enthusiasm for the subject, much less ability. Her friend Oregon is clearly an excellent student, though determined to hide the fact from her rebellious housemate; still, if I could accept the idea of her affair with the English professor, I couldn't believe the scene where she not only reads but starts to edit his new book's manuscript. Come on! He might fancy a bit on the side, but to allow a fresher to tinker with his book in her first term at uni? Generally, the housemates demonstrate the adolescent malaise that escaped my age group. With the exceptions of Howard, JP and Vod - the show's most confident characters and also the funniest and most likable - the others display an insufferable mixture of insecurity and bravado, constantly equivocating, hedging, humming and hawing, using annoying phrases - but if, that is to say, not that I've, and I'm like No way! - you know the sort of thing. It's impossible to care about the droopy romance between Kingsley and Josie which is as wet as a haddock's bathing costume. There often isn't any discernible basis for the characters' behaviour and little development. Why is Vod a druggie and a rebel? Why is Orgeon such a ludicrous mythomaniac. Why is Josie, meant to be seen as sensible and grounded, so obnoxious? One is looking for a little more explication, even in a show about people who have a problem communicating.<br/><br/>And yet...Fresh Meat is often very funny, with lots of puns and neologisms, \"guymens\" for male hymens being one of my faves. The cast are faultless in their portrayals of these deeply worrying freshers, with Jack Whitehall and Zawe Ashton standing proud. Seeing Robert Webb playing such an insignificant needy teacher, another character hard to believe in, was both funny and poignant, since despite its merits and (occasionally) creative use of swear words, Fresh Meat isn't a patch on Peep Show (yet). It does come from the Channel 4 stable and no British channel has created or imported as much high quality comedy in recent years as Channel 4, so here's hoping Series Two will be both funnier and more tightly written.", "rating": null, "helpful": "7 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "19 November 2011"}, {"title": " A Timeless and Hilarious Comedy", "content": "Fresh Meat was first introduced to me by my father when I was 14 or so but I did not understand it and gave up after 2 episodes.\nI picked it up again around the start of 2018, just as my preparations for University were picking up.

Wealthy prep school girls from a private school and also appeared to have little problems (on the surface), were at the centre. The only thing that isn't touched upon enough is the corrupt officials that were clients. The real life client list held the names of politicians, police officers, UN Ambassadors etc... and police believe the high profile clients were aware that the girls in the real scandal were only 14 and 15.\nWhen you think about Baby in real life terms, it's actually dark and disturbing but it also shows how easy it is to groom teens.

True Detective is slower. I didn't find Dublin Murders slow at all, and wondered why a lead reviewer here at IMDb would claim that. The pace is awesome, and always interesting.

Don't let that dissuade you though, Dublin Murders is very clever writing indeed, in fact, I haven't seen anything quite like it.

The lead man in DM is a clever character study. You'll love him, then hate him, then find sympathy again. The lead woman is one of the strongest depictions of a strong woman I've yet seen, and a credit to a portrait of Irish femininity.

And herein lies the show's biggest problem. French's series is pseudo-anthological in design; each novel has a different protagonist, and although there are common characters across all of the stories, each plot is wholly self-contained. In writing Dublin Murders, Sarah Phelps has made the strange decision to present the plots of the first two novels as happening concurrently, with each case bleeding slightly into the other. This doesn't even remotely work, with the events of The Likeness never feeling like anything other than a half-baked B-plot that serves only to detract from the far superior material in the A-plot. It's a maddening decision, as In the Woods could have made a superb five or six-part series, but instead, we've got an over-long eight-parter with a ton of what feels like completely extraneous fat. Nevertheless, there is much to laud here; the acting, the cinematography, production design, and art direction, the editing and directing, and, when focusing on the first novel, much of Phelps' writing, which admirably captures the thematic and tonal essence of French's 500-page interiorised narrative.<br/><br/>The show takes place in 2006 and begins with the discovery of the body of twelve-year-old Katy Devlin (<a href=\"/name/nm10956298/\">Amy Macken</a>) in the woods around Knocknaree, a (fictional) housing estate in Dublin's suburbs. Detectives Rob Reilly (<a href=\"/name/nm2832424/\">Killian Scott</a>) and Cassie Maddox (<a href=\"/name/nm2497366/\">Sarah Greene</a>) of the (fictional) Dublin Murder Squad (DMS) are assigned to the case, which has attracted a great deal of attention, as twenty-two years earlier three young children disappeared in the same woods. One of those children was found a few hours after they disappeared, and although he was uninjured, his shirt was ripped as if by claws, and his shoes were filled with someone else's blood. He swears, however, that he has no memory of what happened in the woods. That child, Adam, left Ireland with his parents and as far as anyone knows, never returned. However, Rob is in fact adult Adam, having secretly returned to Ireland with a new identity, after years spent in England, a fact known only to Cassie, and he plans to use the Devlin investigation as a means to delve into the 1985 case. Meanwhile, Cassie is approached by her old boss, senior investigator Frank Mackey (<a href=\"/name/nm2534167/\">Tom Vaughan-Lawlor</a>), with an intriguing undercover operation made necessary by a very unusual murder.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, the show has a lot going for it. To a certain extent, it successfully mixes genres - there's the obvious whodunnit, but there's also a pseudo-<a href=\"/title/tt0071315/\">Chinatown (1974)</a> motif of greed, conspiracy, and corruption, and a vaguely supernatural, otherworldly undercurrent, not unlike <a href=\"/title/tt0098936/\">Twin Peaks (1990)</a>. In terms of narrative structure, although the 2006-set events are presented chronologically, the show makes ample use of flashbacks, which jump around quite a bit in the timeline. That this never becomes confusing or arbitrary is a testament to the editing, which always ensures to establish the link between the show's present and the moments to which the characters are flashing back. The one major deviation from this is that the opening scene in the first episode takes place right at the end of the story, but it's a wholly justified way to begin, succinctly establishing the tone, and introducing us to much of the psychological conflict within Rob.<br/><br/>The cinematography is also worth mentioning, working hand-in-hand with the production design to suggest that things just aren't quite right in Knocknaree in general, and the Devlin home in specific. The world genuinely feels lived in, and the people who live here all have their quirks. It's hard to put your finger on, but the visuals do a great job of keeping the tone slightly off-kilter, sometimes suggesting that this character knows more than they're letting on, sometimes suggesting that another character does. There are also some lovely subtle details, such as the ladybird crawling across Katy's face, and the reveal that her body has attracted a colony of ants. The acting too is impressive. Scott and Greene have tremendous chemistry, which is pivotal, and although both are initially presented as likeable, if damaged, individuals, as the show goes on, both actors allow us to see a much darker side to their personas, with each turning on the people closest to them in a particularly vicious manner. Also worthy of praise are an exceptional <a href=\"/name/nm7388592/\">Leah McNamara</a> as Katy's older sister, the ever-reliable <a href=\"/name/nm3974805/\">Moe Dunford</a> as Cassie's boyfriend, <a href=\"/name/nm0384152/\">Conleth Hill</a> as the unapologetic acerbic and un-PC head of the DMS; and <a href=\"/name/nm0567945/\">Peter McDonald</a> as Katy's father, about whom something just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Thematically, much like In the Woods, the show isn't so much focused on the Devlin murder as it is the nature of lingering trauma. Virtually every character is damaged in some way, but none more so than Rob, who, to a certain extent, never really made it out of the woods in 1985. This is evidenced perfectly by the fact that he uses the Devlin murder as a cover to delve into the disappearance of his friends. The show begins with Rob asking Cassie, \"what if the killed are the lucky ones?\" And this is a central theme throughout - what if it's those who are murdered who could be considered free, and those who survive that are forever trapped within their trauma?<br/><br/>All of which brings us to the show's fatal flaw. Notice above how almost everything I've said relates to the Devlin case/In the Woods rather than the undercover operation/The Likeness? That's because the undercover investigation does little but detract and distract from the far more interesting and compelling murder inquiry. Phelps is unable to mould the two plots to coalesce properly, with the characters in Cassie's case never being developed to even half the degree of those in Rob's. Every time we cut to the undercover case, all I wanted to do was get back to the murder case. This is particularly apparent when we get to the big reveal at the end of the undercover case and it just kind of limply sits there. It's about as \"meh\" as you could imagine, and it's because we've never gotten to know these people or their relationships with one another, as the whole thing never feels like anything other than an afterthought. Splitting the show's real estate does neither plot any favours - in the novels, each case works by immersing us in the interiority of the protagonist, as the plot unfolds in a manner coloured by that character's subjectivity. Continually cutting away from one plot to show us the other completely breaks that immersion, and seems to imply an inherent connection between the two plots that simply doesn't exist.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, although this might sound very negative, I did enjoy the show for the most part. It's well-acted, looks great, and in relation to the murder case, is very well written. A shorter run focusing on just that case would have been infinitely preferable, but that's not what we got. It's absolutely worth checking out, but be prepared to be frustrated once the undercover operation starts taking up so much time.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "22 out of 25 found this helpful.", "date": "23 February 2021"}, {"title": " Sets The Tone...

You have just sat through hours of a film which is getting tedious and confusing, and suddenly in the final few minutes. all is explained and you realise that what you have been viewing is a brilliant script.<br/><br/>Sadly, there was no such ending. Instead, there was a multitude of plot holes. All of these were the size of an Elephant, but nobody wanted to discuss these Elephants in the room. The main character centres on Detective Rob Reilly, who it transpires was connected to the disappearance of two childhood friends about years earlier. That case remains unsolved. Somehow or other, he manages to join the Police without this coming to light in spite of the stringent vetting that recruits undergo before enrolment.<br/><br/>He sets about investigating a recent murder of a child in the same area as the disappearance and we are left wondering whether the cases are connected. His Police partner, is a complex character, Cassie Maddox, who at one time was an undercover officer playing the role of Lexie Mangan. The plot becomes more complicated when an identical woman to Maddox is found murdered, and her name is Lexie Mangan too. To all intents and purposes, this \"Lexie\" has just materialised from nowhere and there seems to be no evidence that she ever existed very long before her murder.<br/><br/>The police then involve a hospital in the ethically dubious plan to resurrect Lexi, using Maddocks. Clearly, for them to be able to use such a device they would have to know that she has no family who might later be outraged at the deception, but as there is no apparent history of her prior existence,nobody seems to let that little plot hole worry them.<br/><br/>Eventually, Reilly's antecedents are revealed by a school age girl, though where she has got this knowledge from is also never made clear.

For sure the police they show us in Dublin, Ireland, is not particularly glorious. The two main cops, Rob Reilly and Cassie Maddox find themselves in two cases that are reminiscent in some ways of an older case twenty years earlier or so. The trick - and we know it from the very start - is that Rob Reilly is, in fact, the kid Adam who was one of three kids in the early 1980s, two of whom disappeared completely, and the third one moved to England and disappeared from the scene. At the same time, their drama happened when they witnessed one night in the woods three bullies raping a girl. But 20 years later or so, the boy who had disappeared in England with his family and everything, Adam, is back as Rob Reilly. Adam has become Rob Reilly, and he finds himself in charge one of the new cases, that of a girl assassinated in the same woods as those where the rape scene he had witnessed with his two friends twenty years before or so had taken place.<br/><br/>A girl more or less disappears and is found killed on some altar in the same woods as in the early 80s. Later on, they find the body of a young woman known as Lexie stabbed to death in some ruins. Both modern cases are solved, and the killers are surprisingly not those we could have thought, but you'll have to watch the series to know.<br/><br/>What is more interesting is the way all that is shown in a hazy and dark light. In the early 80s three kids witnessed a rape, two disappeared on the spot or nearly, and the third one was found clinging to a tree trunk crying, his T-shirt slashed and with blood that is not his. We will never know what happened to the first two, and we know about Adam. He was sent to a boarding school in England and he only came back to Ireland twenty off years later as an adult to be a detective in Dublin, with the secret intention to find out what happened to his two friends.<br/><br/>Adam is depicted systematically when he was a kid as someone who wanted to be up to his two friends but never could. We do not know exactly if the two friends took advantage of his inability to follow them at the proper pace so that they could bully him in a friendly way, and so he could remain their friend. Or if they tried to get rid of him by discouraging him by losing him in the woods. Or if they had more vicious intentions. Typical very young teenagers who are friendlily cruel with one another. Adam's case is made worse by the decision of his mother to send him to a boarding school in England at 11 or 12, cutting him away from his home, country, friends, etc.<br/><br/>The second thing is the very graphic depiction of the three bullies: one is a chief in the triplet, and two are more or less weak followers. In modern times the girl who is assassinated is one daughter of one of the bullies. He has three daughters, an elder one who was the cause of his marriage since in Ireland at the time it was impossible to abort a child and it was normal for the two kids who got in such a situation to get married, and they did. Despite the fact these parents got two twins, later on, they could not give their first daughter any love and the mother clearly told her she was not wanted. One of the two twins is a promising ballet dancer and is to move in the fall to a dancing school in England. The mother is hysterical, and she is disabled by her guilt. She feels guilty about her life - which is pathetic and it is a little bit too late to change it - and about her children, the eldest daughter she hates, and the twins are not able, even the dancer, to make up for the forced and unhappy marriage of hers. The father is just gutless and submissive, doing just the right and proper things, which is, of course, the wrong thing to do with teenagers, and even with his eldest daughter who is taking over the place of her mother, making her mother's problems even worse.<br/><br/>The killing of the daughter becomes a nasty family affair in which of course one boy from outside will volunteer to take the blame. The older episode will not find a solution. We will never know what happened to the two missing boys, and how can we know since, of the three bullies of the older case, one is the father of the murdered girl in modern times, a spineless pathetic and pitiful man. The second they finally find is a derelict vagrant more or less homeless man lost in his alienation, though not completely because he is one rare person who recognized Adam at first sight in Rob Reilly, who loses his self-control completely. The third one, the main bully and the rapist of the early 1980s has completely disappeared and we assume he is the one who did what had to be done to eliminate the witnesses, at least two witnesses, and traumatize the surviving one into complete oblivion (it is called PTSS in psychiatry). The two weaklings who are found still there are maybe taking advantage of the disappearance of the main bully to cover their backside, but we will not know.<br/><br/>The second modern times' case is the assassination of Lexie. With a ridiculous undercover operation that did not turn properly, they discover the truth and the identity of the killer, once again a weakling in a group of five, reduced to four by the murder. Lexie was pregnant from one of the three young men there, but it is another one, the weak one who did the bad job for reasons that are so evanescent and transient that it shows the young man was weak to the point of being insane and then losing control of himself. That is so perverse, and normal at the same time, yet corrugated as a vision of society provided by the series.<br/><br/>Cassie Maddox gets nearly killed in that undercover operation and has to kill the one who menaces her who has committed no crime but he was the authority (the chief or the bully of the band) of the five young people and he could not accept his authority to be questioned by Cassie Maddow, once she had been revealed not to be Lexie, as she pretended, and he could have turned criminal because of that. The result is that he turned dead.<br/><br/>In this vision, there is absolutely no hope. This society is doomed to lying, killing, bullying, covering up, dissimulating, etc., and the list would be two or three pages of a simple thesaurus with words that all mean the truth is never told or permitted to come out.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU", "rating": 9, "helpful": "19 out of 22 found this helpful.", "date": "15 May 2020"}, {"title": " A decent, atmospheric adaptation", "content": "I really do not understand the negative reviews here.

It has more daring portrayals and deeper situations too, with the Kyle's young son taking drugs and also impregnating his girlfriend throughout the series of the show.<br/><br/>The key thing that works here is the cast, much in the same way they did in Cosby.

Kids in these shows can often not have much charisma or can deliver lines well, but she does it excellently. The one that really makes me laugh though is the young genius and future husband of Kady, Franklin played by Noah Gray-Cabey. Every line he is given is superb, because generally he is given lines to say that you would never hear from someone that young. He's also the maestro pianist who serenades his girl with concerto pieces. The trademark line `Anyhoo!' is a gift for the audience that Franklin must utter at least once an episode. It's all funny stuff and lots of running jokes such as the ever more imaginative deliveries of the words `yes' and `no' with dances and palpitations resulting in an answer to a request from the kids.

The show, while if often rollercoasters from over the top buffoonery to being corny walks the line enough to keep it as a show that you can see Damon Wayans be comfortable in his own skin on the set (especially since the main writers, directors and consultants were ALL members of the Wayans family) AND in his character. Once everyone had been on the show for a while, they worked to everyone in the casts strengths and were able to make a consistently funny show on the air.<br/><br/>However, there is TOO MUCH buffoonery, too many over the top antics, and oftentimes too much chaos happening in the life of the Kyle family. They made Junior TOO STUPID, they also made the eldest daughter an attractive, clumsy idiot from time to time and the youngest daughter wasn't even spared by the writers. I feel they jumped the shark and signed the shows death warrant when Junior got his girlfriend pregnant, she moved in and he married her and her parents were introduced (Junior's wife's father's character makes me WINCE just thinking about him). The show remained funny...but it was a UPN show on ABC if that makes any sense to the reader.<br/><br/>The reruns are funny enough, but I'm relieved it's over...there was nowhere left to go with it.

An ABC mid-season replacement, \"Kids\" felt like a refreshing and real family sitcom without the obnoxious strains to be \"edgy\" or a slavish following of the man-child husband, nagging wife, cute kids formula that runs most CBS comedies. It was an unlikely star-vehicle turn for \"In Living Color\" alumni Damon Wayans.<br/><br/>Wayans constructs the show as a living homage to \"The Cosby Show\": a happy affluent African-American family with a father who spends most of his time at home, a strict but game wife, a dim-bulb son and adorable little daughter. Tisha Cambell-Martin (Janet) plays Michael (Wayans) Kyle's wife as a partner in his adventures instead of a constant adversary. The new Theo is George O. Gordon as Junior, the butt of constant jokes about the size of his head from dad, the new Rudy is the a quintessentially scene-stealing Parker McKenna Posey. \"The Cosby Show\" is highly regarded for a positive portrayal of its characters in the 80s when TV was seen as going down the moral tubes. \"Kids\" benefits from a similar swing of the pendulum and got some deserved praise for its ability to resist being smarmy in a sea of garbage.<br/><br/>But as the show wore on, Wayans' scatological impulses begin to overtake him. It starts with season 2's \"Table for Too Many\", a one-hour juggernaut where Wayans faces off with Larry Miller at a Benihana-type restaurant and the \"pee pee\" jokes begin to fly. A few seasons later, \"Wife\" makes a spectacular and unexpected leap off the ramp and over the shark when Junior actually impregnates a girl and we're supposed to believe that a character played to us as nearly mentally retarded is becoming husband and father material.<br/><br/>From season 2 forward the show gets lazier and lazier. The show is charming and pleasant enough \u0096 and would have been a perfect fit for all the conservative crusaders who want all TV to be about nice, happy people who nothing happens too but the show begins to stock itself more routinely with sex jokes that are less clever and less implicit. As when applied to any family sitcom, it's a little creepy.<br/><br/>I like that the show doesn't try to gross us out; it doesn't try to be edgy or contemporary (though there is a memorably clever \"A Beautiful Mind\" homage re-casting Junior in the John Nash role). Not to mention, the show has the benefit of truly wretched ABC family comedies like \"Full House\" and \"Family Matters\" still in our memories to make it look better. Wayans does everything he can with what he has and within the limits of the genre (as well as his own self-imposed constraints) and gets a few good laughs along the way, but he alone can't keep the show afloat.

You can still tell a good story with mediocre visuals. For example, Bojack Horseman has ugly animation, and yet it's one of the best cartoons of the 2010s, and one of the most acclaimed and successful at that. Even ignoring the designs, the animation itself is pretty fluid.<br/><br/>Speaking of the character designs, let's talk about the characters themselves. They're stereotypical, but they have a lot of charm to them (much like the characters in \"The Loud House\"). Wayne is probably one of the best ones - he knows he can't live up to his girlfriend's former husband, and yet still tries his best to be a good father figure to Violet.

Also, Jesus is shown to give good advice to Jenny, so he also has some positive traits.

They both had interesting concepts, good characters and could have gone somewhere. Yet, as happened with EFC, the seasons got progressively worse until finally ending up as a joke, the likes of which you might expect to come from the SciFi Channel in the post-2003 era.<br/><br/>Andromeda's best seasons were 1 and 2. The plots surrounded the overall concept which was an idealistic captain from an idyllic fallen civilization seeking to restore an order to the fractured systems across 3 galaxies. It was evocative of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire as the Dark Ages set in.<br/><br/>In season 3, the series lost its aim. There were still interesting plots but the overall aim of a lone captain in a powerful ship on a lone quest to restore the Commonwealth had been lost. While not as good as seasons 1 &amp; 2 by any means, season 3 is still watchable.<br/><br/>It's at the end of season 3 when the series took a notable nose dive. Season 3 ended with a cliffhanger which made you think everything had changed; yet when season 4 began it was clear the only thing which had changed was that everything became less logical and the writing noticeably worse. I have to wonder if there was a major change in management and writing talent at this point. In season 4 things foundered and it was not the Andromeda of before.<br/><br/>Season 5 became a joke. The end of season 4 obviously set up a \"reset\" for the entire series but instead it appears in season 5 they ignored this set-up and created a scenario hardly worthy of Andromeda. Instead of roaming 3 galaxies trying to establish a grand civilization, the crew, which inexplicably survived clearly being killed, is now trapped by an absurd force in a single solar system plagued with ailments while Andromeda sits crippled. Season 4 was a disappointment but season 5 was so far removed from the original series that it only served as the butt of jokes from former fans.<br/><br/>All in all, Andromeda serves as an example that you should know when to end your show before it becomes pitiful.

Wolfe took his experience from shows such as Star Trek: Deep Space Night and invested it in Andromeda, bringing life to intricate plot-lines and vibrant characters functioning in a realized Universe.<br/><br/>As Season 2 began to move along, the usual first season clumsiness that one expects from new TV shows had totally dissolved and an epic plot line was beginning to come to life.<br/><br/>This was tragically cut short when Wolfe was fired. After this unfortunate event, nearly all of his work was thrown out of the window as the series took an entirely different direction in favour of mainstream approval and a more episodic format. The most painful example of the latter is embodied in the decision to do away with the character of Trance in favour of a new incarnation of the character designed to be sexy.<br/><br/>The series began to spiral downwards even more, until it was finally too difficult to watch.

Acting is average, but special f/x are top notch (and they stay that way through all seasons). Season One had it's ups and downs, but the characters fleshed out nicely, even though many stories appear to disregard logic or anything resembling realism. On the whole, though, I felt season one was a winner.<br/><br/>However, with the beginning of Season Two, the show began to break down. More and more shows appeared to be simply a vehicle for Kevin Sorbo (playing Captain Dylan Hunt) showing off his selfless heroism. By Season Three the show had become confused, disjointed, and lacking any shreds of logic. Routinely, Andromeda's crew of (apparently) six take out an army of Killer Aliens, find a single missing person on a large planet within seconds (while other people have looked for them for ages), infiltrate, and fight their way back out of, a garrison, etc. After a while, it becomes too difficult to suspend disbelief. But worst of all is that, at the beginning of Season Four, the writers appear to have abandoned all hope of delivering a single, coherent, and believable story. Season Four does not contain one single interesting or well written story. Watch in awe as five people manage to stand in the right place along a 36 by 8 mile long arc-ship to fend off invaders that should board everywhere. Try not to groan when a signal is sent through space (and travels faster than light) by way of ultrasonic burst (which, as everyone knows, travels by speed of sound, and can't cross vacuum). Try to comprehend how two races that have battled each other for 'countless generations' managed to do so without any mixed children (even though they do mix in everyday tasks). Then bow to the wisdom of the captain who, while dying from debilitating fever, manages to deduct that the cure for his fever is mixing the two bloods. He finds a cure for which the people have searched for generations themselves. And key to his finding is some corny video footage from the library. And on, and on, and on.

Thus, my take on the series might be different from someone who had the show's rhythm broken by advertising - talk about taking one out of the moment. I really wanted to like this show from the beginning, mostly because of its origins with Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. I strongly disliked actor Kevin Sorbo's previous show \"HERCULES\" (except for the rare appearance by the brilliant Bruce Campbell), but was willing to give his new show a try anyway. After 4 seasons (season 5 is still airing and not available on DVD as of this writing), here's my take on ANDROMEDA: This might be as clear of a case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde writing as I can remember in a TV series. There have been episodes that stand up with the best of sci-fi television writing (the original \"TWILIGHT ZONE\", \"City on the Edge of Forever\" episode of \"STAR TREK\", \"The Inheritors\" episode of \"THE OUTER LIMITS\", etc.). The two-part episode that ended season 4 was probably the best thing I've seen from TV since \"TAKEN\", the Spielberg mini-series.<br/><br/>But when ANDROMEDA is bad, it's really bad. I've never been a fan of \"BUCK ROGERS IN THE 25TH CENTURY\", and some of ANDROMEDA's shows must be compared to the very worst of \"BUCK ROGERS\". Unfortunately, it's not like there's a good season or a bad one. It's, as my summary states, a roll of the dice. This 50/50 result of script writing (and I really must put the blame there) is in some part due to the pace that TV writers must produce these days. But there's the rare quality TV show out there to make the case that it can be done. I won't blame the actors, because when the writing is good, they're all fine - even impressive at times.<br/><br/>I think the issue with ANDROMEDA is a lack of clear cut identity. Is it a light space romp with plenty of humor? Is it a serious take on a potentially exciting premise? Is it experimental? Is it space opera? Unfortunately, the answer is 'All of the Above'. Beyond this, it's hard to define just why the show is sometimes terrific and other times pathetic. The one thread that I found had to do with the character Trance Gemini. It seemed when the show centered on her, it was usually better than when it didn't. But even that is not always the case.<br/><br/>So my recommendation for viewing ANDROMEDA is this: If you like your sci-fi goofy, this might work for you. If you're really hardcore sci-fi, it also might be worth sifting through the episodes on DVD. As I said, when it's good, it's hard to beat. For special effects junkies, Season 4 has some stellar (excuse the pun) and stylistically unique CGI work, some of the best I've seen on TV.

The cast is, on the whole, quite good.  Kevin Sorbo is the solid core (typical) central character one expects in this type of story, but the other characters are generally original and well-played.  I especially like Harper and Beka, who manage to be fresh and compelling without being so iconoclastic as to distract the viewer from the plot.  I also like that Rommie is not only an AI \"learning to be human\" but is also The Ship.<br/><br/>2. Backstory and plot are as interesting as any sci-fi franchise on television.  The tale of Dylan's having been \"stuck in a singularity\" for 300 years, while scientifically suspect, makes a good yarn.<br/><br/>3. Effects and art direction are up to the best modern syndie TV can offer: benefitting from the advances in computer tech while likewise suffering from the vague sense of unreality it creates.<br/><br/>Where Andromeda falls short:<br/><br/>1. As the biggest \"power that be,\" Sorbo has a slight tendency to overstress his character's importance.  Dylan is, of course, the most important character, but as a fairly stereotyped \"strong, silent captain,\" he's far from the most interesting character.  The other characters should not only be allowed to carry some episodes, they should also be allowed to \"be the hero\" in more stories, even when Dylan is also featured.  No captain, no matter how heroic, is always right.<br/><br/>2. Individual episodes are hit-and-miss.  Not only are occasional episodes not much fun to watch, they don't even have much to do with the ongoing story.  While I recognize that we can't get a barnburner every week, we do need *some* reason to tune in, whether it's humor or romance or whatever.<br/><br/>3. Not every unique touch has played out:  Rev Bem was interesting in conception but not really in execution.  I don't fault Brent Stait; I just think a Magog monk was compelling for about a week tops.  I don't really mind that he was written out (for whatever reason).  Another character who has failed to reach critical mass:  Tyr.  KHC is a good actor and undeniably an impressive physical specimen, but as the seasons have gone by, Tyr has never really developed much beyond a surly, untrustworthy bore.  I think the problem lies largely with the concept of Nietzscheans in general; to make him more interesting, they would necessarily undermine the underpinnings of the character--it's a catch-22.  I'm also underwhelmed by the \"new Trance.\" The character as originally played was enigmatic and sweet; now she's just confusing.<br/><br/>4. Season 3 already misses the \"rebuilding the Commonwealth\" story thread. While the stories this year have been interesting, the show lacks dramatic impetus.  Now that they're not concentrating on preparing for the Magog invasion or on strengthening the Commonwealth, they seem to be floundering around a bit.  The plot lacks direction.<br/><br/>All told, I like Andromeda as much as anything on right now.  But I can't help but feel it's not living up to potential.  I'm afraid they may be trying to please a focus group rather than trying to make compelling television.", "rating": null, "helpful": "89 out of 115 found this helpful.", "date": "1 December 2002"}, {"title": " Could have been SO much better", "content": "After series finale I have been left with completely mixed emotions and had to wait for a very long time to come to a complete summary of the series.

Our protagonist is Dylan Hunt, captain of the ship Andromeda Ascendant and his world is about to be turned upside down. A group of genetically modified humans, known as the Nietzscheans, betray the Commonwealth; this includes Dylan's close friend and second-in-command. As the fight rages Andromeda is caught on the event horizon of a black hole. Here Dylan is locked in time till a salvage crew pulls the ship out. Three hundred years have passed and a lot has changed; the Commonwealth is long gone, the Nietzscheans are divided but still oppressing people and a species known as the Magog are literally preying on people.<br/><br/>After initial events Dylan takes the salvagers, pilot Beka Valentine; engineer Seamus Harper; Rev Bem, a Magog who has renounced violence; Tyr Anasazi, a Nietzschean with uncertain motives; and finally the enigmatic Trance Gemini, a purple alien of an unknown species. They are soon joined by 'Rommie' the ships android avatar, built by Harper. Over the course of the series they face various dilemmas as Dylan works to re-establish the System's Commonwealth. Some of these will be single episode problems others will be long running plot arcs. We also get some crew changes as the seasons progress.<br/><br/>This series, from an idea by Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, starts of really well as it introduces an interesting group of characters. Dylan is perhaps too much of a 'Captain Perfect' character at times but the others are more interesting; notably Tyr, thanks to his moral ambiguity, and the mysterious Trance. We get plenty of action in just about every episode; this can include space battles, shootouts and physical fights. There is also a good amount of humour. While I still enjoyed later seasons I don't think they were quite as good as the early ones; the plot gets a bit messy at times; the final season, where the crew are trapped in a single star system almost feels like a different series at times. The special effects are pretty good and the cast does a fine job bringing their characters to life.

They had lost the original purpose from Season 1 and the redoubled anxiety we saw in Season 2.  Now, in Season 3, they seemed aimless and downright pointless in many ways.  The role of the Andromeda in the new Commonwealth was absurd and not completely clear.  Most importantly the goals of the first 2 seasons seemed utterly ignored.  They weren't even engaging in missions to build and strengthen the new Commonwealth as you might expect; instead they were puppets, albeit rebellious puppets, of naive political powers.<br/><br/>The only element which remained somewhat intact in Season 3 were the characters.  Yet even then, one could not see them in their new roles. Would Dylan not say \"hell with this, we have things to do\"?<br/><br/>The end of Season 3 was such that it looks like it might mark the end of any worthiness to the show we once knew as Andromeda.  One got the feeling the writers didn't like the show they'd created so they just pointlessly smashed it all.  They had a monumental event handled in such a poor and pointless why that it left the viewer saying \"why did they do THAT\"?  It seemed like a cheap and senseless way of saying \"OK, we producers have changed our minds so we came up with the quickest, most pointless way to change almost everything without having to waste more than an episode doing it\".  We're not talking about a sudden and shocking plot twist like you might see in the best of shows.  There was no sense of PURPOSE to this one.  No promise of a PAYOFF for having changed the rules.  No - rather it smelled of taking an eraser to the script and aimlessly wiping out huge elements.<br/><br/>While I can recommend the first two seasons of Andromeda to most SciFi fans because they appealed to many people on many different levels, I cannot recommend Season 3 or beyond to anyone who appreciates intelligent or well done writing.

That seems fitting, everyone likes different things.<br/><br/>For me, Andromeda is the type of show I wished had gotten better funding and had a chance to follow its arc with better precision. Some found season 4 the best, I found it the worst, in character development, plot and even writing. True, the CGI was better, but that never ever makes up for bad plots or writing in my book...without a good story, everything sucks. You can forgive a lot of bad makeup or silly sets, when you have great writing and characters. Those who are fans of Dr. Who or Blake's Seven or even Red Dwarf would understand. In fact, those who are fans of the original StarTrek, the one about ethical issues mixed with characters in an adventure setting, will understand.<br/><br/>I think Andromeda was truer to the old Star Trek than anything since ST's time. In fact, I'm one of those who was tremendously disappointed with Next Generation and all its spin offs, except for the 1st season of Enterprise and the last season (NOT including the stupid clich\u00e9 season finale.) The first couple seasons of Farscape were good, then it got overly dark and clich\u00e9, same with Babylon 5, except there I put the blame squarely on JMS.<br/><br/>I even found that with Andromeda's faults, the characters grew on you (but not necessarily if you didn't see the series from the beginning... because the backstory was so important to each and every episode...building on the other to some extent.) Even story lines I've heard others say had no meaning, or too tangential, were often fun and I, personally, did see connections with the arc...whether the Abyss is attacking through the WorldShip or through influencing another universe to attack through a vortex, it is the same arc...just adding complexity. In fact, this show's arc was exceptionally complex and intertwined, in mini-arcs, character development, subplots, everything...it even was asking questions that are not PC, like mixing God and Demon, good and evil, multi-universes, Promethean like beings giving fire to mortals yet possibly being condemned as demons...god like entities that seek destruction as a way to harmony, hating life, because life is complex and chaotic and full of suffering...even the idea that an philosophy generated in our time (Nietzche) could end up causing a new kind of bigotry and genocide between human variants in the future. Nazism, Stalinism, human control, slavery...a great writer once said that basic human stories never changed, just the people and the variations in how the tale is told.<br/><br/>It's a lot to spin into a tale and I preferred those stories, whether it be as simple and fun as Fear and Loathing in the Milky Way to as complex as the idea of an entity developing that hates life, not in the clich\u00e9 villain way, but because it wants an end to chaos and sees nothingness as harmony. You can do adventure and fun and still ask serious questions, more often you expect that from good science fiction writing, usually getting that from books...it's hard to do a TV/film show that can get those issues in because of the great complexity and the likelihood you will offend someone...and even more sadly it seems lately, it's harder getting viewers that appreciate it rather than those that seem to want just CGI, creepy costumes and boring, wooden scientific speaking characters.<br/><br/>I also simply like the series because the characters don't walk around like valium-drugged-into-calmness zombies (Next Generation, et al) nor do they all speak techno-babble or all act like scientists. Here, the way is pretty much the way you'd expect people in the future to be...they don't speak about technologists or scientists, they simply accept the tech as normal and concentrate on normal daily activities..and reacting to odd things the way we might with \"OK, this is weird...\" or \"I'm not a science ship, I'm a warship. I'm good at blowing things up.\" The humor is often because they are acting the way you or I might act, not calmly, with normal speech and with normal human-alien reactions.<br/><br/>Things I miss: tying things together better, like the connections between the Vortex warriors as a different front of attack than the Magog, the tesselation/phaseshifting hunters that came after Harper twice and were suddenly never seen again, the idea that genius brains were being stolen and that they were also tied in with the Engine of Creation thread being dropped, the Angels bell thread, the other avators like Trance suddenly not showing up anymore with conflicting ways of dealing with the Abyss, and so on.<br/><br/>I know season 4 and 5 could have been a lot better...4 if they had done some better writing and more consistently even at the loss of some special effects and dropped the paradigm stupidity...and 5 if they had more money, so didn't spend every show in Sefra...the stories seemed a bit better and consistent, I think, but the scenery and situation just stayed depressing/boring...without the general fun and humor that had kept the characters from killing each other.<br/><br/>And yes, I think the science on Andromeda was better thought out than on other shows, and the timeline/history...with the exception of how to rescue a ship caught on the event horizon of a black hole of course... but hey, no show is perfect on tech.

Most of the episodes varied from season one to five and gave nothing away about what the show was about, but I was curious and did some research on the internet and what I found I liked and I wanted to see the entire show. In January of this year(2008), I placed an order for the entire series on DVD \u0096 worth every penny I spent, great value and a treasure worth keeping!!

I believe Andromeda deserves a Perfect Ten rating for great original and interesting story by the writers, great set production and inspirational artistic direction from prop master, wardrobe design and make-up to directors for editing, photography, engineering and special effects, great imagination and artistic talent from the entire cast of actors who work extremely hard at making each character more interesting and identifiable and smart planning and management from all the executives for making it a great quality production show.<br/><br/>Andromeda has a cast of six characters, all of them individually different. They all come from a different culture and race, they all have secrets to hide, making them all intriguing and fun to know.<br/><br/>Each individual character is far from perfect. Each of them has flaws and weaknesses, each one of them left someone behind and each character has a story to tell and someone to love and if you give it time throughout each season you will get to know them fairly well and share some of their individual adventures. With each season the adventures get bolder and more fun and exciting to watch.<br/><br/>The Andromeda story offers hope where there are few, friends and family to relate to in the best and worst of times. Their friendship holds the story together from season to season. Having the DVD series it's not hard to see just how good the friendship genuinely becomes and how hard all the actors work at making their characters as strong, as fun and as enjoyable and their individual talent brings them closer to the audience and strengthens the show as each season passes on.<br/><br/>Each season was a winner from one to five. Each season is a page-turner like every great book I've ever read, it's hard to put it aside. All the cliffhanger episodes for each season make me thankful that I don't have long to wait.<br/><br/>Andromeda delivers!! When I first began on this journey watching the series on DVD without any of its publicity, I never felt let down in any of the episodes in any of its seasons. I love them all.

This was especially true of the quirky, sarcastic Artificial Intelligence played impeccably by Lexa Doig, and the character of Tyr Anasazi, who remains to this day a unique and indelible merger of the anti-hero and the warrior poet.<br/><br/>The narrative that began to spin itself around these characters was layered and multifaceted, providing the audience with both the simplicity of episodic television as well as ever more depth and mystery to unpack, both concerning the characters themselves and the events that were beginning to take shape around them. By the second season, it really felt as though Andromeda was going to be the first truly great example of the still-new format of novelized television in science fiction, with a broad, sweeping narrative unfolding across multiple seasons.<br/><br/>And then the network decided that this approach made the show too inaccessible, contemptuously underestimating the intelligence of their own audience in the process, and demanded a return to a more episodic format. In protest, Robert Hewitt Wolfe left the project, and all of the careful, methodical work he had done to craft his grand narrative was scrapped.<br/><br/>To this day, I believe this could have been one of the greatest science fiction stories ever told on television, easily on a level with Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek at its best.

The space vehicle called Andromeda is not very great looking, and the different forms of technology that comprise the Universe of Andromeda are fuzzy and not really talked about by the shows characters.

The show takes a satirical low-stakes premise and manages to make it genuinely suspenseful and funny, as well as very poignant towards the end of the season. The show blends this style with elements of found footage films, finding the best aspects of both and managing to never get stale.<br/><br/>For a show with a mostly junior cast that essentially lives and dies by the believability of its performances, American Vandal's actors were all surprisingly capable and felt like real people. Jimmy Tatro was great; if you've followed his YouTube channels, you won't see much you haven't already seen him do, but he's very talented and he was definitely perfect for the role. The other leads were great as well, and I can't think of too many weak links in even the supporting cast. It's rare to see TV shows paint an accurate picture of modern high school kids across different stereotypes (and make any attempt to deconstruct those stereotypes), but this felt about as close as I've seen one get.<br/><br/>Plus, the writing is engaging and keeps you guessing throughout, such that you won't be certain where the plot is going until the very end. Certain details will appear in the first few episodes that don't get elaborated upon until several episodes later, and it makes the show very rewarding upon re-watches for viewers paying attention. For a show that would have done just fine as a fun romp satirizing the true crime genre, American Vandal actually goes the extra mile to make itself more enjoyable.<br/><br/>If you were even moderately interested based on the trailer, absolutely give American Vandal a binge.

This one is different because the subject matter is very serious, a person's future is on the line at a very young age, there is really only one funny person, and he is the one in trouble--for being funny. This mockumentary gains its humor not from gags or jokes, or from ridiculous characters, but from the juxtaposition of a very serious true crime investigation, within an Southern California American High school where the social culture of the kids is portrayed in much more realistic way than is typically shown on TV or Movies. Which almost always show High School life in ways that are not like High School at all. That's because they almost always use unrealistic hackneyed tropes instead of trying to be realistic. <br/><br/>Here they try to be realistic, and succeed. Which means lots of hedonistic behavior involving openly used drugs and casual sexuality mixed in with typical High School caste consciousness and other realistic views of modern SoCal High High School life. But without going over the top in any of these areas which is what happens often in certain types of movies that try to portray High School life in a hedonistic way, where they usually always end up too unrealistic because of going way over the top and making them ultra-hedonistic beyond average. This show wisely avoids that pitfall. Throw into the mix a High School version of Bart Simpson as a stoner as your protagonist, and you have a recipe for great viewing. Of course without a Bart Simpson type as the creator it wouldn't work as brilliantly as it does. It is unlike anything ever seen on TV or Film, and I think a must see. <br/><br/>I can see many people really hating this because it is not being judgmental over the hedonism by High School age kids, which I imagine is the real reason behind the attacks on the show by some reviewers since it is so well made. This is not something for prudes or people who think kids need to be brought up without exposing them to certain ideas about sex, drugs, and so on. That reaction by many plays perfectly into the humor of the series which takes its cue from real types of High School age kids instead of the commonly artificial and false portrayal of American youth on TV and movies. The uncanny \"life imitates art\" aspect of the story that is sure to occur in response to this show makes it even funnier because in fact the criminal act that is the basis for the story, is in reality a symbol for the series itself and the reaction that is sure to follow. It will be judged accordingly in the way the criminal in the story is judged. And as predicted kids will love it while many older people will find it embarrassing and juvenile or even immoral and bad.

We were eager to know whether the show is as good as the trailer. American Vandal is a mockumentary which revolves around the vandalising of 27 cars by Dylan Maxwell - a notorious prankster of Hanover High school, who gets expelled for being charged guilty of the crime. Whether he committed the crime or not forms the crux of the story. I can't think of a single mockumentary which I have not ended up liking. The first episode as expected was hilarious. But what we were sceptical of, was whether there was enough juice to last 8 episodes. We are glad to find out that there wasn't a single episode which bored us or felt stretched. The show is a good satire of the 'True Crime' type of shows, which have gained a lot of prominence recently. The plots &amp; sub plots are hilarious.

Though many shows at times employ slapstick, \"Mr. Bean\" is very different from the majority of these shows and their characters. The most glaring contrast is between what constitutes as humor in \"The Simpsons\" and \"Mr. Bean\". \"The Simpsons\" can sometime present gory themes in an offhanded way (eg, Itchy &amp; Scratchy), making ethically questionable images and situations funny to the audience. The humor in part lies in the blase way in which the characters treat something like murder, torture, etc. However, I don't find that very enjoyable. That is why I applaud Rowan Atkinson for proving that slapstick humor can still be funny without turning murder and torture into light-hearted entertainment. Mr. Bean maintains an innocence that, for me, is a welcomed relief from the harshness of the TV landscape in general. From reality TV shows where participants backstab each other for money to shows like \"South Park\" and \"The Simpsons\" that fuel their comedy with questionable material, TV land can be a harsh place thesedays.<br/><br/>Many people may feel that Mr. Bean is childish and foolish, but his is by far a gentler character than many you would meet on TV nowadays. I don't wax nostalgic for shows like \"Leave It to Beaver\" or any of those black and white TV shows where everyone is super cheery and pretend death and homosexuality don't exist.

What started as a time-filling sketch, it is quite an elevation considering what this character; more than the series, has achieved. Rowan Atkinson, the actor and more or less the creator of this global phenomenon, has previously worked in similar arenas in stages, miming, what basically could be considered as a stand up, his appearances have always been about the performance more than the content. And with a physical language that bars no boundaries, this global outreach actually comes with a never-ending clause. Primarily, to Atkinson. Since he could always claim his throne and the blames could easily be passed upon. But filtering or criticizing themselves, the creators have only shot definite amount of these sketchy scenes, in order to maintain the quality. And so pure the material is, that even after decades later, it hasn't gotten rusty yet. And it presumably never will. Since none of these scenarios seem effortful or tedious to the audience, the depicted gags are actually a part of a common man's routine in his day-to-day life. And looking at those activities with an eye of an anarchistic 9 year old boy, Atkinson has managed to embed his name among pioneers like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. But even something sensational as such, comes with few flaws. Lopping off the editing and execution of this series, the shift of these chapters into one typical sitcom can easily be seen. Running out of ideas and occasionally compromising to the commercial aspect of the fame (Christmas episode), the series loses the subtlety for a brief period. When the neck starts going towards the noose rather than the other way around, that is when Mr. Bean grows simpleton, in a sense that it relies upon nothing but the performer and its inspiringly absurd performance.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "40 out of 46 found this helpful.", "date": "14 March 2020"}, {"title": " Great humour and a grand step away from all the crassness and vulgarity of modern humour", "content": "STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Mr Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is in this world, but not of this world. His mind simply doesn't seem to comprehend things the way an average person would and his life is one long disaster because of this, getting himself into constant mishaps and far out, zany situations, which he is left to sort out on his own as he doesn't seem to mix with anyone and he rarely speaks. But he never gives up and, despite the simplest of tasks being a constant struggle for him, applying his own zany methods of solving the problem always pays off for him in the end.<br/><br/>To look at the sorry state of modern British humour, with all it's focus of sex and general vulgarity, you'd be forgiven for forgetting that a show like Mr Bean was made at one time. There's nothing unsuitable going on here, just good, clean U rated humour of the type Tommy Cooper and the like made in the 50s. And I find it just as laugh out loud funny now in my early 20s as I did when I was a young boy in the early 90s.<br/><br/>Although I can look at it a little deeper now and see there must be more to this character than than meets the eye. There must be a reason why he does things the way he does and things seem to keep going wrong for him. As others have noted, it looks like he may have a type of autism. In fact I'm so convinced about it that I really think were a professional psychologist to analyse him, I think Mr Bean could be the first famous, fictional character to be diagnosed with something like Asperger's Syndrome.<br/><br/>If you'd like to see some truly hilarious British humour at it's very best before it all became obsessed with sex and vulgarity, then this would come highly recommended. Shows like Little Britain do work because it's well realised but it's really just as vulgar as the rest.

I certainly wasn't much of a fan at the time, and didn't see too many episodes. I didn't really get into the show until my late teens, just a few years ago, which was when I finally watched every episode. Unlike before, it made me laugh many times, and since then, that has always been the case during repeat viewings of episodes! <br/><br/>Mr. Bean is a mysterious, self-centred, antisocial, extremely naive buffoon whose best friend is his Teddy! He is pretty much isolated from society, and life is not easy for him, as he constantly struggles with very simple things! This is because he lacks some fairly basic knowledge, and has the mind of a child. He finds himself in various kinds of trouble wherever he goes, and comes up with very bizarre ways to try and solve the problems he faces! Not only does he often cause trouble for himself, but sometimes for other people as well, which he often doesn't tend to realize! In other words, Mr. Bean is a walking disaster! <br/><br/>The humour in this show is very visual, and there is very little dialogue. The gags are almost always sight gags, which is mostly what the show is about. While there may be an occasional lacklustre gag, I would say the vast majority of them are funny, often hilarious, (there are so many highlights)! While \"Mr. Bean\" is certainly not the most sophisticated comedy ever made, it's still great for many of those who like visual humour, and due to the very limited dialogue, you don't even have to speak fluent English to enjoy the show, which is why it has received such a world-wide reputation!

The title character (Rowan Atkinson) is a perfectly ordinary man who either never seems to do anything right, or always finds the hardest and most inefficient way to do it. Rarely speaking, he gets himself into all sorts of wacky situations.<br/><br/>One of the funniest predicaments was at a hotel. Mr. Bean was following a man in the restaurant, taking twice as much as the other man. Sitting down at a table, Mr. Bean began wolfing everything down, only to learn that the food had gone bad. Feeling ill, he goes back to his room and falls asleep. He wakes up a few hours later and accidentally locks himself out of his room. Now he has to wander around the hotel naked.<br/><br/>Actually, he ends up naked a lot, and usually there are other people around. But the point is, Mr. Bean is completely cracked. Whether going swimming, trying to tend to a baby, going to the beach, or hosting a New Year's party, he always manages to do everything in a way that most people would never imagine, and most often ends up embarrassing himself.<br/><br/>As the British say, smashing.", "rating": null, "helpful": "55 out of 67 found this helpful.", "date": "12 June 2005"}, {"title": " CANNOT STOP LAUGHING WHEN WATCHING THIS SERIES", "content": "Mr. Bean is funny purely and simply because he is a total buffoon.

Superbly played by comedian Rowan Atkinson, Mr. Bean takes us into the doldrums of day to day life to show us that even the smallest gesture can be the funniest. He whirlwinds us through England in the most unconventional way, either in his sporty yellow car (with lock), or in his dentist office, or his doctor's office, or around the countryside stopping at several childish playgrounds. No matter where he takes you, the laughs are sure to follow and remain with you for a very long time.<br/><br/>Atkinson has mastered the ability to bring this verbally challenged character to life in ways that comedians today falter. Atkinson weaves this richly developed character into simple settings where he transforms into part social satirist and part MacGyver of the common man. His ability to take any common item and transform it into a new bit of comedy is rare today. The fact that you never knew what Mr. Bean was going to grab next on the set always allowed endless moments of joy. Now, I can watch him over and over again thanks to A&amp;E and the power of DVD. Released as a set, I can see Mr. Bean morning, evening, and late afternoon whenever I have the urge to laugh at life.<br/><br/>This series is enjoyable for the newest Bean follower to even those of us that have been following him around for years. While some novice viewers may be disappointed to see the cuts that A&amp;E made to some of the episodes, the packaging and supplemental features should suffice. It is packed full of fun information about Bean, especially a very informative feature on how Bean was created by Atkinson himself. It also allows us to see some of Comic Relief UK that showcased the talent of Mr. Bean right next to Alan Cummings himself. The extras are just more icing on an already sugar-packed cake.<br/><br/>Overall, this collection is amazing. I love Mr. Bean and the style of humor that he brings to each episode and situation. He is funny without being crass or vulgar, allowing us to build so many new dimensions on this simple character. Atkinson is a master in his trade and has created a character that will be remembered for years to come. So, if you are a fan of slapstick humor with intellectual stimulation, than Mr. Bean is right up your alley. The set is not expensive, so I say go ahead and splurge on a DVD that you will never regret purchasing. You are definitely in for a hysterical treat!

And, importantly, this makes the show amazingly easy to export abroad. It's so amazing how the show is able to make you laugh even without the use of much language--just wacky situations and terrific pantomime by Atkinson.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that if you don't like this show, you are either dead or have absolutely no sense of humor!

It's a testament to the talent of Rowan Atkinson that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality - without hardly ever speaking a word. The whole success of the program rests on Atkinson's shoulders, but he carries it with ease. Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season, anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubber-faced social 'tard, so great is the talent and effort put into the performance. At times exasperating, at times lovable, Mr Bean is an innocent, unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate. The brilliance of this character cannot be put into words, you have to see for yourself.<br/><br/>The show gets almost too depressing at times, like in the infamous New Year's Eve sketch, or when Bean celebrates his birthday by going alone to a restaurant, offering himself a congratulatory card signed by himself, and being served a stake he doesn't quite fancy. Still, there are times when you can't help but feel impressed by the inventive methods by which Bean gets himself out of trouble, like when he disposes of said stake in numerous clever-ish ways, or when he changes into swimming trunks without taking his trousers off first! Whatever your reaction to Bean and his unorthodox lifestyle, you're bound to throw fits of laughter while watching. <br/><br/>Finally, I'd like to point out that although \"Bean\" is classified as a program for children, it is just as enjoyable for any grown-up with a sense of humour. Because the more \"adult\" jokes will go over the heads of the little ones and the intelligent slapstick (yes, there is such a thing) is funny no matter what age you are, \"Bean\" is the truest definition of a family show.

BEAN is, hands down, the greatest sitcom of the 1990s.<br/><br/>MR. BEAN represents the first major attempt at a throwback to the era of silent greats such as Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton for several decades. It brings to the audience a single character - Mr. Bean - played to perfection by Rowan Atkinson.<br/><br/>Many people who have commented on this page as well as on the message boards on this and other websites have engaged in debates about whether or not Mr. Bean has a mental disability or has significant learning difficulties arising from such a disability. However, I believe this debate is unnecessary because I highly doubt that the creators of this show expected anyone in the audience for a single moment to even consider Mr. Bean in such a context.<br/><br/>Mr. Bean is shown to be a character who seems to have very few friends, rarely speaks and chooses to solve problems by himself with no guidance from others. Some of his methods to approaching day-to-day tasks such as preparing lunch or going to the dentist are approached in a manner bizarre to anyone watching the show. This is where the humour derives from. Mr. Bean is not necessarily someone with a mental disability, he may just be an eccentric person accustomed to dealing with things his own way. And naturally some of his methods to completing a single task often result in disaster, which we then see Mr. Bean try to resolve.<br/><br/>Sometimes, we see Mr. Bean show a mean or petty streak, often trying to compete with those around him or play pranks on those least expecting it. But no real harm comes to anyone at the end of the day and outcomes are always reassuring.<br/><br/>Unlike most examples of British comedy in the past 30 years, MR. BEAN is simple, inoffensive, harmless U-rated entertainment suitable for everyone in the family to enjoy. It is for this reason why the TV series became a big hit in dozens of countries throughout the world. It is also why it will still be remembered in several decades from now when lots of other TV shows will have come, gone and been forgotten.<br/><br/>Some critics claim the show only appeals to children yet I laugh just as much at Mr. Bean's antics now as I did when I first saw the episodes as a kid in the 1990s. Rowan Atkinson has used his natural ability to create effective visual gags that seem just as funny on repeat viewings as they did the first time.<br/><br/>The TV series has to date spawned two spin-off movies, BEAN and MR. BEAN'S HOLIDAY. As one familiar with the type of humour shown in the TV series would expect, it does not translate to success on the big screen. The two movies do little justice to the TV series and fail to truly capture the magic of the episodes. The greatest failing in both movies perhaps resides in the change of setting. In both movies, the producers take Mr. Bean out of his normal British surroundings into America (the first movie) and France (the second movie). As a result, the movie characters around Mr. Bean respond differently to his behaviour than their TV series counterparts. Both movies re-use gags from the TV series, and the evidence shows that the gags were done right the first time. In the second movie, Mr. Bean is shown to be behaving out-of-character with some aspects of his personality exaggerated to the point where some gags seem dumb rather than funny. At various times, I found myself thinking that the character I was watching was not Mr. Bean but a pale caricature. It is clear that Rowan Atkinson was not enjoying himself as much as he did in the TV series. His heart just wasn't in the performance. After the second movie came out, he stated publicly that he would not play Mr. Bean again. I realise how he felt.<br/><br/>Returning to the TV series, each episode shows evidence of meticulous planning in terms of writing and execution in every single scene. Even the weakest episode is still highly enjoyable and well ahead of the two movies.<br/><br/>My favourite episodes are the first three - these set the high standard that was to continue. I consider the final episode to be the weakest but still hilarious nonetheless.<br/><br/>To summarise, MR. BEAN is a truly superb sitcom suitable for all the family. Rowan Atkinson is a true comic genius and the evidence is in the 14 episodes of this TV series. My recommendation - watch and enjoy.

Once in a while you find shows like this which make you scared you might hurt your bowels while laughing too hard cause you can't stop having no control over yourself in moments like this.

I would like especially mention Richard Curtis who was the co-writer on the many of the episodes of the show and went onto time-enduring classics such as Love Actually (Atkinson makes a guest appearance alongside some of the biggest names in the British film industry; It is also another must watch on my list) and About Time (It is really about that and a little bit more about love). I wish I had seen his movies after I started doing these reviews, as my policy is to onl write in about stuff I have seen fairly recently and within a week of having watched it. But if and when I do re-watch Curtis's classics, I will love to write about it. Also, my appreciation goes to Mathilda Ziegler who played Mr Bean's Girlfriend.

There's a lot happening and a lot of mystery around every corner, but it never feels like it's wandering too far into an unknown direction or getting too far ahead of the viewer. It's clear that every scene has a purpose and the writers now exactly where they're going and how they're getting there. So whenever something happens that's a little bit over the viewer's head at that moment, you know that it's going to be explained all the way soon. Everything that happens comes together in the final picture. And the journey to that final picture is one of the most compelling I've ever taken. Each of the thirteen episodes brings a remarkable amount of believable character development that looking back to the first episode after finishing the finale, it seems like I began by watching completely different people.

My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time, and every episode just had me aching for the next one. Genius stuff.<br/><br/>The acting more than deserved all of the immense praise that it received. Glenn Close gives a shatteringly intense performance that is frighteningly commanding. Rose Byrne is perfect as the one character who makes a huge change throughout the first season. She plays this transition from the gullible, naive new attorney to a hardened, revenge-driven women as if she were born to do it. I've loved her as an actress since I first laid eyes on her, but she still managed to impress me in a way I couldn't have imagined. She's never had a role this dark, this adult...gone through so many different levels of maturity and emotion without hesitating for a second. She holds her own against Close, and that is no easy task. We see her go from being a tool in Patty Hewes (Close's character) end game to being an almost mirror image of Hewes herself. Zeljko Ivanek is the cast member who surprised me the most, though. I've seen him in shows before (24, Oz) but he was never given the room to really display his immense talent like he was given in this one. He has a quiet intelligence to him that always drew my attention towards him on screen, and his character probably faces the most tragic journey throughout the first season.

Glenn Close, what can we tell about her? For sure she's ALWAYS mesmerizing and particularly in this show she's frightening terrific. I also agree to think that it's a waste of talent see an actress like her having to work in a TV show, but at the same time a thank god for being able to watch a show like this one casting an actress like her. Rose Byrne is great and a lot convincing, I already knew her for some previous works and she's really talented. Ted Danson worked perfectly as the pathetic Mr. Frobisher and was great to see Tate Donovan working in something interesting again instead of wasting his time in TV shows like The O.C. And the same can be said about the other guest appearances thru the seasons.<br/><br/>During the 5th episode of 1st season, Patty Hewes says to Ellen Parsons to trust no one. The show is ALL about this sentence because everything here is a secret, no one is reliable and nothing is what it seems. All the elements for a good crime/thriller show are there. Some clich\u00e9s exist but they are important for the entertaining. 1st season was a smash delivering all the greatest things that a TV show like this one should have and its finale was something that really did the audience expect the 2nd season enthusiastically. After more than an year of waiting, 2nd season finally had its premiere and it was awesome the new and undefined plot that was presented, but as new episodes were coming things were more confusing than being just an interesting puzzle to a point that audience was not being an active part anymore, trying to discover together with the characters what really happened, but became a passive one being deceived all the time, losing what made 1st season so special. 3rd season was the same thing, maybe the worst one. A bunch of great actors and actresses underused within a weak plot development full of red herrings and horrible conclusions, failing a lot when trying to exceed the 1st season tricky interesting qualities. Both 2nd and 3rd seasons finale were something kinda strange, giving absurd explanations for things that could be far better if explained in a simpler way. Maybe that's why 4th season was far better and a back to form. The formula using flashbacks and flash-forwards was the same, but a simpler main plot was presented and developed without unnecessary obstacles during 10 episodes. Characters in a exact number performed brilliantly by an amazing cast. Hope 5th season (and last one) to keep the tone achieved during 4th season, and maybe a great court fight to give it a great ending.<br/><br/>So, even thinking that 2nd and 3rd seasons failed a lot in a bunch of aspects, I still give the show 9 stars most for its first season and, of course, the performances that, I repeat, are more than just performances, are outstanding performances.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "58 out of 79 found this helpful.", "date": "2 February 2008"}, {"title": " One of if not THE best show on TV right now", "content": "I took notice of this show once it was Emmy nominated in 2008.

Every episode gives you a few clues on the mystery, while still keeping you in the dark of what did happen.

Add to that the fact you can root for both characters, and at the same time! Well what more can one want from this funny and amazingly written gem? I've got to say, I was pleasantly surprised at how well Cuckoo addresses modern families and relationships through comedy. We've come a long way from the classic stigmata of working man, stay at home wife and kids, etc. Well, Cuckoo gives us a pleasant look at one type of modern family environment and relationships, that many either have experienced (first or second hand) or will very likely experience themselves at some point in their journey of life across this modern yet ever changing world.<br/><br/>Before you judge it, give it an episode, or two or many :) Just remember what comedies are for, unwinding and having a laugh at other people and their predicaments.

I'm sure many will relate to it on many different levels.<br/><br/>My idea of comedy?

Inspector Lynley is maybe posh, as The Guardian said, since he is a Lord by birth and practices policework as a profession, one of these few professions a hereditary lord can practice. There are very few.<br/><br/>His assistant is a woman who is quite different from him but the two together are a funny pair more or less always staying within acceptable irregularities according to police ethics. But Lynley is going to the crime with his impulsive belief and conviction, whereas Barbara Havers goes to it with her empathy. When dealing with criminals and psychopaths, empathy is a weak point since the criminals and psychopaths just want this empathy so that they can play on it and manipulate the police, the situation they are in. The last case is typical of that. Two criminals absolutely equal in horror and viciousness and they play differently on the two cops to capture somewhere the empathy or the hostility they need to save their fate, at least if they have any future fate. They seem to think so.<br/><br/>But in all these cases, it looks like some salient features are coming out like the fact many of these cases concern children or teenagers or very young men or women becoming the victims of people older than they are. But in the last two seasons, they seemed to have come to some kind of a dead end. The first paramour of Inspector Lynley moved out of the police after a dramatic accident that killed her baby-to-be. One season later she came back under the name of another actress but to be purely shot dead by some Bosnian woman trying to shoot the man who killed her whole family in Bosnia. So, Lynley had two wives in the series, and in both cases, they ended dead or at least estranged after the death of their unborn child.<br/><br/>There is maybe slightly too much of this family business and maybe not enough of the crime side of the cases. The criminals are too often psychopaths who do not have any depth. They are just psychopaths, and that is the way the cases are dealt with which is the problem. It is always some technical connection between a crime and a criminal, but no real exploration of the motivations. The first wife of Lynley in the series was a profiler but her profiling was very dry, as dry as a fingerprint on a weapon or some DNA on a glass. You could do better than that, even when you are the Earl of Asherton. The empathy side of Barbara Havers is better but it never has the upper hand.<br/><br/>That's OK if you are only looking for some entertainment because the social or cultural depth is rather shallow, gliding over things as if they were hawks and then pouncing onto the prey as if the prey were a juicy piece of running rat or rodent.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU", "rating": 8, "helpful": "0 out of 0 found this helpful.", "date": "7 May 2020"}, {"title": " Better than the books, but loses quality over its run", "content": "I've read a couple of Elizabeth George's Inspector Lynley books and after the second one I gave up: George's style is to get into the heads of everyone, which is fine, but those monologues go on and on and are often not relevant to the plot.

The characters are fleshed out through the action for the most part, and the glimpses into their personal lives are just enough.

Yeah, I know. Sue me. Anyway, I binged all 5 seasons in about a week, so I'm reviewing the entire show, pilot to finale. All my commentary will remain general, so no spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Overall, I have to say I don't think the show is worth watching, even if you're a big fan of one of the actors or some other specific element that went into it.<br/><br/>The show does occasionally have its moments. Once in a while, but generally not more than once a season, there is something to really get excited about, something that will stir some emotion if you're invested in the characters and story. Sadly, none of those moments are quite grand enough to make it worth the grind of reaching them. And it is a grind.<br/><br/>For starters, it's hard to really root for any of the characters. I've seen plenty of shows/movies where you're \"rooting for the bad guy,\" which is sort of the premise this show was going with- a bunch of management consultants whose job it is to trick corporations into paying them ridiculous amounts of money. Okay, no problem there. Except that they're not just bad guys in business. They're constantly backstabbing, back-biting, and generally treating everyone around them (including each other) terribly. And if we weren't supposed to like the characters, that MIGHT be okay. But then we're given all these subplots and interactions that are clearly designed to make us feel for and relate to the characters. And just when you're getting to like them, they turn around and do something horrible again. It's a bit like a very unpleasant roller coaster.<br/><br/>Part of that, the very worst part, are the 'false growth' moments. The show will give you some sequence of events that seems to lead one of the characters to grow and change, and then a couple episodes later (if it even lasts that long) they revert right back to who they were in the pilot. After a while it gets hard to watch the same characters doing the same things without ever growing, learning, or changing.<br/><br/>This is especially pronounced with the \"sidekick\" characters played by Ben Schwartz and Josh Lawson. They're more caricatures than characters, and every time they seem to start turning into real people, the show pulls a 180 and they're right back where they started.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say much about the acting except that I didn't think anyone spoiled it with their performance, but likewise the only one that really impressed me was Glynn Turman, who plays Don Cheadle's character's father and pops up pretty regularly throughout the show without being one of its leads. He steals virtually every scene he's in, but part of that may be that he's the only truly likable character in the show.<br/><br/>House of Lies rarely lacks for unpredictable twists and surprises, but by the end even that starts to become predictable. Once you get a good feel for the show you can actually predict when the next twist will pop off, and what sort of character it will have (blow to personal life, blow to the business, etc.) without having any clue what form it will take.<br/><br/>Even if you don't know the first thing about corporate America, the show requires a ridiculous amount of suspension of disbelief. The team deals almost exclusively with powerful CEOs, Board Members, and other titans of industry who are, one and all, half-wit fools and cowards. They are all just bumbling around, doing obviously stupid things, waiting for the team to arrive and trick them with the most childishly obvious ploys and strategies imaginable, treating each one as if its an act of sheer brilliance. I'm sure the writers like to imagine that everyone who goes into business is an idiot because it fits with Hollywood's preferred narrative about capitalism, corporations, 'rich white men', etc. but it's really quite ridiculous, especially given how big a part of the show it encompasses.<br/><br/>And speaking of narratives, strap in for some seriously preachy story lines, because you're going to get force-fed a lot of the usual Progressive talking points in the process of watching this show, and House of Lies doesn't do subtle. So you'll see Don Cheadle deal with over-the-top racism, and Kristen Bell with over-the-top sexism. Then you'll see the obvious knock-offs of real people the show wants to mock by presenting them as caricatures with slightly altered names. And if anyone brings up religion, you don't even have to think about it, because they're all fools, hypocrites, and bigots. Cap it all off with a portrayal of the brutal dictatorship in Cuba as some kind of paradise on Earth and... well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>My final note will touch on the series finale, but without any spoilers. The entire final season feels like it's building to a logical ending business-wise, as if they were planning to end the show at the end of season 5. But for some reason they don't take any steps at all to set the characters' personal lives on a matching trajectory, so we roll into the final episode with nothing close to resolved for anyone, and then suddenly the characters just turn themselves inside out to give the ending we've all been waiting for, which I found completely unsatisfying.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope this review helps.

Comedy, in it's original definition, means a story in which the main character(s) end up better off, ultimately. It didn't always mean a show or movie that will make you laugh. Regardless, I do end up laughing especially when Don Cheadle's character starts describing things to the audience while time freezes, the ridiculous banter between Schwartz and Lawson's characters, as well as Kristen Bell's sarcasm. Going along again with the debate of the term \"Comedy\" and the comparison of this show with other shows that exist, on HBO the show \"Entourage\" was considered a Comedy. That show made me laugh even less, yet I still enjoyed it. It wasn't busting-at-the-seams funny. So, let's stop being so ridiculous and just ENJOY a show for what it is instead of having expectations of what other show it should be like.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "27 out of 47 found this helpful.", "date": "6 February 2012"}, {"title": " Infantile", "content": "The main characters have a smidgen of depth; the rest are cardboard cutouts.

These first two series were legendary and gave us some of the most memorable characters ever. Recently after watching the first four seasons of Dragonball Super, I felt compelled to re-watch the original series again so that I can make a fair comparison between the two. <br/><br/>Despite some fans having mixed feelings about Super, I think it's not bad, in fact the first two seasons combine the recent two theatrical movies (Beerus God of Destruction, Resurrection Frieza) but once that's over, Super has been getting much better with the tournament saga, as well as the evil Goku (Goku Black/Zamasu) saga and not forgetting the universe of power tournament. The show itself feels more refreshed with much crispier animation (and I'm pretty sure there are some parts with CGI) although it does upset me that some of the major characters (Piccolo, Gohan, Android 18) have been reduced to side shows.<br/><br/>Still, Dragonball Super is entertaining and I absolutely love the transformation scenes as well as the plentiful fights, Goku and Vegeta are great as ever and some of the new characters (Beerus, Champa, Hit, Jiren) are cool to watch. However, Dragonball Super does have some problems, and most of these are to do with continuity and power level inconsistency. As a quick example, remember when Goku first went Super Saiyan 3 in Dragonball Z, the entire earth was shaking and this illustrates how powerful the third level is, yet in Super they instantly turn to Super Saiyan God (Blue) without much of a stretch. There are plenty more inconsistencies, if you care to look for it, but if you just want to enjoy the show, just ignore them (like I do!!).<br/><br/>So despite its share of problems, I still think Dragonball Super is better than GT, that doesn't mean I don't like GT, I also liked GT but only for two reasons, Super Saiyan 4 level and Fusion (both of which are ignored in Super as the story continues from Dragonball Z and ignores GT). So to sum it up this is how I would rate the entire Dragonball Series:<br/><br/>Dragonball - 9 out of 10 for the first 3 seasons, 10 out of 10 for the last 2.<br/><br/>Dragonball Z - 10 out of 10 for the first five seasons (Saiyan, Namek, Frieza, Cell, Android) and 9 out of 10 for the rest (Majin Buu and Garlic Junior) <br/><br/>Dragonball GT - mostly I would rate it 6.5/7 except for the final 10 episodes which are 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Dragonball Super - so far, I would rate it a solid 8.5 out of 10 although my rating could change once I've seen the rest.<br/><br/>So overall, Dragonball Super is pretty good, certainly an improvement over GT and while some fans might not like it, let's just all appreciate that we are getting to see the next generation of Dragonball and enjoy it for what it is.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "23 out of 29 found this helpful.", "date": "11 January 2018"}, {"title": " Dragon Ball Super I LOVE IT!!!!!!", "content": "Dragon Ball Super does not go into full blown action packed episodes from the start unlike it's DBZ counterpart.

The battle of Gods arc was done much better than the movie although i must admit I hate the frieza arc. However there was a massive improvement since the universal tournament arc. And the Future Trunks arc was quite good. Although some complained that Potara fusion was retconned, Vegitto was there for only a few minutes, the ending was too dark. However I think it made complete sense and explained why vegitto defused inside buu, and Vegitto is a special character, and we were lucky to catch a glimpse of him. Some people wanted the series to be dark and yet they are the ones to complain that the arc had a pretty dark ending and not a happy one. You also have to understand that Toriyama would come out with something unpredictable, and not what you would expect. The things that bother me in the series are the lackluster sound effects which is because we have the sound engineer from dbz working on One piece, how goofy they are making goku for comedy purposes, and them not bothering to tell the back stories for the characters.. The animation in battle of gods was quite good(except episode 5 although had more issues with the artwork) although was lackluster in the middle of the frieza saga and improved in the universal tournament arc and was pretty good back to normal in the future trunks arc. You have to understand that art and animation is not the same thing.Animation is the fluidity in movement, and how many frames are used per movement. Only Rof had poor animation as well as artwork. Well in the end we can say it was aimed for kids in the beginning as Toriyama also wants to attract the new generation to the show and gradually the kids will grow up, so will the series just get darker like it is getting now.

The other one is tournament again and the newest one is meh, future trunks back with grim news, AGAIN.<br/><br/>3. Characters are messed up. I mean every character is basically held for gasp and observations other then Goku and Vegeta. Goku is for some reason more of an idiot than he was (remember the dragon ball z cell games, Buu saga, the way he acted as a mentor) and seems to be a kid again even though he is an adult and cares only about getting stronger above all. Vegeta is also comic relief. By the end of Buu saga, you could see him showing respect for Goku. Here he is a Tsundere. who is always behind. Gohan is somehow had anorexia or was held up in some kind of concentration camp, is skinny and useless (how could that happen in such short span), Krillin is turned into a coward for \"character development\" even though in the movie he isn't.

The tone of the show is changed to some kind of comedy, and a not very good one. And it's not that there is no blood or gore, just there is no danger no tension. Even when they try to show dramatic moments, you realize there are dragon balls and you just simply don't care because it's not presented in a way you should care. For example Piccolo sacrifices himself for Gohan. I mean it has been done before and he is an adult now, and it feels pathetic and rehashed. Or the future trunks arc, where future earth is destroyed. It doesn't feel grim at all and it's suppose to. You don't feel anything there is now danger and all the characters are wacky. Dragonball was wacky too, but it had those serious moments, the feeling of the fight to the death, the moment of sacrifice and stuff and now it's just plain wacky. Even in the black Goku arc , Mai sacrifices appears to be killed yet you barely feel anything, because of the tone of the show and because the viewer haven't build any attachment to her yet. Remember all those deaths in Dragon ball and Z? Even though everyone could get revived with dragon ball characters dying felt SOMETHING. They fail to produce that feeling with these series. Is it specifically made for children? Cuz Fairytail is for children too yet somehow feels more mature and there are some stakes. Also what is with Kpop at the ending of episodes that kills the the dragon ball vibe?<br/><br/>5. The forms and fights are lazy and stupid. I mean characters could destroy planets in Frieza arc. Even though there are super saiyan gods now, they don't really look that powerful. The fights feel the same.When Goku in god form fight golden Frieza, it doesn't look different than the fight in dragon ball z on namek. When goku fought beerus in space, they could have destroyed the universe with their power, and now even though enemies are stronger it barely differs than the fight on namek with Frieza. I mean when Goku transformed into super Saiyan 3, the whole earth shivered. Now it's just *poof* blue form is stronger. And the new forms are lazy as hell. I mean golden frieza? super saiyan blue? I mean what's next super saiyan green? They look effortless and bland. They change the hair color and expect everyone to gasp? I mean there so many fan arts by now, you could picked something... No let's do it cheaply and just change the hair color and dumb fans will love it anyway, sigh.. I mean saiyans are primal monkey race. Shouldn't their god would be some god ape, something similar to Super Saiyan 4 and not just blue hair and aura?<br/><br/>6. The story is dumb and the villain reasoning is weak. Beerus tries to destroy planet because of pudding, black goku is killing all humans because they conflict with each other (also if he is so strong, how the hell he didn't wipe them out yet, when majin buu did it in one episode, and you can see humans fighting him with what , guns??). <br/><br/>7. Who is this aimed at? I mean even anime aimed at children have better story and fights these days. This for those kind of fans who will buy anything with dragon ball on it and attack you if you say anything bad about it.<br/><br/>This is what i call milking the franchise dry.

Since then I've branched out into multiple anime and have come to appreciate and respect the hard work and art styles behind the genre. I would also like to note that this review is a non- biased account from a viewer, who enjoys a good show as well as a good story above anything else.<br/><br/>Before we talk about DBZ Super's story, let's first take a quick look back at the original series. At the beginning of DBZ, in a startling turn of events, you have Goku's brother Raditz come down to Earth to settle some interplanetary business with his sibling, only to later kidnap the hero's son and engage him in an epic fight to the death. More Saiyan mercenaries show up some time later to seek the dragon balls for their own personal gains, in a confrontation that ends in the tragic deaths of most of the entire crew. The heroes then go on an adventure to another planet in order to save their friends lives, leading them into an epic planetary struggle against an alien tyrant responsible for killing billions of innocent people. Then we have a dark filler arc in which a movie villain returns from the Dead Zone and converts the entire population of Earth into demonic vampires. After that, Goku and friends eventually get into a struggle of potentially apocalyptic proportions against an old enemy out for revenge and has created artificial abominations to kill the Z-fighters.<br/><br/>Now, let's look at what happens in Super. A cat God who is supposed to be the harbinger of death (and for some reason the cause of previously non-connected events in the series) comes down to Earth and eats a lot of food at a yacht party. We watch Vegeta act silly for a bit, more Z-fighter shenanigans, a new arbitrary Super Saiyan transformation, and absolutely no consequences take place. Then we have Freezer return in another 'this isn't even my final form' arc of unbelievable conveniences, with again no tension, stakes, or consequences, and is just put in there as a measuring stick to make Goku and Vegeta look good. Then a tournament between Gods happens between a bunch of character props and only a few main characters, with more illogical events and situations unfolding. Finally, against all common sense, Future Trunks has been shoehorned into the series, even though his story already had a powerful and touching resolution at the end of the Cell Saga.<br/><br/>The original DBZ set the standard to which a lot of Shonen anime has been expected to live up to, with many being a great success. What Super lacks in this respect is a story with significant weight, edge, tension, and seriousness, and has resulted to throwing in tons of fan service and tropes to keep the franchise chugging along. What made Dragonball &amp; Z great was that we were able to watch Goku, his friends, and the show itself, take us on an epic adventure; evolving from a funny children's tale into something darker, heartfelt and appealing to young adults. What Super has done is take a step back into that children's realm and throw all the character growth that has taken place in the original series out the window. This is probably the result of the author attempting to tie in more Dr. Slump and old Dragonball elements into DBZ, and the studio wanting the series to appeal more to children, in a way that One Piece and Naruto has done. In doing so they've toned down the violence and added more slapstick comedy into the mix, compromising the once serious elements that made DBZ an epic adventure and an ever-transforming conflict. So instead of seeing an innocent person getting eviscerated by a monster or seeing Gohan shove his hand through a villain's chest, we see Gotenks head- butt Ginyu in the balls and characters doing stuff and dancing about for no reason; other than to get a few cheap laughs. The Dragonball cameos in the original series came in small doses, and were cool to see. But when the creators start throwing them onto the screen all at once, it dilutes the quality of the story and turns it into an overused gimmick that people feel the need to show clips of on YouTube.<br/><br/>This isn't even counting the poor animation quality. Though people think the animation is good because it's made clean and crisp due to digital technology, the truth is it's not. A lot of classic anime, including the original DBZ, was all meticulously hand painted onto cells, with astonishing attention to detail and heart. However, since the studio has brought in a new crew of animators for Super and the episodes are being speedily written up, not only are the stories and new characters lackluster, with dozens of plot holes and convenient plot elements, it is easy to tell when episodes have been rushed in order to meet the studio's ridiculous deadlines, resulting in poor fight sequences, character faces and bodies being out of proportion, and glaringly noticeable CGI elements. Even Akira himself said he was disappointed by how the show turned out.<br/><br/>You can't rate a series highly just because of nostalgia or because it carries the Dragonball name. It needs to be looked at carefully, and after perusing over the entire show thus far, I'm a bit disappointed. Before you rate this review, are you rating it negatively because you're a die hard fan of the show who can't see the flaws the author can, or are you rating it positively because it's the truth?

This show often operates within the range of quality of what you'd expect to find in a One Piece filler.

This, as I have noticed, has turned quite a few people off - understandably. However, the execution of this retelling is, in my opinion, masterful. Where the movie starts at the awakening of Beerus the Destroyer and moves directly onto King Kai's planet, in \"Super\" we see a little more of Beerus - including destroying some planets with a magnificent power. Beerus, himself, is portrayed in a much darker - more villainous light. He is a little less like a teacher, and a little more like a foe, nearly destroying the universe during the battle with Goku - just by the extreme shockwaves their battle was echoing. There are more differences. Bulma's birthday party take place on a cruise ship. Scripting is a little more series-like, but still very much on par with the greatness that made DBZ. Of course we have the return of Pilaf, Mai and Shu in their little baby bodies (I love that these characters were brought back, I believe for the first time since the original Dragon Ball series). The graphically enhanced auras which surround SSG Goku and Beerus are still present, even more signaling the vast improvement in the animation. The energy balls which Beerus fires (some of which were fired in swarming numbers at Goku) look more like a swirling atomic ball than just a normal energy ball - which I think further enhances the animation presence. BUT the best thing yet, was that this first saga is nowhere NEAR as long, tedious and laden with filler as some of the more prominent battles from DBZ. No whole \"season\" dedicated to one fight, no three-episode power-ups, and though these particular battles - being Majin Buu, Frieza and Cell - were memorable and awesome, its nice that there is a more fast pace to this series so far. No - it's not all original like everyone hoped for (except for the one-episode battle which followed Beerus's saga in which we have a very vivid picture of what Mr. Satan would look like as a Super Saiyan - classic), but so far it is what it is, and it's Toriyama - finally. Despite this re-imagining, as well as the upcoming re-imagining of \"Resurrection F\", there are a TON more episodes that are following, hopefully with surprises the fans have been waiting for. The second saga also goes into more detail - such as training with Whis, Whis's love for earth cuisine and his constant visiting Bulma so she can feed him, and more curiously - the outfit changes with Goku and Vegeta (the explanation behind them). We have also been introduced to Champa (?) (aka Fat Beerus, as he has been so lovingly named) and his female Whis-like servant.

What it lacks in actual writing talent, it more than makes up in storyline.<br/><br/>The previous commenter skewered this 3-part ITV crime drama, a modernist re-do of the Jack the Ripper murders, but the high scores (9.0 out of 10 at time of writing) tell a different tale. Those who are watching are clearly enjoying this fast-paced, oddly dark series. I suspect this is a reflection on other lacklustre series offered today, as much as its own qualities, but equally it could be because of its ambitious narrative. It's one of those programmes which charms the viewer despite its flaws.<br/><br/>Rupert Penry-Jones, he of Spooks/Cambridge Spies and son of television grande dame Angela Thorne, leads a cast of unevenly talented actors who have been given the impossible task of updating the Jack the Ripper murders. But it's not just the crime which has been updated, but for once, so has the copper.<br/><br/>Like many \"paper cops\", who have more education than experience, DI Joseph Chandler (Penry-Jones) seems a bit wet to his hard-bitten colleagues in the force. His Savile Row suits, David Beckham haircuts, fashionably large Tag Heuer Grand Carrera Chronograph Calibre 17 watch (Penry-Jones is a big Tag fan), as well as homeopathic remedies for tension -- a mint pomade for the temples -- scream out metrosexual for these 'lager and crisps' men. It's all too much when he asks them to shower and look more respectable in a suit, not to mention actually read whole books on the Ripper murders, which they reluctantly do.<br/><br/>East Londoner extraordinaire, DI Miles (Philip Davis), especially doesn't like this new state of affairs. It's possible that he sees a future when policemen will be more like Penry-Jones than the rogue-copper-with-a-heart-of-gold version he represents; he constantly refuses to acknowledge the lad may have some good ideas. His colleagues agree, save for one DI Chandler wannabe, played by Sam Stockman. With his off-the-peg suits, and \"crapuccinos\" (as they are teasingly referred to by others), it seems even the lower orders may desire a more polished style.<br/><br/>The series is never bogged down by details of the old Ripper saga, perhaps due to the eccentric Ripperologist who hovers around the story, played to the hilt by the excellent Steve Pemberton. Could the mastermind of the modern Ripper murders, replicated to the exact detail, be none other than a man whose entire life is dedicated to Jack the Ripper? Or perhaps like an Agatha Christie murder, the obvious is too, well, obvious? <br/><br/>Whitechapel may have any number of flaws, not the least of which are hackneyed character development, seeming like a cross between Prime Suspect, Morse and cult-classic Edge of Darkness, but it packs a very intriguing punch all the same.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "79 out of 92 found this helpful.", "date": "10 February 2009"}, {"title": " Atmosphere and style!", "content": "This is something a bit different from the usual police procedural and it works very well because of the stylish and stylised direction and some great acting.

Anyone who works in a company, private or public, of any scale, has seen these in action even today! <br/><br/>Phil Davis is cast very much to type as the cynical, angry, working policeman but the twist here is that he is the one who makes major mistakes every time about the perpetrator of the crimes and the possible suspects. <br/><br/>Steve Pemberton manages to be creepy and sympathetic at the same time.<br/><br/>Rupert Penry-Jones' subtle and far-from-heroic presentation of the \"useless\" plastic fast-tracker is spot-on, as is his gradual realisation that he's out of his depth and is being cast adrift by his \"puppetmasters\". He's been brilliant at the slow transformation into a real investigator, going with his instincts instead of by the book. It's a very unshowy but intense and believable performance and one of his best to date. The premise is highly imaginative by its nature but the mix of factual background and stylised dramatisation is so effective because it exercises the imagination.

This program got me on the historical parallels because well, frankly, I have a History degree. This is my field. <br/><br/>The real strength of the show is in the actors. First, Penry-Jones, Davis, and Pemberton make a strong core. You have the rookie/leader, the experience cop/family man, and then the intelligent/semi-creeper tropes mixed and played so well. The strength in acting carries through to the secondary characters. They become believable people, which sometimes gets lost in other crime dramas.

I also like the character of the \"ripperologist\" who helps them out. I love the quirky personalities of the people involved and how they have to work together to find the real killer.

Fantastic grizzly crime drama!", "content": "If you plan on watching this drama don't do what I did and watch (especially the last episode of the three) on your own in the dark as I managed to terrify myself. The acting was superb and Rupert entry Jones was excellent as the lead. He played the main police officer in charge of the ripper murders, Joseph Chandler. This poor guy really has a lot to deal with first there is the disrespect and resentment from his fellow officers, then he has to deal with his snooty boss who doesn't believe him and then he gets blamed by the press for not acting quicker. No wonder he is constantly rubbing headache oil on his temples. A sterling performance by Jones which is reason itself to watch this. Phil Davis was also good as Chandler's second in command but at the start he did get on my nerves. The murder's themselves were very gruesome and graphic so if your squeamish then I don't recommend this. This drama is historically accurate in itself, from the information given by the Ripper expert (or Ripperologist as Miles constantly calls him)to the way the murders are carried out. There are things which are a bit far fetched such as the package containing the kidney on one of the women was sent to Miles' house and has managed to get through the entire postal service with out revealing what is inside, gets to his kitchen table and spontaneously starts bleeding. Also the amount of flashes from all the photographers in the pathology labs was ridiculous. The ripper himself was not fully revealed which was a bit disappointing but a the biggest twist was who he was posing to be and that they had met him several times where he seemed completely sane and normal.

There's far more clich\u00e9 and plot holes in television dramas. Whitechapel is no exception. Taking the premise and plot by itself its an awful idea: someone's re enacting famous crimes. Exactly re enacting them which should make it easy to solve. The Krays shot up a pub or boozer in the vernacular so it would be sensible to avoid the boozer on the anniversary that the same pub was shot to pieces. Machine guns replacing shotguns.<br/><br/>The first episode is the most documented and notorious of all: Jack the Ripper. A homicidal maniac that decapitated women and yet has a legendary cache due to the incompetence of the police to catch his bloody trail.<br/><br/>As expected the program follows the exact path, dates and places of the killings. The places, and they still can't catch the killer! But this is an enjoyable drama because its parts are greater than its whole.<br/><br/>Rupert Penry-Jones and Phil Davis as the two contrasting police officers are the heart of this drama. It maybe a clich\u00e9 that good cop and cop that bends the rules will butt heads but find a real respect and loyalty to each other; but without this central teamwork the dram would fall to pieces.<br/><br/>Rupert Penry-Jones is the university graduate who has been fast tracked in to promotion and thinks the rule book is always right and the law can be trusted. Phil Daniels is the hard living police sergeant who, again the hackneyed, knows the streets he patrols. He has a chip on his shoulder about his Superior officer Rupert having been to university.<br/><br/>What makes this drama better than it really should be is Penry-Jones arrogant certainties breaking down in realization that a degree and faith in the law doesn't solve everything and that there are people more ruthless than he even as a police officer realized. Phil Daniels snearing contempt is tempered as his sympathy for Rupert's confusion and sense of helplessness and a growing respect for him.<br/><br/>Penry-Jones gives his best performance consisting of subtle but intense emotion and realism.<br/><br/>Steve Pemberton gives a performance similar to a couple of characters from the League of Gentlemen but with the over the top exaggerations toned down- slightly. He plays a wildly enthusiastic tour guide of London's criminal past. Ever happy to show off his in-depth knowledge of brutal killings, dates and places, Phil Daniels sergeant is understandably irritated by the amateur detective's fascination with the savage of Jack the Ripper. But its the same enthusiasm that provides the knowledge they need to hunt the killer.<br/><br/>If people find this program offensive, especially the Jack the Ripper episodes then they have a point.

There was no white artificial light, it was amber (tungsten) or green/blue (florescent), there was no soft white and no halogen lighting. <br/><br/>All this, while it may seem nit picky, is what makes that era that era. It's the contrast of the new and modern with what is mostly a pre war world. This is supposed to be the early 60's, possibly the most uptight period in US history. A period where rock and roll was mostly played in suits. The peak of public smoking and drinking, the wind down of the highest birthrate in US history, the acceleration of suburban sprawl and urban decay. People who flew at that time frame were well off, it was an upper middle class or better affair. <br/><br/>The show has way too many arcs for a show this early in it's run, and the story development is too slow. The situations portrayed in this show would take place in much more shadowy and dirty venues, and the characters would be much more in contrast to each other. They've also set a pace, and a story line that doesn't let individual episodes stand on their own, which means it can only lose viewers as the series goes on. <br/><br/>It's all really quite a shame, period well done could be interesting, but they've taken an attitude towards it that could only work in a more light hearted show.

I think Julia Louis Dreyfus may finally have a shot at stomping out the Seinfeld curse.<br/><br/>I'll start by saying the premise won't blow anyone off their ass. Christine (Dreyfus) has been divorced for a little while but she has a good relationship with her ex and together they juggle the responsibilities of their son together, focusing obviously more on Christine who the kid lives with. Christine has a brother that lives in the guest house who serves as a nanny (or as he prefers, manny) and her ex has a new girlfriend named Christine, or new Christine, hence the title. The premise struck a resemblance to Reba pretty quickly, but the characters, particularly Julia herself more than make up for the familiar premise. She's got enough of Elaine injected into her personality to satisfy Seinfeld fans like myself but changed enough to carry on a new show. She can be ditsy and over the top like Elaine but she's always concerned in the end about doing the right thing, even if it doesn't always turn out that way. The characters are good too and play off each other pretty well, but I won't get into breaking them down too heavily.<br/><br/>A big plus for the show so far is it hasn't gotten sappy at all. It's a little early to make that comment but I will anyway, so far so good. I hate when sitcoms have those heartfelt moments, they should save that crap for full house reruns. I thought I might be in for some of that stuff given that it's about a divorced mom, but it pokes fun at pretty much every potentially sappy moment, and in the end that's what makes it worth while.

There are reasons for this. The most obvious is that much of what they've produced has just been crap. Look at Jason Alexander. Aside from the wonderful \"Duckman\" cartoon, his two live action series, \"Bob Patterson\" and the recently canceled \"Listen Up\" (which was unwatchable, formula treacle), were both ratings duds. This is a guy who, on Broadway, was practically George M. Cohan! Same with Michael Richards (Kramer). His lone attempt at solo fame (\"The Michael Richards Show\") was mystifyingly terrible. It seems that all of the \"Seinfeld\" cast have made bad career moves since the show ended. At least, Julia Louis-Dreyfus has tried to be conscientious. She's been in some duds, sure, but her previous attempt, \"Watching Ellie\", was a good show, that just needed a little retooling. The cast was sharp, it was well-written and she was bubbly and easy to watch. The major problem it had, was that it felt like some of the later Laurel and Hardy movies, the plotting was a little trite. I understand she had a lot invested in that program, her husband wrote it, they both produced it. So when the nincompoops at NBC decided they weren't going to give it a fair shot, it must have been a bitter pill to swallow. She's been on hiatus for a few years; I suppose, just to let the smoke clear. Now, she's back with \"The New Adventures Of Old Christine\", and believe me, this one is complete junk. For starters, she looks terrible; wan and sickly, with circles under her eyes and primarily, she plays a punching bag. If Elaine Benis was rife with insecurities, Christine's insecurities are eating her alive. Here's the premise: her husband (a lackluster milquetoast of a man) and her were having marital difficulties, so they went to a therapist, who, we find out, episodes in, is a nasty incompetent who was having sex with the guy. Like everything on this program, the shrink is a broadly drawn cartoon. If this woman were your marriage counselor, you'd be looking for a new one mid-way through your first 45 minutes. But, okay. So, when the series begins, Christine's spouse has already walked out on her, for a younger, NICER woman, who is also named Christine; hence, NEW Christine. Brutal. She's moved into a not so great apartment, has trouble making ends meet, nobody likes her... . I mean, how do the producers think that anybody who's EVER lived through a divorce (what- 75% of the USA now?)could find humor in this? Mostly, Old Christine doesn't even have suitable responses to the group of sharks around her. The supporting cast either doesn't care, doesn't have any use for her or they simply want her gone. None of this is even mildly amusing, let alone witty but worst of all, there's simply nobody to root for.

The five girls are also likeable and thanks to different hairstyles usually easy to distinguish. There isn't too much in the way of fan service which I found refreshing.

And then, the characters, who behave in accordance to strict rules surely strange to us behaving in ways that are, ultimately, quite fascinating. The love relation develops strangely, slowly and far from any courtship you could ever imagine. That gets performed by the two main characters in rather fascinating fashion as well.

I was never interested in ER, Grey's Anatomy, Scrubs, or any of the other shows of this kind. This one, however, I like.<br/><br/>I first watched the show because it stars Eoin Macken. I loved his light-hearted, somewhat goofy portrayal of Sir Gawain in the BBC show \"Merlin\", so I thought I'd see what he could do with this role. I'm very impressed with his work on this show, which seems to improve with every episode. His breakdown scene after his friend Topher is shot,triggering overpowering flashbacks to his time at war, is heart-breaking. The fact that he may be the most perfectly gorgeous man who ever lived is just a bonus.<br/><br/>The show centres around a group of army doctors who now work on the night shift at a hospital in San Antonio. Macken plays T.C. Callahan, a doctor who is suffering from PTSD, though it is never specifically stated. The cast is lively and interesting. It includes Callahan's ex- girlfriend, Jordan, as the acting chief of staff for the night shift, and a secretly gay army doctor who does MMA fighting on the side. There are also two interns, one who is capable, cool, fun, and fits right in, and the other who is \"book smart\" but naive. There is a hospital administrator who seems like a real stick in the mud, a psychiatrist who is having a sexual fling with T.C., and Jordan's current boyfriend who joins the hospital as a trauma surgeon.<br/><br/>With all of these colourful characters, there are endless story lines. There are always sub-plots alongside the main action, and everything blends together seamlessly. I have to admit that I found the first episode clumsy, as there was limited time to introduce so many characters, but after that, the show really took off.<br/><br/>The action in each episode is non-stop. Being army doctors, these guys often fly out to do triage at a chemical explosion, or airlift a shooting victim from a remote hunting accident. Do I think this is a realistic portrayal of an average doctor's shift at work? No. Is it dramatic, exciting, fast-paced, and fun? Hell, yeah.<br/><br/>Although the plot changes each episode, it always furthers the personal story line of the characters. Each of them faces insecurity, doubt, jealousy, fear, joy, victory, and loneliness. There is a strong emphasis on camaraderie, sticking together through thick and thin, and helping each other. There is the occasional make-out session in a storage closet, pranks played on their new intern, and even a male nurse helping the boss write a dating site profile, all of which lighten the mood from time to time.<br/><br/>Sometimes the patients die on this show. Sometimes the doctors make mistakes or have a melt down. It just adds to the drama, as outcomes are unpredictable.

The show seemed it faced a bit of an identity crisis, as it couldn't decide whether or not it was military medicine or work back at home at Texas San Antonio night shift.

Season three was near perfect, but the show's fourth season had too much going on (as I said, come the fourth episode and that point on). <br/><br/>\"The Night Shift\" always had the issue of balancing military-based stories and work at S.A.M., but it became much more obvious in the show's fourth season.

One line describes the relationship beautifully: in replying to her n'er-do-well sister's question about why Mary won't just get rid of her defective car, she says \"because, like my family, I love it a little more than I want to kill it.\" The people she's protecting have been getting better and better with each successive show. The most recent, David Foley, was a real hoot as an assassin's middleman.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't care if it's not exactly as law enforcement would do it.

For example, how many times have shows depicted a detective leaving some major department and going to another city and immediately becoming a detective? Sorry folks, it just doesn't work that way. I don't care if you have a gold shield in the Big Apple, it you move to another state, you're going to go through the entire testing process all over again, go through another academy, and start out as a junior patrol cop working a beat.<br/><br/>So I don't like cop shows.

It is a brilliant piece of television. The story is gripping and this caliber of work is very rare. The writing is the best you'll find and the cast is powerful. This is not a chest thumping, triumphant, primal scream of a story. This is a walk through fear, uncertainty, and madness, that is at times almost too painful to watch. But you will watch it. <br/><br/>I've read a few reviews here and one stood out for its criticism of the pace of the action and the \"laconic\" depiction of the lead character played by Aden Young. To that critique I would offer this: Daniel, who at the age of 18 was sent to death row for rape and murder, is now free after 19 years. In the second episode of season 1 he is describing his time there, and what was \"real\" to him for those 19 years. And he sums it up as, \"the time in between the seconds\". This is a man who for nearly two decades felt time passing in half seconds, one second at a time, every minute, of every hour, of every day, week, month, year, and decade. Aden Young portrays Daniel as someone who was thrust suddenly into freeway traffic when he's never even seen a car. The everyday world is whizzing by him at a pace he's never seen or doesn't remember. He is in a constant state of confusion and bewilderment. Every move he makes is cautious because in his mind it could be his last. He is slow. He speaks with the syntax of someone who has had the time to read a lot of books but very little experience of actually having a conversation with another living person. And he comes off as odd. And who wouldn't after what he's been through.<br/><br/>The story does delve into the ugliness of prison life in a way that may be a first; where \"prison rape\" is actually acknowledged as \"rape\", and even \"systemic rape\". Primarily though it deals with the shock waves and exponential suffering experienced by so many because of the rape and murder of a young girl. Though no one suffered to the extent that the unseen murder victim did, Daniel's 19 years on death row as an innocent man, his lost youth, the experiences he endured and will never recover from, comes close. And all around him are more victims: his family, the family of the murdered girl, the community where it happened; and they are all trying to recapture a \"normal\" that is forever lost. Some things cannot be fixed and you just have to live with them. It's an ugly lesson no one wants to learn.<br/><br/>The acting in this series is staggering but measured. The undercurrents and crosscurrents are where everything happens. Aden Young is haunting as Daniel. This actor creates a character you can feel in the room with you. Luke Kirby, who plays his attorney, is a comfortably natural actor no matter where he turns up. From \"Mambo Italiano\", to \"Say You Love Me\", to \"Rectify\", he just disappears into the character and can be anything at any moment with so much subtlety that you forget you're watching a performance. Clayne Crawford, playing Daniel's stepbrother, is the breakout performance of this series though. His character is written as a regular guy. A \"bubba\". His crumbling middle class life is the polarity to Daniel's gasp for air as he breaks to the surface for the first time in 19 years. Crawford's \"Ted Jr.\" is a good guy, a regular guy, but he can deliver a compliment with his words and then send a shiver up your spine with a glance. He is a gifted actor and a more than substantial counterweight to the emotional tomb of \"Daniel\". <br/><br/>It is almost the end of season 2 and there is a mine field of plot twists yet to be resolved. The genius of this script, however, is that we know from episode 1 that Daniel's guilt or innocence is not one of them. This is a gripping drama about the effects of a horrible crime. And from a perspective not often presented. The writing in \"Rectify\" is mind boggling and brilliant. And everything, and everyone, that follows from it delivers equally.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 8/1/15 -- I called it when I wrote the above review. Now I want to re-emphasize it halfway into the third season. This amazing cast headed by Aden Young is unreal. Adelaide Clemens as a young woman confused by her maturation, J.D. Evermore as the conflicted and curious small town sheriff, J. Smith-Cameron as the mother tormented by the loss and then return of a son, Sean Bridgers as a really creepy default suspect, Abigail Spencer, and Sharon Conley, are just shredding this series. Clayne Crawford gives the most complex, multi-layered, multi-faceted, performance in this deep and stellar ensemble. The car ride scene with his step-half-brother at the end of episode 2 is bone chilling and revelatory.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 12/8/16 -- I didn't think it would be possible to keep this up for another year. How does Ray McKinnon do it? Season 4 is off the charts. Parachuting Caitlin FitzGerald into this hive of raw emotions, as \"Chloe\", was genius. Next week is the final episode and I don't want this show to end. It's so good and so compelling.<br/><br/>UPDATE: 12/15/16 -- I couldn't even imagine how they would end this.

Daniel Holden was arrested for the rape and murder of his girlfriend at the age of 16, convicted and sent to live on death row at the age of 18, and 20 years later after living on death row in a cell by himself, preparing himself to die and be forever gone from this earth, has survived 5 stays of execution long enough for technology to catch up with forensic science and, unbelievably, Daniel Holden is released to his family because it is determined that his DNA was not found at the scene of the crime. So now the big question is: Will the current prosecutor re-try a 20 year old case? The whole town has an opinion, and while Daniel Holden walks around like a man in his own dream, quietly and painfully processing freedom, relating to a family that is 20 years older, and adjusting to the overwhelming overload of his sensory perceptions, danger is lurking as those involved in the original case begin to realize what is at risk if a new trial takes place. It's too soon for all of us, the audience, to know what is at risk because, wisely, the story is unfolding slowly and painstakingly like a new flower. The actors are all superb as they falter and try to think of how to talk to Daniel. Daniel is unsure, awkward, and quiet...very, very quiet. Aden Young's face can show about 5 emotions all at the same time, and in one scene as he is describing in a perfect soft, southern drawl his prison \"initiation\" experience for his shallow step-brother, Teddy, Daniel's expression changed from placid, to subdued, to quietly earnest, to a moment of sheer madness, before he snapped back to placid, leaving Teddy speechless and a little bit afraid. Totally alone and silent, this tall man with the haunted eyes drew me in as he walked to a baseball field and just laid down in the grass. How can such a gentle person be guilty of such a heinous crime? Who committed this crime and let this sweet soul suffer 24/7 for 20 years waiting to die, stealing his youth? Is this man guilty, innocent, reformed, or just a stone cold killer with a good con going? I don't know yet.

Reading reviews about its slow pace put me off slightly, but I went ahead with the first episode and was hooked about 15 minutes in by the writing, the excellent use of silences and the sheer quality of the performances. Aden Young is mesmerising, his thousand yard stare bringing nuance to every scene he is in, and he is ably supported by a cast I know from nowhere else, with the exception of Adelaide Clemens. The pace is slow, but not in a frustrating way - it seems entirely appropriate to let the audience experience the bewildering, overwhelming experience of being free after two decades on Death Row, and while after two episodes, I am no wiser as to Daniel's innocence, I do find that I genuinely care about it, and that's pretty much the most important thing to me in any drama: I should care about the people (like them, hate them) otherwise I'm just watching moving images.

Rectify deals with an issue I have been fascinated with for some time and that is people being wrongly accused of a crime and sent to prison. Only instead of showing us the legal wrangles the family and lawyer would have to go through Rectify picks up when Daniel Holden (Aden Young) is released after new DNA evidence throws his case out. Daniel has served 19 years on Death Row for rape and murder and now has to adjust to coming up and living with his family again.<br/><br/>One of the genius things about the show is whilst the evidence gets Daniel out of jail it doesn't necessarily prove his innocence and he could face a new trial. Also as an audience we really don't know if he is guilty or not, even three episodes in I have no clue if he was involved or just the two males we saw briefly in episode one. <br/><br/>Daniel is a bit strange, a bit weird but is that just an effect of 19 years shut away in a cell or was he always like that? Does it mean he has a hidden more sinister agenda? Or perhaps just a little eccentric? <br/><br/>Most of the town seem to think he is guilty including the State Senator and the Sheriff. His family or at least his sister Amantha (Abigail Spencer) is convinced of his innocence, I think his half brother Jared (Jake Austin Walker) does as well. Meanwhile step brother Ted, Jr. (Clayne Crawford ) seems to care more about how it will affect the family business than getting to the truth whilst his wife Tawney (Adelaide Clemens) seems to have formed a touching connection to Daniel. As for the mother Janet (J. Smith-Cameron), she is just overwhelmed by the entire situation.<br/><br/>Rectify was originally developed by Ray McKinnon for AMC with the intention of Justified actor Walton Goggin playing the role of Daniel. Whilst I would loved to have seen his take on the character I have to say Aden Young has impressed me so much in the role I can't imagine anyone else now. Daniel has this awkwardness about him which is natural after being away from the real world for so long and Young brings to the character this mesmerising charm. You can't help but listen to what he has to say, listen to his experiences and life view.<br/><br/>Whether or not Daniel committed the crime isn't really the central point to the show, it is about how prison changes a person, about how life moves on for everyone else and how they have to deal with his return. How victim's family have to cope when the justice they thought had been served perhaps hadn't been.<br/><br/>Rectify is every bit as good as dramas airing on HBO, AMC and Showtime.

This is not a judiciary story but the story of a man, mysterious, profoundly changed by its jailed time, who was still teenage when the movie of its life took a brutal stop. It add to the subtlety to ignore whether he did it or not and his silence about it. The dysfunctional recomposed family is source of lot of deep moment.

After seeing it all, i can safely say it is a moons away from \"Breaking Bad\" for a couple of things - \"Breaking Bad\" was better show overall but the most important thing of how different it is from \"BB\" on its core. The main character is nothing like Walter White, opposite he approaches life, even knowing of how unfair it was to him gently in a first place. <br/><br/>\"Rectify\" is definitely is a show like i haven't seen it before. It is very slow paced drama down to its core - there is no action, no thrills. Basically what we see is an aftermath of some truly horrible murder and more important of how prison sentence can affect a person after he is being released. It shows step by step of what happens to this person and the people surrounding him. There are also some big spiritual themes in this show and anything is being rushed of feels forced - its all as real as it gets.<br/><br/>The craftsmanship of the show is a first rate. This is a small series on its scale, and everything went into script, acting and directing. One of the most amazing thing that i will never forget was score of this show.

HBO, AMC, FX, PBS, BBC and Showcase have all contributed to this renaissance in the medium. From Six Feet Under to Mad Men to Downton Abbey and Justified, modern audiences have been truly gifted with great things to discuss at our dinner tables, at the office or around the back deck or porch. Perhaps it is a reaction to the gluttonous and inane presence of reality television that has helped sparked this talent for great script writing or perhaps it was inevitable. Who knows.<br/><br/>As for Rectify, I don't quite feel the same burst of enthusiasm other newly born fans are feeling. The first episode, I was quite ardent about, seeing the potential for something groundbreaking and immediately sensed there was something to be honestly said about showcasing the life of a recently released man from death row. I loved the potential and eagerly watched more.<br/><br/>And yet I feel nothing remarkable came from it. For one, despite Daniel's remarkable story he is really an unremarkable character. Granted, we feel for his situation and yet by the third episode, we, audience (or maybe just me) have grown tired of his re-acclamation with the world. Great writing, I have learned establishes a fact and then moves on and explores other facets and aspects. In this instance, Daniel is constantly being shown to be a quirky character and his release from prison constantly being hammered at. This, I feel is a result of weak writing. I can only take so much of one man's curious antics and idiosyncratic behaviour before my patience is being worn. And the decision to make him laconic in his delivery only adds to the already-agonizing pace. Perhaps this be would forgivable in an indie film but as far as I can tell, great shows have great leads. Daniel is definitely different, complex and plausibly so but for the sake of story-telling, perhaps not the best choice to make him so passive.<br/><br/>As for the others, the cast is under-valued and under-developed and there are quite a few unbelievable moments (which I won't get into seeing I am limited to under a 1000 words).<br/><br/>Again, this is not for me and I simply fore warn others. I notice a trend in online forums wherein someone who is critical of something and approaches the criticism with intelligence is still called a 'hater'. Someone might love Daniel and his family but in the main, I don't find aspects believable or even intriguing. I'm not into vampire shows and anything with excessive explosion; moreover, I feel compassion for anyone who has gone through what Daniel has. For me I wish the story and the pacing was a bit more fleshed out and scenes given a greater complexity (another critique: I can only take so much of the musical score which shoulders a great deal of the drama. Music is there to enhance and compliment and in no way should it take the place of writing and acting). I only hope any other IMDb viewer will be content that this is my opinion and not feel I am lashing out.

Sorry to be so blunt, but she is incredibly unpleasant to watch and listen to.<br/><br/>The show tries to be atmospheric and moody so as to evoke richer material like \"Top of the Lake\" and \"The Killing,\" but falls desperately flat with amateurish acting and writing, despite nice scenery and sometimes interesting photography.

It does neither well. I chuckled slightly only a few times during the entire season. And I was never drawn into any of the drama either because it was so far fetched. The script and directing was not high enough quality to have viewer \"buy-in.\" My typical response during a scene: \"what??? -_-\" or \"this is so dumb.\"<br/><br/>Examples of \"this is so dumb.\":\n<ul><li>Paul Rudd tries to apologize to his wife for everything, they are mid conversation and instead of confessing... let's dance?</li><li>Everyone that hears about the cloning procedure believes them almost instantly.</li><li>She gets pregnant... and they are all happy about that? No way. He just tried to kill him for sleeping with her and now he is happy that it may be his baby? Stupid. Plain Stupid.</li><li>The CEO of the corporation that Miles delivers his pitch to reads him like a book... because he threw a Jewish boy under the bus and had him killed back during WWII. Is anyone buying this? There are so many leaps in this show... just make it a low level of believability at a minimum. It's a way of forcing Miles into continuing to have clone miles work at the company. Dumb and too far fetched.</li><li>How did the businessman on the rival company know he lied about his grandfather being a farmer, he had never met him.</li><li>Your life is currently bad (but only kind of recently), so you pull 100% of your savings out, ($50,000!!!) to go to a spa you know nothing about? They had to get Tom Brady there so the viewer would \"buy-in.\" How about you just make the storyline more believable.</li><li>His wife stole a $1,000 credenza? Just buy it... it works with the story better anyway.</li><li>The FDA legitimately kidnaps him and locks him up. And they try to make it funny, but it's a huge miss. All of it is, again, not that funny and too far fetched to get me to buy-in.</li></ul>-much more...<br/><br/>Lastly, throughout the entire show I am left waiting for the inevitable.

She was already unsatisfied with original Miles and intended to meet other guys - and perhaps leave Miles in the long-term. But she so happens to meet the better version of Miles - the guy that brings her coffee in bed, dances with her and buys tickets to Paris. To which she says he's \"too great and it's exhausting\".

My mom and I LOVE this show although we obviously cannot relate to the materialism and privilege and a lot of other things.<br/><br/>Those who are hating on the show, have probably been divorced before, or maybe they're married, Or they are comparing it WAY too much to Sex and The City. \nLook, It's a fun and entertaining show about a writer who made all of her money and her career out of books that gave advice to women on how to live their lives. Which is ironic because she end up having an emotional affair, she gets a divorce, and her life becomes out-of-control. I obviously can't relate to living in $1 million home, Receiving $40,000 dollars a month for alimony alone, or having the privileges and opportunities and time and wealth that these women have. Yes they are incredibly materialistic, and rich, but it's just a television show that's there for entertainment.\nI've read some these reviews, And some divorced women are getting angry because they probably feel that it's glamorizing divorce and making it look like a lot more fun than it actually is. But FYI, It is a fictional scripted show!!!!\nIt is there to make us laugh and cry and enjoy ourselves. <br/><br/>1. Abby, The main character, Is a neurotic control freak, which gets incredibly annoying at times but I know people just like her. And it makes for some interesting drama.\n2. Jo, Is her Puerto Rican friend that came from the Bronx and she is a little stereotypical, I will admit. But I am Puerto Rican and my family is just like her so I don't know. She's loud and rambunctious and bold. \n3. Delia, Is an Indian law partner. She's afraid of commitment but she's strong and intelligent and the most stylish, And the most beautiful one, in my opinion.\n4. Phoebe, She's been divorced 3 times and she's a hippie who makes her money from alimony as she looks for her passion. Out of all of them this is the only character that I don't like. Her problems stem From her desire to be surrounded by materials and wealth as She Looks for her passion. She pays no attention to her children and she constantly needs a man by her side.

Carrie, was an immature spoiled, selfish, narcissist who thought she was 15 and spent $1000 on shoes when she only wrote one column a week which was obviously unbelievable. The women did not seem as materialistic or privileged on that show up because they had average sized apartments and had their breakfast at some rinky diner but come on. They drank cosmopolitans and went to fashion shows and parties thrown by celebrities. And Carrie was absolutely unsympathetic, while the main character of this show, Abby, is a little more sympathetic and relatable at times.<br/><br/>Some reviewers are complaining that the characters of this show are acting like teenagers because they're partying and drinking but they did the same exact thing Sex and the City and nobody said anything. <br/><br/>Sex and the city was about finding love and everything that happens before, Girlfriends guide is about getting over it, And everything that happens after.\nI hope they don't cancel the show!!", "rating": 8, "helpful": "9 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "24 February 2018"}, {"title": " Started out pretty good..", "content": "The first season was somewhat enjoyable and showed promise.

This one appeared recently on Netflix and I thought I'd give it a go. I've just finished watching Episode 7, almost halfway through the series.\nFirst off let's get the dubbing out of the way. It's excellent, the best I've yet encountered. By midway through Ep. 2 I'd adjusted and barely noticed it. The voice actors do a first class job and adjustment for atmospherics is spot on.\nThe Sci-Fi element in this show centres around Aasimov's famous Three Laws of Robotics and a new, superior prototype robot called Arisa, \"acquired\" from the Chinese by the ambitious CEO of a Russian robotics company. Arisa escapes and adopts a dysunctional family, and thus begins a clever, well-paced story with multiple threads. There aren't the major twists or end-of-episode cliffhangers so prevalent in US drama. Instead the story unfolds steadily, capturing the imagination through first class screenplay and camera work plus judicious use of moderate CGI (at least in the first few episodes).\nArisa, played with an engaging balance of subtly human facial expressions and smooth, deliberate robotic action by the inimitable Paulina Andreeva, is a mystery wrapped in an enigma. One small revelation after another drives the tale forward without swamping the accompanying side stories. My one reservation is perhaps too much focus on the young love affair, but it does tie in nicely with the comparison between 16-year-old Igor's adolescence and Arisa's own childlike efforts to understand humans.\nAside from that, Better Than Us takes a number of admittedly somewhat clich\u00e9 characters (tough suspended cop with history, teenager in love, crazy mum who's lost a son, surgeon who's unfairly sued &amp; persecuted etc.) and re-instills a good deal of credibility through an all-round talented cast.\nBut perhaps the most engaging aspect of the show is its cunning misdirection. What appears clear-cut, is not. Whom you might think is good, or bad, becomes less obvious as the characters' backgrounds are revealed. It's fascinating, and will keep you guessing enough to want more.\nSo my recommendation is try the first episode.

The show is very entertaining, the acting is good for the most part. The visual effects etc are very good. And the writing/story is also great. It's slightly soapy in some moments but well worth it in the end. Many times I found myself furious, frustrated, angry, happy or otherwise emotionally involved with the characters which goes to show the writers did a great job. Aside from a few minor plotholes, irrational things done by some of the characters (people in real life do irrational stuff all the time) it is absolutely an fantastic show that I would recommend to anyone that likes sci fi or just a good intrigue / drama show. The music is very lacking which is unfortunate, they even managed to butcher the wonderful \"Scarborough fair\".<br/><br/>It's kinda funny that the most advanced robot in the show is actually Chinese made. In the show the big corporations making the robots havent even come close to the creation of this mysterious Chinese scientist that made this robot. I understand why the other robots are so \"robotic\" but my biggest complaint aside from the music would be that this one super advanced robot should have been more fluid and humanlike on her movements and emotions (as I said previously, more like the robots from \"humans\")<br/><br/>I am genuinely excited to see the second season and how the story will progress.<br/><br/>Original review<br/><br/>As someone that loves sci fi and dystopian movies and shows it's much better than I expected. Admittedly I've only seen 2 episodes. I dont think I've ever seen any Russian show or movie aside from the original Solaris and Stalker. I expected it to be more \"B\" quality but it's a great and entertaining show. It's not as good as \"humans\" (which unfortunately had a terrible ending last season) but it's better than most generic sci fi shows.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good although that's hard to judge when the language is foreign to me. The acting of the robots is not that great though, it's an artistic choice I'm guessing but it's sorta stupid. They act too \"robotic\". I mean they should be slightly robotic, maybe a bit cold but there is no reason for them to have such stiff movements.<br/><br/>\nSo far my biggest annoyance is that there is this really pretty pregnant lady in the show. She is like a solid 8.5 or 9/10. Shes short, pregnant but super \"cute\". Imagine pam from the office, now imagine if pam was super pretty haha. Anyway her fiance, which is this ugly guy, acts like she is worthless and is drooling over these robots that arent even as pretty as his fiance. She also seems to be completely obsessed with this guy and seems to genuinely love him. Meanwhile he seems extraordinary uninterested complaining about how she keeps calling him and saying stuff like I wish I could move to another city where she couldn't find me (she's pregnant with his child).<br/><br/>I guess the point is to make him a very unsympathetic character, but it just doesn't come over as realistic. Also the fact that she seems to be completely oblivious to this guy disliking her so much makes little sense.<br/><br/>Despite this being set in the future I thought it was funny that the corporate bosses act like they are mobsters, they treat male staff like crap while treating girls nice. And corruption seems to be super normal. People bribe others like it's the most normal thing to do Haha. It's very Russian in that sense, at least so far.<br/><br/>\nAnyway, I'm pleasantly surprised with the first two episodes. Enjoyed the story so far and the acting. My only wish is that the robots were more like the ones in the brilliant British show \"Humans\". These robots, even the most advanced model with \"free will\" seem to be incredibly \"robotic/stiff\" in their movement.<br/><br/>Overall, if you lile sci fi and the subject of synthetic humanoid robots / androids etc I would definitely recommend it. But if you havent seen \"Humans\" yes I would recommend that show over this.

Law\" dominated the ratings for the network.  The series deals with a likeable alien from the planet Mailmac who is stranded on Earth and forced to live with the Tanners, a California family.  Throughout, ALF is being protected from the fictional Alien Task Force.  The Tanner family is led by Willie (Max Wright), his wife Kate (Anne Schedeen), and their children Lynn (Andrea Elson) and Brian (Benji Gregory).  Perhaps the biggest minus of the series is the lack of character development within the Tanner family.  Kate, Lynn, and Brian are all flat characters.  However, Willie's character is excellent and it is Wright who helped carry the series as long as it went.  Critically speaking, \"ALF\" is a somewhat disappointing series which struggles for story-lines. The fact that the series went on as long as it did is a testament to the writers and directors of this series.  Sometimes the series struggled to find a permanent audience.  At times the material was very adult-oriented, but at other times the stories seemed to cater more to the youngest of age groups.  The way that the series ended was extremely disappointing in 1990. I am not sure how the series could have been wrapped up, but I felt empty and upset with the way the show ultimately ended.

While some good ideas are out there about how this became an epidemic it may never be fully known.<br/><br/>Some nations did persecute mainly women.

Given the fact that I have very little knowledge of the actual events of the witch trials that took place in Salem, I can say that there is at least a very nice sense of authenticity to the show and a good feeling of realism as well - well, as real as things get when you mix witchcraft and the Devil into the picture.<br/><br/>The characters in the show are very, very important for the show to keep its appeal and keep it fresh and interesting.

And much of this is also of course credited to the talents portraying these characters.<br/><br/>Without a good cast, \"Salem\" wouldn't stand out as strongly as it does. They have managed to put together a great ensemble of actors and actresses to fill out the various roles and characters. Stephen Lang, once he gets into the show, really carries his role so well and he is so well cast for that particular role. Despite only having a supporting role as Tituba, then Ashley Madekwe really shines on the screen as well, and she needs to be brought more on the center stage, so to speak.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the movie is good, as it is not diluted with cussing and lots of inappropriate bad languages, that would most certainly not be time accurate, such as seen in other TV shows that were supposed to take place in the past.<br/><br/>A key essential to the show is the set and the props.

As much as I used to enjoy Marilyn Mansons music, then his song is a poor choice for the intro. While the song, in itself is good enough, it is just misplaced for this show.

Personally, I don't think Salem deserves such a rude lashing based on these biased arguments. <br/><br/>Salem isn't meant to be a documentary to begin with. Viewers have to acknowledge that the show's premise is simply an alternate take by the producers on the Witch Trials and what could have transpired back in 17th-century Massachusetts. You can say Salem is inspired by history, since certain historical names and events have been retained, but re- adapted with a modern twist brimming with mayhem, malice, and murder. Last I checked, I don't recall seeing a \"based on a true story\" mention during the show's opening or closing credits.<br/><br/>Imagine this: A TV series which revolves solely around the Puritans persecuting the innocents, with presumed witches burnt at the stake, day in day out, without \"real\" witchcraft, without deceit, without debauchery, and let's see how long those elements will hold up. It won't be long before you have critics writing it off as the greatest bore of the season, wouldn't it? <br/><br/>Acting-wise, I can't say I am impressed by all the characters but Janet Montgomery (Mary Sibley) and Seth Gabel (Cotton Mather) do stand out among the main cast. They are the show's anchors, and their broad appeal and convincing acting make the series particularly engaging as well apart from its fantastic set and well paced plot. Special mentions also go out to Xander Berkeley (Magistrate Hale) and Stephen Lang (Increase Mather)for their believable bad-ass characterization. On the flip side, Shane West's constant frown and pained expression is getting old and tiresome although he does shine in some scenes from time to time.<br/><br/>In short, Salem is a riveting series soaked with a good dose of sorcery, debauchery, and of course, witchcraft. The storyline is compelling, and the theme is dark, but as mentioned earlier, please do not regard Salem as a history lesson.

Personally, I love it! (Sure, a few of the new episodes are kinda...eh) Aside from Spongebob, this show is the pure definition of comedy and one the only one that keeps me, and a lot of other people, tuned in to the Nick channel in the first place. <br/><br/>The basic plot is that Timmy Turner is a lonely, misunderstood ten-year-old boy who must deal with more than any boy his age should handle.... Ever. So out of sympathy, he is given Cosmo and Wanda, two bumbling fairies for personal servitude and company from Fairy World. But even with the two fairies at his side to help him 24/7, he quickly learns life is full of complications that even magic can't fix. <br/><br/>One of the reasons this show does so well is the large cast of characters. Everyone on the show gets a good laugh from me and that's what's important. Timmy's father, for example, is a clumsy, dense man and always undertaking some stupid task to get back at the... Dinklebergs.... Look up the word \"evil\" in the dictionary and you'll see a mug shot of Vicky, Timmy's babysitter, who cares only about money, the pain of a child, and... well, money. <br/><br/>Another reason of this show's success are the plots themselves. To get through life's challenges, Timmy uses his fairies' magic to the advantage. But, of course, nothing ever works out right. One reason is because of the rules added to the power of magic. After all, without restrictions on what Timmy could do, this show would be over in a snap. Also, each episode constantly throws in joke after joke after joke and, coupled with the quick animation and scene switching, it rarely slows down on its humor.<br/><br/>Now onto the heart of this wonderful show: the fairies. A regular comic pair. Wanda is sensible and smart, totally opposite of the purile idiot known as Cosmo. Their interactions with each other are often rib-cracking, especially since Cosmo is constantly getting on her nerves to no end. Adding to the fact that they are wed can ensure worse punishment for Cosmo in the end. They're always trying to work together as a team (a horribly dysfunctional one) and help Timmy, but you can always be sure Cosmo will add some \"fun\" along the way. <br/><br/>For real people, I can see nothing wrong with this show. Some of the reasons stated on here for its atrocity are total non-sense, such as the animation is bad or the characters all act dumb. Hello, it's a comedy. The characters act like that for a reason. As for the animation, there is worse, such as some of the things on Cartoon Network. (Dexter's Lab, PPG) It, and other shows like it, is actually a revival and tribute of an old style in the 30s and 40s that relied on an abstract look for uniqueness, so it had few details and the characters looked flat. And besides, so what if there's little detail and such? Is that really important in an animated comedy?<br/><br/>Alright, enough personal ranting for one day. Back to business. This show is absolutely wonderful. Good, quick humor, a huge and colorful cast of characters coupled with the premise of a boy with (nearly) infinite magical powers make this a must-see show for all.

The show was once at the top of its game with its great jokes, excellent lineup of characters, and good plots. Nowadays, the FOP is BARELY getting a laugh from me and the few there are in the episodes are so far and few in between that it makes watching the show unbearable and makes you yearn for the old days when this show was at its peak.<br/><br/>Timmy Turner is a miserable 10-year old kid that secretly has two fairy godparents. Together, they all go on crazy adventures of what happens when something you wish for goes out of control. So how did this show go downhill? Well unfortunately, this show has decreased in terms of quality and the characters themselves have become unlikable, along with a few other things.<br/><br/>For one thing, the plots have been getting pretty boring now and some of them are recycled. Like for example, a recent episode was about Timmy wishing to be the smartest student in class. However, that was already done in another episode where Timmy wished to be the smartest person to beat A.J. If the show isn't reusing plot lines from past episodes, it's now focusing on one of the new characters on the show, Poof the fairy baby, and him being taken to school or fighting over a girl with an anti-fairy baby of himself. Needless to say, these plots not only sound bad, but they are bad.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters, almost every one of them are no longer likable. Timmy was the miserable child who wished for stuff to make his life better and was a pretty kind kid. Now he's become a selfish, self-centered jerk who abuses his fairy godparents and acts more like a brat. Cosmo was the dumb one, but he had his smart moments as well and was funny. In the new seasons, he's become dumber and he is now more annoying than funny. Wanda was the voice of reason and tried to be more like a mother figure to Timmy. Now she's been made into a nagging woman who constantly complains about everything and always acts so cynical.<br/><br/>Then there are the two new characters on the show, Poof and Sparky. The addition of these characters are where the show has truly fallen apart. Poof adds nothing to the show since he's only a baby and just looks cute. He's a waste of a character and shouldn't have been made at all. Sparky is just as bad. He's an annoying, irritating magical dog that sounds annoying and tries to be funny, but he uses every tired joke that's been done to death. It's a terrible attempt to save a show that was going downhill and adding them in has only made the show more unwatchable.<br/><br/>Another issue is that this show doesn't follow any kind of continuity at all. For example, when Timmy wants a dog, all the pets he's taken care of, but die are shown except for Eddy, the Gerbil, from the episode, That's Life. Another example is that fairies never get old so they don't need babies, but yet there are plenty of baby fairies seen at the preschool Poof is in. My question is, why even have continuity if it's going to be completely ignored like that? It creates a lot of holes in the episodes.<br/><br/>The jokes are also another thing that's been getting stale and terrible. Many of the jokes are now repeated so many times in an episode that it overstays its welcome very quickly. Not to mention some of them don't even make sense, like when Cosmo described the pound and turning a dog into a British Pound. Very rarely will you find a joke that is funny or clever and I do mean rarely. <br/><br/>Artwork wise, it still looks pretty good and stays true to the original Butch Hartman style and it is colorful and has some nice visuals. The animation is good as well with characters moving smoothly and it's not choppy.<br/><br/>In the end, the Fairly Oddparents is a show that's long since run its course and is only getting worse and worse now. The addition of the new characters not only make the show badder, but they are not interesting at all, the characters are not likable anymore, save for a few of them, the jokes aren't funny anymore, and the plots are either recycled or boring.

Cosmo sounds like a whining mongrel, Vicky sounds like a stereotypical shrew, and Timmy's dad makes every line sound like a bad impersonation of a game show host (Guy Smiley from \"Sesame Street\" comes to mind).<br/><br/>The animation is awful; even the producers of \"Yu-Gi-Oh!\" laugh at the overwhelmingly bad artwork on this show. Every character has buck teeth, or a square head, or a head three sizes too big for his or her body. And what's with having the characters speak every single line wide-eyed and grinning, as though posing for a photo op with the president? Then, there is the fact that every character on the show is completely moronic. Not since the subtle grace of Amelia Bedelia, Homer Simpson, and Buddy Lembeck of \"Charles in Charge\" fame have characters been portrayed as so unrealistically dumb. Usually \"unrealistic\" is synonymous with \"unfunny\", and that is most definitely the case here. There hasn't been this much slapstick based on cluelessness since \"The Naked Gun 33 1/3\"...and at least Leslie Nielson was good at it.<br/><br/>Finally, the premise of the show (and it's the same every single episode, so big time spoiler alert here): Timmy wishes for something with his two \"Fairly Oddparents\", something goes wrong, there's always some contrived reason why he can't immediately reverse course and wish away the damage, and then everything turns out just fine in the end. Oh, and on a side note, Timmy's parents never believe him when he complains about Vicky, and they continue to employ her at every opportunity. Maybe it's just me, but it seems that a kids' show containing the subtle message that it pretty much does no good whatsoever to tell on an abusive babysitter probably isn't a great idea. <br/><br/>If you're writing a paper and want to cite an example of just how far the quality of cartoons has fallen, \"The Fairly Odd Parents\" has to be a great place to start.

But that all changed when he got his own fairy godparents named Cosmo and Wanda! Cosmo is my favorite character because is so funny and he isn't that smart and makes a lot of mistakes!

There haven't been many shows of which I have my full devotion to. But there's something special about Fairly OddParents. Something that touches the heart as well as the funny bone. Something that makes me interested in watching it every day I can. For one thing, it is absolutely hilarious. However, there is more to it than just humor. It is also well connected to the life of kids and has many truly heartfelt moments. The Fairly OddParents may seem like just another stupid show on television, but it is that and much more.<br/><br/>A good number of us know that is a great cartoon. It is crazy and wacky; with the characters all acting larger than life and magnifying to the nth degree certain character traits. In addition, it parodies many real-world people, places, and things, turning popular culture upside-down. There are jokes that appeal to all age groups, with the adult jokes carefully woven into the episodes so as to not disturb kids too much. Plus, with varied settings, genres, and plot lines, it comes with a fresh laugh in almost every episode. The many wishes Timmy makes with his fairy godparents gets them into a variety of hilarious situations. This is the kind of show that can keep you laughing with each new episode.<br/><br/>The show is hilarious, but what makes it really fabulous lies in its powerful symbolism. Timmy Turner is not just a reflection of an average kid; he IS an average kid (did you pay attention to the theme song?). Timmy goes through life experiencing the same emotions real kids do, such as torture at school, being misunderstood by parents, being teased by more popular kids, torture by a certain person, and the list goes on and on. The big thing is that Fairly OddParents doesn't antagonize kids for their choices or attitudes like teens and adults in real life do. The show accepts kids for who they are, although it shows consequences of bad choices as well as good choices, which are made readily available to Timmy with his fairy godparents. For example, when Timmy decides to destroy Vicky's house in \"Timmy's 2-D House of Horror,\" the decision leads to Vicky (His archenemy and evil babysitter) staying with her family with Timmy's family, which leads to a nightmare for Timmy. This show gives kids someone to relate to and something to confide in, as well as influencing them to make good choices in life.<br/><br/>Behind the humor, this show has something that most cartoons lack, heart. There is a wealth of morals and messages with scenes that find their way to the heart. Aside from the obvious message about making good choices in life, there are others, such as the value of family and friends. This is evident in many episodes, such as \"Odd Jobs,\" where Timmy tries to help his dad to get a better job, but only when he was about to lose him for about 60 years did he realize that his best job was being his dad. Also, in \"A Wish Too Far,\" Timmy tries to become popular so that he could be able to be with a popular girl, Trixie, but when he becomes so snobbish to his friends and godparents that he was about to lose them, he realized that popularity wasn't important, his friends were. Another important message is in \"The Boy Who Would Be Queen,\" where Timmy decides to wish that he was a girl in order to learn what Trixie liked, and as a result, learned that it was okay to be yourself. The scenes when Timmy learns lessons of life can be quite touching. This show can transmit values to many kids without using overly simplistic plots and it can also amuse them at the same time. This is what makes it a superior show.<br/><br/>With its fusion of humor and heart elements in such a way that has never been equaled by any other show on television, it's easy to understand why Fairly OddParents is the second most popular show on TV and why I believe that it is the absolute best show on TV. It has a wealth of jokes and emotion that can appeal to people of all ages. I'm not just casually saying this like other people who say something is the best show ever but just mean that its really good at the moment. I genuinely mean it with all my heart. I don't do this often, but I express my great appreciation to Butch Hartman and all of the staff for creating this wonderful show. No matter how many other \"good\" shows such as Spongebob Squarepants or The Simpsons get more attention on the media, Fairly OddParents will always be the best show to me and other kids, and that is what really counts.", "rating": null, "helpful": "8 out of 11 found this helpful.", "date": "24 March 2005"}, {"title": " One of the best shows on Nick!", "content": "OK, the first thing I have to say is that Fairly Oddparents is one of the best shows on Nick, (next to Spongebob) and has hysterically-funny characters.

One is that the theme tune does have a decent melody. The show does have a nice premise. Also, I am probably in the minority, but I like Wanda. I like the fact she is caring, and is more a mother figure to Timmy. However, despite all this, I do not like this show, it isn't excrement but I do find it very annoying.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that it is the best animated show on Planet Earth. When I use that term for an animated TV show, I think of Peter Pan and the Pirates, I think of Darkwing Duck, I think of Scooby Doo and I think of Talespin. And I hope I am not the only one who really likes the Wild Thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at. Nor do I think Fairly Odd Parents is the worst animated show on Planet Earth. I accept it's annoying, and in some ways overrated, but it isn't the worst show on Nickolodean. That is Chalk Zone, god that show is unwatchable. But the worst animated show I've ever seen is Shaggy and Scooby Doo:Get a Clue, which is crudely animated, unfunny and frankly a disgrace.<br/><br/>One thing I don't like about this show is the animation. The characters, forgive me if I offend, have very weird facial features, and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make Spongebob Squarepants and Wild Thornberrys so nice to look at. The characters with the exception of Wanda I find very annoying. I can't believe such a talented voice actress like Tara Strong(aka. Charendoff) voiced Timmy. Timmy I don't find very likable as a lead character at all, he is annoying and sometimes patronising, and he is a poor decision maker as well. And his voice gets on my nerves. I actually like Strong but not in this show. Another annoying character is Cosmo, the supposedly funny character. Instead, his jokes are as unfunny as they could become. They are either a) contrived, or b) over familiar. Timmy's parents are awful characters, who don't give a toss about their son, and their personalities wear well thin.<br/><br/>The story lines are very unoriginal on the most part, and I keep thinking, where have I seen this before. The episodes after the arrival of the baby I thought were unwatchable. Even worse is the scripts, very unfunny, childish, witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy.<br/><br/>All in all, not the worst show ever, but pretty poor for an animation fan, and fairly uncomfortable to sit through. 3/10- there are redeeming qualities, and I completely understand if people like it.

Fairly Oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. It also had high ratings along with Spongebob. But it started to fall because of the following crap that Butch Hartman and his team shoved into the show.<br/><br/>First off, toilet humor isn't all that funny. You can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a clich\u00e9 joke. Next there are the kiddie jokes. Lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing. LOLOLOL!!! I just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss! Somebody help me! But of course, this show wouldn't suck that bad if it weren't for stereotypes. Did you see how the team portrayed Australians? They saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert. But now... Is the coup de grace of WHY this show truly sucks the loudest of them all... OVER-USED JOKES!!! The show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them being unfunny) thinking it is like the greatest thing ever! Cosmo is mostly the one to blame. I hated how they kept on mentioning \"Super Toilet\" (which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well) and Cosmo would freak out. And who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in Dimmsdale would use in that one e-mail episode? You know, the one in which every single parent (oblivious to other parents saying it) would utter the EXACT same sentence before breaking into their kid's room? Yes, it may be first class humor to some people, but it is pure s*** to others.<br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken, I do believe Butch Hartman said something about ending the show. Thank God!

This series is fantastic! There's so much to go over that I don't even know where to start! I'll go like this: 1. The Story 2. The Characters 3. The Villain(s) 4. Overall Thought<br/><br/>1. The Story: The Story goes like this: a boy named Jim finds an amulet that, if he says this incantation(For the glory of Merlin, daylight is mine to command), he'll turn into the Trollhunter. The Trollhunter is tasked with protecting the good trolls of Trollmarket located beneath a town called Arcadia and the citizens of Arcadia from the Villains(which I'll get into later).<br/><br/>2. The Characters: I'll obviously start off with our main protagonist; Jim Lake Jr. One of the best parts of the series, is that he is flawed. There are moments when I feel sorry for him, when I'm frustrated at him, and when I think he can do better with something. That's ALWAYS an admirable trait for a character. Being flawed. Moving on to my favorite character(who is not Jim), we have Claire Nu\u00f1ez. She is Jim's love interest and a very amazing character. There will be moments with her and Jim where I just squeal from their cuteness together. And there are moments when I tear up due to her losing her brother to the Villains to turn into a changeling(which I'll get into later). There is my third favorite character(second not counting Jim), Tobias Domzalski(Toby for short). He's the obvious comic relief character and I haven't seen a comic relief character this funny since Sokka from Avatar: TLA! He is absolutely hilarious! But like Sokka, there are his serious moments. Like when he's saying goodbye to a friend(I won't spoil what happens). Then there is Blinky, one of the first trolls you meet. He's a fine character. He's pretty funny and there's not much else to say other than he's brilliant and has good character traits like helping Jim, Claire, and Toby find Claire's baby brother. Then we have AAARRRGGHH. I'm not kidding. That's his name. He's like the second comic relief character and Toby's 'wingman.'<br/><br/>3. The Villain(s): The villain(s) are so well written! The first villain you see(and one of the first characters, is Bular. He looks like a giant troll Minotaur. He's got one of the coolest voices I've ever heard! Voiced by Ron Perlman, the voice of Sinestro from the CGI animated Green Lantern series, voice of the Satbbington Brothers from Tangled, and voice of Firelord Sozin from Avatar: TLA! We've also Gunmar, the Bular's father and biggest villain in the series. The main goal for almost half of part 1. Voiced by Clancy Brown, voice of Mr. Krabs from Spongebob, Lex Luthor from various DC related media, and Long Feng from Avatar: TLA! We've then got Mr. Strickler, a changeling. A changeling is like a monster than that hide amongst humans by 'morphing' into one. We've also got Angor Rot. Alongside Combustionman from Avatar: TLA, He's one of the coolest assassins I've ever seen! He's actually a really smart character. His one weakness is a ring called the Inferna Copula. Whoever bears the ring controls him.<br/><br/>4. Overall Thought: If you haven't seen this series, then you have to and I mean HAVE to watch this series! It is absolutely fantastic.

Thoroughly enjoyed it. <br/><br/>. . .<br/><br/>SPOILERS: If you loved Buffy, lots of stuff clearly referencing Buffy. No question the plotting is HEAVILY influenced by season 1&amp;2 of Buffy the Vampire slayer, which was also set in high school with a \"chosen one\" in a world of supernatural (trolls replace vampires) . The first two episodes here are actually titled becoming part 1&amp;2 which is the name of two of the greatest Buffy episodes of all time, as if to cement the Buffy reference. The main character lives with a single mom, just like Buffy, and slayers/trollhunters are supposed to work alone. Except this one acquires a gang of scoobies who eventually make indispensable contributions. Angor Rot, one major opponent, is Basically much like \"the Judge\" in Buffy. They sit basically on a hellmouth type gate out of which the greatest evil entity is trying to escape, and only The hero himself is key to opening the gate to let him into our world.as season goes on, he is hiding more and more from mom, straining their relationship The coming out as a hunter/slayer scene to mom is a little reminiscent of the Same scene in Buffy. The mom bashing a bad guy in the back of the head shouting get away from my son is a direct homage. Also like Buffy, huge emphasis on having to hit the ancient tombs and study to beat their enemies. And the trolls turn to stone in daylight like the vampires. <br/><br/>Yet despite taking many plot points and the core character dynamic from Buffy, it feels fresh and there are constant surprises. The main characters are very different. Jim is a nurturing type boy who cooks gourmet meals for his mom to take to work at her night shift work as a physician.

They each carry a weight and presence and mystery that meshes with their role in the story. Their voices match their personality really well; Angor Rot specifically gave me chills every time he spoke, without exception.<br/><br/>My favorite thing about this show is the baddies. (20 something year old with a soft spot for villains speaking here, just FYI) Seriously, all storytellers of all mediums could take a leaf from Trollhunters in this arena; the villains each have their own twists and quirks that make them more than one-sided evil bent on good's destruction, and with each season, their complexity only grows. (Gunmar, I'm looking at you.)<br/><br/>\nAngor is by far my favorite character. Clever, cunning, resourceful, and powerful, he comes off as more than a match for the Trollhunter. Jim needs his whole team to take on this enemy, and even then, Jim barely makes it out of each encounter. Angor is a terrifying opponent, and there were a few times that I was questioning whether Jim would make it out alive. <br/><br/>Yet Angor himself has some serious internal conflict that makes him very complex and fascinating to me. I did honestly feel bad for him when he made the Faustian bargain with the intent to protect his people, not knowing what he was truly getting into. He's on a parallel with one of my other favorite characters of all time, who happens to be from an M-rated game. Seriously, top-notch writing on display here.I take all my hats off to the people who helped put him in the show. <br/><br/>When he died in season 1, I felt pleased with the way they did it; no deus-ex-machina burst of will or strength that suddenly gave our young, under-experienced hero the skill or strength to kill him. Part accident, part teamwork, the Trollhunters' takedown of this sorcerer-assassin gave a satisfying end to this deadly foe. It shows how much care the writers put into keeping the characters consistent, and I hope to see this displayed across the rest of the show. <br/><br/> It saddened me a little bit to see that he never got a chance at redemption in the first season, so when I realized they were bringing him back, I pretty much jumped over the moon. I really hope he has a chance to redeem himself, and I cannot wait to see more of him later. I really want to see him get even with Lady Pale for enslaving him. <br/><br/>(I know this has been mostly about one character, but I really like Angor. Sorry. Guilty as charged.)<br/><br/>This is a must-see show for its pure entertainment value, and its wonderfully written characters help pull the story through the few sticky spots the show encounters.

While I am a Batman fan first and foremost and love the animated series, I also love Superman quite a bit. I've seen every animated series of Superman and as far as I'm concerned, this one is the best of all of them, even though the classic Fleisher cartoons of the 40's give it some competition.<br/><br/>Superman: The Animated Series is a more modern looking show than Batman is judging by the cars in the city as well as the technology. Other than that, the characters, and especially Superman himself have a look that is timeless. Modern, yet reminiscent of the way people looked in the old classic movies. Superman himself and his alter ego of Clark Kent captures that feel more than anybody and I personally enjoyed his vocal performances by Tim Daly and was saddened he was unavailable for Justice League. Lois Lane has never been hotter in any other interpretation plus Dana Delaney was perfect casting voice over wise. Lex Luthor is a suave, rich, billionaire business tycoon who was voiced over superbly by Clancy Brown. This Luthor is what I feel the movie version should have been and amazingly, he reminded me of Tony Savallas, even before I knew that was the animators' intentions with the character. From other shows, I enjoyed the newest interpretations of Jimmy Olsen, Perry White, and villains like the Toyman, Kalibak, and Desaad and others as well as supportive players like Lana Lang and Jonathan and Martha Kent, who oddly enough, were voiced over by real life married couple, Mike Farrell and Shelley Fabares. <br/><br/>Other than Lex Luthor, my favorite Superman villains were: Brainiac, who in this series is from Krypton, Mr Mxyptlk, who voiced over by Gilbert Gottfried, was so damn funny, that I bust a gut laughing at his episodes. Also for entertainment, I like Bizarro. And for a dangerous, undefeatable villain, I choose Darkseid, voiced brilliantly by Michael Ironside.<br/><br/>Since I didn't read Superman comics like I did Batman, I got familiar with characters in the animated series like: Anchorwoman Angela Chen, Detectives Maggie Sawyer, and Dan Turpin of the Metropolis SCU. ALso, Professor Emil Hamilton and villains like Metallo, the Parasite, Maxima, and new villains like Livewire, Luminus, Volcanna, and Apokolips villains like Granny Goodness , Steppenwolf, and the Parademons. And I must not forget the likes of Kryptonian villains like Jax ur nd Mala, and for good laughs, the bounty hunter Lobo. <br/><br/>My favorite episodes include, The Bizarro and Mr. Mxyzptlk stories for the sake of laughter. For drama, I'd recommend the pilot movie, \"The Last Son of Krypton.\" Apokolips.. NOW!, episodes with Supergirl, the final two part episode, Legacy, and I especially love teams ups with Batman, like World's Finest, Knight Time, and the Demon Reborn. I also loved the team ups with the Flash, the Kyle Raynor Green Lantern, Doctor Fate, and the Silver Age version of Aquaman. <br/><br/>I love everything about the series, the animation quality, the voice over cast, and the great music by Shirley Walker. These are excellent shows and I recommend them for anybody. I've recently heard that there will be an animated Direct to DVD Superman movie coming out this year.

These are Jack Kirby stories about Darksied the ruler of Apokalips, a hell like world. This makes the last season very epic, especially when darksied invades and kills one of the cast members, I won't spoil it by saying who.<br/><br/>Supergirl is also reinvented very well. Instead of using the bizarre idea that a piece of Krypton flew into space, she comes from a neighbouring planet which Kryptonians inhabited.<br/><br/>Supermans cast members Lois, Perry White, Jimmy, and Dan Turbin are done very well, and are the only people not reinvented.<br/><br/>The show ends at its prime. After a certain cast member dies you start to actually feel worried. After that point, Darkseid could do anything. In the final, very epic, two episodes of Superman, Supermans mind is taken over by Darksied and forced to invade earth. The series began on a happy note and ended on a sad one leaving Superman to earn earths trust.

No here you will see him lose a good friend to the cold Darkseid, help the Green Lantern take on the villainous Sinistro, and battle schemes by Lex involving him creating a cyborg man with kryptonite in his chest named Metallo.

Interesting readings of the Parasite, Luthor and in particular Brainiac mean that this is no slavish copy of the comicbook.

In any case a very weak story (even for a single episode, but this is a tow parter!) involving an insipid DC version of Marvel's The Collector called The Preserver fails to convince.

(Not for the dog/cat thing, for that, please see my review of the Cat in the Internet Pet Database). Supe is very hard to dramatize, once you get past the origins. He never lies. His virtue is never in doubt. Not much can hurt him, so writers have spent almost 7 decades inventing baddies who can. Batman, on the other hand, is more fun than a barrel of hammers. He is a borderline psychotic. He has no superpowers yet somehow gets invited to JLA roasts? Even his enemies (Joker and Harley) are more fun. The point of this review is that Batman was a tough act to follow for Dini and crew, and the production team tries hard but never quite makes it work. No foul. no blame. But the magic is scarce. And frankly I have seen enough Lex Luthor to last a lifetime. (In his own way, he is as predictable and boring as Supe). In the Golden Age of comics (yes they were called \"comics\" then) the DC people would often do a full issue stuffed with an \"imaginary\" story just to break the bounds. Of course, when you do an imaginary riff on something which is imaginary to start with, well, nothing good comes of that.

Yet oddly everyone is down with stopping a conservative candidate in Germany because of her tough stance on immigration. <br/><br/>The writers try to cover themselves by saying the CIA has good intelligence that this candidate is going to try to fake a terrorist attack.

And it has a lot going for it - some great actors, good locations, what seems like a healthy budget. Unfortunately, there seems to be some people at the helm who make terrible decisions.<br/><br/>First: the overall aesthetic of the show is about 20 years out of date - as evinced most painfully by the choice of Bowie's \"I'm afraid of Americans\" (released in 1995 - and it sounds like it!!!) for the title music. Ugh. This song was dated about two minutes after its release, and age hasn't made it better. Also, the fast-edit style a la Jason Bourne movies might have seemed cool back in the early 2000s, but now it just feels cheezy - like watching your dad trying to act 'cool'.<br/><br/>Second: While the cast is generally good (I tuned in mostly because Rhys Ifans was in it; but Richard Jenkins and Leland Orser are also excellent and help prop up the show). I'm a bit divided on Richard Armitage as the lead - he's a solid actor, but feels miscast here. I just don't buy him as an intrepid spy with a dark past - he's too stiff and uptight-looking. He was convincing in North &amp; South (mostly because he played a stiff and uptight Brit), but not so much here. Also: having two British actors (Armitage and Ifans) play American leads is problematic. Viewers outside North America might not notice, but their accents don't really sound natural. I wish they'd just played them as MI5 agents - would have been more convincing and there's really no reason for the show to focus on the CIA. A properly Euro-centred version of Homeland would have felt much more authentic and would have avoided these issues. Plus: some of the actual American actors they have in the show are awful and drag the overall quality down: of course this season Ashley Judd, but also Michelle Forbes.<br/><br/>Third: By far the weakest part of this show is the writing, which tries to weave a complex LeCarre-style narrative but frequently resorts to idiotic clich\u00e9s, radically implausible character decisions and actions, and general eye-rolling dumbness. Examples from season 2: -the way large chunks of exposition are hamfistedly inserted into the dialogue between Daniel Miller and a female agent in the opening scene of S02E01, making for one of the most awkward \"conversations\" I've ever heard (-she might as well have been saying \"Here are some things from season 1 you might have forgotten about that I need to remind you of in this first episode of season 2\").<br/><br/>-how Miller and the German undercover agent have a conversation right outside Ganz's office - who for all they know might be standing with his ear to the other side of the door, or have the hallway bugged - about how the latter will surely kill Miller if he's found wearing the wire he was about to go in wearing (-and in fact these sorts of scenes - where characters who are supposed to be highly trained super-spies do obviously careless things which never seem to cause suspicion or get them caught - recur in every episode; I'm no expert, but this doesn't seem like professional tradecraft...) <br/><br/>-terrible continuity errors, like in S02E02, where Ganz says to Daniel, as they stand in his office in BERLIN \"You will take me to your source NOW!\" and the scene immediately cuts to a shot of them driving up to that source's house IN SOUTHERN SPAIN!!!!!! (that one actually caused me to laugh out loud). Wow - when Ganz says NOW, he's not foolin' around - I guess they teleported... (actually, they mention later that they flew; so I guess we're meant to believe that Miller, Ganz, his daughter and his henchman drove straight to the airport - where they somehow already had tickets booked for this location in Spain that Ganz hadn't even known about till Miller mentioned it - and then flew there together, rented a car, drove to this house... anyway, you get the idea - the show is plagued by nonsensical transitions like this).<br/><br/>Overall, non-US productions that try to imitate American-style programming are always worse for it. Here it results in some of the worst aspects of the show, like pointless nudity and sex, bad accents and casting choices, terrible editing, dumbed-down storytelling, and generally just a lot of empty, stupid clich\u00e9s and posturing in place of intelligent writing. Like I said, I WANT to like this show. I was surprised that it got a second season and was hoping things would be better this time around.

The first couple of episodes did little to change my mind either, Berlin was just as weirdly misrepresented as in Homeland (seriously guys, Potsdamer Platz might be a nice shooting location but it's not where you'd hold confidential meetings or drop-offs). Moreover, many of the characters seemed to conform to silly stereotypes for the sake of giving the show a bit more of a flashy Hollywood feel at the expense of authenticity, with seemingly very obvious good guys and bad guys, the devious mole and the self-serving back-stabbing vice chief, and so on.<br/><br/>Well it certainly took its time, but as the show kept spinning its complex plot like an intricate spider's web its depth (along with that of its characters) was very slowly revealed, until towards the end I found myself really starting to sympathize with almost all of the main players -- none of whom ended up being as one-dimensional or gimmicky as they seemed at first. Even more impressive was that the complicated and multi-layered plot, with so many characters and B-plots and C-plots, really seemed to coalesce in the end into one meaningful story without any major loose ends or plot holes, every character's actions seeming completely in line with their personalities and motives. And suddenly it seemed more and authentic than both the shamelessly ridiculous Hollywood-style espionage thrillers like Bond and MI (of course) but also the opposite-end 'ultra-realistic' style of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and other John Le Carre adaptations, where the lack of human emotion can often give the movie a surreal edge.<br/><br/>Could it have had a tad more energy at times? Sure. A slightly better cast? Less broadly generic direction and score? You bet. Did it upset me when the Mossad agents sounded every bit as German as the BfV agents? Yes, it did.

The political bias, not very biased, everyone is tainted yet human, redeemable, even heroic in their own way. I don't like \"one anti-hero superhero save the world\" trope. And Berlin Station is satisfying in that regard. Some unlikely alliances, seemingly amoral personalities could still believe in something. Plentiful inter-personal tensions to make us cringe or wince.<br/><br/>Strong, generous, courageous cast. Even the weaker actors are a 9/10. My only beef with casting, on average primary male characters are (or looked) 20 year older than key female characters. But there is nothing strong acting and good writing-directing can't overcome. Leading beef looks like a cross between Hugh Jackman and Rupert Friend (Quinn of Homeland).

For any sci-fi or adventure show fan, this was THE show of the 70's. The 60's had Kirk, Spock, Tribbles, and Klingons; the 70's had Steve Austin, Oscar Goldman, Jamie Summers, and Bigfoot.<br/><br/>Lee Majors was Steve Austin, astronaut; a man barely alive...... There was nothing Stone Cold about this Steve Austin, except maybe his wardrobe. Lee Majors was quite entertaining as Col. Steve Austin; part James Bond, part Buzz Aldrin/Chuck Yeager, and part Superman. Lee gave Austin a nice mix of serious and fun. Yes, his acting could be as mechanical as his bionics; but, Majors always had a bit of a twinkle in his eye (may have been the lens in the bionic one). He never took himself too seriously in the role, but could convey that emotion when the script called for it.<br/><br/>Richard Anderson was steady as boss and pal Oscar Goldman. Like Majors, he was limited, but well suited to his character. Anderson could be a good supporting actor when he rose to the occasion; and he often did.<br/><br/>I personally preferred Martin E. Brooks to Allan Openheimer, as Dr. Rudy Wells. Brooks came across more as a scientist. The other supporting characters varied in quality from show to show, but Rudy was always an integral part.<br/><br/>The episodes vary in excitement and imagination. The later seasons suffered from repetition, but, the early ones hold up well as good science fiction. Personal favorites include the death probe; the Russian installation with a doomsday device that is accidentally activated; the booby-trapped Liberty Bell; the androids; Steve's return flight in the experimental craft from the pilot movie;the Bionic Woman cross-overs; and, of course, Bigfoot. I preferred the more science fiction oriented stories to the more mundane cops and robbers shows.<br/><br/>The show had quite a mix of guest stars. There were the greats, like William Shatner, Lou Gossett Jr., Guy Doleman (from Thunderball and the Ipcress File), and Ted Cassidy and Andre the Giant as Bigfoot (Andre played him first). There were the so-so, like Farrah Fawcett (Majors), Cathy Rigby, Gary Lockwood, and John Saxon. Then there were the strange, like Sonny Bono and Larry Csonka.<br/><br/>This was the show that caused millions of kids in the 70's to run in slow motion, while making strange noises. It also had the coolest action figure; it came with an engine block that you could cause Steve Austin to lift, by pressing a button on his back. You could also look through the bionic eye, although you had to make your own sound effects. I understand these things go for big bucks on eBay.<br/><br/>Years later, I found a copy of the original novel, Cyborg, by Martin Caidin.<br/><br/>The character was a bit different. He was more of a secret agent than in the series, and the bionics were a bit different. The eye was actually a camera, rather than a telescopic lens. It was explained that Austin's stamina was greater, since his lungs didn't have to provide oxygen to his bionic limbs. He also had special enhancements for the limbs for special missions. In one, he has webbed feet for underwater swimming. The book plays up Austin's intelligence and scientific background more. It was generally well written, and makes a nice contrast to the series.<br/><br/>There have been rumors of an updated movie. At one point, it was pitched as a comedy with Chris Rock. Thankfully, that doesn't seem to be the case right now. It has tremendous potential as and action/sci-fi movie, particularly with advances in special effects. Here's hoping the right script, director, and cast comes along and makes it a reality. Of course, they'll have to adjust it for inflation; 6 million doesn't buy much these days.

You see,I remember this series coming on television very well. For one,I was one of those kids who from some reason was glued to the set when this show came on Friday Nights on ABC-TV during the 1970's. I was one of those kids who for some reason went out and brought up a lot of memorabilia stuff including all of the merchandise that flew off the shelves relating to this show: Who remembers owning one of the two dolls of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" action figures that were made by Mattel which featured the character with the bionic grip and not to mention his mentor who had changeable outfits,let alone tons of stuff including the GMF View-Master set of one of the episodes not to mention seeing one of your friends walking on the playground or jumping over something in slow motion....Oh yeah,that TV soundtrack to the show which had Lee Majors doing country tunes and rock and roll stuff?<br/><br/>For the answers to the questions depicted? YES!!! I WAS THE 1970'S! FOR ONE,WAS ONE OF THE CHILDREN WHO WORSHIP QUALITY 70'S TV PROGRAMMING! By the way,if you remember 70's TV characters like Archie Bunker,George Jefferson,Maude Findley,James and Florida Evans,Fred Sanford,Dee Pepper Columbo,Jim Rockford,and Kolchak,Baretta and not to mention Theo Kojak,then the character name of Steve Austin should come through the light!<br/><br/>Even after all of these years,\"The Six Million Dollar Man\" still holds up to the test of time and to this day,it has always been a personal favorite of mine as a child,and still is regarding as a vintage classic even after some 30 years later with some of the best special effects around. Ever since it premiered on ABC-TV in September of 1974,it was a runaway bonafide hit which was garnered huge ratings with the audience and was always in the top-ten of the Nielsens,where it stayed for six astounding seasons until its final episode of the series ended in May of 1978,after producing 108 episodes,which in turn took ABC to the top of the Nielsens where it was on one of the most watched shows during its run on Friday nights in its first four seasons,and from there in its last two the network moved the series from Friday nights to Sunday nights opposite the Sunday night competition:\"60 Minutes\",and \"The Wonderful World Of Disney\" until 1978,when the series ended.<br/><br/>About the show.................. Long before \"Cyborg\" became famous with Arnold Scwarzenegger in the \"Terminator\" films,Lee Majors was everyone's favorite cyborg,and for every fan out there,this show delivered the goods since this was indeed part science fiction/action-adventure genre mixed in with some international espionage and political intrigue for a great effect. Lee Majors' role as Steve Austin was in fact a combination of James Bond,part Buzz Aldrin/Chuck Yeager,part Road Runner and part Superman in which gave this series a nice mix of seriousness and fun. Let's face it,he was part-human,part-mechanical;the world's first bionic man. Better than he was before...BETTER,STRONGER,FASTER...............<br/><br/>The character of Steve Austin,who was an astronaut who suffered an accident and was rebuilt by a government agency and was under the supervision of his boss,Oscar Goldman played by Richard Anderson,and there was Dr. Rudy Wells,played by Martin E. Brooks,who was responsible for Steve's bionic parts. The chemistry between these characters were to be tested throughout the series,but as the show progressed the chemistry between them was brilliant. The sound effects which included the bionic eye looking miles ahead,or the sound of bionic legs running faster and faster is what made this show stand out beyond them all. FANTASTIC! you say? I'll say AWESOME!........<br/><br/>This show was just pure fantasy from the get-go with the stories truly engaging and very well written the offered variations in excitement and imagination,and during the last two seasons of the show it suffered from repetitation since the earlier episodes(from the first three seasons)and from there the ratings slipped too. The show had a mixture of guest stars of who's who in Hollywood from William Shatner,Ted Cassidy and Andre The Giant as Bigfoot(Cassidy played him first)to the guest of TV show regulars like Gary Lockwood,John Saxon,Cathy Rigby, Lindsay Wagner(who played Steve Austin's love interest,Jamie Summers which was for the inspiration to the spin off,\"The Bionic Woman\"),to the strange and bizarre like Sonny Bono,Larry Csonka,and so forth. Nowadays it is a crying shame that this series is no longer shown on any cable network(cable's The Sci-Fi Channel was the last to do so...an all-day marathon of this series was shown not too long ago)or any syndicated market station doesn't show this anymore,and I wonder why? Why isn't there a big-screen version of \"The Six Million Dollar Man\" coming to theaters? I heard rumors its going to be George Clooney.<br/><br/>But by the way,while during the last two decades many of our favorite TV shows(Star Trek,The Untouchables,I Spy,Mission:Impossible,McHale's Navy,The Wild,Wild West,Lost In Space,The Fugitive,Charlie's Angels,SWAT,The Brady Bunch,The Twilight Zone,Lassie,Flipper,My 3 Sons, and not to mention our animated TV favorites Scooby Doo,The Flintstones) and cartoons(Batman,Superman,X-Men,Daredevil,Spider-Man,Hulk,The Punisher)have been made into full-length feature films,so now is the time for SMDM to give it the big-screen treatment and the respect it truly deserves.", "rating": null, "helpful": "30 out of 32 found this helpful.", "date": "23 August 2004"}, {"title": " You Gotta Love This!", "content": "This is one of the ways you can tell you're getting old: when someone says the name \"Steve Austin.\"  Do you think of a bald wrestler rolling around on the mat groping other guys, or Lee Majors moving in slow motion and squinting?

Lee Majors (along with Clint Eastwood) proved that some people look so cool when they squint.  I look like I need my prescription checked when I do it, but I'm not Lee Majors.  Steve Austin could handle anything they threw at him, not just because of his bionics, but because he was smart, he never gave up and always kept his cool.

He could run faster than a car and he was a super intelligence agent. Along the way he meets a variety of interesting characters and ones that I have never forgotten about.  There was Barney, the seven million dollar man who lets his bionics take over his mind and he uses them for his own benefits instead of that of his agency.  Then there was the probe.  The probe was a machine that was designed to go to space but never made it there.  On Earth, it wreaks havoc and Steve has his hands full with it. Then of course there was Jamie Summers.  She was Steve's girlfriend that has a tragic parachuting accident.  Steve, blinded by love demands that she is given bionics.  She receives them but she has amnesia.

Most of the great science fiction themes had been exhausted during the early Cold War era, when fears of alien invasions and nuclear holocaust were rampant.  It was the horror genre, if anything, that enjoyed a resurgence in the 1970's, with such notable offerings as The Exorcist and Jaws, and television programs like Dark Shadows.  By contrast, the 70's were lean years for sci-fi - the classic motifs of the 60's were dead, and successful 80's tech-shows like Knight Rider were still on the shelf.<br/><br/>But Col. Steve Austin virtually redefined the genre with his story of bionic implantation.  His character was indisputably TV's first cybernetically enhanced human being of any significance.  In fact, rarely did even the silver screen feature a cyborg in a major role before TSMDM debuted. After its long run at the top, Hollywood began churning out its subtle rip-offs, which spawned such diverse characters as \"Bishop\" in Alien, The Terminator, \"Data\" and the dreaded Borg from Star Trek TNG, and a host of mediocre Austin clones in Van Damme-style B-movies.<br/><br/>Further, TSMDM was competent in its own right.  The show was a household name during its reign, and gave birth to the kind of merchandising mania - action figures, board games, etc. - more typical of a big-budget motion picture than a television series.  There wasn't a young boy anywhere in North America who didn't mimic the Colonel's slow-motion antics in the schoolyard, and even parents inevitably ended up enjoying the program as much as their kids (name another show that can make that claim!).<br/><br/>The cast was well-chosen and usually convincing, with Majors' understated but charming persona leading the way.  The special effects were acceptable for the time, if not particularly ground-breaking.  Best of all, the episodes were reliably action-packed, well developed and truly imaginative in their diversity and execution.  The program touched on alien visitors, military themes, espionage, romance, and never lost its sense of perspective or sheer fun.<br/><br/>My only complaint with TSMDM is that no station in my part of the world carries the show any longer.  Amazingly, the Space Channel sees fit to broadcast garbage like Beauty and the Beast and Lexx, but turns its back on a genuine pioneer of the genre.  It's confounding.  Shows like this cannot be allowed to simply rot away in some vault.  They must be preserved, just as legends in their time like Star Trek clearly have.

With a good, solid, realistic in treatment (psychologically and artistically), 1973 pilot produced and directed by David Irving and starring Martin Balsam as Dr. Rudy Wells (see H. G. Wells?) and Darren McGavin as the crippled cynical and manipulator Intelligent head Oliver Spencer who is also known as newspaper \"Kolchak, The Night Stalker\"; the show starts very well with Gil Mell\u00e9's electronic and jazzy score a la Miles Davis' \"Bitches Brew\", then comes a terrible second pilot \"Wine, Woman and War\", produced by Michael Gleason and written by Glen A. Larson with a dreadful main title and a horrible song by Dusty Springfield in which Steve Austin is a kind of reluctant second-rate James Bond whose mission ends with an atomic explosion. The series really finds its format with the third pilot: \"The Solid Gold Kidnapping\" with Jack Cole's famous techno medical main title (made with footages from the two pilots, video effects and body animations). During the middle of season 1, the music department decided to add sound effects from Universal's stock music library to highlight the bionic motions (some were already used in a previous series like the 1972 E.S.P. series \"The Sixth Sense\"---oddly enough, you can hear a noise from a missile when Austin launches an object into the air). The series had three Dr. Rudy Wells: one played by Martin Balsam (first pilot), by Alan Oppenheimer (pilot 2 &amp; 3 and season 1 &amp; 2) and by Martin E. Brooks (season 3, 4 &amp; 5). The first two seasons ---produced by Sam Strangis/Donald R. Boyle and Lionel E. Siegel/Joe L. Cramer--- were in the line of the pilots and then occurs the transitory season 3 ---in 1975, the main composer Oliver Nelson and the music supervisor Hal Mooney left---, a season 4 with some drastic changes (bad writers and producers, the lead wears a ridiculous thin moustache, Goldman has a new office's decoration and the music is composed and renewed by J. J. Johnson) and therefore an un-inspired season 5 ---without Harve Bennett--- in which the protagonist wears a pre-\"Fall Guy\" haircut. TSMDM is basically an espionage series with a shallow sci-fi canvas (everybody remember the zoom shot bionic left eye with the frames or the infrared vision); notice the various martial music themes to grasp the concept of this pro-gov/militaryNASA/technology drama. The first pilot shows an offhand and rebel Steve Austin who refuses his injured disabled condition (even try to commit suicide) and his involvement in the scientifical department of the C.I.A. (here, O.S.O.: Office of Strategic Operation, and, later O.S.I.: Office of Scientifical Intelligence): official Oliver Spencer (later Richard Anderson as Oscar Goldman) even receivs a cold slap. From season 2, we are introduced to another bionic man: paranoid auto racing Barney Miller (with a season 3 sequel) in \"The Seven Million Dollar Man\", and a woman: tennis champ Jaimie Sommers, in a two-parter (with a season 3 sequel too) in \"The Bionic Woman\". From that point, the show slips into cheap bionic new products (Bigfoot, boy, dog) with a comic book leaning. The best episodes are those which deal with the space program/Austin's background (\"The Rescue of Athena One\", \"Burning Bright\", \"The Pioneers\", \"The Deadly Replay\": where we learn about Austin's near fatal plane accident) and the dangers of technology in the hands of America's inner enemies (\"Population Zero\", \"Day of the Robot\", \"Run, Steve, Run\").", "rating": null, "helpful": "12 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "24 December 2002"}, {"title": " Cheesy, But Excellent! They don't make shows this good anymore!", "content": "One of my all time favorite TV shows. I saw it when I was very little and not again until the SciFi Channel in the 90's. The Six Million Dollar Man series was a series that never developed a permanent formula so each season is unique and different from the others. The character first came to life on TV in 1973 with a trio of 90 minute TV movies. The Six Million Dollar Man movie (Cyborg) was take right from Martin Caidin's novel and also starred Darren McGavin as Oliver Spencer and Martin Balsam as Dr. Rudy Wells. Wine, Women, and War debuted Richard Anderson as Oscar Goldman and Alan Oppenheimer took over as Rudy Wells but was never a series regular. This movie made Steve seem like a Bionic James Bond. Solid Gold Kidnapping was a dull TV movie. <br/><br/>Season one (1974) was a season that seemed geared towards more adults than children. Slow motion would be used as a reverse psychology to show Steve's super speed at slow motion. Cheesy, but effective. The episodes were more action oriented and we saw Greg Morris, William Shatner, and George Takai in guest roles. And the best episode of the season had to be Day of the Robot that introduced the toy figure called Maskatron. John Saxon's fight scene with Steve was awesome!! Season Two was in an interesting season as we occasionally heard the trademark Bionic sound effect which was used more towards season's end. In this season, Steve encountered another Bionic Man who was emotionally unstable, plus he would return in season three. The biggest highlight of the season was the introduction (and the death of) Jamie Sommers, the Bionic Woman. Season Three: I think this was when the series soared in popularity, became more kid friendly, and the Bionic sound effect was used on a regular permanent basis. The Bionic Woman, Jamie Sommers got revived and later spun off onto her own series. Then the show turned more SciFi with the 2 parter that introduced Bigfoot played by Andre the Giant. Season Four: This season plus the previous season remind me of the Incredible Hulk TV series because Bionic Woman creator Kenneth Johnson who adapted the Hulk was chief writer on the SMDM in these two seasons. We saw Steve and Jamie occasionally team up like in the 2 part Return of Bigfoot played by Ted Cassidy and the 3 part Bionic Crossover that introduced Fembots. In this season, Steve had a couple of Bionic malfunctions and he meets a boy who gets Bionic leg implants. Oddly enough though Lee Majors changed his look by sporting a mustache for most of this season which went against his look that was marketed on SMDM merchandise. In this season we were also introduced to the Russian Venus Death Probe. Dr. Ruy Wells was now played by Martin E Brooks who became a series regular at this point. Season Five was the strangest season of them all. The series made fun of itself with its story lines. There were more 2 parters than usual and although Lee Majors ditched the mustache, his hairstyle (which I thought was cool) was a late 70s'style that made Steve look more civilian and less military. Since the Bionic Woman was now on another network, he was dating other women and no longer had any interaction with Jamie. Best recommended episodes are: The Robot (Maskatron)series, Day of the Robot, Run Steve Run, and Return of the Robot Maker. Episodes with Jamie Sommers, The Bionic Woman and her season three return episode, plus Welcome Home Jamie which kick started her own series, The Secret of and Return of Bigfoot 2 parters, but avoid the season five episode, Bigfoot V, the Seven Million Dollar Man and the Bionic Criminal with the other Bionic Man played by Monte Markham, the Death Probe 2 parters as well as episodes like Dr. Wells is Missing, The Pioneers, The Deadly Replay, Stranger in Broken Fork, Look a Like, Hocus, Pocus, and the 2 part Dark Side of the Moon, these three episodes guest star Jack Colvin, who would later play Jack McGee on the Incredible Hulk. Also, the Price of Liberty with Chuck Connors, Target in the Sky, The 2 hour episodes, Bionic Boy and the Thunderbird Connection, The 3 part Bionic Crossover Kill Oscar, and from season five, the best ones are the 2 part Sharks, Killer Wind, the Cheshire Project, and the series final episode, the Moving Mountain. I also wanted to mention 4 episodes, Rescue of Athena One, The Peeping Blonde, The Golden Pharoah, and Nightmare in the Sky. These four all guest starred Farrah Fawcett, Lee Major's then wife and future Charlie's Angels star. There's a little over 100 episodes, but this series is great.

I remember seeing the ambulance coming right in to the school yard to pick him up [a funny side note, his name was Stephen!]. Anyway, I think season 1 and 2 were the only worthwhile episodes. Things started getting really silly in season 3 with the Bigfoot episodes. It was always better when the stories remained fully human interest, with no aliens, E.S.P, Bigfoot, or the death probe.

Hs is 'rebuilt' with bionic parts ( as Freddie Starr said at the time: \"He's got everything bionic, hasn't he? Well, almost everything!\" ), turning him in the process into a superman. Austin can now run at incredible speeds, see things over a long distance, and with one arm rip off safe doors and punch holes in walls ( a useful ability should one accidentally lock oneself out of the house ). The makeover costs six million dollars ( a lot of money then. Today he would be lucky to get a bionic big toe for that amount ). Keen to get their money's worth, the U.S. Government puts Austin to work for the O.S.I. ( Office of Strategic Intelligence ), headed by Oscar Goldman ( Richard Anderson ).<br/><br/>Each week, Austin would be sent round the world on some dangerous mission such as assisting a Russian scientist to defect or recovering stolen microfilm - one that required the use of his extraordinary powers. Beautiful girls including Britt Ekland, Martine Beswick, Michele Carey, Jane Merrow, and Lee Majors' then wife Farrah Fawcett cropped up an awful lot, none able to resist our hero's charms. Bits of him may have required an M.O.T. every now and then, obviously not the bits they were interested in.<br/><br/>The villains were by and large foreign saboteurs or evil scientists out to seize power. The late Henry Jones played a robot inventor called 'Dolenz' in no less than three episodes. 'Bigfoot' showed up more than once too; he wasn't the real Sasquatch, of course, but an android used by aliens to guard their secret base. Then there was 'Death Probe', a N.A.S.A. device designed to explore and study alien planets which went berserk after crash landing on Earth.<br/><br/>All this was great fun if you, like me, was eleven years old back in '74. The novel 'Cyborg' by Martin Caidin formed the basis for the pilot. Mark Gatiss cited the opening title sequence as one of his all-time favourites. Footage of Austin's crash backed by dramatic music led to an animated version of Austin's rebirth, leading to that famous voice-over: \"Gentlemen, we can rebuild him. We have the technology...the capability to make the world's first bionic man. Steve Austin will be that man. Better, stronger, faster!\". We would then see him lifting weights and running like the wind, and hear Oliver Nelson's theme in all its glory. Depicting Austin running fast was a problem for the producers. Initially, they sped up the film, but this made him look like Benny Hill, so they went to the other extreme by slowing him down, managing to convey a sense of power without looking too silly.<br/><br/>The show was a pop culture phenomenon. Playgrounds the world over were full of children pretending to be Austin, before going home and playing with toys associated with the series. I still have the books along with a pair of Annuals. It captured the imagination of an entire generation in a way that few shows, before or since, have managed. It wasn't an original idea, of course. The British show 'The Champions' also featured superhuman secret agents. The timing for 'The Six Million Dollar Man' was right because in the aftermath of Vietnam and Watergate it reassured American viewers that their country was still a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>Parodies abounded. Les Dawson became 'The Fifty Pence Man' on his 'Les Sez' show, while Eric Sykes' B.B.C. series featured an episode in which he dreamt he was bionic. As late as 1985, Ben Elton's 'Happy Families' featured 'The Man Who Cost A Lot'.<br/><br/>Though not the world's greatest actor, Lee Majors was perfect for the role of Austin ( though his dress sense occasionally left a lot to be desired. And why did he grow that cheesy moustache? ). Richard Anderson made Goldman a likable authority figure. He and Steve did not get along initially but then became friends. Martin Balsam played 'Dr.Rudy Wells' in the pilot, Alan Oppenheimer replaced him, but it is Martin E.Brooks who is best remembered now in the role.<br/><br/>In a decade when science fiction was considered pass\u00e9 in the aftermath of the Apollo moon landings, 'The Six Million Dollar Man' defied expectations by enjoying a solid five year run. Like many shows though, it 'jumped the shark' - particularly when it brought in other bionic characters. I did not mind 'The Seven Million Dollar Man', put up with 'The Bionic Woman' ( I rather fancied her ), but when her spin-off started, and 'Bionic Boy' and 'Bionic Dog' came along I used what was left of my bionic strength to switch the television set off. There were a number of 'reunion' movies in the '80's ( one of them guest starred Sandra Bullock ), but for me the original remains the best. I still enjoy reruns. Scientists may perfect bionics someday, and I hope its soon so I can go bounding around the place in my checked jacket and flares, just as Steve used to do.<br/><br/>( This review is dedicated to the memory of my friend Kevin William Jones, the number one 'bionic' fan, who passed away on 23rd December 2010, aged 47 )", "rating": 10, "helpful": "5 out of 6 found this helpful.", "date": "20 April 2008"}, {"title": " What a fantastic TV series.", "content": "I loved this show and still do.

Considering the time it was made, I think it was good value for money.<br/><br/>The show attracted huge audience ratings on the Universal and NBC Television Station between 1974 and 1978.<br/><br/>Lee Majors (born Harvey Lee Yeary),before playing the Bionic Man,he featured in \"The Big Valley\" as Heath Barkley(1965),\"The Ballad of Andy Crocker\" as Andy Crocker(1969). I believe it was The Six Million Dollar Man that made him hugely popular. Other sources may argue and say it was \"The Fall Guy\". Colonel Steve Austin, aka the Six Million Dollar Man was definitely a role Majors was born to play and he certainly made it his own. Other sources claim that Monte Markham was to play the role before the role was given to Majors. <br/><br/>However, Markham did get the chance to feature in a few of the Six Million Dollar Man episodes,(\"The Seven Million Dollar Man\" and \"The Bionic Criminal\").<br/><br/>'How much did he cost?' 'This man had one bionic arm', 'two bionic legs', and 'a bionic eye'. 'How fast could he run?' Well, he's hit sixty miles per hour. 'Oscar Goldman'(played by Richard Anderson) must be very proud'.<br/><br/>Although I find it difficult to pick a favourite,because all the episodes were good. Here are a few of my favourite episodes that I can recall: 1. \"The Seven Million Dollar Man\" (November 1974) 2. \"The Bionic Woman Part 1&amp;2\" (March 1975) 3. \"Day of the Robot\" (February 1974) 4. \"The Bionic Criminal\" (November 1975) 5. \"The Return of the Bionic Woman Part 1&amp;2\" (September 1975) 6. \"The Return of the Robot Maker\" (January 1975) 7. \"Population Zero\" (January 1974) 8. \"The E.S.P. Spy\" (March 1975) 9. \"Hocus - Pocus\" (January 1976).<br/><br/>I believe if they follow the 1970's format by keeping the music sound in the series it will work. There is so much going on politically around the world and I am sure there is a lot to come up with. Look at Hawaii Five O.

I was exactly seven years old when the show first premiered as a weekly event and while seeing the very beginnings of the series are hazy recollections at best it quickly became THE weekly television event in our household. At least as far as I was concerned -- back then parents actually regulated stuff like what TV you watched and where you went after school. We each got to pick one show to watch every weekend (no TV on school nights!) and I always picked The Bionic Man. The few times I was forced to miss it due to groundings or family scheduling conflicts were absolutely traumatic. I literally had no idea how the epic \"Secret of Bigfoot\" turned out for a whole year waiting for it to go into rerun phase because of a behavioral infraction the week of part two. Take it for granted that I never screwed up like that again.<br/><br/>For my money the show was better than \"Star Trek\" because it was (at first, at least) far less pompous. We didn't necessarily tune in to learn anything, we tuned in to watch Colonel Steve Austin bust through walls, jump over buildings and throw stuff with that bionic screeching projectile sound effect. Eventually the show demonstrated to us how to be good citizens, see right from wrong and appreciate the military industrial complex. Eventually the show lost it's edginess and became routine, with disco mustaches and Bionic Woman &amp; Farrah Fawcett guest appearances that intruded on our fun.<br/><br/>But man, all the memories: Sasquatch, The Death Probe, John Saxon as a faceless robot squawking backwards, the weekly opening segment, Oscar Goldman with his omnipotent phone in a briefcase, Steve's Mercedes and custom belt buckle, and who can forget that sweet jacket covered with NASA mission patches. What the heck was that supposed to mean? Though you must admit that just like Kirk's v-necked wrap tunic, anybody else other than Colonel Steve Austin would have looked like an idiot paravanting around in it.<br/><br/>Seriously, sometimes I wonder what people REALLY watch these days on television, and what brings them back week after week. Watching people dance or forage for coconuts or sing, yeah whatever. Even the fiction shows of today that are considered \"hits\"; what's the deal with them? How do they keep audiences tuning in every week, buying the products that are being advertised and turning into hysterics when a particular series is threatened with cancellation? Back when SMDM (as we call it for short) was the thing we honestly didn't know if he would be back the next week ... not because the show might have been canceled, but because for all we might know he could have been KILLED every week. He wasn't just some actor playing a role, we believed in this show. And not just because we were dumb kids, but because it was convincing, absorbing and oh so brain dead stupid.<br/><br/>You honestly couldn't help but love it, and when I mean \"convincing\" I am not referring to the bionic special effects, I mean that we believed in the little microcosm this television show inhabited. It involved us as viewers and engaged our imaginations, which is not something I have encountered on TV in a live action show since \"The X-Files\" started to suck. There's no way to deny that once SMDM became a ratings hit and the Bionic Man a childhood icon it became muddled and weak, though even in it's last season there were some wonderful SMDM moments.<br/><br/>What's more important is that the show has endured the passage of time, perhaps mostly because it hasn't to this date (April 2008) been remade or otherwise ruined: The image of Colonel Steve Austin in his polyester lounge suits flipping over cars and chasing Bigfoot around the woods has remained intact, aside from some later years made for TV movies that I somehow managed to miss.

There is the humour. I agree that My Little Pony:Friendship is Magic is very winning in its humour, there are many times where I was amused by the situations and writing. Not all of it is funny though, the show manages to convey some poignancy as well without being too schmaltzy.<br/><br/>There is also the characters. Other than the lessons and the humour, the characters and the way they interact are what make the show work. All the characters are genuinely cute and engaging without leaving a bad taste in the mouth, and they are simple yet interact so well with each other and they also have unique personalities. The story lines are also simple but well paced and quite clever, and the writing is cute, funny and poignant. I also liked the animation, the colours are bright and breezy, the backgrounds are ethereal-looking and the character designs are adorable, and the music is lovely complete with an infectious theme tune.<br/><br/>Overall, a huge surprise and if given a chance without prejudice well worth watching. 10/10 Bethany Cox", "rating": 10, "helpful": "175 out of 234 found this helpful.", "date": "27 March 2011"}, {"title": " Awesome show", "content": "What this show has, that this world lacks is an emphasis on on friendship.

So I watched it and OM Freaking G WAS IT GOOD!!! This show has everything you could ever want! great colour, completely memorable characters and HIGH-larious facial expressions. But enough of that let's take a look at the plot shall we? Okay so the focus of this show is a Unicorn pony named Twilight Sparkle (getit it supposed to be like the sparkly vampires in Twilight (God I shudder at the memories..)She spends most of her sweet time in her library in Canterlot (the capital city of Equestria where the show takes place). Seeing her lack of social skills Equestria's ruler Princess Celestia sends her of to The community of Ponyville to learn about the magic of friendship because that's what it says in the show's title 'Freindship is Magic) so she heads to Ponyville with her loyal, hard-working but comical assistant a baby dragon named Spike who's always with her no matter the scrapes he get's into.<br/><br/>As she makes friends in the place she tries to find out more about The Elements of Harmony a powerful kind of magic in order to stop the return of a malevolent Alicorn (Unicorn/Pegasis hybrid) who is to plunge Equestria into an entity of everlasting night and doom. I won't say anymore about the story you'll have to watch the first two episodes to find out. yup. You're gonna have to wacth this.<br/><br/>We then have her friends who are always with her in her many adventures ((All female by the way just so you know) First their's Applejack the western apple-harvester, Rainbow Dash the completely awesome tomboy and fastest pegasi in the land as well as long-time admirer of Equestria's personal aerobatic squadron 'The Wonderbolts', Fluttershy the cute one who would rather look after animals than engage in activities that involve noise, attention and danger. Rarity the fabulous one who's goal is to bring out a Ponie's inner beauty as long as they don't trail in dirt on the way in and Finally Pinkaminea Dianne Pie OR Pinkie Pie for short who is undeniably the most random, party obsessed and hyper-active pony you could ever meet (She is also the most famous character from the show.)

The cartoon, unlike it's \"ancestors\", the 4th gen My little pony isn't aiming for only girls, but for males as well, even older people. That is why the show is so popular as it is. The demographics on Youtube show that the show is mostly popular with males who are around the age of 18-24. It is full of funny situations in which the main cast has to face different types of problems, and successfully solve every single one of them. The show is also praised by many of it's viewers for the excellent character development, and thus in a small time span created a huge fan base. Unlike many producers, Lauren Faust often talks with fans of MLP about the show itself, and so uses some of the fans ideas, like the over and over appearance of Derpy Hooves - A fan-named pony which appeared first in the first episode as a background character. The cartoon itself is praised as well for the huge amount of side and background characters, who are frequently developed throughout the series. The plot is based on Twilight, a nerd-unicorn pony, being sent to Ponyville by the order of Princess Celestia. Twilight has been sent there to meet other ponies and develop a friendship with every single one of them. There are 5 ponies she becomes best friends with: Fluttershy, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Applejack and Rainbow Dash. Now, not to get into details too much, the show itself is really focused and the plot is nicely written. There might be some plot holes throughout the series, but they are either tiny or not important. If you have kids, you must make them watch this with you; The series can teach kids various things that are important for living.

I would not call myself a \"brony\" because I am not fully embroiled in the internet culture responsible to the peripheral demographic popularity of the show. So I'm a non-Brony male fan.<br/><br/>Firstly, it is targeted at 7 year old girls. The important word there is \"target.\" Walt Disney once said (and I paraphrase) 'you don't make products only for kids; adults are just kids ten years later.' This show takes Disney's idea and runs with it. Fun slapstick with dynamic characters never gets old.<br/><br/>Even the morals are surprisingly good; The central moral of the pilot is that making friends is as important as studying. Reflecting on my school career, I wish someone had told me that back in grade 7. What one might not realize if they do not watch both pilot episodes is that by the end, then princess reveals to Twilight that she believed in her the whole time and never intended to make her quit all studying. Other morals include: accept help when it is offered, make intelligent compromises, sometimes it helps to just ask, even feminine girls can be clever and strong, and don't bite off more than you can choose.<br/><br/>It is legitimately funny. The show is fully of one-liners that are infinity repeatably. This is largely the reason for it's internet success. Such lines include \"it's nice, but needs to be 20% cooler\", \"I could do it in 10 seconds flat\", and \"Flutter-shy is not a tree\"<br/><br/>Lastly, I'd say that the best thing about to show is the cast of characters. They are each dynamic; they learn and grow; they surprise you; they are distinct; they are all utilized in the story.<br/><br/>For more information, the first season is easy to find on popular internet video sharing sites.

Once you've viewed it, it's not hard to understand why this show is good. Simply put, it's fun where it has to be, lighthearted, and deals with a number of difficult subjects in a tactful manner.<br/><br/>The entire premise of the show deals with the weekly adventures of six ponies (not counting the Cutie Mark Crusaders) as they discover the true meaning of friendship, the ups and downs of it, and understanding the power that such bonds have.<br/><br/>The animation uses Adobe Flash and it gets a LOT of mileage. It's not breathtaking nor will it blow your mind, but for the target audience (and unintended whom grew up on the Internet), it's perfect. The show is brightly colored without being a headache. Also, in certain episodes, it is used to massively dramatic effect when switched up/toned down. Some of the more \"intense\" animation scenes do make one nod in approval. It's meant to be cute without being \"cutesy\".<br/><br/>The voice acting is simply top notch. The talent involved would be enough to make Pixar take notice. The crew is extremely versatile and talented. The songs (usually one per episode minimum) are cute and catchy without being painful, and the entire ensemble shines. The individual characters are distinctive, full of personality, and engaging to follow.<br/><br/>The show follows an \"adventure of the week\" format rather then over-arching multi-episode stories for the most part, but this fits the motif of the show and means anyone can pick it up without missing a beat. The characters continue to evolve over the course of the show, and there is sufficient nods to the previous episodes \"lessons\" to keep the continuity hounds happy. It's not perfect, but there are more hits then misses. Even then, the misses are negligible.<br/><br/>Where this show really shines, for the target audience, is how it deals with subjects like racism, tolerance, self esteem and staying true to what you believe in. The more touchy subjects are taken care of in a subtle manner, but they are there when you think about it after the fact. Long story short, the creative team did an incredibly fine job. More or less, if the subject matter were a baseball, it gets crushed 450 feet time and again.<br/><br/>For the parents, there is enough witty dialogue and humorous situations to keep them entertained without boring them to death. This helps to make the show unique in the fact it can be genuinely entertained by the whole family. The character development of the Mane cast (see what I did there?) helps in this regard. There are no pauses to force a lesson down and the pacing of the shows tends to be \"just right\".<br/><br/>As far as the \"Bronies\", Hasbro tends to embrace them as well. They don't flag parody videos for the most part, keep them engaged in various ways and give them a few token bones in the show itself. While one character, Derpy Hoooves, got named and was later redacted for obvious reasons, this is just an example of how they try to appease the Bronies. Granted, this wasn't the best example, but it shows the lengths they are willing to go. They do this right 99% of the time.<br/><br/>Make no mistake though, Hasbro and Faust (whom did the most to resurrect the franchise) stay focused on the target audience and that is where the magic to this show is, and I think that's what does it. They've evolved as necessary while staying true to the original premise of the show. New characters come, such as the CMC, that add rather then detract from the show. Minor characters, such as Big Macintosh and Cheerilee, get their own episode as well. Ultimately though, the show never strays from the premise. These things are always a precarious balancing act and the Powers That Be, with this show, do it well.<br/><br/>Basically, \"My Little Ponies: Friendship is Magic\" manages to blend multiple elements and makes it click in a way that's enticing and just downright fun. Granted that Hasbro and their crew did this to help a flagging franchise, but they really do have lightning in a bottle with this show. It succeeds on many, if not all levels.

Created by Lauren Faust who did work on the Power Puff Girls, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, and so on. Lauren manages to take a girl's toy and turn it into a show that not only girls can love, but boys as well. The show takes place in the land of Equestria ruled by 2 rulers, Princess Celestia who controls day, and Princess Luna who rules over night. The show centers around a young studious unicorn pony named Twilight Sparkle who is very gifted in magic and smart, but refuses to make friends. She is assisted by her roommate and assistant, Spike, a sarcastic baby dragon. Twilight is forced to leave Canterlot, and go to Ponyville to make friends. There she meets Pinkie Pie, a party maniac, Applejack, a tough cowgirl, Rainbow Dash, a fast pegasus with an attitude, but is kind hearted, Rarity, another unicorn who is skilled in making fashionable dresses, and Fluttershy, a pegasus who's more down to Earth and can communicate with animals. Twilight at first rejects friendship, but overtime learns the value of it, and with her new friends they learn the magic of friendship. Now at first it sounds cheesy, but don't be deceived. The characters are well developed and in some episodes we learn about their back story, and how they came to be. Everyone is likable and no one is annoying. The humor is also another highlight. Pinkie Pie does random things that are hilarious, and there are good jokes and gags galore in this show. The plots are rehashed, but they are actually pretty good, and each one has a good moral to them. The morals are good as well like accepting help from others, and so on. They aren't shoved into your face like most shows these days. The artwork is excellent with characters drawn beautifully, sets are great and original, and the colors are perfect. The animations is also superb, and is smooth in this show. There are also several musical numbers in some episodes that while good have a tendency to drag. This show is just pure awesomeness.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: In a sea of endless bad cartoons on CN and Nick, the HUB does a wonderful job bringing a show like this on the air.

I hope this show gets accepted for even more seasons, 2 is simply not enough.

My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, has done something I would never believe possible, it softened the cold and unforgiving heart of the internet.<br/><br/>Lauren Faust is one of a few producers and creators that have ended a long and harsh drought in the cartoon industry, by making a show that is as fun to watch for adults as it is for the kids it was intended for. And what's more, she did it with the same success as some of the great cartoons of old like \"Tiny Toons\" and \"Animaniacs.\" The animation and design is top notch; very smooth, even when the episodes get fast paced. The sets and characters are very colourful and bright without being a strain on the eyes. Despite the fact that almost every single character model is exactly the same, the colours, hair and tail design, even the character's body language make every single one unique. even the background characters, which are really just ponies made to fill space, get this treatment, leading to some of them getting treated by the fans with the same love that the main 6 do.<br/><br/>Speaking of the characters, they are the backbone of this entire show. Each one is unique and can be related too in some way. When you think you've found out just who your favourite is, some other one will do something that makes you feel another strong emotion for them, changing your perception and their position in your eyes. The main six characters are just brimming with personality, so much so that the dialog and jokes just seem to write themselves. They're not just a bunch of girls who like tea parties and playing dress up, they each have jobs and roles in the community that set them apart. Applejack is a hard working farm girl who can also bake, and always spares time to help others in the the town of Ponyville, even putting them before herself. Rainbow Dash is the town weather mare who is in charge of the daily weather around Ponyville and is also in training to become a part of an aerial show team called \"The Wonderbolts\" (sort of like the Blue Angels); though she's brash and a bit lazy, she's loyal to her friends and her home and will bravely stand up to any challenge. Rarity is a fashion designer who actually makes all her own clothes (which makes her a good role model for those who wish to use their artistic abilities to run their own business); at times she can be a little arrogant and a perfectionist, she's willing to put those aside and be a generous friend and capable of using her wits to sort out a problem. Fluttershy is a kind and soft spoken animal lover who, even despite her shy and timid nature, will stand up to danger in order to protect her friends. Pinkie Pie helps run a bakery and sweets shop, and in her free time sets up surprise parties for her friends and the other residents of Ponyville; though some will find her obnoxious, she's a fun loving and hyper pony who just wants to make the world smile. Finally there's Twilight Sparkle, a highly intellectual and resourceful pony, she is the librarian of the towns tree house library; though she was once an asocial pony, through the course of the show she learns from her new friends how to be a person, and wants nothing more than to help others and to learn all that she can.<br/><br/>The personalities of each one of the main cast drive the stories of each episode as they bounce off one another and even many one off characters that visit Ponyville, who are also brimming with personality and flair.<br/><br/>But even great characters need great voice actors, and this show has phenomenal voice actors, some are even able to act for multiple characters and still give each a unique and fantastic performance. A good example of how great this voice acting is in the well written song portions of the episode. You will find your self humming the catchy tunes of \"Winter Wrap Up,\" \"At the Gala\" and many others long after you hear them.<br/><br/>I could rant all day about how well crafted this cartoon is, and even longer about how talented the fan base is, but I think I've gone on long enough, and really the best thing I could do is to tell you to just give the show a try. Yes, it's My Little Pony. Yes, it was made with 8 year old girls in mind. But this show is about more than cute little equines and their adventures in a magical land, it's about a group of friends with both flaws and strengths exploring and expanding the bonds between themselves and others.<br/><br/>It's a fantastic show and I have no shame in saying that I absolutely love My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and everypony should give this show a try and watch a few episodes.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "34 out of 53 found this helpful.", "date": "6 January 2012"}]}, "/title/tt10098248/": {"title": "The Food That Built America", "reviews": [{"title": " Fascinating insights into what drove food tycoons to succeed", "content": "Kudos to History Channel for a riveting and well-made documentary about visionaries with ambition, drive, a thirst for success, and a willingness to risk everything on an untested, untried idea for a food that no one had experienced before.<br/><br/>This three-part six-plus-hour documentary follows the failure and success of several now-household product names from entrepreneurs Henry Heinz, Will and John Kellogg, Frank and Forrest Mars, Charlie Post and his ambitious daughter Marjorie, Milton Hershey, Harland Sanders, Clarence Birdseye, the two McDonald brothers, and the nearly-forgotten John Pemberton and his invention, Coca-Cola. Their tales are set against the backdrop of a country that, in the space of less than a century, evolved from a largely agrarian culture to the leader of the free world.<br/><br/>Each story is told by well-cast and talented actors, and supported by interviews with food historians, history professors, and food writers. The dramatizations take us to earlier times when success was far from assured, and failure and bankruptcy a real possibility.<br/><br/>The sets are stunning. Some exterior shots were done on location. I did wonder whether many of the interior scenes were filmed at the actual locations where they first occurred. They're first rate.<br/><br/>The people interviewed (primarily corporate and culinary historians) add their own in-depth knowledge to each tale. Whether they're discussing Hershey, or the Kellogg brothers, or Sanders, or one of the other culinary pioneers, each stresses that while they're household names today, success was not assured. Indeed, several of these 'food pioneers' went bust -- some more than once -- only to claw their way back up. Two world wars and a great depression challenged them to the point of failure, while post-war booms presented untold opportunities.<br/><br/>The people chosen each invented a food (or developed new ways to prepare or sell food) that had never existed before. In each case, they had to convince a skeptical public to try something new and unique, which meant big risk and long hours. In the end, each succeeded, and most of them reaped both fame and fortune.<br/><br/>The tale of the Kellogg brothers is intimately intertwined with that of C.W. Post, and their shared history is riveting. The same can be said of the friendship, then rivalry, then all-out war between two candy titans -- Hershey's Chocolate and Mars, Inc.<br/><br/>The histories of these food tycoons are somewhat different, but they shared the same goal: to change the way America looked at food. It was their overwhelming drive to succeed, and their certainty that their idea was the one America was waiting for, that finally paid off.

There was even a show; with Vincent Price as the Saint. The defining Saint was of course Roger Moore's Simon Templar.  A suave, sophisticated jet setter who always was available to do a good deed.  His character had an edge; a perception at least, of an international rogue. He was first and foremost a man with a strong sense of right and wrong and would do anything to make things right. The Saint ran from 1962-1969 and is still beloved and with good reason. Roger Moore does the Saint with a flair and the supporting characters are always well defined and twists and turns of the plot are always there. There was an informal ensemble cast and many of the same actors play different characters. I had mixed feelings about Inspector Teal (Ivor Dean), he is always duped and his character, although well played, was a bit of an idiot.  Still Inspector Teal had some charm.

The series concerns a man who is described as being a modern day Robin Hood of crime. Roger Moore truly is Simon Templar - no one else comes close. R.I.P. Broadcast from 1962 until 1969, 118 episodes is quite an achievement and they are mostly great. \"The Saint\" was able to evolve with the times, just like \"The Avengers.\" The black and white episodes have a bit more in the way of intrigue and mystery. Simon Templar would sometimes gather all the suspects in one room and present his findings - shades of Hercule Poirot. The colour ones aimed for being more trendy and rather larger-than- life. Templar usually acted as a one man army in his crime-fighting activities and feared no one. His cool demeanour spoke volumes. The writers admitted that they usually had to insert a middle section in an episode because there wasn't one included in the original story. Leslie Charteris never seemed very happy or satisfied with the series on the whole. What he perhaps failed to realise, was that the series had to keep Simon Templar in a more contemporary setting. Otherwise, the whole thing would have looked old fashioned. There are far too many great episodes to list but on the whole, about 90% or more are of a high standard. The music for the shows theme is very effective. There were 3 different tunes and the first one is the best in my opinion. I know the scale of the series was quite small, with not much location filming. I can easily overlook this.

And did US interest in these Brit ITC shows wane when the Beatles broke up and swinging London faded away ?

In a time of oversexed young white sitcoms, Newsradio relied on brilliant writing, expert character development, and excellent plots to drive it along. No gimmicks needed. Each character had a role to fill, and they filled it well. All of the cast members are excellent, with no misfires. Everyone has classic episodes they like to talk about.<br/><br/>Still, as excellent as this is, there are a few minor flaws. For one, Khandi Alexander never got as much screen time as she deserved, and this is no doubt why she left the show. She tried to be a Bill McNeal foil, but Dave served that function already. She seemed like an excellent actress, and her character seemed to be geniune, but nothing ever seemed to happen--in fact, I cannot readily recall any episode where the plot line was based on her save for her departure and maybe some of the Joe-Catherine romance episodes.<br/><br/>I like Jon Lovitz, and, unlike others, I found him to be just as capable as Phil Hartman to be in Newsradio. I believe that his performance did, in fact, grow as the last seasoned progressed (watch his hire date vs. some of the later shows--his character certainly changes). He did serve better playing off of other characters, such as Beth and (surprisingly) Lisa, and the few shows that center on him are indeed subpar. Still, some of the best episodes (in my opinion) are in the last season (the apartment hunt, Matthew's 30th birthday, Joe Jitzu), so Lovitz's appearance couldn't have changed the show that much.<br/><br/>Some shows just didn't work. Some of the very early ones are heavy on the Dave/Lisa romance, and did use just as many sex-related jokes as other sitcoms of the time. Some shows try to cram three plot lines in one episode, and Newsradio needs time to develop. Some rely way too heavily on Andy Dick's slapstick or Jimmy's over-the-top schemes. And some just don't make sense (the Dilbert episode did little for me).<br/><br/>All this, however, is little detriment to the show at large.

Add a former member of one of the most popular Sketch comedy shows in the world, The Kids In The Hall: Dave Foley. A gifted comedian and a very good actor as well. Probably the most versatile player out of the 5 \"Kids\", Foley is the base flavor that keeps the show balanced, like a carefully prepared stock.<br/><br/>Add another former Sketch player from the award winning Ben Stiller Show: Andy Dick. Dick plays probably the most ridiculous character to ever be employed in any capacity. Picture a 30 year old man with the mind of a 15 year old girl. A great physical comedian, Andy Dick is an acquired taste akin to cilantro- strong, sometimes overpowering, but improves almost anything to which its added.<br/><br/>What?! Another gifted comedian straight from a great sketch comedy show? Of course I refer to Phil Hartman, without question the most consistent and versatile actor ever to be featured on the uneven series Saturday Night Live. Mr. Hartman, who left the show abruptly due to his untimely demise, was the potato in this dish- so consistent you sometimes forget how amazing he could be.<br/><br/>Maura Tierney and Khandi Alexander were given what were probably the most \"straight\" roles, usually only involved in storylines which involved sex or relationships with the men on the show. Both are very talented actresses but neither contributed nearly as many laughs as the three men above. Their roles were essentially sauces, breaking up the flavor and adding different sweet, rich notes.<br/><br/>Vicky Lewis, on the other hand, was quite like the female version of Andy Dick. Instead of cilantro, however, she was the hot pepper- and not just because of her red hair. She was a foil for every character, taking no one seriously while doing as little work as possible. Again, not a favorite character for most because of her caustic screen presence. Hmmm... this tastes pretty good so far, but it needs something more... Perhaps some vegetables... well, kids don't like their vegetables and immature adults don't like to be told what to do. So Stephen Root, the hilarious Billionaire/Owner of WNYX, is the bitter vegetable- unyielding and necessary for good health.<br/><br/>OK, we have our meat, our potatoes, our vegetables and our sauce as well as the important herbs and spices. But... this doesn't taste good. It tastes flat. We need something which improves every flavor it comes in contact with.

That show Brooke Shields did during this time seemed almost a duplicate right down to the red head. The episodes in this one ran mostly hot, with the occasional cold episode. Most of the cast was on fire, however Andy Dick's character sometimes proved to be a bit to much. Khandi Alexander left a bit of void when she left, however the show probably had to many characters as it was so it probably was best she left as the show had enough people to focus on.

This telenovela is a very handsomely-produced and directed romantic thriller similar to the excellent 2016 British romantic thriller \"The Night Manager.\"<br/><br/>The main strength is the actors playing the hero and heroine: Sebastian Rulli (as Miguel Garza) and especially Renata Notni (as Adela Cruz). To say these two actors have chemistry is an understatement. And Ms. Notni is one of the most charismatic actors I have ever seen; and, Mr. Rulli is not far behind. This is what is so great about streaming services: Americans like me can watch excellent tv/theatrical movies and actors from other countries. I think with this production, Mexico has joined South Korea and Spain on that level. And I hope Mr. Rulli and Ms. Notni will get a chance to star or co-star in major Hollywood movies. (I recommend watching their performance with subtitles; not with dubbing.)<br/><br/>Other strengths are the elegant and clever dialogue written for Mr. Rulli and Ms. Notni when they speak to each other, as well as the bad guys' non-politically-correct dialogue. Add to this the excellent cinematography; and, most of the twists are well-thought-out; they do not occur because of contrivances.<br/><br/>There are some flaws. Two irritating ones are the many storylines crisscrossing one another; and, the makeup. The investigative journalism portion is not even needed, distracting from the main story. And making up Mexican actors to look Japanese seemed very amateurish. No money for Japanese actors?<br/><br/>But the major flaw by far in my opinion--and why I selected a spoiler alert with this review--is the fate of one of the principal characters at the end of Series 2.

I would have preferred they had stuck to the military action stories each week and skipped the soap operas, but I understand they want more than just a male audience. Also, lulls were needed to break up the intense action here and there.<br/><br/>All the characters, male and female, were interesting. Of the males, I had no problem with Dennis Haysbert (\"Jonas Blane\") in the lead role. His character dominated the action stories. His deep voice and authoritative manner made him a very believable person as the leader of these missions The other, younger guys are fine, too. Their spouses run the gamut from experienced military wives to very young newlywed-rookies. Two of the three major female characters, however, had serious flaws: \"Tiffy\" as an adulterer, and \"Molly\" as a frequent liar. Speaking of moral issues, what turned me off more than anything was the commander \"Col. Tom Ryan\" (Robert Patrick) of this elite unit being the one having the affair with\"Tiffy!\" Hey, I know everyone is human and subject to many daily sins but this seemed out of place and out of character with most everything else presented here.<br/><br/>Oh, well, for the most part, the characters in this military show are honorable, brave and, hopefully by the second season a little better people, morally-speaking.

It offers an extremely realistic idea of what the Delta Force and other secret organisations actually get up to behind the headlines. But also it gives an idea of their home life, far from the solitary, playboy existence we think off, instead they have real wives and children, money problems and doubts.<br/><br/>Real incidents taken from the book abound in the series, the mission to Iran fails because of a dust storm just as the real attempt to rescue the American Embassy hostages did. The team use specially doctored rifle rounds to kill an assassin without harming any bystanders, just as Haney did against Hezbollah snipers who were attacking US Marines in Lebannon. An old special forces colleague turns up working for South American narco-guerillas just as an ex-Green Beret friend of Haney's did in real life. <br/><br/>Of course it isn't perfect, sometimes the lack of budget shows. Our heroes have an unrealistic ability to blend in amongst any surroundings, even where a Caucasian, Hispanic or Afro-American face would instantly cause suspicion. They seem to be able to speak every language and master every skill, Jonas even taking command of a submarine at one point (forgiveable of course as sticking with the same characters allows the viewers to maintain continuity). The enemy seem to die instantly when shot whilst the team are constantly wounded and recover fully by the next ep. I was disappointed that they were able to track down Hector's killer, it would have been better had he just remained some random, faceless militiaman who gets away with it. I would also like to have seen Bob struggle with his drug addiction more, it seemed too easy for him to resolve. One annoying factor is that they're nearly always right, I would like to see them more fallible and other people who have a different point of view to sometimes be proved correct, you're not necessarily worthless just because you don't have the Ranger tab. When a technical expert says his task will take a certain amount of time it seems unfair to just arbitrarily give him a fraction of the period required then shout at him when he can't deliver what he always said was impossible. Also apart from Colonel Ryan there appear to be no other officers in The Unit, everyone is an NCO?<br/><br/>Possibly the most ruthless 'heroes' ever to exist, never hesitating to make hard choices and moral compromises, make bad decisions based on necessarily limited intelligence, kill in cold blood, risk civilian casualties, kidnap and torture for the greater good (despite Dennis Haybert's assertion on the commentary, his character shoots 2 people in the kneecap for information and threatens many more. I wonder what his friends in 'Move On' thought of that?). What other show would you have the good guys shooting dead an unarmed young boy in the back as he ran away in order to preserve the secrecy of their mission? Or bursting into a random apartment, taking an innocent family hostage and brutalising them at gunpoint, terrifying their handicapped child before killing his 14 year old brother as he goes to get help?<br/><br/>My favourite ep, Five Brothers, so damn intense with tough choices all around for everybody. My favourite characters, Mack and Tiffy, I've known soldiers like Mack and soldiers wives like Tiffy, they really convince in the roles. Their scene where Mack confronts Tiffy about her infidelity with Colonel Ryan and confesses his own is my favourite of the series. Contrary to some other reviewers I find the scenario highly realistic, I've seen servicemen cheat with their comrade's wives time after time, people are only human.<br/><br/>Some have criticised the series saying 'Every frame votes for George Bush'. I don't buy that although it's interesting in the commentaries that the cast appeal for more viewers in the 'Blue' states, the 'Red' states obviously great fans of the show. It doesn't surprise me that the actors got such a rapturous reception whenever they visited US troops overseas whilst anyone who questions The Unit's ethos on the show get's extremely short shrift.<br/><br/>All told, a truly excellent series and I'd love to have had a fifth season.<br/><br/>According to remarks and interviews made by members of the cast and crew and leaks on the internet these are some of the rumoured storyline ideas for the series finale<br/><br/>-The series would end with Jonas beginning to suffer with combat stress. This is aggravated by Bridget Sullivan being mortally wounded on a mission, her dying words forgiving Sam McBride for his fake attempted rape of her. As a result Jonas retires from the army and joins Molly in her real estate business. Mack would become an officer and he and his family would move to a permanent posting elsewhere arranged by General Ryan, giving him a conventional army training job without any combat role. Bob would leave the army due to his injuries and go to law school but he would maintain his links with the CIA and work as a training instructor/legal consultant for them. He is intended by the CIA to be their inside man on The Unit through his contacts but it is later revealed that he is actually still working for Tom Ryan and is effectively The Unit's mole within the agency. Charles Grey would be promoted to the new team leader with Sam McBride as his deputy. General Tom Ryan would get back together with his ex-wife and call in the numerous favours owed to them and his men to have The Unit once again placed under his command. The series would end with the entire cast assembled to watch Charles and Sam put potential new recruits to The Unit through their paces in order to bring their team up to full strength.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "5 out of 6 found this helpful.", "date": "18 December 2010"}, {"title": " Peyton Place in the SpecOps Community", "content": "The first rule of television is to garner ratings.

Now, I recently bought the fourth season on DVD and wish I hadn't. The stories are mostly outright silly, the look of the action and the behavior of the unit members seemed a lot less professional and the wives stories were unbearable (sometimes I wondered if I had zapped over to Desperate Housewives, other times I could not wrap my head around the craziness of sending untrained housewives on military / recon missions - who in the writing room had that idiotic idea?). The quality of the writing here was so far below that of the first two seasons and even the third that one must wonder what caused this. If I might propose a theory: During the first two seasons, Eric Haney, one of the real members of that covert ops unit, was shown in the credits as a producer. In seasons 3 and 4, his name was notably absent (although because of the writers' strike, the stories of season 3 were mostly older concepts) . And overboard went the attempts to \"keep it real\" and on went the writing room madness. A little more drama for a lot less accuracy. Very, very bad decision. Another bad decision was shifting the focus from 80% unit action and 20% wives to a near 50-50 to capture the female audience. And those horrible story lines for the wives - oh no.

Many Delta are former Ranger and Special Forces. The tactics: another flaw. Episode #2 features a team recovering a Chinese satellite behind enemy lines. One two man two provides \"overwatch\" (aka observation and security for the recovery team). They don't conceal their position, rather park a jeep on an open hilltop. \"Hello?\" Then the insurgents skate across the desert floor to intercept them leaving a visible and exposing dust signature.

If Delta is authorized to use deadly force why wait till they are on top of your position. Weapons use: Watch how they hold their weapons-enough said.

For example: our main character Sakuta doesn't really get prioritized for character development until the second half of the story and the movie, when it hits it hits hard, but it does take a little while to flesh him out and make him stand out from \"other\" anime protagonists. I've also heard some people say that Sakuta as a character is too perfect and solves everyone's problems for them rather then letting them help themselves. I don't really agree with the that criticism, but I guess I can kind of understand why you might feel that way if you don't like the characters, which is unlikely as the characters are pretty well done in the end. I've also heard a lot of people compare this show to other anime like the monogatari series. I've never seen that series but from what I've heard Rascal has enough differences to make it in no way a \"rip off\" despite its similarities. Overall, I would be lying if I said I didn't love this show. It has a couple of problems, but in the end I think it more than makes up for them.

I've been following along to Amphibia since it was first announced back in 2018 alongside The Owl House. Made by matt Braly, one of the masterminds behind Gravity Falls, I knew this show not only would be one to watch, but would have a huge legacy to maintain.<br/><br/>And so far, 2 episodes in, it's safe to say that this show is a hit. Right of the back, the intense and spectacular setting of the cartoon shows itself. IDK what people have that makes them hate animation like this? Maybe I'm not an expert but who cares! This show is breathtaking from the get go. It has a superb and very rich landscape that's been beautifully animated. It always throws out something new the longer you watch.<br/><br/>Then there's the characters. Anne and Sprig are both really solid characters so far. They're both flawed and make mistakes, but that gives them the human aspect that I truly like seeing. Other characters like Polly and Hop Pop are really funny and seem to have more to give as we go on.<br/><br/>And the elements that this show deals with a truly unique and welcoming. The whole concept of peer pressure and doing things to fit in really hit hard with me personally (as I know what Anne feels in that moment). I truly like that about the show. Who cares about animation style tbh? Story is what in my opinion makes or breaks a cartoon and so far, Amphibia has something huge being built up. What that is, just watch episode 1 ;)<br/><br/>Overall, it maybe early to call. But I truly think Amphibia is another win for Disney. The network may still have its fair share of meh shows, but it truly is giving its A game when it comes to cartoons. In a post SVTFOE and Gravity Falls Disney where Ducktales and Big City Greens are the only really good shows left that are ongoing, Amphibia fits perfectly in as a worthy successor to the dynasty that preceded it.<br/><br/>It's new. It's different. And it's unusual. It just needs to find its audience and I'm certain that Amphibia will be a worthy new cartoon for any cartoon, animation or Disney fan to watch and obsess over.<br/><br/>Take it from this die hard Gravity Falls fan.

Because Ashley Tisdale from The Suite Life of Zack and Cody got to star in the animated Disney Channel series Phineas and Ferb, I'm glad that Brenda Song also got to have a turn with that a decade after The Suite Life of Zack and Cody ended. By an amazing coincidence, I noticed that this show started one day after the reboot of The Powerpuff Girls ended, and Amanda Leighton, the new actress for Blossom from that show, voices Polly in Amphibia. Clearly the only good thing about that reboot series was that it gave new voice actresses some experience for better parts in original series going forward.<br/><br/>Anne Boonchuy opens a strange treasure chest which takes her, Sasha and Marcy to Amphibia. She becomes friends with the Plantar family after Spring Plantar saves her from the other frogs of Wartwood. While helping the Plantar family deal with their everyday problems in Wartwood and going on strange adventures with them, she wants to find Sasha and Marcy. By the end of the first episode, we know where Sasha is, but we have yet to see Marcy by the end of Season 1. I am happy that Disney Channel gave Amphibia a second season before the first premiered because they don't want it to be another 1-season show-much like Dave the Barbarian or The Buzz on Maggie, especially because I am 100% sure we will find Marcy in Season 2.

Jason seemed very real, I thought his portrayal was really natural but nicki I thought was awful, I think she's a brummy but in cuckoo she was bearable. A downgrade in the show. Her accent was just irritating. Her acting was just a bit meh. She's not really easy to like, seemed one of those control freaks who were fake nice and just not great. The rest of the characters were just OK, weren't really that engaging and seemed a waste of talented actors.<br/><br/>Some bits were amusing but none laugh out loud, I genuinely don't think this has the quality to succeed. The dynamic is off and such very little chemistry, I found it just watchable but not entertaining.<br/><br/>I'd give it a miss.

I think it started OK. Not bad, not great. Just OK. Good. For a pilot episode. In a future, I expect more. We see these girls, classic good guys - bad guys routine; one focusing on her work and doing her best; the other one a bit breaking the rules (no dating...or you're out) but also chasing the dream, being like a slot machine to her parents (IMHO, that was my very first thought when I saw her dad) and being in love; then there's this Olympic wannabe, mean little girl who won't stop until she gets what she wants, even if it means hurting someone in the way; the last one, a classic girl from the neighborhood, just starting, getting her chance, her big moment.<br/><br/>As I said it all now...Some may not like it. Of course, if you're a gymnastic athlete or huge fan, know all the routines,what is possible and is not, scoring system etc, you may find it a bit unrealistic.

When you spend 20+ hours per week in a smelly gym, you don't have time to waste on angsty teen dramas. Trust me. So, when I saw the commercials for this show, I was pretty pumped. What could be better than a TV show that I could actually relate to? I knew this show would become an instant favorite of mine.<br/><br/>I have never been so wrong\u2014and if you knew me you'd know just how horrible this show is if I'm admitting I was wrong about something. I couldn't get through the first five minutes of it without feeling offended by the mockery it makes of the sport of gymnastics. I will never understand how even non-gymnasts could tolerate one full episode of this show, let alone get invested in the characters and the story lines as some of my friends did. It's baffling. Make It or Break It is just about as bad as they come. It is silly, it is inaccurate and it is above all offensive to gymnasts.<br/><br/>If you're going to watch this show, expect horrendous acting. I've been forced to sit through episodes of Secret Life of the American Teenager and Pretty Little Liars, so I know ABC Family accepts nothing but the \"highest\" quality actors. Their actors and actresses have about the same amount of acting knowhow as I do\u2014none. The comedic scenes are ruined by the actor's lack of timing, the joyful scenes seem fake with their plastered on smiles and school girl giggling, and the dramatic scenes are just about as believable as the surprised look on a kids face when he unwraps a brand new pair of socks for Christmas. And I haven't even gotten to the gymnastics part of the review yet.<br/><br/>You'd think that with the show centering on the lives of four Olympic hopefuls, the producers would aim to create a program that real gymnasts could get behind and appreciate. ABC Family and the creators of Make It or Break It accomplished exactly the opposite of that. Great job, ABC. It was impossible to just sit back and enjoy the show without being constantly distracted by all the inaccuracies around the sport of gymnastics. It was immediately clear that the producers don't have a clue what real gymnastics is like. <br/><br/>One huge problem I had with the show right off the bat was the content of the gymnast's competitive routines. The pilot episode of the show, a crucial time for the viewer to judge a show on it's believability, features nationally ranked, elite gymnasts competing compulsory level skills. The second I saw the \"best beam routine in the country\" end with a cartwheel back tuck dismount, I lost any remaining respect I had for the whole show. Imagine Olympic All Around gold medalist Nastia Liukin, concentrating on her dismount, taking a long, deep breath, pounding down the beam, propelling herself into the air, pulling off a 2.5 twisting back layout, sticking the landing, and making the whole thing look easy. That's the kind of dismount I want to see. Not just a cartwheel back tuck.<br/><br/>That wasn't all they got wrong either. Episode after episode, they had parents allowed on the competitive floor, gymnasts conspiring against each other, girls scaring away an urban gang with cartwheels, scratched routines being performed, and a whole lot of other craziness. They even had a gymnast make herself puke up her breakfast because it was \"too fattening\". Excuse me, what? That was the last straw for me. I barely made it half way through the season before I was too disgusted to continue.

Plus, I like the gymnastics/competition parts. <br/><br/>By the end of the second season, they've managed to thoroughly shock me (happily) with four of their characters who totally break out of the typical morality play quality of most ABC shows for teens.<br/><br/>The gymnast central to the storyline learns all sorts of typical morality play lessons - then gets pregnant and drops out of the sport to live her life as a single teen mom with no prospects. Wait, what? Second, the only openly Christian character, the gym manager, (played by Family Ties alum Candace Cameron) is so sickly sweet over the top holier than thou she pisses off the rest of the characters regularly. She emotionally devastates one of the teen girls by telling her that she would always be there for her, then refusing to forgive her after the girl makes a mistake and admits it. Cameron's character frequently shocks and upsets others with her extreme moral attitude and hypocrisy, eventually forcing her to leave the gym (and the show).<br/><br/>The coach - the most positive supporting adult in the series - is openly atheist and teaches the girls about morality and forgiveness. He takes on responsibility for his actions, and encourages others to do the same. He makes the greatest sacrifice for the girls immediately after being romantically rejected by the Cameron character because he will accept her faith/values, but not join her religion.<br/><br/>A major love interest for one of the girls reveals that he is not gay, but bi, and complains that even the gay community won't accept him (insisting he must go full gay and drop girls, or he's simply still in denial).

'Ben 10' is a good show for kids, and I'm proud to say I like it. It is somehow different from the other TV shows, like Totally Spies and Teen Titans. Well, actually, I can point out some similarities between Teen Titans and Ben 10. It's about a boy who has a alien watch that can change him into 10 different aliens. No matter how lame it is , it's pretty smart for a kid's TV show. I think the animation are occasionally good and pretty flashy, but not always. The character design could be better. Much better, the character could not be any shallower, and sometimes it's very, very predictable, especially the dialogue. It deserves more credit than it is given, because it's way better than the other shows. It's moderately successful, but completely satisfying. Cartoon Network was once a good channel, but now it has shows that are just plain bad and makes you disgusted that someone has come up with the idea to make it. Not this show. Sure, it's not as brainy as The X files, but it does well compared to the other shows playing on Cartoon Network. For some people, Ben 10 is a slow paced, ridiculous show with forgettable lines and an uninteresting storyline. But for others, it is a excellent show that is exiting and funny at the same time. The TV movies are pretty bad, even for a TV movie, but the spin-off show, Ben 10 Alien force is just as good, getting better and better with each episode it progresses. Thank you 'Ben 10' creators, for bringing a good, decent show onto Cartoon Network.

It was mainly along the lines of, \"Oh, wonderful. Another pointless show to displace my favorite regulars.\" Rarely have I \"Ben\" more wrong, and rarely have I been this glad to be wrong.<br/><br/>My brothers were watching it long before I saw my first complete episode, but they will watch anything that moves on the television screen, so I thought little of it. After my first episode, I watched another, and so on. Yes, I noticed that it was primarily for 8-14 year olds, but I still found it entertaining. Here's the thing, though: yes, my brothers like it, and they are the target age group, I like it, and I am 18 years old; my dad even likes it, a little, and he's 40 and hates cartoons. I humbly submit that age has less to do with it than one might think.<br/><br/>To those of you who have not seen the series, watch it (at least one episode, start to finish) before you criticize. Okay, fine, the presentation is aimed at the younger audiences, but the concept is solid super-hero-hits-sci-fi awesomeness: A person finds a watch-like, alien device that is \"the key to an ancient power-struggle...\" (Presented like that, I'm interested already). This person (a kid in the cartoon (probably) because that is their target audience) decides to use the abilities of the watch fight for good and serve those around him. But his struggle is not so easy, as the forces of the galaxy are not all so benevolent. An alien warlord wants the device to equip an army to conquer (it's not clich\u00e9, it's classic). Now he must do battle with the evil in his own people, as well as that within other races of the galaxy. And he must do it using the powers of a device that does not enhance his own power, but gives him the great strengths of others.<br/><br/>I'd be sold after a description like that, but that's not the point. The point is that it could be one of the great superhero stories along the lines of Batman, Superman, Spider-man, etc., and maybe even a live-action movie. Maybe one day, but for now, I can't wait to see how the next episode turns out.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "36 out of 40 found this helpful.", "date": "7 July 2006"}, {"title": " The End Of A Glorious Era.", "content": "The original Ben 10 series is one of the better Cartoon Network shows I can remember from recent years. In fact, its end coincided with the end of a glorious era of adventure-oriented animated shows that were smartly written and could be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. To summarize everything in two sentences, Ben 10 tells the story of a ten-year-old boy whose boring summer vacation with his grandpa and his cousin takes an exciting turn when he -- not quite by sheer luck -- gets his hands on the most powerful device in the universe, The Omnitrix. He now has the dream prize of every narcissistic bad guy out there and that's not a good thing, to put it mildly.<br/><br/>Where to start the praise from? I guess the animation art isn't too bad; it is great, as a matter of fact. The colors aren't too bright but of the right measure, and the scenery in the background always has a realistic feel which befittingly captures the vivid imagination of its talented writers. It's not too conspicuous but that's a good thing. An integral facet of every episode, it can be safely said.<br/><br/>As for the main characters, all of them are likable as well as relatable. Ben reminds the viewer of a more mischievous incarnation of their childhood self: a not-so-typical good-hearted douche bag with a penchant for adventures which at his age is understandable. Max is the perfect blend of a strict but caring grandpa who treasures whatever little time he gets to spend with his grandchildren. The man is dignity and warmth personified. Ben's cousin sister, Gwen, is a little obnoxious (I won't sugarcoat it) but as the show progresses you tend to start acknowledging her complementary role -- accepting her nerdy but interesting ways.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the villains, most of whom are given their own menacing angles and evil motivations. Vilgax, Enoch, Zombozo, Dr. Animo, Kevin -- all made invaluable contributions to the charged, tense atmosphere of the show. Hey, the hero is only as good as the villains he's up against and Ben 10 comprehends this as well as anything.<br/><br/>This review would probably feel incomplete if I didn't give a description of the very thing that's the root of this see-saw battle: the darn watch. The Omnitrix operates by attaching itself to the holder's DNA who can then morph into any available alien of his choice. Each alien has a unique ability, and it's said that the Omnitrix in total control can unleash an army strong enough to conquer the whole universe. Talk about the very definition of a crippling responsibility. The existence of extraterrestrial beings has always been a fascinating subject of discussion for me and maybe that's why I find the concept of Ben 10 engrossing.<br/><br/>Aside from the aspects I've mentioned, the show expertly examines simple but relevant themes of good vs evil, being there for your family, and respecting the perpetual and inexplicable powers of the the earth and the universe. With the advent of technology and the increasing cockiness of the human race, such issues are more important now than ever before. That's exactly why I feel that Ben's (man) judicious use of the powerful Omnitrix (technology) in the show is a truly commendable example to its viewers. The dark themes are presented in a palatable way. For instance, the masterful episode \"The Last Laugh\" is about confronting your inner fears/demons (do not miss this one, by the way).<br/><br/>Ben 10 also has fantastic voice acting. You can expect nothing but the highest level of quality from Tara Strong and co.<br/><br/>For me at least the Ben 10 series ended with Ben still a kid. The way I see it, the new series with a teenage Ben simply isn't the same; it just isn't. The great action sequences, witty dialog, and clever storytelling are a Ben 10 trademark and Alien Force has none of the exuberance that made Ben 10 awesome in the first place.

About 10 years after the Power Rangers first became good, the youth of today is being shown the rubbish that is Operation Overdrive.

One day when i got home from school i found my brothers already watching TV, and this programme Ben 10 was on. The options were to either do homework, put a DVD on or play on the xbox 360. Being incredibly lazy, i decided to just sit down and watch the TV. 2 hours later i had watched 4 episodes of the show and couldn't believe it.

Ben 10 is a fun show with an interesting premise and a decent execution. The show centers on Ben Tennyson, a ten year-old boy, who stumbles upon an alien device that allows him to transform into different aliens. In effect, he can give himself different superpowers for a short time. It follows that the device is sought-after, creating the setup for a good story. Along with his cousin and his grandfather he begins fighting various villains they run across. The characters are real and likable and the plots are well-executed. In short, it's good entertainment.<br/><br/>Where does it fail? The most obvious failure is that Ben 10 \u2014 like so many of its cartoon brethren \u2014 lives in a limbo between an episodic style (villain-of-the-day, rather than a comedic Spongebob-style) and wanting to have an overarching plot. The short of it is that you can watch any episode regardless of chronology without feeling like you've missed something \u2014 not a good sign for a show trying to tell a larger story. Character development could, likewise, be improved. At the start of the series Ben is whiny, annoying, and rash. By the end of it? Slightly improved, but not as much as you'd assume from what he's been through. Gwen too is not developed to her full potential, while Grandpa Max is, frankly, underutilized as a character. The relationship between Ben and Gwen is also left under-developed. Generally speaking, character-developing moments just aren't seized and are left to flow by without mention. Ben and Gwen are the same people leaving the series that we meet at the start of it.<br/><br/>The action is cartoony, if entertaining. The fights are largely there because we're supposed to see some fights rather than because of natural conflict. Like most cartoons, there's lots of hitting and flashiness, but little that's actually damaging. It divorces us from the action by giving us no real sense of anyone's strengths or weaknesses. This helps hinder development even more.<br/><br/>In the end, the worst I can say about Ben 10 is that it doesn't live up to its immense potential. There's nothing wrong with it that isn't wrong with most cartoons, and Ben 10 among its peers is by far one of the better cartoons you could watch.

Goggins's insults drip with a hilarious straightforward honesty towards McBride's Gamby whilst McBride is happy to play second fiddle in the interchanges.

Of course, some may argue that isn't saying much for CARNIV\u00c0LE but it truly is a gem.  This twelve episode first season (which debuted on September 14th) tells the tales of a traveling carnival amidst 1930s depression-era America. The show primarily follows two main characters; a chain-gang escapee named Hawkins (Nik Stahl of BULLY) and a Californian Preacher man (Clancy Brown of HIGHLANDER) by the name of Brother Justin.  Both men contain mysterious powers and an unknown connection not only to each other, but also to a man from the Carnival's past named Scudder (the incomparable John Savage).<br/><br/>Young Hawkins is picked up by the carnival and hired as an extra hand. While traveling with the crew cross-country, he picks up subtle clues as to the significance of his dreams and learns more about his peculiar powers. Meanwhile, on the west coast, Brother Justin is tested time and again with his contemporaries' lack of faith and grows increasingly dangerous in his religiosity.<br/><br/>CARNIV\u00c0LE has quite the cast of familiars, some known and others known only to cult fans. Most notably is 3'7\" Michael J Anderson who plays Samson, the carnival boss. You'll most likely recognize him from David Lynch's TWIN PEAKS (1990) as the strange little fellow who spoke backwards. Andrienne Barbeau (ex wife to John Carpenter) plays a tattooed snake charmer by the name of Ruthie, Clea DuVall (BUT I'M A CHEERLEADER) plays young fortune teller Sophie, Glenn Shadix (Otho from BEETLEJUICE) appears regularly as a Californian politician, the 7'6\" Mathew McGrory (Rob Zombie's HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES and Tim Burton's BIG FISH) appears in the pilot episode, and the absolutely lovable horror favorite Bill Moseley (remembered best as Chop Top from TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2) plays Possum, the carnival's head cook.<br/><br/>The show's ultimate strength is the presentation of its visual tones, the lighting in particular is eerily beautiful. Most scenes are lit in reminiscence of the Italian Renaissance painting technique \"chiaroscure,\" in which figures stand with an almost goldenish glow in stark contrast to the dark surroundings and or backgrounds. This is most obvious in scenes of Brother Justin at home with his sister Iris (Amy Madigan). These golden tones give the overall series a cohesive thematic. This is one of the strongest atmospheric shows I've ever seen on television.  Furthermore, the grittiness and downright dirtiness of a poor traveling carnival through the dustbowls of America's Midwest is developed by the show's creators as yet another layer of ambiance. The characters appear dirtier and sweatier each progressing episode as they travel further south.<br/><br/>Being carried by HBO and not a mere network station allows CARNIV\u00c0LE greater freedom for its tales. This is not just for mere nudity with the carnies' dancing girls or extra blood with any scenes of violence.  Episodes five and six (titled \"Babylon\" and \"Pick A Number\") for example are tragically heart-breaking and downright scary on a number of levels.  The direction, acting, imagery, and overall tone is brutally tear-jerking. This flexibility from conservative censorship only aides the story tellers in their craft.<br/><br/>By the final episode of the first season many elements of the story are brought together, yet just as many new questions arise for the viewer. Therefore much excitement and drama unfolds, but not enough to satisfy. Naturally, they want you to come back next time and plenty of story line still does lay over the horizon.

Set in the 1930s during the great depression, I can't help but think of the parallels with today's current socio-economico-political mood... Yes, the 2010s aren't the 1930s as it was probably a lot more overtly savage as a society back then... However the same lines can be drawn between good and evil today. The same dynamics are prevalent... the greed of bankers and complicity of elected officials at the root of the misery and suffering of the 30s after the crash of 1929 still relevant today after the great financial crisis of 2008. Also, since I just saw this series, I can't help but think of the music theme used during the political speeches in Carnival being reused by 'House of Cards' how enlightening! It makes a lot of sense because you will hear some of the greatest political speeches ever in 'Carnival' professed by the evil preacher.\nAs for Michael j Anderson, his performance in this series is simply masterful. I used to love him in David Lynch's movies but in lieu of being the creepy guy, he exhibits a much wider range for his acting in this series. Clancy Brown is amazing too as the preacher in this series.

Some major events occurred such as the suicide of the spouse of one of the actresses and the divorce of Adrienne Maloof. Other than that, most drama wasn't that spontaneous although not everything is scripted in detail. Some real life friendships were broken in most unpleasant ways as well. <br/><br/>CASTING/SELECTION <br/><br/>It becomes apparent how the casting works. Basically all stars of this show know each other. Kyle Richards knows some of the ladies because they were clients of her husband, a real estate agent. Kim Richards is a sister of Kyle Richards. Dana Wilkey, a former guest star, is a real life friend of Taylor Armstrong. And so forth. They are all connected.<br/><br/>SCRIPTING <br/><br/>I've read that the stars have only a few hours per episode to prepare. So not everything is scripted in detail. However, it has been implied that the actresses have to make their own storyline. Because of the absence of Dana Wilkey I searched for an explanation. Turns out she wasn't asked to return because she didn't make her own (interesting) storyline. That's a major hint on how things work. For a bigger part the stars have to invent their own character and keep it interesting.<br/><br/>PERSONAL INTEREST <br/><br/>Another thing that revealed itself gradually is the motivation for the actresses to participate. Money seems to be the obvious answer, but that's not all. This show serves as a platform for the women to launch their own products, shops, programs, books and restaurants or to re-launch their acting career. Yolanda Forster used the show as a platform to raise awareness for Lyme disease, which she suffers from. Later it becomes a platform to promote her two daughters' modeling career.<br/><br/>MODUS OPERANDI: ONE TRICK PONIES <br/><br/>To create drama, things were escalated often out of nowhere, so it seems. More on that later. For example Brandi calling Joyce constantly 'Jacqueline', Kyle who pretends not to see the difference between a Witch Pentagram and a Star of David and when Carlton (the Witch) complained about it she got accused of anti-Semitism. During a dinner party, somebody calls somebody a fat pig out of nowhere. Brandi Glanville's (evil) ways is legendary by now.<br/><br/>Also the emotions are the same. Kyle's way of looking disgruntled is her trademark. Lisa V's attempts to cry (or to faint) is laughable. Eileen Davidson's level headed demeanor has become a bore to me. Cautious hustling Lisa Rina is a bit cowardly for my taste but she's popular, I get it. In general people perform their shtick so bad, it's sometimes toe cringing. But then again, the perfection is in the imperfection in reality shows.<br/><br/>But some things are real, such as the troublesome relationship between the sisters Kim and Kyle. I find this truly heartbreaking and feel Bravo should not pursue this angle ever (again). Nor would I encourage Bravo to pursue Kim's (lack of) sobriety again as well.<br/><br/>MORE ON THE DRAMA<br/><br/>Basically in every season and episode, the drama was setup quite structurally. For example the show involves us in the preparation of a nice party, get-together, boat trip, meeting, you name it. The second step is giving us hints what tensions could arise at said event. The third step is the event itself and the drama that unfolds.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION<br/><br/>I think RHOBH created a lot of winners: the actresses, the Botox companies, and it created a fan-base for each of the participants. Nevertheless, I rate the show a 4 out of 10. The modus operandi to create drama was the same. I didn't see enough of the 'Beverly Hills luxury life' and the actresses were too much of one-trick-ponies.<br/><br/>Having seen it up to and including season 5, I would welcome less negative vibes during the episodes. Sometimes it's a little bit too much.

If the mom can't do it, she needs to hired a nanny who can. So terribly sad to be a child raised by self absorbed parents who only want to be seen as rich and known for fighting on a reality show. The show loses its fun when we must become too concerned and heartbroken for the children lost under all this stupid glitter and glam. Maybe it's time for a reality show that exposes the truth about forgotten, dismissed and ignored Hollywood children. As far as the women and the drama, it's clear that Vanderpump did not plant any story, and the whole slew of idiotic women are so gullible as to believe that she did by some stupid word such as \"nipped\" and they show that they will buy anything they are sold and spoon fed. Someone is playing them and they are all falling for it hook, line and sinker. Vanderpump may leave and that will ruin the show. I would not watch an entire group of stupid women who fell for some dumb story and decided that Vanderpump was lying, without knowing the truth. That would be completely boring, so I hope that Lisa V does not leave, else I will stop watching the show.", "rating": 2, "helpful": "9 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "6 March 2019"}, {"title": " Why many men stereotype women as vain and stupid...on full display", "content": "There are many smart, talented, and wonderful women, who are beautiful inside and out-- those women ARE NOT featured on these programs. My wife insists on playing these shows early in the morning on reruns and listening to bitches scream insults at each other for some reason. <br/><br/>Why these shows are utter garbage:<br/><br/>1)Marketed as \"reality\" shows. Really? Is it normal reality for a bunch of plastic old women with botox to sit around in a lavish set or house and cuss each other out about manufactured, scripted events that matter less than the pocket lint in your pockets??? Then they have some stupid reunion events where everyone \"hates\" each other but agrees to sit around and critique each other yet again, with some retarded gay dude in a suit who gets paid to produce and come up with this fecal matter. How this is a reality, I'm sure I don't know...<br/><br/>2)There is nothing redeeming about these shows. It just showcases the extreme narcissism and vanity of blowhard airheads that already dominates our society in modern America.<br/><br/>3)Why is everyone cussing and being bleeped out constantly. The stupid BLEEPS are so God-awful that it drives me nuts. You can't even understand what these morons are talking about, because they have so many loud bleeps and edits. It is like watching COPS or Jerry Springer, but with bimbos in fancy gowns and dresses, with botox and plastic surgery.<br/><br/>4)The reunions with the gay fairy in the suits. Why do we need a reunion meeting for people that hate each other and already argued or cried like 500 times in the past? That is another setup for a fake WWE argument match for no reasons, just to do the same setup yet again.<br/><br/>5)Why do intelligent women like this show? I understand guilty pleasures, or shows that exist as a low-brow relief, or a social commentary, but these shows seems to genuinely portray themselves as \"reality\", \"entertainment\", and \"drama\". There isn't even any real tension or drama here-- the only tension being in the women's faces to the point that they can't express emotion from all the crap injected into their heads. I feel that this show makes women dumber and more petty and materialistic, as you can't help but absorb, at some levels, the stupid behavior of these people on a daily basis. <br/><br/>6)What kind of \"man\" wants to be married to these shallow, fake women? They are nothing but gold-digging morons, many of whom look 65, trying to dress and augment themselves to look like teen hookers at a tanning salon. How does a woman like this add value to your life, raise good children, contribute to her community, or make you feel desirable as a man, when they are merely married to any buffoon in a necktie, as long as he has a mansion and some checks coming in for their latest surgery or sports car??? PATHETIC.<br/><br/>7)If I want stupid humor or social commentary humor, I watch Sunny in Philly, or South Park. If I want drama, I watch a show like Walking Dead, Narcos, Black Sails, or Breaking Bad. This show doesn't qualify as anything other than fake idiots screaming at each other over superficial BS in a trash fest that literally looks the same on every episode, and has NO VALUE to society. I literally cringe and lose braincells upon hearing every portion of these shows.

Lisa has a gay trainer who moved from London to be with the family. They have two grown children.

Season 7 to me has been the most interesting season since season 1.<br/><br/>Now much of drama has been caused because of Lisa Rinna. I truly believe she is never one that likes silence. She is always talking. I also think \"She meant no harm\" when she said \"Kim was close to death\" because in reality I think Lisa thinks \"Kim still drinks and does whatever\" and she doesn't want to see anything bad happen to Kim. She is afraid that if she says \"Nothing\" and something does happen to Kim she would feel guilty. This is why she is bitchy around Kim. Since she thinks \"Kim is not getting help she thinks that Kyle is an enabler\". This leads me to the conversation Lisa she had with Eden Sassoon.<br/><br/>Eden is a recovering alcoholic. When Lisa told Eden about Kim and Kyle Eden thought she could help them. The next time Eden saw Kyle she repeated what \"Lisa said\". Then all of hell broke loose. <br/><br/>Later we learn that Eden lost her sister to addiction and that her mother was also in recovery. There was a scene to me where Eden and her mother had a conversion about \"Kim and Kyle\" Her mother told Eden \"... that she should not have gotten involved\". <br/><br/>Now what did not ring true to me was the fact it that scene with Eden and her mother seemed to have been filmed months after the fight that Eden &amp; Kim but, that is not how the show presented it. <br/><br/>It looked to me Bravo saw Lisa Rinna's popularity going down and wanted to save Eden. So they shot that scene with Eden and her mom! Shady Bravo! <br/><br/>Now I think in reality Lisa meant no harm but was lying when she said she \"Did Not remember saying Kim was close to death\". However she came clean. I think Kyle should forgive her only because Lisa meant no harm and that carrying a grudge is a heavy load. However Kyle &amp; Kim seem to be getting along now and I am happy for them. <br/><br/>Now I love Eileen and Ericka. I never herd of them before this show. I like them and Lisa Rinna because they all came from nothing and I could be easily be friends with them. Now I am sober for 20 years now so I could be friends with Eden but not best friends! She might be a nice lady but there is something about her that I can't put my finger on. <br/><br/>I still like Kyle. I love the fact now she is trying everything that she can to be on good term with her sister Kim. <br/><br/>Lisa Vanderpump is someone who you can't trust. If she doesn't like you she makes your life hell. She does what she can to make other not like you. She is not as nice as she pretends. She is the underlying problem with all of them. She is a uses people. <br/><br/>Dorit is nasty fake &amp; rude! She and her husband are Euro-Trash. Even though she is an American her fake accent makes her sound like she is mentally challenged. One thing for sure people were most liekly doing drugs at her party.<br/><br/>SHE NEEDS TO GO<br/><br/>Kim Richards has always been a terrible person. My sister worked in a movie theater in the 1970's. When she saw Kim Richards She asked Kim for an autograph and Kim called my sister all sorts of names. <br/><br/>Years after the incident my sister wasn't shocked to see how Kim turned out. I had to tell her about this show but she refuses to watch. Kim still has lots of anger in her. She is not working the program. If she is acting like a \"Dry Drunk\".

While the initial season of Orange County's opening credits featured an opening gate and a theme song reminiscent of that of \"The Twilight-zone\", Beverly Hills opens with a theme song as light and bubbly as the pink Veuve Cliqot Brut Rose served at Lisa Vanderpump's restaurant \"Villa Blanca.\" Somehow this seems to convey that peeking into the luxurious worlds of the housewives doesn't feel as voyeuristic as it did when the franchise began. <br/><br/>The Beverly Hills series takes viewers behind the lives of some of the most awesomely wealthy households in America. The extravagances of daily living in Beverly HIlls are incomprehensible to most Americans outside of the 90210 zip code . . . private jets, personal limos, houses full of servants, nannies, cross-continental flights on a whim, and world-renowned designer ateliers on speed dial are just some of the mind-boggling aspects of life in Beverly Hills that make the series deliriously irresistible to viewers. While all of the Housewives series' have showcased those with extraordinary lifestyles, the extravagance of the Beverly HIlls lifestyle is like F. Scott Fitzgerald's Jay Gatsby to the nth power. <br/><br/>Along with the fabulousness of the Beverly HIlls ueberlife is the ueber-drama that accompanies it. Viewers will also find themselves intrigued to see the social foibles of the Hills' women and how they play out over the course of the season, culminating in an explosive finale that involves drama with family members, close friends, and mere acquaintances. At times it is difficult to remember that this portrays the real lives of real people, as the show does such a skillful job of removing the viewer from everyday reality with its portrayals. Each installment of Beverly Hills promises to keep viewers on their toes and attuned to the nuances of every character's mannerisms, conversations and body language, and eagerly anticipating the next week's episode. <br/><br/>Is your interest piqued yet?

From the previous IMDb reviews, I see I am glaringly in the minority in my initial opinion about the show; I was already a fan of a few of the actors and loved the look and feel of the production. The previous reviews, however, have not convinced me to change a single idea I had about the show; in fact, I find the other reviews to be epistemologically flawed in their vagueness and unspecified assertions.<br/><br/>So as for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the first episode and plan to keep watching. Below are my first five reasons to watch.<br/><br/>1. Mireille Enos: Mireille Enos is a compelling actor. She may be typecast by some as the serious, unadorned detective in \"The Killing\", but in \"The Catch\" she is engagingly glammed up and beautiful, not with an 'I've-been-entitled-all-my-life' beauty but rather with an 'I'm smart and accomplished and insightful' beauty. Plus, she can sprint at an impressive speed after bad guys, showing that her outer strength can match the inner.<br/><br/>2. Alimi Ballard: Alimi Ballard has always been smart and sharp, as his scenes on \"Numb3rs\" and \"CSI\" have shown, but his frequent relegation to a law enforcement roles in dark suits has required a restraint he can thankfully shed in this role. From the first time we see him on the links rocking a preppy polo-shirt-and-plaid-pants golf outfit, we know something will be different. On \"The Catch\", he remains sharp and smart, but as the 'fixer' of the confidence team, he morphs into changing roles with emotive style and wit.<br/><br/>3. Mature Allure: It is great to see a show with a variety of actors over 35 (notwithstanding Rose Rollins' 20- something visage) who look great, dress great, speak articulately, and keep the story going. Much has been written about Peter Krause's casting and whether his age and recent role in Parenthood will affect audience perceptions. Not having watched \"Parenthood\" (or \"Six Feet Under\" or any of his roles, to be honest), he was a blank slate to me, and I was pleasantly surprised. My daughter remarked that the younger actor in the original pilot (still available online) is better eye candy, but Krause is a nuanced actor who conveys ambiguous intentions well. As a con man in his late 40s, it is more plausible that he has been around, seen more than he needed, and become reflective and conflicted about whether to stay in the game or pursue a connection with his latest smart, intriguing target. If his character were in his mid 30s with less knowledge, life experience and capital, would he really be ready to give up his best confidence-earning years to be with someone who could always put him in jail?<br/><br/>4. The Artwork of Maria Kreyn: I am not sure how widely recognized artist Maria Kreyn is, but after this pilot episode, I'm sure she will gain a much wider audience. Her painting 'Alone Together', featured in \"The Catch\", is hauntingly beautiful and provides a captivating metaphor for the show's narrative.<br/><br/>5. Open Spaces and Sunlight! Whenever I catch a few seconds of another TGIT/ShondaLand show, the scene is usually in an enclosed space such as a hospital room or dark office or someplace not particularly airy or (naturally) light. \"The Catch\", in contrast, is replete with outdoor settings, California sunshine, and floor-to-ceiling windows with luxurious day and nighttime views.

Even more galling is the way in which it targets a female audience by relentlessly patronising them with sub-Sex-and-the-City stuff about weddings, wedding cakes, wedding dresses, etc. Truly appalling.", "rating": 2, "helpful": "54 out of 95 found this helpful.", "date": "3 April 2016"}, {"title": " Good Concept Filled with Stupid People", "content": "It seems every single person at this high end, top flight, high security firm is a complete incompetent.

The actors are good (glad to see Dirty Sexy Money's Peter Krause again) and the premise of a private detective, the con guy who loves his last mark, Interpol, an ongoing con and a mystery-of-the-week is fine, but I just didn't find any of it that interesting.

If you think back to shows like NYPD Blue, Barney Miller, The Rockford Files, any number of programs that have gone before. The cast included stars as we'd all expect. And usually a good number of supporting actors. And these shows were not cast based on the appearance of actors. This another program that has only attractive people in every single part. In one episode there are defense contractors who all young and very attractive. It's a huge distraction. Look around, at your own life, not everyone in physically fit, and attractive. This show does involve a story line that moves in and out of the world of the rich and famous. But even those people should not all be young and attractive. Somehow they even have bad guys who look like underwear models. If you enjoy watching shows where every single person looks like no-one you'll see in everyday life. This is the show for you. But then you'll have to suspend your disbelief to swallow the story lines they've woven so far. I can't see how they can do more that a season at most. How are they going to come up with even an even slightly believable continuing plot with the same cast of characters, they set in place? Lastly, they resurrected split screen editing. This effect quickly became irritating when it first became popular back in the late 60's and early 1970's when it was first conceived. And they've managed to make it even more annoying by having lines, forming grids, blend across some of the screens.", "rating": 5, "helpful": "28 out of 48 found this helpful.", "date": "15 April 2016"}, {"title": " Falls short on all fronts", "content": "I tried to give this an honest chance, but there are just way too many plot holes. The script looks improvised on the set. For example, when the lights dim at the 1st episode closing party and the investigators immediately move away from the doors, and the guy predictably gets away. The photogenic posing instead of grabbing the guy kills me. The second glaring thing that really killed the show for me, was the overly friendly FBI guy. The garage scene was just too far from reality. Her standing there with a crowbar in front of a car with possible evidence and the cop does nothing. They would have had her in a little room in a hot second. Mirielle Enos is not a good choice for this role and her makeup is just caked on. The supporting cast is horrible.

I admire the lead actress, who reminds me of Faye Dunaway. I've always liked Peter Krause, and loved his work in Six Feet Under. Now THAT was great t.v.! I do like the Mission Impossible-esque split screen thingy, as well as the music used throughout, (the t.v. series, not the Tom Cruise movies) which gives it a vintage feel reminiscent of that series, as well as others of that same period. The wardrobe department, however, needs to be addressed....Tonight's episode, for instance, just felt like kid's playing dress-up, in evening gowns that looked like some grade eight student's home economics project. Really bad. I thought Peter Krause looked like a corpse in an ill-fitting tux. Aside from that issue, the scene with the two women coming onto the dance floor, (which looked like someone's rec-room, by the way) and then kissing...I wondered aren't we yet past trying to squeeze in some gay content into a show just for edgy/risqu\u00e9 effect? I realize this scene was used in order to create a diversion regarding the snagging of the bracelet, but that's exactly the problem. They used two women dancing, and then kissing, to catch people off guard. Have we not come farther than that in 2016, to create a spectacle of gay people?? Or were they trying to pander to the heterosexual male viewer, and indulge the fantasy of two women together?? Either way, it felt odd and out of place. <br/><br/>In order to make a classic, decadent dessert, you have to have the right ingredients.

I gave up 10 minutes into the show because I got a full blown headache from the rap noise. Unbelievably bad.

If this is based on the Thomas Crowne Affair and set in the 60's, it's disconcerting 'cause lots of visuals that are nebulous.

The African-American characters are even less available as humans. Everyone has a Stepford Wife quality, and the dialogue from voices never spoken in anybody's world. The acting is just as annoying as the dialogue. Trite and obvious. <br/><br/>I wish American television would do better. That's probably why I'm even writing this review. All the pretty white people, that include's the African-American actors--very pale depths of character. I know the zombie apocalypse has been trending, but there isn't any indication that's what this show is about, not with all the visual connection to the \"Thomas Crowne Affair.\" Even the original movie had some seedy, dumpy, real people involved. I do wish there were some real people, of all ages, sizes, that sucked us into the story. As is, I just don't give a hoot as to what's going on here. Give me some character! Give me some truth!
