Built up as a super villain who radiates domination, he instead turned out to be a harmless rocker who switches between \"nice uncle from next door\" to \"bat swinging psycho killer\" whenever the script demands it.<br/><br/>Negan was supposed to surpass the Governour in terms of cruelty and malice, but in my opinion he doesn't even get close. The Governour had charisma, style, and above all, a real reason for all his experiments; his daughter. We still don't know why or how Negan came to be.<br/><br/>Season 6 was full of chest-pounding and inevitably doomed plotting by the heroes, but it was still fun to watch them descend into mass murder. Especially Carol had incredibly intense moments.<br/><br/>Season 7, after the reveal of Negan, turned out to be a super slow recuperation with the nice uncle coming over for spaghetti. They tried to show how he controls his people with rules and by burning them and so on, but overall it was a super tame story with \"Soon(TM)\" all over it.<br/><br/>Instead of fixing that in season 8, they now bury the show in one action episode after another. And its not the somewhat smart action we saw in earlier seasons, but 80's style A-Team nonsense action. Cars are bullet sponges, ammo is thrown around like its World War II, a .50 caliber machine gun mows down 50 people with ease but can't hit one dude in a Jeep, and there is no stopping to all the shooting. Even when people are having a quiet moment to talk, you hear often hear shooting in the background.<br/><br/>We rarely have those epic Daryl moments anymore, Rick has become a a hollow shell of a leader, Carl seems to be on vacation.

Its hard to pin-point one thing that is extraordinary about Season 1 since there are so many aspects to talk about. First off, the scenes in downtown Atlanta were incredibly visual and the scenes that took place in more rural areas were very scenic. The undead in the first season had great makeup and special effects too, the zombies had defined faces that really make them feel they were once human. If I had to pick one thing that was great about the first season, its has to be the cast... Andrew Lincoln and Jon Bernthal make great, bad ass lead actors that also have the ability to project a range of emotions. Laurie Holden is also radiant in this season and the surrounding cast of Jeffrey DeMunn, Steven Yeun, Irone Singleton, and Norman Reedus all showcase a great character that can be easily become a fan-favorite to any.

Like an aging boxer this show doesn't really know where to go and what to do anymore. So it keeps trying to do what it did in its youth but to lesser effect. Is it time to hang up those gloves?<br/><br/>For anyone unfamiliar with the story 'TWD' is about a group of people trying survive a zombie apocalypse.\nIt soon becomes apparent that you should fear the dead but fear the living even more.\nIt's dog eat dog, or in most cases human eating human!\nThe show started out very promising and over its eight seasons developed a bunch of characters that you will truly begin to care.\nUnfortunately the show seems to have lost its way and has become almost as clumsy as the dithering dead that walk the Earth.\nDuring the shows entire run ( I'm currently watching season eight as I write this) there has been some truly magnificent television. Some great storytelling, nail biting, riveting moments that shock and keep the audience hooked.<br/><br/>Characters come and go and the long run time of each season helps us get to know each individual thoroughly. The cast become almost like family members. So when one of them does meet their demise it's upsetting. There's been some great villains and foes along the way too. The Governor and Negan being most memorable. Negan played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan is probably the best thing about the more recent seasons. There's characters that have conflicting views. Shane played by Jon Bernthal being a good example. This show tugs on all the emotions. There's pain, anger, fear and despair. There's also the well timed piece of humour here and there to show that despite all that has happened to them these people are still human.<br/><br/>The production value of this show is of very high quality. Only the odd piece of CGI occasionally lets the side down. Particularly the CGI flames used instead of practical effects. This is odd as the practical and makeup effects in this show are second only to Game of Thrones. Prosthetic makeup effects are Oscar worthy.\nCan a TV show get an Oscar?\nI don't know but if it can this show definitely should get one.\nZombies are brought to life, if that makes any sense by some truly wonderful makeup design. Animatronics are very realistic giving the whole show a level of authenticity usually associated with a high budget Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>One criticism I do have is that the show doesn't look and sound as good as it should. As a High definition experience the picture is often grainy with no vibrancy. Possibly this is intentional to show the grubby broken down world that the show is set in.\nSound doesn't seem to immerse as well as it should. While I'll admit that it isn't bad, it just doesn't sound as involving as some other big budget TV shows. Overall 'TWD' is a superb show. One that will go down as a classic.

I LOVE zombie movies. Dawn of The Dead is my favorite. Back in the early 2000 there were several great zombie movies. Nowadays they are awful. More guns, empty characters, and explosions plus bad scripts than anything else. How in the world TWD transformed into a Steven Seagal movie? I remember the beginning was so thrilling \u0085 suspenses, a story, characters that you cared about, scary zombies. But after season 3 or 4 everything turned into guns and people fighting people. Cheap scripts, retarded dialogues, poor CGI. Take any episode from season 4 on and you can broadcast it on a cheap TV station as \"action\" movie. No one would tell the difference.<br/><br/>Right now you cannot care about any character. Bad actors that play as much as the trees in the background die by the dozen by each episode. Flashbacks and \"emotional\" (dumb) dialogues want to make us care about someone. But you can't. Zombies do not matter anymore, only rarely when they suddenly matter. It is either this image of them as \"pests\" most of the time, or lethal killers out of a sudden. I am sick of watching a cheap action movie that has nothing to do with a zombie movie. A zombie movie was a zombie movie because of the thriller surrounding this worldwide catastrophe of people turning into these creepy and horror things. That was the MAIN factor. TWD has nothing to do with that anymore.<br/><br/>If TWD would have kept 4-5 main characters and presented their struggle to live in this horror world full of zombies, then that could have been a great series. But even that has to stop. The only reason TWD continues is money. That's all. They make more money off the show. Why do you think the action happens in forests and zombies are mainly seen in packs from distance? Because it is cheap. No need to pay for shooting in a town and pay for complex CGI, a forest is perfect.<br/><br/>So. I loved this series but now I think it is the cheapest garbage out there. Honestly I don't care what happens anymore so I'll finally give up. Last episode \"Some Guy\" did it for me. I just could not bare anymore.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. However, that being said I have to disagree with the reviewer.<br/><br/>So here are the reasons I like the show.<br/><br/>First, character development, this is not usually a very big trait in the Zombie genre. If you only watched 3 episodes, this is a big part of what you watched. They take the time to give you a slight background of the characters, a chance for you to get to know them. For those of us that are big fans of the Zombie genre it gave us a chance to think \"Who would I be?\" in this situation.<br/><br/>Second, the story doesn't follow a straight line. This was a point of contention in the other review. I personally like the multiple story lines. It keeps things interesting and keeps it from becoming a boring show where I can foresee how everything is going to turn out. And before anyone says it\u0085YES I know this is based off a graphic novel. I haven't read it and will refrain from reading it for a while.<br/><br/>Third, the zombies look and act pretty bad ass. The make up is done great, not a bunch of CGI which is so common in today's world. So anyway\u0085if you aren't a fan of the zombie genre to begin with then yeah, you probably aren't going to get why so many of us love the show. However, I think most fans of the genre will love this show. <br/><br/>So in closing, for those of us who love the genre, It's a weekly dose of zombie apocalypse. <br/><br/>For those that aren't fans of the genre, when the zombie apocalypse happens and you don't know what to do\u0085don't come crying to me and my friends\u0085you'll just slow us down.<br/><br/>On second thought\u0085you may come in handy in case we need to make a hasty retreat", "rating": null, "helpful": "449 out of 710 found this helpful.", "date": "7 August 2011"}, {"title": " Smell of decay grows stronger in S10.", "content": "Someone cancel this show.

It just sort of screams in your face \"Love me!\" with all its interesting characters who are very different from each other and a nice plot that you just have to be addicted to. The supporting work is clearly a winner. It has a very lovable supporting cast with T.R. Knight as the sweet and sort of the \"average guy\" as George O'Malley and Katherine Heigl who is very likable in her role - even Sandra Oh is a clear winner on top. And my personal favorite is \"the Nazi\" - Dr. Miranda Bailey who is played by Chandra Wilson. Very, very well done.<br/><br/>This is sort of a soapy spin on \"Scrubs\" and \"ER\" but with light comedy/romance and serious and intense drama where character build up the plot. Some of the characters may get a bit annoying for your taste (ex. Meredith Grey) but the acting is just superb and you can't help liking it. It has a guilty-pleasure feel to it and you just can't help but stay up late for this show. This show is definitely not about \"medicine\" - when it has to deal with medicine, it has a clear soft side to it. The doctors play heroes (pretty clich\u00e9d, but yeah - this IS a hospital show) and save lives or care or has to live up to certain defeat. Just to be aware: This is a show about relationships-within-a-hospital and the life of each person that works there.<br/><br/>The show breaks all the \"bad\" mid-season shows record.

We were along for the journey with these young Doctors as they began their professional careers as well as their personal struggles with friendship and love. Fourteen seasons later, Grey's Anatomy has become a completely different show as we the audience has also changed. I am now married with children and at a similar time-line as some of the current cast members. It is for this reason that I am no longer a devoted fan. Having seen every episode since its pilot, I have finally questioned why I am still tuning in every week to watch the continuing adventures of Meredith Grey and her circle of friends and fellow doctors. Simple, it is no longer the same show I began to watch 14 seasons ago. Most of the character of the original show have left if not been killed off. The hospital has been set on fire, blown up, and taken hostage multiple times. We have seen love, lost, passion, promise, joy and sadness from multiple story lines throughout its run. Grey's Anatomy has reinvented itself so many times that we have seen its central figure (Meredith Grey) change for good and bad. <br/><br/>From the single girl, the devoted daughter, the young doctor, the passionate girl friend, the on again off again good / bad friend, the angry daughter living in her Mom' shadow, the newly-wed, young mother, widower, lost adult and now, for lack of anything else, a supporting character to the show that graces her name. <br/><br/>For this reason and the loss of so many of its prior cast members, I have found myself question time and time again when Grey's Anatomy \"jumped the shark.\" <br/><br/>Grey's Anatomy by default has inherited the generational audience of fans from such shows as St. Elsewhere, Chicago Hope and ER. The hospital drama has a home with Grey's Anatomy. When the show began, it was a home to a young cast of young professionals that were in multiple \"sexual\" relationships as they juggled their careers and side stories. Also, the show has taken a life of its own by juggling a much more diverse cast then it set out originally. With good and bad results, the solid fact remains that the current show does not reflect anything that the original show set out to be 14 seasons ago. <br/><br/>While the show has created a multitude of amazing stories and moments for its audience to enjoy, I have lost that love and feeling many years ago. Now, I fear that after many years of hoping, wishing and praying, the show will not return to what it once was. It has tried several times to revive its cast to showcase this but has failed. Even during its second and third wind of new medical arrivals, only a handful have made the cut to the current cast while the large majority have disappeared if not written off the show. However, I am not angry at the overall show. Grey' Anatomy has (had) produced many good characters and stories back in the day. Thank you for the good times, which were many many seasons ago. Now, audience members have to make a tough decision. <br/><br/>With that said, the show has struggled for an identity while holding onto several different aspects for a show.

Grey's Anatomy hour meant NO TALKING hour!! I was so in love with the series that to this day I watch older seasons on Netflix once or twice a year! Up to the middle of the 9th season that is....<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>We were all sad when they killed Denny, though he wasn't a main character, he would have made a good one, I think we all loved Izzie and Denny. And we were ABSOLUTELY DEVSTATED when George died! Those were okay though, we could got through those and it was great in between and I didn't care even a little bit when Burke left, I never cared for him.<br/><br/>BUT THEN.... The plane crash!! What an amazing couple of episodes, until you got to the end of them and realized that up to this point they had killed off 40% of the main cast AND your favorites none the less!! Lexi and Mark!! REALLY!! They were just getting ready to get back together! It was simply too much.<br/><br/>Killing off so many main characters didn't do the series any favors, and adding the characters that they did, it RUINED it. Amelia? Ugh she's so annoying, her character has a daddy/big brother complex that she cant seem to get over so she's constantly in a power struggle with men. Its nauseating, I dislike her character very much. Meredith's sister though, I hate her so much I cant even remember her name, she's HORRIBLE!!! HORRIBLE actress, HORRIBLE, character, HORRIBLE for the show!! Just single handedly dragging the series the bottom. Not to mention killing Jackson &amp; April's baby!! WHAT!! Too much!<br/><br/>So my personal opinion of this series is, I'm hooked, I have to see it through, but I recommend not watching after midway through the 9th season, its a waste of time and will likely only annoy. I'm giving it a generous 6. Now it used to be a strong 10 and the only reason it still gets a 6 is because of how amazing it USED to be. If I was going by the last 2.5 seasons alone....

I kind of like Danaerys going mad but it needed a lot more time and thought put into it - It went too far too fast with no substantial development to justify her killing thousands of innocents. It was actually laughable. Needed seasons of planning and transitioning her character. After Dany's death it just skipped to Tyrion's trial and no one seemed phased over it. Anything that required any thought from the Writers was done off screen, like Arya and Sansa finding out about Jon's lineage. Major let downs and bad dialogue throughout.

The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.<br/><br/>When it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow &amp; move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.<br/><br/>Season 6 &amp; 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books &amp; George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.<br/><br/>This brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as \"bigger than Helms Deep\" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.<br/><br/>Episode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan &amp; Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.<br/><br/>The writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'.

I am here to confirm, as a fierce devotee to the books, that we have nothing to fear.<br/><br/>While certain scenes play out differently in execution, the plot remains perfectly intact (so far). The characters have been transplanted well from page to screen, and the actors (most notably Peter Dinklage) nailed their personalities quite well. However; it is only fair to point out some of the acting seemed a little wooden at times.<br/><br/>Special effects were well done, though nothing mind-blowing, but the scenery and props perfectly captured the feel of the novels (in my mind at least). It also must be noted that there was just the right amount of nudity, violence and vulgarity to let the audience know they were watching a tale woven for mature viewers without using said nudity, violence and vulgarity as a crutch.<br/><br/>All and all, I am very, very pleased with this adaptation, and I went into it expecting to be disappointed. If I were to gripe about anything, it would be that newcomers who have not read the books might not know what to think of this fantasy story for adults. Some may shrug it off as fodder for geeks, while others might take offence to what they may see as a defiling of a genre usually meant for children.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>After watching the entire first season, I can safely say this is perhaps the BEST adaptation of book into film/TV. While many moments in the show do not match the moments in the book action for action and word for word, the plot is never sacrificed when doing this, and the alterations simply make the story a better fit for a one-hour television time slot.<br/><br/>In addition, new scenes (by which I mean scenes which never happened in the book at all) fit seamlessly into the greater plot, and help the audience with information they would only otherwise get via the narrative of the novel (EG: asides which explain character/world history).<br/><br/>Top form, HBO.

Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. <br/><br/>I was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. <br/><br/>The acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. <br/><br/>If you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>I have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. <br/><br/>Each episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend.

Cable has provided some great options but we were running out of things to watch so we started searching out for TV shows from other countries. What we have found is many of the dramas from places like England, Ireland and even Iceland are very well thought out with intricate stories.\nThis show is one of the best I have ever watched regardless of where it is produced. There is some action but this show really shines in two areas.The first is the stories. They are very well conceived. One thing we noticed when watching the show was the gray areas with all of the characters. I think one of the themes of this show is not to see people in terms of good and bad with no in between. That everything is not black and white and that human beings are more complex than many TV shows portray them to be.\nFor people who enjoy shows like NYPD Blue or Bosch, this is in that same category.\nThe second area that shines with this show is the acting. These actors offer a broad range well beyond what you might normally see in TV shows. Great actors from series like NYPD Blue (Dennis Franz) or The Americans (Matthew Rhys) are part of what made those shows so compelling and here there are so many standout performances I don't know where to begin. They are simply fantastic.\nAnyway, if you are tired of watching junk check out this show.

Gripping from the start, it never really let go and even if the conclusion was slightly unsatisfactory in my eyes, in that pretty much all the bad guys got away with it and justice wasn't seen to be done, but in terms of plotting and character development, it was riveting throughout.<br/><br/>The subject of police corruption and the workings of the internal affairs unit has to be handled sensitively but realistically and here I was convinced from the outset. What made it more interesting and watchable was that the central character under investigation, DCI Tony Gates is presented to us as an award-winning cop, a family man who even stops crime on his time-off, foiling a petty robbery at a restaurant where he's eating in the first episode. Unfortunately in so doing, he absent-mindedly allows the restaurant to not take payment for his meal (in this day and age, it's an offence for the police to accept gratuities, even when off-duty) and worse, he's in the company of his lover, rich girl lawyer Jacqui, both of which come back to haunt him as he becomes the subject of an investigation for 'laddering\", the practice of only solving easy crimes and getting multiple offences tagged onto the crime sheet, thus boosting his efficiency figures.<br/><br/>Things get far deeper and murkier from there as Gates finds himself at the mercy and under the control of an underworld kingpin, only heard in the first four episodes by his rasping Glasgow accent, messages passed to him on disposable mobile phones by a tear-away ten year old boy, who later participates in a particularly disturbing torture sequence involving Gates' investigating nemesis D.S. Arnott.<br/><br/>The direction was excellent throughout, involving and exciting, with the ensemble acting likewise of the highest order. I wasn't quite convinced, as I wasn't in the otherwise excellent \"The Forsyte Saga\" remake some years ago by Gina McKee as a femme fatale, but in particular Martin Compston and Vicky McClure as the pursuing investigators, the latter undercover, made for an effective team, with thankfully not a whiff of romance in sight between them. As Gates, Lennie James played a difficult part, engaging the viewer's sympathy and anger by turns, before making the ultimate sacrifice at the end.<br/><br/>I'd like to see Compston and McClure reunite to fight more corruption, along with Adrian Dunbar as their wily boss pulling the strings behind them and hope the series did well enough for more episodes to come.

Aspects of this programme are quite good, although it never feels exactly fresh. Anti-corruption units, and undercover agents, have been on our screen before ('Between the Lines' - there's clearly something magnetic about that word 'line' and 'The Ghost Squad') - and some of the conspiracy elements seem both far fetched and perfunctory. Perhaps the greatest problem is that Lennie James' protagonist is a hard man to connect with: an almost-clean copper brought down by a bad friend, he remains a hard man to like, and while he appears to be driven by his own private sense of ethics, this moral code seems completely self-centred - he's torn when he fails to live up to his own expectations of himself, but it's hard to see why we should care. And the portrait of feral kids on the local housing estate seems both lazy, and again relatively loosely connected to the more serious crime in the background - if you're looking for the forensic detail of 'The Wire', you won't find it here. None of this actually makes for a bad series - it does all the standard things you expect a show of this sort to do reasonably well, but it doesn't add much you won't have seen before.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "33 out of 51 found this helpful.", "date": "27 July 2012"}, {"title": " Tense anti corruption police drama.....", "content": "Line of Duty is a Brit cop drama that focuses on the tense interplay, between the anti corruption units, within the UK Police and the officers, they are tasked with investigating. <br/><br/>Refreshingly, this drama, renders real characters, on both sides of the divide. No one is perfect, including the investigated and the investigators.<br/><br/>The standard of casting and acting, as is typical with most UK productions of this kind, is of a high caliber. The convincing characterizations and the tension that mounts for the viewer, as the lives of often good people, who makes bad decisions, slowly unravel, is not always easy to watch. <br/><br/>This is an engaging series, that works well.It keeps the viewers attention with storyline(s) that are, for the most part, believable. Often focusing on personal issues, that make their way into the workplace, as is so often the case, in real life. <br/><br/>Where this series falls down somewhat, is some of the more implausible mistakes made by seasoned police officers. A ring from a glass left on a table, for example, taken by a compromised officer is inexplicable. As is, false claims, regarding a relationship, whilst knowing full well, that text records from mobiles, including intimate ones, are readily available. Any experienced detective would realize, in some instances, truth is less damaging than lies and may, in fact, better hide a bigger lie. <br/><br/>The other shortfall, is how cold and often, unlikable, a good portion of the characters are. Injecting a little human warmth, into this series, would actually increase the impact on the viewer, when things turn sour. This, I think, is what stops Line of Duty from being an exceptional series, like the much loved, classic detective series, in the same vein, Cracker. Cracker is outstanding because it takes far more emotional and personal risks, with its characterizations. <br/><br/>That said, for the most part, Line of Duty is a good series and still represents an intelligent, worthwhile watch.

Really has been an incredible start to this anime, and that is what I have rated it on, though I have extremely high confidence this one will be one that gets better and better.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "179 out of 215 found this helpful.", "date": "18 May 2013"}, {"title": " A Classic in the making,has a great story and fantastic character development- one of the best anime's of 2013", "content": "Although there are already a few reviews on this series, AOT is so good that I still felt the need to write a review.<br/><br/>Attack on Titan is, at the time of this writing, only 8 episodes into the series, yet it already seems to be one of the best anime of 2013. I'm a big fan of SAO and this series is right on par with part 1 of SAO (if you're reading this and Haven't seen Sword Art Online, I would very highly recommend it- definitely one of the best anime I've ever seen.)<br/><br/>**Here's a quick note- if you aren't sure whether or not you'll want to watch this, here are some things that could keep you away. There IS gore in AOT, and while it lessens up later, the first few episodes are particularly gruesome compared to shows like Naruto or One Piece. If you're interested but not big on the gore, try watching Psycho Pass. It's a great anime in its own right but it's also not afraid of some blood. If that show has too much Gore for you then you probably won't like AOT. Also, if you get scared easily, these Titans are extremely creepy. Like, Evil-Clown level creepy. In the end, wouldn't recommend for early teens.**<br/><br/>Some reviews have given confusing accounts of what Attack on Titan is about (I'm looking at you blackmamba99971) whereas others have given much more concise sums (fanis-gav has a good one) but basically, it's a Medieval-looking time period and humanity lives in the spaces between 3 separate circular walls (Great Wall of China sized walls) one inside of the next. These walls were put up to protect humanity from the Titans, humanoids with no \"junk\" that go in sizes of 5, 7, 15, and 60 meters (A tall human is 2 meters by the way). No-one knows where the titans came from or how they survive/reproduce or even how they can be killed for awhile. All they know is that Titans eat humans simply because they enjoy it. After \"100 years of peace\" living within the walls, the Titans break through a part of the Outermost wall where a young boy named Eren lives. To put it shortly, he sees some people killed right in front of him and vows to \"wipe out each and every Titan.\"<br/><br/>Now here is where the show really sets itself apart. In most anime, the main character has some secret power or something that allows them to live up to their challenge. Naruto had a ton of chakra, Luffy had the Gum-Gum fruit and Ichigo had an intense Spiritual Pressure. All these MC's have something exceptional about them that makes anything seem possible.<br/><br/>This is anything but the case for Eren. When we meet Eren, he's a scrawny little punk that can't even take on others his age, much less an adult or Titan. The idea of Eren taking on a few of the lower level Titans is laughable. Even after a 5 year time-skip where Eren and other kids have become young adults trained to kill Titans with the Recon squad (a unit of the Army that goes outside the walls to fight Titans and has little to no success at this point), they look like as big a threat to Titans as a toddler with a wooden gun. And you see it in every episode too; the feeling that no-one is safe and the desperate plight that the characters are in really permeates the entire show. There's no \"Last-Second-Save\" like in most other anime, and the twists come every week. You get to know a whole cast of characters but you never know who's safe or not. This adds a gravity, a realness to the show that brings you in and really allows you to connect with these all too fragile, human characters.<br/><br/>Besides that, the artwork is fantastic, the soundtrack gets better each episode, the character and plot development is top-notch and there's still a ton of room to grow with where the Titans come from, what Eren's dad injected him with (we still don't know), what's in the basement and how the Colossal Titan keeps appearing. If you can deal with a bit of gore and are looking for a great new show, it's a fantastic piece of work well worth the look.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "223 out of 270 found this helpful.", "date": "26 May 2013"}]}, "/title/tt1586680/": {"title": "Shameless", "reviews": [{"title": " Keep Watching", "content": "I have never watched the British version of this show so I cannot comment on the original.

It's a fast paced Comedy-Drama like no other, in that it lends itself perfectly to both without apology or hesitation.<br/><br/>Whereas the British original finds it's characters living, fornicating, screaming and jumping in the revelry of zero-expectation in a rigid class system, the American remake masterfully equivocates the triumphs and the tribulations of a lower class family existing on the edge of acceptability at the heart of society in a flawless, delicate and shameless manner.<br/><br/>The pilot introduces the characters, much like their British counterparts, not in an effort to garner their sympathy but simply as a statement of fact. The aspiring teen marine struggling to hide his homosexuality only fears losing the love of his brother, the absent drunk dad who loves his children but through the haze becomes a heckling prophet - a Shakespearean fool who sees through the thin veil of sanity and order, a young woman struggling to keep the family together seeing a way out through a handsome highwayman. These people are not bad even if they do bad things. Society has forgot about them and for that they couldn't care less for it.<br/><br/>The whole cast is tremendous but William H. Macy rises to the occasion with the father, a Frank Gallagher straight out of a bar in Memphis at 3 a.m. on a Wednesday, last orders, don't interrupt him because he hasn't finished yet, he's got to tell you what's wrong with the world before he wakes up and it all ends. You would believe this guy was a war vet or something with the confidence and delirium at which he pontificates.<br/><br/>No matter what your race or background you can take something away from Shameless. Most television that likes to call itself Comedy, Drama, or both, tends towards a particular demographic, offering an escape fantasy for, say, the 'off-beat' teens in Glee or the sexually deviant young adults in True Blood or the repressed housewives in that show about the repressed housewives.<br/><br/>As the designated guardian's new boyfriend takes a seat at the head of the table, he pushes Frank's legs aside as he crashes drunk on the floor. Shameless doesn't escape anything, it lives in the world it is given and every so often reminds you, during those joyously chaotic scenes, that the sweetest lemonade is almost bitter, so it's just as well every episode is only an hour for you to laugh, cry and enjoy.<br/><br/>Moments of anarchic jubilation inter lap, run over and sometimes juxtapose flourishes of near-the-bone reality, served eloquently on a fresh platter to which America needs to to have the stomach for.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "221 out of 287 found this helpful.", "date": "19 March 2011"}, {"title": " Time to say goodbye", "content": "There was a time when I would have given this show a 10 (or more if allowed.)

I think a was a little disappointed that we didn't create it, but I was also happy that it was one of the few shows that we copied without ruining it. When I checked some of the user reviews, I was surprised to see how many thought the show to be appalling. OK, not everyone will share my love for the show, but to rate it SO badly? But when I looked, the author of nearly every bad review was a fan of the original show. This simply sounds like a case of liking what you know. \"I don't care how good their cooking is. It ain't as good as my Mom's!\"<br/><br/>Once I finished the American series, I gave it about a month to settle in and then started watching the British series. But I'd like to think that I was objective enough to judge it on its on merits, and not simply that it's different than what I'm used to.<br/><br/>Since, as many have pointed out, the script is nearly word-for-word identical, the difference lies mainly in how the actors portray the characters.<br/><br/>So I'm going to give my character-by-character head-to-head appraisal of UK vs. US. I'm going to use the character names rather than the actors' names for simplicity. Starting from the youngest...<br/><br/>Little Debbie: UK wins this one hands down. No contest. She steals every scene she's in. Who can not fall in love with this girl???<br/><br/>Carl: This one's close, but the UK one is (at least in the first season) a little more deranged and fun to watch.<br/><br/>Ian: Another close one, but this goes to UK, too. US Ian is somber and good looking, but UK Ian always seems a bit panicky, and the wide-angle closeups of his face make him look pretty bizarre. <br/><br/>Lip: This is solidly with the US. I like US Lip's darkness. He seems more responsible and intelligent. UK Lip is just kind of impish and unsure. You can depend on US Lip and he offers some of the only real family support to Fiona.<br/><br/>Kevin: Dead heat.<br/><br/>Veronica: Very different performances by each, but in the end, I like them the same.<br/><br/>Fiona: This was a difficult one to call, but I'm giving it to the US. And this is probably because I saw them first. I just like her better. Hard to put my finger on the reason.<br/><br/>Frank: Sorry, UK, but I just don't like your Frank. I understand the character is usually drunk, but he seems that way even before he starts drinking. He seems clinically stupid. US Frank (Macy) is equally as obnoxious, entitled, selfish and deluded, but he only seems drunk when he's drunk. At other times, his pontificating is fun to listen to. You feel good about hating the guy, because he's like this by choice. With UK Frank, you have to pity him.

I wasn't sold on the characters and the direction seemed directionless. In fact, it wasn't until the third ep that my eyes were opened. It's as if the actors have found their mark and the characters have come to life. <br/><br/>While the ensemble cast is solid, and Macy is at his irascible best, it is the performance of three of the actors which makes Shameless something special. Emmy Rossum, as the 'adult' glue that holds the family together, has rightly received the most press. Her role requires a combination of strength, resolve, humour and vulnerability - qualities that would thwart a lesser actress. Rossum is able to convincingly bring it all together with fire and sexuality in addition to her other qualities. <br/><br/>Equally effective in his role as the younger brother Lip, Jeremy Allen White brings a world-weary innocence to his character. Blessed with a malleable physiognomy, White is at once rascal and protector of the brood. White makes us want to know Lip better. That's rare.<br/><br/>In a smaller role but probably my favourite is Emma Kenney as little sister Debbie. Her deadpan wisecracks supply the laugh-out-loud moments while her heartbreaking scenes of longing for parental love bring a tear to the eye of the most hardened soul. She can act toe-to-toe with Macy and still steal the scene.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is almost as good. Their performances would be wasted, however, without a tight script and fluid - but not frenetic - direction. The third episode brought all these pieces together in a fascinating show.

The comedy that they do attempt with it is the nasty mean-spirited kind of \"humor\" that is not funny, but is simply insults without intelligence attempting to hide behind the mask of comedy.<br/><br/>So unfortunately the series is going down hill at a break-neck pace, and likely nothing is going to save it now, especially with the loss of the central character.

It doesn't have distinctive, stylish features. Into its 3rd season, The Blacklist survives, it thrives despite its being no Breaking Bad, or Mr. Robot, or Fargo, or The Knick. How is this possible? Just what is its appeal?<br/><br/>James Spader as Red Reddington is the answer and the sole reason this show is so watchable. He's not only the captain of the ship, he's the crew and the ship as well. In short, his performance is everything that makes this show great and I suspect he's somehow improved the template like performances of his supporting actors over time. The man is just a joy to watch and makes an improbable character--govt spy turned international criminal mastermind-- delightful and believable. Every actor on that show ought to thank Spader for allowing them the opportunity to make money on a show that would have been cancelled its first year--perhaps mid-season--if he were not on it. It's the darndest thing, the difference one actor can make. <br/><br/>Still, I wish that the creators had chosen a different actress to play the part of Elizabeth Keen, the FBI profiler that Red Reddington is inexplicably fond of. Someone like Zoe Saldana would have been brilliant casting and added dimension to the mystery of the Keen-Reddington relationship. And perhaps better casting for that part would have inspired the writers to shape her role more credibly and sent the show into the stratosphere. While Megyn Kelly may be a solid actress, she does not yet have the chops to make something of the oddly inconsistent writing for her role. Too late to change this up now. <br/><br/>I'm hardly the only fan who tunes in to enjoy Spader's performance, marveling at how the dreamy young actor with long blonde hair evolved into this very charming, balding older man who can act his *beep* off.

Though there were some moments where it seemed a little bit exaggerated but considering its genre as a TV series, that is reasonable.

I'd be surprised if this review isn't skimmed over and marked unhelpful by them. Obviously I'm not speaking to all the British, but the majority that unfairly judge this show with little to no basis in the truth. <br/><br/>This whole fanaticism is juvenile and petty.

I've read comments ranging from 'bad acting' to 'direct copy', neither of which are true. The first season may have had its borrowed bits, but that was to get it on its feet. The second and third seasons have proved that it is a show entirely on its own, with scenarios and characters having NOTHING to do with the UK version at all. The acting is just as convincing and real as the UK version. <br/><br/>I've even read that Michael Scott is devoid of David Brent's humanity! In actuality, Michael Scott is shown as far more human than David Brent, who was more manipulative (albeit, poorly) and heartless. The US version still has the cruel elements of the UK version, but it balances these awkward, painful moments with tender, human moments, which makes it more enjoyable and watchable. <br/><br/>As for the humor, each show has its own moments of subtlety, detail, absolutely outrageous moments, awkwardness, pain, cuteness, ridiculousness, and vulgarity. The UK version was groundbreaking. But instead of blindly basing your opinions on bias and arrogance, see the US version for what it is - a brilliant, brighter version that, in its first season, simply used the framework of the original (the characters and basic situations) to get started with. <br/><br/>This is the funniest, smartest American television show in recent history besides Arrested Development. Not since Seinfeld has a show made me laugh so hard and smile so much.

Some of those qualities are still there, but unlike MALCOLM, BREAKING is the blackest of black comedies. When I first heard about it, the reviews I read compared it heavily (and favorably) to the Coen Brothers' dark crime comedy FARGO. And the comparisons are aptly warranted.<br/><br/>This is one of those series where the less you know about it going in, the better, but just to set your mind reeling with the possibilities, here it is in a nutshell: Cranston plays high school chemistry teacher Walter White, who is constantly battling the lackadaisical attitudes of his disinterested students, the looming specter of financial disaster - by supplementing his paltry teacher's salary with a second job at a local car wash, and trying to cope with the impending arrival of a new baby, even as he and his wife raise their disabled teenage son, whom unlike many stereotypical portrayals of handicapped kids is no Pollyanna-like angel. <br/><br/>Then in the midst of all this, Walter makes a shocking discovery: he has inoperable lung cancer, and therefore only a few years left to live at best. Facing the very real possibility of leaving his family struggling not only with his death, but a financial situation that could only end in catastrophe, Walter suddenly has a revelation, thanks to an idea handed to him by his boorish brother-in-law, who works with the DEA - he decides to become a crystal meth dealer. <br/><br/>Okay, so while you're letting your brain take that all in, you also need to know that this is one of those defining roles where you just know that the lead actor will get Emmy recognition, whether he intended to or not. That is just how good Cranston is as Walter. In fact, he's every bit as good as Michael C. Hall's Dexter Morgan, James Gandolfini's Tony Soprano or Harold Perrineau's criminally under-appreciated Augustus Hill. And he's backed by an amazing supporting cast of mostly new or unfamiliar faces (with the exception of Dean Norris as the brother-in-law).<br/><br/>You can tell from the word 'go' that writer/producer/director Vince Gilligan (former head writer/exec producer on THE X FILES) has been champing at the bit for a while to let fly with a project like this. And if the first episode is any indication, AMC has another real winner on its hands. So MAD MEN will need to move over and make some room...since BREAKING BAD isn't the kind of series to \"ask nicely.\"<br/><br/>Which brings up another important point: this is not a series for everyone, the way that FARGO and Showtime's kindred-spirit drug dramedy WEEDS are not mainstream, either. This is sharp, biting, satirical social commentary that draws blood when it sinks its teeth in, and you are guaranteed to wince even as you laugh out loud at Cranston's dead-on portrayal of a MAN on the edge of a nervous breakdown (well, more like over the edge.)<br/><br/>A caveat for would-be viewers, though, and a very ironic one at that: AMC has applied its ham-fisted method of editing its movies to this series as well, unfortunately, making the channel the LAST place you want to see it. The best thing to do is to check out the premiere episode whenever you can catch a rerun on AMC, then hustle on over to iTunes and download it so you can watch it again. Some very important scenes and some impressive establishing shots have been \"edited for time and content\" from the broadcast version, and this is material that IS essential to your experience viewing this show. There is a lot more to the characters and situations than you will be allowed to see on basic cable. So as you watch, keep that in mind.<br/><br/>And after you are done marveling at this magnificent character study sketched in desperation, you can wonder as I did, whether Bryan Cranston will bother preparing a speech for next year's Emmys.

There is Viking tradition, there are interesting social and cultural differences between Northmen and others, there is vibrant Viking society and mainly, there is Ragnar; cunning Ragnar, who would \"give far more than his eye to acquire knowledge\". He is a man of progress, whose logic and wit wins against rigidity and stupidity. He is the man, who comes up with new ideas and surprises everyone who wants to defeat him. Finally, he is the only one capable of carrying this show and pushing it forward. <br/><br/>The third season is also pretty good, although it had slowed down a little bit, dragging the story slowly around, but who cares when Ragnar is going to raid the Paris whatever the cost! <br/><br/>As much I like the first three seasons, there is one thing that kept bothering me throughout second and the third one especially. Every time Ragnar kills some of his enemies (earl Haraldson, king Horik), he creates some kind of vacuum in the society he is not able to fill. Yes, he becomes earl and than king nominally, but he doesn't quite behave like one! I mean as Haraldson had been an earl, he had counselor Svein for the dirty stuff and his guard, he was a judge (in fact), blessed children etc. and all in all there was a lot of things happening around him in Kattegat. Not so with Ragnar; he is just kind of there, not ruling whatsoever, and sometimes it just feels like anarchy there, which I find not entirely plausible. Additionaly, as I have mentioned, there is a feeling of emptiness because of this, emptiness, which I am not quite able to describe. Maybe it is happening, because the second and third series already follows more story lines and can't concentrate on Vikings more, which is in my eyes a threat for this show.<br/><br/>Season 4 takes the good things from its predecessors - throws them away - and builds on flawed stuff of the first three seasons - which is emptiness, story distraction and fade-away from Ragnar. Starting with the most serious issue - Ragnar, it was perhaps the worst decision in the whole show to screw him up. For the entire season 4a, he feels old and tired, doesn't have any desire to explore and raid, doesn't care for his people and children much, and as if it wasn't already too bad, we have to watch him as he becomes a drug addict. This alone is just enough for me. The writers basically take the character majority of viewers cares about most and flush him into toilet. I know he must die eventually, but instead of seeing him suffering for about 9 hours (!!), it would be better to kill him off at his zenith.<br/><br/>Another issue, that hardly appeared in the first three series - there are many meaningless scenes which just kind of fill the time. Consider the whole Wessex feminist thing with Judith - so much time is wasted on her becoming tough and independent, but I don't see a reason why - this is something suitable for 20th century, not 9th. On the other hand there is not much explanation on key events such as why Rollo gave up on his manhood and turned into french nobleman and loving husband so easily.<br/><br/>The emptiness and anarchy I was talking about is really apparent in season 4. It is no more the king Ragnar and his people or the vibrant society from early seasons, it is a mixture of random characters with no depth being around. Typical ruling day of king Ragnar consists of throwing knives, ignoring everyone, doing crazy stuff and taking drugs in the shack, stalking on the rooftop and making a foreplay with that Chinese girl. Bj\u00f6rn tries to look as serious as possible, which makes his character so flat it makes me wonder about Ragnar's successor's ability to lead the show (I doubt any of the sons is capable of that). Than the whole thing with Erlendur's revenge is wasted, as everybody knows from the start Bj\u00f6rn will not die and Erlendur has even got no plan; when Kalf was still alive, there was a chance to take advantage of it, but now he wants to kill Bj\u00f6rn and then will see what's next, probably.<br/><br/>I totally agree with others that it has become a soap opera. Consider king Finehair's arrival. It peaks at the end of an episode, when he basically says in front of everybody he wants to overthrow Ragnar, but that situation is not expanded in the next episode, which is typical for soap operas. Speaking of new characters, they are very uninteresting, and especially Yidu is a complete waste of time, and besides I find presence of a Chinese in the fjord disturbing, she just shouldn't be there; her only purpose is to be a drug dealer anyway. Then there is lot of uninteresting talking about family, children (everybody is with a child now, hearing this gives me an allergic reaction) and how it is being a father, which is just boring. And I can't help myself, but the families look like projections of 21th western family values - different from earlier seasons where we could see more freedom in sexual life and less sensitivity about children and death. Overall the episodes are too talkative and while basically nothing happens in most episodes, everything must have happened in the last one and it created a big mess, but I will not comment on that.<br/><br/>For me, Vikings end with the season 3 and the 4a just does not exist.

There are lots of great characters that appear across the run but at the start the show rests on Travis Fimmel's shoulders and he's really good. Ragnar is not a good man, or father and the danger of the character always is present in Fimmel's wild eyes but you still understand why his men fought for him and elevated him so highly that his sons could trade of his name. His sons each derive some aspect of him, Ubbe played by Jordan Patrick Smith is the explorer he wanted to be, Bjorn the noble King, Hvitserk, played by Marco Ilso, is the sufferer and addict and Ivar the vicious warlord.

How because of their bad experience during childhood and after they have learned to profile and manipulate people,the disorganized crime scene compared to organized scene and mixed crime scene and what it tells you about the unsub. Learning their geographic profile. All these things are in this show to give us a pretty reasonable idea of what they do. How they are made. Why they exist and do what they do. I find it fascinating not only to watch psychopaths and their crimes but to some extent through their fiction, learn something about them. John Douglas says he saw John Gacy and looked him right in the eye when in fact he never did so I don't really take his word about what his job was like.

I normally don't do reviews, however with this show heading into it's 9th season, proper criticism is long overdue. Crime procedurals is not a TV genre I'm a fan of and generally avoid them. However I started watching this show after seeing the short lived series Higher Ground and thinking AJ Cook really had potential. After seeing all her later movies, this show was all that's left so I started watching it and hoped it wasn't too bad. I set my standards too high.<br/><br/>Saying this show is unoriginal is an understatement. I don't think there's a single thing about this show that wasn't taken from somewhere else. Heck the creators admits to taking ideas off real life cases. First off the characters. They are cardboard stock characters from other crime procedurals. Some of them are blatant ripoffs when I hear more about other crime procedurals like NCIS and Numbers. You got the old wise mentor, the apathetic boss, the tough guy, the socially awkward genius, the woman who can hang with the boys, the token eye candy, and stolen from NCIS, the computer expert who's suppose to be wild and funny. If they don't sound clich\u00e9 enough, their distinction is maximized. For example the apathetic boss is so devoid of personality that the actor didn't felt necessary to give him any facial expressions. The tough guy is always the one tackling people. The socially awkward genius has a social past so pathetic Steve Urkel and the geeks from Big Bang Theory come off as more realistic people. The token eye candy (AJ's character) is basically a glorified extra who barely does anything. Their wardrobe never changes either just in case it's not blatant enough what type of characters these are. Boss is always wearing a suit, tough guy is dressed up like he's running a military obstacle course, genius looks like he works in a cubicle, the female agents are dressed up like GQ models and the \"funny\" computer whiz has over the top hair, layers of makeup and an outfit that overall makes her look like some sort runaway from the circus.<br/><br/>As for the story, what story? It takes ques from CSI and every other popular CBS crime show of having that overproduced Michael Bay inspired look as well as grotesque and shocking images and ideas. CSI started this with their forensics and dead bodies while Criminal Minds seems to be aiming for as close to Saw levels. Cause you know, Michael Bay and Saw is what people like to flock to. Episodes themselves are completely by the books. Opening scene will be about the case in question. We hit credits then someone on the team will cite some historical figure at the beginning and end of every episode. This idea apparently was stolen from another crime show. Team presents the case so the audience can follow what's going on. Killer is almost always a guy, victims is almost always women, local authority is almost always incompetent morons. Team will try and piece things together while the killer is doing something that escalates the matters. This is how episodes constantly keeps you on edge. They will also play overly dramatic music to let the audience know how they should be feeling cause things aren't blatant enough already and this show likes to treat it's audience like morons. Though if people actually think this show has great writing then I guess the creators aren't wrong there. The team figures it at the end then gives a exposition dump, if they haven't already, to the audience, uh, I mean authorities like they're reading off a script. Okay they are actually reading off a script, but you're not suppose to make it look like they are. They always make it in the last moment with tough guy tackling the killer. Case has been solved in the course of a day or two. The End.<br/><br/>This is all then repeated in a infinite loop until this show gets cancelled. Everything this show specializes is pretty much everything I hate about the crime procedural genre. There's no story or character development at all. The most you get is if something is happening to the actors in real life (like they're leaving the series) and the writers are forced to accommodate to the change. Speaking of change, the cast has been changed a number of times and the new actor generally looks like the last actor. How original. Well to be fair, they did try the bold move of replacing AJ's token eye candy with Rebecca Locke from the series the Inside. I'm not kidding, it's Rebecca Locke with Rachel Nichols playing her also, except she has CM's craptastic writing behind her. Most of what you know about the characters are given in throwaway lines that never gets followed up on. Not that it matters, whenever they do try and develop these \"characters\", it's always cringe worthy. If the writers just happens to be planning (read: not a reaction to real life) to bring in a character that gets close to a main cast, they are sure to die just for more shock value and things reset back to status quo: the way the writers like it. It's apparent shock value is the only writing skills the staff has. There's not even any concept episodes shows like these like to try out once and a while. You know the episodes that's completely different from the usually.

Off hand, the only thing that comes close to this style of gangland depiction is the first half of Once Upon A Time in America, were we see the heroes struggling to escape the deprivation of ghetto life. This is where Peaky Blinders stands out from the typical run-of- the-mill crime show. There is nothing glamorous about being a gangster in this world. As far from LA Confidential glitz as you can get, the viewer is forced to get down and dirty in the horseshite-ridden streets of post WW1, working-class Birmingham. <br/><br/>The attention to detail, the costumes, the sets, particularly the Lee family dwellings, have all been created to the highest standard.

First of all the acting is the best I've seen in any television show and it remains consistent for every season. Being a fellow brit, I thought the accents where quite good, a little hard to understand sometimes which it would have been at the time period. The only persons accent i have a problem with is the leader of the billy boys, I can't remember his name, his accent was dreadful. Now, season one and two where my personal favourites, the pacing was excellent and knew when it had to speed up and take a break from the action which was so brutal and compliments the show so very well. The characters are were the show shines, the interactions they have between each other are son interesting and entertaining. The dialogue for every season, besides season three which I will get to, is extremely satisfying. The camera work is nothing too exciting but is grounded and works well for the nineteen hundreds were the show takes place. Also, my oh my was the villain great. Every single action he did was so horrid and made me hate the character with all my heart, which is what you want for a show like this. It's all due to the incredible performance by Sam Neill. Somehow the show makes you root for the alcoholic gangster murderers instead of an Irish police officer, it really takes a different perspective from any other television creation. Season three on the other hand was a bit lacklustre. The show tried to grow too fast, the peaky blinders all of a sudden had ten enemies and a hundred different problems to face and it all became a huge mess, sometimes becoming difficult to follow. The show also took a turn towards more buisnessy affairs which I didn't enjoy as much. Besides all this it was still great. Oh yeah, Tom Hardy randomly showing up for a small part was amazing, he's amazing in this show I just wish there was more of him. Season four picks it back up with a simple revenge story, and it works excellently. The villain is pretty simple, nothing too special with an overall bland and clich\u00e9 performance from a-list actor Adrien Brody. Season five is pretty good as well, the start of the season is really strong and has the Shelby family in a feud but the show very quickly forgets about this and moves on to other, more boring things. The very ending is alright, it still makes me want to watch the next season or film whenever it comes out. I realise that I have been quite harsh in this review but the show is really good and has and will inspire plenty of other shows in the future.

Above all though, the vast majority of the music irritates me; could they not blend music of the time while retaining Nick Cave's intro and randomly chosen outros?

The initial plot - the plan to secure the Mint and make off with over $2 billion Euros - was very clever and intriguing.

From here on I expected a taught, gritty battle of wits and wills between the robbers and the police.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Instead of being tight, the plot diverged into silly escapades. One escapade lead to another: robber has to fix some error, fixes it, unwittingly causes another issue, now has to fix that, rinse and repeat. What's worse, the errors, solutions and escapades were incredibly implausible, just being antics for action sake.<br/><br/>In addition, having established their characters in the first few episodes, the robbers then do several things counter to their characters. It was as if the writers wrote each scene independent of what had happened before. It could not have been more random if they brought in a different writer for each episode, and told them not to read the scripts of the previous episodes.<br/><br/>The further into the series one went, the worse it got. During the first season the good, clever plot developments generally outweighed the random, implausible, stupid ones. By Season Two it was open season, with dumb stuff being the norm.

Thought they make some attempts , but ultimately enjoy themselves being called hostages.\nAlso the robbers have their nice Team meeting every now and then , without being bothered about the hostages that they may run or hurt any of them. Liked the trust factor that was built betweent the two parties.\nAnd lastly they buillt a nice tunnel between the Royal Mint and the professors house.

After seeing this and then looking for more information about it, I came across IMDb and instead of finding intelligent reviews from intelligent people, I find a few that scream of ignorance. <br/><br/>It is pretty easy to understand why.<br/><br/>As the 20th century began, human evolution was at a turning point. Science fiction of the day predicted a future that was more enlightened, civilized and more intelligent. But as time went on, things seemed to be heading in the opposite direction. A dumbing down of society began to occur. How did this happen? Natural selection, the process by which the strongest, the smartest, the fastest, reproduced in greater numbers than the rest and in which the weakest or not-so-intelligent were culled, a process which had once favored the noblest traits of man, now began to favor different traits. Evolution began not to reward intelligence, but to coddle and save the weakest. With no natural predators to thin the herd, it began to simply reward those who reproduced the most, and left \"Intelligent Man and Woman\" to become an endangered species. One need not look far within these comments to see that in effect. It's not that hate which is shown in some of these reviews that is killing the world. I think that up to a certain point all of us possess some level of hate. It is not having the mental acuity or aptitude to recognize it within ourselves, and to not let ourselves be led by it. Some of these so-called reviews are downright scary when you stop to think that is the actual mentality of the person who wrote them. One guy decrying interracial couples and gays to the point of not watching a television program that has them. A woman who says this could not happen and in the next paragraph goes on to detail how it could happen, only not as Christianity. Who cares what it is called, if you admit it could happen?<br/><br/>As for this series itself, it is relevant. For now. In this time. More than ever. <br/><br/>Beyond that, it is beautifully filmed and acted. <br/><br/>Do not fall for the negative reviews of those fanatics and zealots who are purposefully trying to bring down the ratings and who are so lost they cannot even practice the very laws of a god they are trying to defend.<br/><br/>This series is a masterpiece.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "972 out of 1,452 found this helpful.", "date": "29 April 2017"}, {"title": " The Handmaid's Tale-Seaso-1-2-3", "content": "SEASON-1\nA masterpiece! Put feminism aside for a moment, this is a brilliantly told story whether you are watching it for empowerment or just as a leisure activity.

Season One is slow in parts, but each carefully framed shot is purposeful and powerful. There is no holding back in The Handmaid's Tale, and as the story progresses, there are twists and turns that you have never before seen on T.V.\nSEASON-2\nSeason Two of The Handmaid's Tale is the perfect continuation of Season One, yet it comes back even stronger with new, shocking conflicts. Moss, Fiennes, and Strahovski all have incredible chemistry together on screen, and this season, the tension is stronger than ever.

There is nothing in my previous sentence that is not true. Let me type it again. The Handmaid's Tale is a series that presents what could happen were women's rights reverted or taken away. Is it an extreme depiction? Let's study that for a moment. In a Puritanical society, the Bible was the sole authority. Puritans believed it applied to every area and level of life. The Salem Witch Trials are one such example of Puritanical beliefs in action. Were it not for historical documentation, you would have people negating those as well. So, as to the question of whether it could or couldn't happen, the people most decrying it and stating that it could not happen, are the ones that most believe it can.

The other major problem is that \"The Handmaid's Tale\" was a masterpiece of understatement and brevity.

Birth rates are plummeting. An ultra religious cult see it as their God given mission to 'save mankind'. They seize power by staging a fake terrorist attack against the US government, impose marshal law and set about rebuilding American society.('War On Terror' anyone?) They use The Old Testament as their blue print, but with some totally wack interpretations and distortions. Fertile women become the property of the state. Brain washed and farmed out to the new ruling elite as baby makers, slavery and subjugation is all they can hope for. <br/><br/>Margaret Atwood, Canadian hero, social commentator, environmentalist, activist, feminist, tech inventor, business woman and visionary always maintained that this isn't sci-fi, but 'speculative fiction', things that have a chance of happening in the near future. Written in the '80's it's probably more profound now; the Neo Con Christian's have become a powerful force in US politics. Could there be a Tea Party without the ultra religious Republicans? Probably not. Maybe it takes a next door neighbour from Canada to really see what's happening with the totally dysfunctional family next door? It has always been a source of debate about how a country so entrenched in the ideas of freedom and liberal philosophy can also be the home of such obvious bigotry and divide? Surely teaching Creationism instead of proved science in some State's schools is a warning sign? Maggie may well ridicule this dogmatic un-thinking, however it's far from funny when she points out the possible end game and consequences for society and women in particular.<br/><br/>The book, although heavy going at first, is one of those you can pick up every few years and just dive right in (thanks to Una for making me read it back in '87). I was worried that this TV adaption wouldn't do it justice. How wrong I was. It's slightly different, and relies on a lot of flashbacks like the original narration; however this narration helps to smooth over the cracks nicely. So it still sticks faithfully to the principles and main events of the story, albeit in a roundabout 'more up to date' way. The subtle creep up and takeover of government and power has been well handled so far. I am enthralled, totally impressed and on tenterhooks with Bruce Miller's adaption. The direction is also smart, (the hanging scene seen from the back of a van was powerful stuff). Every image is a perfect composition, nothing is wasted, it's real art in the hands of skilled camera operators. <br/><br/>The feminism is subtle, not the clumsy and overt 'all men are bad, all women are good little victims' like of some of the more hardcore feminist literature. Maggie recognises that some women can be bad too, and some men will die to do the right thing, as you will see. Her book made a point that this could only happen if most women were willing parties too, and that a 2,000 year old book of moral tales can hold a massive amount of power when deliberately abused in the wrong hands.<br/><br/>It's also highly commendable that the cast are just 'normal folk', no super skinnies, models, hunks or pretty boys are in sight. This makes it all the more believable, it could happen to you and me. The lead, 'Offred' (Elizabeth Moss) absolutely nails it. No spoilers, but she will impress you with her canny nouse and determination to survive despite many obstacles and traps. I haven't seen one bad actor in here so far, they've obviously got bags of talent and emotional range. The design and resurrection of 'The Shaker Movement', as in the book, harks back to an American and European age of persecution and religious fervor. <br/><br/>Adhering to Maggie's descriptions of the colour coded dress, the production designer's subtle placement of now highly valuable Shaker furniture here and there helps; the muted drab colours, even in the opulent wealthy homes, take us sub consciously back to the times of Salem, witch trials, mass hysteria and life devoid of 'modern vices' like free speech, self determination, free love and modern relationships.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see how this progress', although I know how it ends (can't tell you, but get ready for some shocks!).

I'm good at this stuff and the acting and characters blew me away that I wasn't looking for it. <br/><br/>Best Pilot ever. IMHO.<br/><br/>Then I thought. Well they can't do that every episode because if you are looking for twists you find them. If I was told there was a twist at the end, I would have figured it out (everyone's birthday on the same day, etc). But the fact one was black and the other two were twins threw me. PLUS the fact one was \"Ryan Gosling\" body and the other was overweight threw me that they were twins. Both played on stereotypes which I Loved they made us look into ourselves a little.<br/><br/>So where does the show go from here? It has a great premise. Dual time lines. You can do a lot with that. Have stories play out with flashbacks to tell a larger story (ala Lost). The casting was nailed with exceptional talent. I was interested in every character. They even nailed it by casting Simon and Simon vet Gerald McRaney. He was the glue that MADE that story line click. He speech on the chair was Emmy worthy. I hope he is a regular cast member and explore his wife's death and the death of his one child.<br/><br/>I'm hooked for at least season one. No need for twists. The dual time lines and great characters is enough for me. They can bounce all around in the 80s when the \"triplets\" are 4 or 10 or 15. triple time lines or more.

Such clever writing, acting and directing.<br/><br/>I have laughed out loud watching Schitt's Creek. I have felt delighted, annoyed, surprised, cringey, charmed and deeply touched. Season 4 episodes Open Mic and The Olive Branch brought tears to my eyes. \"That\" scene in Olive Branch I have rewatched about a dozen times and will watch again and again. (Avoiding spoilers here so not saying more than that.)<br/><br/>David Rose. I just want to put my arms around him, give him a big hug, tell him he's beautiful and good and right and that everything will be okay.<br/><br/>Love, love, love Schitt's Creek. Love the humour, the satire, the subtle jokes and the big, fat broad ones, and most of all I love the love.

The script sometimes feels like it was written by a team of 15 year old girls. I'd say my biggest complaint, is how stupid its become. The logic has become mind numbingly dumb. Soooo many plot holes. Sooo many inconsistencies. In one episode, called \"Flash Time\", all the Flashes are running near the speed of light. Then, in other episodes, Flash slips on some marbles and goes \"Darn it, the bad guy got away because I fell down. There is no way I'd be able to catch up with them now!\" I've forgiven them alot over the years for using dumb logic in their plot devices, in all their episodes , but its become way too much. The writers don't even care anymore about making sense. They've relegated this show to pure stupidity. The crisis crossover has been the dumbest thing I've seen on TV. I mean seriously, in 1 scene, Barry must run on the treadmill to save the multiverse. I use to watch all the arrowverse shows, but I've dropped all of them but Flash, but soon I will be dropping flash. It's obvious their target demographic for this show are 10 yr old girls.

The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET. <br/><br/>The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series. <br/><br/>The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films.

I decided to write one, after seeing all the positive remarks on season 3, feeling quite the opposite myself.\nI really liked season 1 of \"Stranger Things\", one of the best shows I have ever watched. Season 2 was so-so for me, already seeing where things were going - protracting and adding almost nothing new to the previous one, it was worse.\nBut season 3 is really really bad. It is laughable, unrelatable, full of nonsense. It has almost nothing to do with the atmosphere of the show from season 1 (and to some extend season 2). It is different in every way, and not in a good way. After the first two episodes I was already questioning myself whether or not to finish watching it till the end. The next episodes I watched with one eye looking at other things on my phone, skipping entire scenes of \"important\" dialogue. I actually did not watch the very end of the last episode, I just stopped it.\nWhy did we like \"Stranger Things\" in the first place? Maybe because of the dark atmosphere, the story about the secret experiments and telekinesis, the monster and the upside-down. This is what I believe most people liked. If there was a good writing, I think next seasons should've explained more and more about these things: what is the nature of the monster, why did it appear, what did it want, what was the upside-down all about?\nWhat do we have in Season 3 instead? New corny light atmosphere, some kind of a new monster created out of thin air, unexplained actions and decisions by some people somewhere, new characters appearing with the snap of your finger, just because..., and no answers whatsoever to the important questions of the original story that got us hooked.\nThe two most annoying things here were the shift from the original story to the one about the life of the kids, and the inclusion of the mighty bad Russians.\nRegarding the first one, the show simply changed its story (I guess either because the creators/Netflix were out of ideas, or they wanted to prolong, of course, their \"product\" for as many seasons as possible). Now we were introduced to hours and hours of show about \"a day in the life of ...put a name here...\". I get it, the kids grow up, become teenagers, they start to develop feelings for each other, blah blah blah...But this was not what Stranger Things was about in the first place! And even there, there was no story development at all. Instead, we shifted scenes from one couple, to the next one, then to the next one, and then back again. They say couple of sentences to each other, and we move on. Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat...\nThe second annoying thing was maybe the most laughable and unbelievable of them all - the introduction of the big bad Russians. They just simply appeared out of nowhere, knowing almost all about the experiments, the door to the other world, maybe the monster (how, what did they want, why were they doing it, these are stupid questions nobody cares about, right?). They had unlimited resources, operated without notice on American soil (WTF, HAHAHAHAHA), had amazing technology and machines (??). And then the Russian \"Schwarzenegger\" guy? Oh, my lord, that was absolutely ridiculous, and absolutely unrealistic. The scene where he walks around hundreds of people celebrating 4th of July with dark military clothes and holding gun in his hand (!!!) just like that, then he shoots a guy dead, but guess what, people around him do not notice, they have balloons and candy and smiles on their faces. Utter nonsense! Or when the \"conspiracy\" US guy was able to fool one Russian guard with his bad Russian accent????? What a joke!\nAt that point I honestly thought Stanger Things moved to the genre of parody. The whole Russian thing reminded me very much of the ridiculously unrealistic old James Bond movies from the 70s-80s. You always had some villain with a base on the moon/island/snow/underground, with unlimited resources, hundreds of people operating under his command, pushing buttons in some corridors in some rooms in some chairs. And our guys are just 3 or 4 against hundreds...\nAnd by way, being Eastern European myself, the image and acting of all the Russians was unrealistic and bad, they don't act and sound and say things the way the show portrayed them, to be honest.\nAnyway, to end this, watching Season 3 of this once great and very promising show was a complete waste of time and grey matter. I will not watch anything new that will come in the future about Stranger Things.\nFor me this show started and ended at season 1.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "11 out of 11 found this helpful.", "date": "7 July 2019"}, {"title": " Season 3, meh", "content": "Season 1 and 2 were fantastic.

Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things. <br/><br/>Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered. <br/><br/>The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable. <br/><br/>Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion. <br/><br/>Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one.

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). <br/><br/>I loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. <br/><br/>From the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.<br/><br/>I know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this.

Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce.

There is some criticism about the pace of EP1, I agree that it felt a bit slow. Viewers who feel it's too slow, please note that the book is about 800 pages long! Additionally, Starz bought 16 EPs rather than the usual 10, so that RDM has time to develop the story line and the many characters that appear in the book. The voice over takes some getting used to, since it's not a common practice today. So I refer back to the book again, because the reader is let into the lead character's thoughts most of the time - it's not all dialogue.

A family that is so imperfectly perfect that you draw the expectations for your own family - present or future - from their actions, morals, decisions and values.<br/><br/>It's a show where an old rich man marries a young woman of colour; where a white patriarchal figure accepts, not without his reservations, his openly gay son and his partner; where a gay couple gets its chance at parenting when they adopt an Asian girl; where we have a teenage pregnancy create the foundations of a loving family; where an old couple decides to give parenting a spin in the second innings of their life; where each child grows up emboldened with the confidence that his family is there to support him/her to become their own person.<br/><br/>What the show does impeccably well is throw societal expectations for a toss to underline only one thing - who we are and choose to be does not dictate the rightness or the wrongness of our being. The only this that does is the purity of our hearts. That is it. One episode after the other, we have the writers create interwoven and hilarious narratives into episodes that break stereotypes and societal conventions to showcase the meaningless of their existence.<br/><br/>Despite the seriousness of the central theme, the show is outright hilarious. It is witty - much too witty to understand every joke, every emotion, every retort in just one watch. The writing is spot on. It makes you live the characters and fall in love with each one of them - one episode at a time. It's made me pause the show because I had to laugh so bad. It has also made me pause to make way for a few tears which flowed without announcement, without purpose. The families, despite their eccentricities and unconventional way of being, are ever so relatable in how they love one another. The only way to truly love someone is to let them thrive in their own choices - that's what I learn from this show - every day.<br/><br/>It's unparalleled what this show has done for the people who were too scared to come out of their closets and the parents who were too scared to have a kid who did. I cannot recommend this show enough.

Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style  show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too  hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh  and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This  show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the  listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly,  clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS.  I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic  sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something  to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family.  And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant  scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the  modern family and modern comedy.  Great show. Period.

There's a lot to say about why this show is great and for me it's for a great part about Ty Burell and Ed O'Neill. The latter, ofcourse, is almost a culthero because of his role in Married with Children, but in MF he's just amazing. His agitated looks into the camera are spot-on and his fear of Gloria is played out great. Burell, in his own right, is a class apart. I wonder if his role could have written in the way is has been written, if it hadn't been played by him. Take away the physical element and his sarcastic undertone and you might end up with an annoying character that insults his wife on a regular base and is constantly dodging responsibility. But this show is about a group and not a lead and everything works. The gayjokes, the sarcasm, the familyfeel... I love it. But...<br/><br/>Somewhere it loses its magic. Not all the children grow up fine in the show. Manny gets annoying, little Joe could have been left out and Haley starts working in my nerves. But I guess this is always a big risk when working with young actors who have to keep playing their chosen role. Also, somewhere around season 7 or 8, the script loses its touch and this is showing in season 9: weird plots, overacting and more crudeness erode the original feel.<br/><br/>And please Hollywood... stop botoxing, lipfilling and plastic surging your actors.

If you're persistent enough and believe it hard enough, everything will be just fine. There are no sad moments, and if one slips in, it doesn't last too long - good vibes only! Everything always has a closure. Flings aside, every workplace is super healthy and there is no envy or jealousy. Everybody plays along well with each other and nobody tries to sabotage you, make you fail or seek an opportunity to replace you and your well-paid position.

Seeing Terry Crews scream like a little girl and freak out trying to put a magical princess castle together is just priceless gold. Or Rosa, the extremely abrasive criminally adept cop who doesn't have an off switch for her intimidating nature. The conversations between her and the timid pushover Detective Boyle make for some great television.<br/><br/>\"go to your happy place\" \"what is that? that sounds stupid.\"<br/><br/>There's also the expressionless, unreadable openly gay police captain who is anything but a gay stereotype, the sociopathically manipulative secretary who in her own words \"thrives on dysfunctional relationships\", and detective scully who is in every sense of the word a failure, smelly, lazy, unadept and just all around a horrible police officer. Andy Sandberg really is just the cherry on top of a great ensemble cast. He plays his normal goofy immature character, but he's not without his redeeming qualities.

This and his competitiveness with detective Santiago cause him to keep his successes just above his screw-ups, and if he didn't actually solve cases he'd probably be fired for goofing off on the job. <br/><br/>Overall i want to see Peralta learn some restraint and become a bit more devious, the competitive sexual tension between Peralta and Santiago become an even more competitive relationship and for Boyle to have a life changing experience when he finally sleeps with Rosa...

While successful police dramas have ruled the airwaves for decades, the same cannot be said for cop shows that aim for laughs. There are some noticeable exceptions such as \"Car 54, Where Are You?\" and the very short-lived \"Police Squad\", but for the most part, it has been hard for show-runners to make crime a funny topic on TV. \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" could have ended up being super broad like \"Police Academy: The Series\" or \"Reno 911\", but luckily creators Dan Goor and Michael Schur have made the decision to keep the show somewhat grounded in reality, allowing for viewers to relate to the characters without them becoming complete cartoons. In casting Andy Samberg as the lead, there was the risk of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" coming across too goofy. However, Samberg is at his career best here as Jake Peralta, a childish and immature detective who just happens to be very good at his profession. Samberg is great at delivering the most ridiculous and silly lines of dialogue without mugging for the camera in the way that some might expect a former \"Saturday Night Live\" performer to do. Half of what Peralta says is either completely juvenile or inappropriate, but because it never reaches cartoonish or mean-spirited heights, he remains likable and easy-to-root-for. The show may eventually reach a point where it may seem absurd that the character is able to keep his job, though that hasn't occurred yet.<br/><br/>If \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" had just been a vehicle for Samberg, the show might have become stale after a few episodes. Wisely, the decision was made to make an ensemble series. It's typical for an ensemble to have one or two characters that aren't quite as funny or interesting as the others, but amazingly, every single character on \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" is excellently performed. Andre Braugher, Chelsea Peretti, Joe Lo Truglio, Melissa Fumero, Stephanie Beatriz, and Terry Crews are all perfectly cast in their respective roles and each have moments where they shine in every single episode. Crews is absolutely hilarious as squad leader Terry Jeffords, especially when the writers are able to make great use out of both his physical strength and priceless facial reactions. In addition to the main ensemble cast, the reoccurring duo of Dirk Blocker and Joel McKinnon Miller as Detectives Hitchcock and Scully, the two worst detectives in the department, are responsible for some of the best jokes of the series thus far. It's also worth noting the writers have made nice use of its guest stars including Craig Robinson, Andy Richter, Stacy Keach, and Dean Winters. Guest stars on sitcoms can be tricky and can often overshadow the episodes as a whole, but \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" almost always makes its guest stars fit organically into the plot in ways that never feel gimmicky or forced.<br/><br/>Although there have only been a dozen episodes so far and there is always the chance that the broadness the show-runners have been so good at keeping down may eventually kick in, the series now remains as strong and frequently hilarious as any comedy on television at the moment. There isn't a particular formula that the show gets hung up on every week and more often than not, there seems to be an effort to get in a decent amount of character development by sitcom standards. If Fox is smart enough to keep \"Brooklyn-Nine Nine\" on for a while, it will almost certainly develop a cult following. If the ratings don't improve and only one season gets produced, at least the series will probably hold the distinction of not having a bad episode in the bunch. 9/10", "rating": null, "helpful": "102 out of 146 found this helpful.", "date": "9 January 2014"}, {"title": " Noice!", "content": "My all-time favorite TV series!

The star detective (played by Samberg) winningly carries the lead with charm (if not grace), but as part of a true ensemble cast, carefully crafted iconic roles played well, and all won me over in the first episode. The surprisingly gay new police chief is a riot for how he takes his zany team in stride, breaking character to enjoy their antics, while maintaining a strict iron-faced facade. Rosa, in particular, stands out as 'scary cop' - Stephanie Beatriz will be a breakout star with this role - you can't get enough of her...and if she and Clumsy Mousy Charles get together or even just continue to dance around it, they'll be the best, most hilarious parody of a Will They/Won't They ever! <br/><br/>The producers claim to be channeling Barney Miller - a far-fetched chutzpadik claim for people who did NOT produce THAT 70s Show, because rarely have current television producers captured that classic 70s overt brand of comedy, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine has indeed! There's a bit of a Naked Gun feel to it as well, what with the vaguely idiotic running gags and horseplay, but Jake Peralta is sharper (and more competitive) than Frank Drebin - leaving Charles to play the fool for him. When Peralta solves crime, it's not accidental - but neither can you take it very seriously, as even the arrest is more of an SNL skit than a semblance of a cop show arrest. I watched the pilot more out of curiosity (and Samberg fan-girl-ing) then out of any hope I would add this to my roster, but wonder of wonders, this thing actually works!

They introduce the audience to the characters in a way that doesn't come across as them trying to bluntly introduce us, as so many shows clumsy do; Shows that tell us how close two friends are in a way real people don't talk, by having one of them tell the other, \"I know you said you didn't want to hang out Friday but I'm your best friend and we're going to hang out.\" Brooklyn 9-9 accomplishes these crucial initial first impressions by not overstating the core personalities of the characters. Half way in, we quickly begin to experience the precincts average day and learn of the quirky interactions that occur between characters alongside the new C.O., Capt. Holt(Andre Braugher). Some characters do leave something to be desired in terms of having something to offer to the show, but the groundwork is solid.<br/><br/>There certainly is the expected detective work, but the main focus is the ludicrous and off-beat styles of the detectives. One of the best things I like about this show, thus far, is the fact that it is able to surprise me with its jokes, most of which are not exactly the shock-value type that are only there because they're so random they're humorous. Though as I recall, that style is mixed in with other, more witty jokes.<br/><br/>I don't see this as a show that will appeal to mass audiences, simply because it is more quirky and witty, though not necessarily requiring its viewers to think more about the jokes.<br/><br/>People who enjoy(ed) shows like The Office, Parks and Rec., Community, South Park, Psych, possibly Modern Family, etc., will more likely than not find something to like about this show.<br/><br/>Obviously not everyone will appreciate it, but I strongly encourage those who are interested in watching it, to watch the entire pilot before making a full opinion.<br/><br/>In the end, Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a fun and silly satire about the clich\u00e9s of police shows, while still able to not take itself too seriously.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "111 out of 168 found this helpful.", "date": "19 September 2013"}, {"title": " Shows a lot of promise - a very likable new sitcom.", "content": "I'm confused by the reviewer (whose comment was featured on the IMDb page just now) who seemingly despised this program and wrote it off, apparently, because he or she felt Andre Braugher deserved better.<br/><br/>I find this review odd, because \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine\" - if nothing else - comes across as a very likable show. <br/><br/>Thankfully spared of talking-head interview segments that have dominated the American comedy scene since The Office, this show also thankfully features no laugh track. Thus, it both has the feel of an old-fashioned sitcom without the dated quality of one. It's actually quite a clever premise: it's a \"cop show\" but set in the workplace environment. This is a clever move as the show is able to subvert some of the stereotypical police procedural elements while also keeping stuff grounded and relatable by keeping the majority of the antics constrained to the police station.<br/><br/>The cast is talented all across the board. One thing you might find as the show grows is that Andy Samberg will become more subdued in his approach. I say this because as of now he is clearly the \"star\" of the show and, as such, he's often given a lot of LOUD dialogue -- but this also happened to the Leslie Knope character in \"Parks and Recreation,\" and she ended up organically evolving into a much smarter and more likable character. I think once Brooklyn Nine-Nine finds its own footing and more firmly establishes its characters, things will settle into place. It's still a bit shaky but it's just the freshman season flaws. Very few comedy shows are at their best in their first seasons.<br/><br/>I'm enjoying this quite a lot so far - it's not must-see-TV or anything of the sort, but it's likable, entertaining and shows a lot of promise.

Delightful? Not so much.<br/><br/>This is a crime show in a period where crime shows are all the rage, so the formula is a familiar one: a crime - usually, but not always, murder - is discovered at the beginning of the show, and the cast are the people who solve the crime. The main difference is that these crimes take place in the military, so the crime solvers aren't detectives, but agents. Leading our intrepid pack is Agent Jethro Gibbs (Mark Harmon), \"the best agent ever,\" according to director, Jenny Shepard (Lauren Holly). The rest of the team consists of Agent Tony DiNozzo (Michael Wetherley), whose last name fittingly rhymes with \"Bozo,\" Agent Timothy McGee (Sean Murray), who seems to perpetually be the unrespected \"probie,\" and Agent Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), who died at the end of season 2, and was replaced by Israeli Ziva David (Cote de Pablo), who, despite having been in the USA for many years, still doesn't seem to get American cultural references. They are assisted by Dr. Donald Mallard (David McCollum), incongruously called \"Ducky,\" and Abby Sciuto (Pauley Perrette), arguably the brains of the outfit, although her area of expertise is never specified. Somehow this rather offbeat and bumbling combination manages to solve the crime every week, and successfully sees that the guilty party faces the proper authorities.<br/><br/>The writing of this show is an odd mixture in that they do manage to come up with some intriguing scenarios, but have created some of the most unlikable characters I've ever encountered. Gibbs seems to rely on little else besides an arrogant stare and hitting his team members upside the back of the head to solve crimes. DiNozzo takes cluelessness to levels that really ought to get him thrown out of the Navy. Ziva covers her inability to get American culture with an attitude of superiority that is wearing. Ducky is a little too eager to describe the results of his autopsies in gory detail - with visual aids. And Abby really leaves me wondering how she manages to exist outside the confines of an institution. The only one I find to be both smart and likable is McGee, and nobody listens to him. Their efforts to solve crimes often come across as bumbling as the Keystone cops, and I'm left wondering how this is supposed to be representative of the Navy's finest.<br/><br/>Given that the characterizations are so unpleasant, it's hard to know how much of that is the fault of the writing, and how much of the actors themselves. Since the characterizations are so consistent from week to week (perhaps a little too consistent, since in some cases they show no growth at all), I'm inclined to say that the actors are doing a good job with limited material. Frankly, they could all benefit from a chance to stretch a bit with their characters, and I think they're all easily up to the challenge.<br/><br/>While I think the idea of showing us how the Navy deals with crimes that take place among its members is a good premise, I really don't care for the artistic choices made in bringing this show to life. In short, these aren't people that I want to invest an hour of my time watching, and the only way I'd ever enjoy the show is if somebody hit Gibbs upside the back of the head - repeatedly.

Almost everything about this show is cheesy, lame, repetitive and poorly thought out. The dialog is sub par at best. It seems like everyone likes the characters and I have not the slightest idea why. The only one one who is half decent is Dinozzo simply because he has no special character traits. Everyone else is a stereotype of a character that has been done to death in a million other shows. I just find that basically none of the characters interact well with one another. It is as if they took the main characters from their own shows and dropped them all together in NCIS. The result is that they are all too unique to create any kind of cohesion. Maybe once a show Dinozzo and Gibbs have a funny sequence of lines but every other time it is not funny and usually nonsensical, defying the way any humans would interact with each other. Not to mention countless instances of assault on the part of Gibbs towards his team, and the team in general towards suspects,terrorists etc. It all adds to the stupidity and unbelievability.

Yet, all of them together (or even divided in groups) create this amazing chemistry that most people desire and few lucky ones have. The humor is wonderful, no matter what type of humor you like, you will get to a point where you will find at least something absolutely hilarious. There is slapstick, some light humor, some dark humor, some raunchiness, some cheesiness - a little bit of everything. The story is captivating; viewers keep coming back to see what situation fate (being the writers) puts the characters in today.

However, I do have my favorite characters/actors/actresses, as I'm sure everyone who has watched the show even once or twice, to those who are avid fans of it.<br/><br/>We'll start from least favorite to best character/actor.<br/><br/>Matt Le Blanc/Joey Tribbiani:<br/><br/>Although some might say, because of his boyish good looks, his cute jokes that he delivers now and then (very well, mind you), and his ability to make you feel sweet and sorry for him at the same time, he is a great actor, and plays his part as Joey Tribbiani really well, he's probably my least favorite on the show.  I love him, don't get me wrong, but I just appreciate everyone else's talents on the show much more.<br/><br/>Jennifer Aniston/Rachel Green: <br/><br/>Rachel Green is a fun-loving, cute little waitress, who seems to always have trouble finding Mr. Right, who is plainly right in front of her 24/7.  Who is that, you ask?  Well, obviously Ross Gellar.  Her roommate Monica's brother.  Rachel is undoubtedly most everyone's favorite character who watches this show, just not mine.  Sometimes her personality can get a little annoying, and although I like her better than Joey, not very much more.  But, that doesn't go without saying that I don't love her in movies. Because, well, I do.<br/><br/>Courtney Cox/Monica Gellar:<br/><br/>It's hard to put Monica Gellar so far down the list, but if I have to make room for the other three, than so be it. As much as I love her on this show, she's just not as good as she is in the 'Scream' trilogy.  But, she certainly does a good job convincing you that she hates to be wrong, has to have everything her way, and is a real trooper with most all of her challenges on the show, that the writers give her.<br/><br/>Lisa Kudrow/Pheobe Buffey: <br/><br/>Now, I love Lisa Kudrow.  She is definitely one of the funniest woman comedians, which is why I classify her as my favorite female on the show. She outdid herself in 'Romy And Michele's High School Reunion', but she's extraordinary on this show.  She's so ingenious with her comedy which is no doubt why she's won several awards for her role on the program.<br/><br/>David Schwimmer/Ross Gellar:<br/><br/>It's so funny to me that I like him so much.  He's not the best actor in my opinion, but he was really good in Kissing A Fool, and really just ok in The Pallbearer, but my second favorite on the show.  He's so funny and he cracks me up with all of his facial expressions and the excellent way he delivers his lines.  He is definitely my second favorite character and actor on the show.<br/><br/>Matthew Perry/Chandler Bing:<br/><br/>They should have a shrine dedicated to this man.  He is so outstandingly funny in every single project that he works on!  He is so hysterical and a true actor in everything that he does, it is amazing that someone can be so talented.  I wish that he were given more roles than just the few comedies he's been in, including Friends. But, he is such a great character on the show, it's hard to picture the program without him. With that being said, I would also like to add that he is not only the best actor on the show, and one of my personal favorites, but I also believe that he would be such a great dramatic actor if given the chance.  If you've seen him in 'She's Out Of Control' you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>So, with that I give this show a definite 10/10.

(I went to Martial arts school years and years ago and was able to see a lady from China who demonstrated her martial arts for us and it was incredible quality, amazing flips control and finesse, this show has none of that. At a U. S. open martial arts tournament I saw the actors of the original Teenage mutant turtles. Hoyoung Pak etc. They were unbelievable absolutely amazing outside the heavy suits).

They just need a better lead better writer and director, better budget and better Martial Artists.<br/><br/>They do little to no research in this show; not in the languages, Chinese background or anything... it has a nightmare of issues and no couple things could fix it. If you are easily pleased.. maybe, otherwise, keep looking. CW is so desperate they seem to hire anyone and try to hope people like it.. I am a die hard Superhero &amp; martial arts fan, but most CW stuff is just there to fill the void after all else is watched. The CW loses valuable supporting actors in shows ( like Supergirl's Jeremy Jordan, that help the shows tremendously and leave the most mediocre actors or just poorly directed/written/produced , they can't discern talent or those hired to run them are just that bad. This is like almost all of CW and it's Superheroes etc., low budget versions of Marvel and better tv. Such a shame since my first love of Superheroes came from things like the old Justice League cartoons.<br/><br/>I wish someone who makes decisions would seek out and take criticism and improve the CW. I personally think the best they have right now is Titans and some good actors scattered in different shows. Arrow started really well but lost direction, Jeremy lost from Supergirl, big mistake, The Flash has asome strong actors Grant Carlos etc, but often falls to bad CW-itice scripts choreography and directing.

Investigators DCI Cassie Stuart and DS Sunil 'Sunny' Khan are initially unsure if the case is worth investigating as they have no idea how old the body is and no obvious way of identifying it. The only clue is a rusting car key\u0085 amazingly this leads to the car which leads to the identity of the victim and a book containing a list of names. The body belonged to a young black man who went missing in the seventies and the names belong to a variety of people; all of whose lives are about to be thrown into turmoil along with the lives of those around them.<br/><br/>These include an Anglican priest who'd had a relationship with a fifteen year old girl, a woman who is now married to a black man but was a member of a racist group in the seventies, a man about to be given a peerage who was an enforcer for a London gang and a disabled man whose wife is suffering from dementia. Over the course of the series the police find possible motives for each of the person on the list and as they investigate dark secrets emerge; even those who are innocent of this crime have other long-held secrets which emerge; some of them will find redemption but some lives will be destroyed forever.<br/><br/>Murder mysteries are one of the staples of television; even ones involving cold cases are hardly new but 'Unforgotten' manages to bring something new to the genre. While there is the question of who killed the body in the basement that isn't the only thing of interest\u0085 in fact the other secrets that emerge are just as interesting. Given that the original crime took place in the seventies it isn't surprising that much of the main cast in is quite a bit older than one finds in most programmes. The cast does a great job; Nicola Walker and Sanjeev Bhaskar impress as the two leading police officers, it was refreshing to have cops who just get on with the job rather than having their own personal issues. Those playing the suspects and their families were fine too; most notably Trevor Eve, as the ex-gangster and Tom Courtenay and Gemma Jones who played the disabled man and his senile wife although it seems unfair to only pick out a few as the cast was uniformly good.

To begin with, I find this an amazing series, very well played by the actors. The series, in my opinion, lets see how the influence of the past throws the shadow over the present, even for old people... It's a story of a so called cold case team. I wondered how it is in England, I am from Netherlands, at some time, 18 years, the crime is \"verjaard\" here. I think it is called \"limitation\" in UK. So no persecution is possible. So I was surprised to see arrests... But that is not the point, all people somehow involved in the victim's life see their present life disrupted, they have tried to put their involvement to the back of their minds, but that never had success, and now the police come to rattle it up... Its also about change, can you really change from skinhead to tolerant? Are you really different from the person yo were 40 years ago? The main question from the detective is also crucial, \"should I do it or shouldn't I?\" Its 40 years ago, let it go, no!, \"I want to solve the case and punish the perpetrator\". Heartbreaking is the confrontation between detective and mother of the victim.<br/><br/>Now the racists aspects. It is a well known fact that in the 70ties gay bashing was not unknown and hatred against \"coloured\" people also existed. So not a strange move to keep that possibility open in the investigation. In fact there are a lot of references at racism, the boy who gets angry at his protector, who means well, the victim being \"chocolate\", the husband who protects his wife even after he knows the facts of her former life... So, Patherton, why on earth should one go counting who is white and who is black in a series? And who is bad and who is not? That says something about you, doesn't it?<br/><br/>According to Patherton: 1/ Detective is female, what a political correct fact! 2/ Assistant is Indian, another one! So we have now a female detective with an Indian assistant and they go along very well, well, that's enlightening... 3/ All the bad men were white! What a joke, It just happened to be so. If you ever watch American series, all black kids are in gangs and all are involved with weapons and drugs. No, not this series. 4/ A woman who marries a black man and helps a black kid with his chemistry exam, is also political correct? Maybe she really regretted the phase of her former life, being member of National front? And whats wrong with political correct? What is political correct anyway? Had the series been better if there was a black murderer? If so obviously Patherton has no idea about the intentions of the series...<br/><br/>So, go see this, its a very good series that make you think... Very clever and emotional filmmaking.<br/><br/>At the moment I am watching season 2 and that is as good as season one. In the beginning we see stories of people of which we ask ourselves, who are they? and what is this? As the series goes on we see all the stories are entangled with the story of the victim. Fascinating stuff! Again, solving a murder that happened a long time ago, does involve different kind of people. And again some aspects of today's society are mentioned. Like the woman with the headscarf who likes to be the school headmaster, or 2 men who live together and like to be father of an adopted girl...

The subtle difference between \"reproducing\" Star Wars and \"recapturing\" Star Wars. Why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right", "content": "It's one thing to bring back elements, characters, settings and stories, and to flash them in front of the audience to cash in on the nostalgia and/or recognisable memorabilia but without using it to further the plot and other to do exactly the opposite. It was about time that Star Wars directives understood that it is too unique a product to be lend to corporate filmmakers. Star Wars needs to be understood and its uniqueness has to be acknowledged in order to make the new stories feel like they belong. This may sound too obvious but if you ever wondered why the new SW movies are so controversial this may be the reason.<br/><br/>Like with \"Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse (2018)\" and their comicbook-industry experts participation, the creators behind The Mandalorian were experts of the industry, connoisseurs of the Star Wars Universe and even long time fans. So they were able to not only recapture the aesthetic of the grimy, battered Star Wars but also build upon it taking the most \"subtle\" things into account. Things like the predominancy of puppets and practical effects over CGI, settings you can feel and touch over green screens and the abundancy of not only known elements previously seen in Star Wars, but a whole batch of new creatures, designs and overall plot elements that felt like they belong to this universe and had always been there.<br/><br/>Exceeding expectations are not only the visual aspects but the narrative too. It might be too late for some story elements now, but it is of great importance that from now on you try to watch the unraveling of the story unspoiled. I was lucky to have seen the premiere of the show before the \"memefication\" of a certain \"element\" that went viral and became one of the biggest highlights of the show. But for me I saw the reveal of this element unspoiled and I was pleasantly shocked, a memory I'll always carry with me. The ability of these creators to generate such shock value and deep moments it's often baffling to me. This is proof that the creators behind the narrative are fully aware of the complexities of the universe they are tampering with and like an experienced surgeon, they are able to tweak, traverse and call back any Star Wars element as they please and with astonishing results.<br/><br/>It seems to be obvious that series creator Jon Favreau turns to gold everything he touches, from his influence in the MCU with the first Iron Man (2008) movie (still regarded today as a favorite among the infinite Marvel movies) to the remarkable and commercially successful live-action Jungle Book and Lion King Disney movies. He seems to understand how to treat a franchise not by exploiting the nostalgia aspects but rather use them to fuel new stories and \"revive\" the experience. Not to mention the contributors to this amazing show hype up the expectations and the quality of the show, from beloved names like Taika Watiti to legendary Star Wars showrunner Dave Filoni. The show today is in the most capable hands possible and away from the corporate meddling of Kathleen Kennedy.<br/><br/>Despite everything it does right, I have found some things that distanced me from it. It is merely one small and almost inevitable aspect I don't think a huge lore such as Star Wars can escape from. Something that makes the world-building so real: the subtle callbacks and references found on names and other elements. This is an aspect that non-Star Wars Lore fans (in which I have to identify myself as even though I have read and know some of the deeper lore) will not like or get as they are cast aside for not picking up or straight up know these references. If people don't know what a Gungan is they won't get the \"you are as ugly as a Gungan\" joke, for instance. But as for the rest, the story can be followed and understood because it feels self-contained and you don't need to know much about the SW status quo at the time other than (in simplified terms) an Empire ruled over the galaxy and now it's over, in this world there are mercenaries that adhere to a code among themselves, there's a magical energy flowing through all of us called The Force, there's a group of Force-wielding knights that fight with light swords, and that's about it. Anything else you need to know it is presented in the story or explained through exposition, which in a huge universe that is Star Wars it is a must in order to be able to tell a story worthy of SW.<br/><br/>\nAs for the show itself, these are some of the most predominant reasons why The Mandalorian gets Star Wars right (reasons I believe stand out among many others the show has) -- WARNING: MILD MILD SPOILERS AHEAD OF SEASON 1:<br/><br/><ul><li>The treatment of the Force -- long gone were the days when the Force had nothing new to teach us. It seemed we have seen it all and had witness it being reduced to a \"superpower\" the Jedis use to move objects. But perhaps the biggest aspect that seemed to bring controversy is the treatment of the force as this quantifiable and immutable force presented in the Prequels. However, the most successful Star Wars stories have not treated it as such, despite the fact that this new addition was provided by its own creator, George Lucas; in fact, the most successful Star Wars stories have expanded on the capabilities of the force still considering it a mystifying and intangible energy that lives in all of us and the binds the universe together. The Mandalorian takes place post Empire, which means the force has started to be known across the galaxy thanks to the Legend of Luke Skywalker, auguring the return of the Jedi Knights. Therefore, treating the force used by the so-called \"baby yoda\" as a powerful and non-understanding power but in fact recognised by some who have heard of it is a genius move as it makes it magical and uncharted still, a long lost ethereal power that exists beyond our comprehension. The force should be something we don't fully understand yet nor people in universe will fully understand either. By allowing the force to be pure and uncharted, there's room for more creative uses of it that when done right can provide of elevated moments. This are shown especially on episodes 7 and 8 of season 1 where by using terms like \"a group of sorcerers called Jedi\", \"I have heard of this power\" and \"i have seen him move things with its mind\" makes the force more mystified and bewildering.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The puppets -- say whatever you want about the incredible alien, prop and set designs of other Star Wars main stream media (TV shows, video games, movies with some really good exceptions of course) but I am one to believe that generally the main reason why none of the later Star Wars media released after the OT were really embraced by everyone as part of the universe is because the \"feel\" of the world we were seeing was not the same. Star Wars stood out from sci-fi like Star Trek and other more \"clean and smooth\" worlds by building a grimy, run-down and almost post-apocalyptic set and prop design with a huge contrast of advanced technology. So when The Mandalorian brought it back, not only by imitating the set and character designs and such but by expanding upon those by using new imagery and creating new alien species that fit with that new world, it was a display of world-understanding beyond any new incorporations Abrams, Johnson and even good ol' George Lucas had ever brought post-OT. By bringing back puppets and practical effects and make up it shows and it gives you the satisfaction of knowing in 30 years it will still hold up because they are physical things, tangible by the actors and even though \"baby yoda\" moves and when grabbed looks like a sack of potatoes, you don't mind because you know it exists, it is there, you can hold it. I'll take your fully-functioning puppet over the best CGI because truth is, in some years, the CGI will have improved so much you'll start to see the cracks when looking back.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Cinematic Special Effects for a TV show -- this may be known for those who keep up with Star Wars news or watch the Mandalorian documentaries in Disney+, but the innovative tech used for the background and other special effects is almost revolutionary and provides a high quality that resembles that of a cinematic film. Needless to say, the special effects, real-model sets design and other props allows the universe to exist and be tangible instead of rendering a scene that with tim we'll notice it doesn't really exist</li></ul><br/><br/>END OF SPOILERY STUFF --<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, The Mandalorian is a worthy sequel to the OT, maintaining the same aesthetic, themes and recognisable elements but providing new and incredible ideas that amount to the incredible universe that is Star Wars. If they are able to keep it up it'll become one of the best SW media to come in its history. Disney Star Wars seems to know what it's doing now after stumbling a couple of time and I commend them for it. SW isn't an easy franchise to expand and continue despite the amount of stories that are left to be told. You know the saying \"Nobody hates Star Wars more than Star Wars fans\".

You're going to give a show that you supposedly loved 1 star just because you didn't like the last 4 minutes? God forbid a show actually make you use your brain to get answer instead of spoon-feeding it to everyone. Please do yourself a favor and google \"sopranos ending explained\" and read the first article, it's long but you'll appreciate the show much more. Showing Tony actually getting whacked would have been tasteless, boring, and wouldn't have left us with anything to talk about. If you really pay attention and look at the fine details everything is there. Plus we had already seen Tony get shot on several occasions, and the fact that people spent 6 seasons cheering the guy on and then want to see the series end with him bleeding out on the table in front of his whole family. Some things are better left to the imagination, and when you put all the pieces together it's really pretty amazing what David Chase pulled off.<br/><br/>For anyone that thinks Tony's fate is up for debate, it's not. Some people say that it just meant that he was going to be looking over his shoulder for the rest of his life (wrong). For starters, the finale opens with a shot of Tony asleep in bed and is supposed to resemble him dead in a coffin (and there is churchy sounding organ music playing). Then one of the few flashbacks in the episode is Bobby telling Tony \"you probably don't even hear it when it happens.\" Those are just a few hints out of many.<br/><br/>More importantly, the entire final scene was set up from Tony's point of view. It opens with him walking into the diner, they show him, they show the table where he will be sitting, then they cut back to Tony, and then there is a jump cut back to him sitting at the table. It's a strange looking cut, but it makes it appear that Tony is looking at himself (like an out of body experience).<br/><br/>During the final scene, you hear the bell ring 4 or 5 times, each time it cuts to Tony's face, then shows the doorway to the restaurant, and then cuts back for Tony's reaction. They use the bell to create a Pavlov's dog type effect, it makes you expect to see certain things each time the bell rings (shot of tony looking up, followed by a shot of what he sees from his POV). So the last time you hear the bell ring, you see Tony's face, and based on the established pattern the next thing should be what Tony is seeing (Meadow walking into the restaurant). But instead there is a smash cut to black, why? Because Tony is dead and you are seeing his point of view, he is no longer seeing or hearing anything. Chase wanted to do 30 seconds of black originally, and if it had just been the end they would have faded out the music instead of stopping it immediately. So You know that he got shot in front of his entire family, Meadow walked in at the last minute and witnessed it too. Carmella and AJ were looking at their menus and wouldn't have had a chance to warn Tony. And if Meadow hadn't been late then the shooter wouldn't have had a clean shot. To me that has much more of an impact than seeing him bleeding all over the table. The guy in the Members Only jacket going to the bathroom to get the gun was a throwback to the Godfather when Michael Corleone went to get the gun from the restaurant bathroom. They show each of them eating one of the onion rings that Tony ordered, which is supposed to symbolize taking communion. Tony had done too much messed up stuff to get off scott-free, and everyone knows that in the mob you either die or go to jail. <br/><br/>Whether you understood the ending or not, The Sopranos is one of the best TV series of all-time. It's a show with so much depth and complexity that you can watch it over and over and still find new stuff every time. If you only watch a few episodes here and there and then just watch the finale, you'll probably be disappointed like all the other idiots that did that were.

It's one third of what I like to call the \"holy trinity\" of TV dramas, the other two being the much loved Breaking Bad and the critically acclaimed The Wire. It's such a great TV series that even a 20,000 word review would struggle to explain every single thing about the show that works, and I know you're about as willing to read a post that long as I am willing to write one, so I'll try not to draw this one out too much. That being said, there's a lot about this show that I want to say, and a lot of praise I'd love to throw its way, so here goes.<br/><br/>The Sopranos works on so many different levels it's staggering. It's a complex character study, a tense crime drama, a relatable family drama, and sometimes it even feels like a weird, twisted sitcom. There's moments of brutal and shocking realism right alongside surreal dream sequences and scenes ambiguous in nature. There's suspense, black comedy, surprising deaths, and even the odd tear-jerking moment.<br/><br/>Every character is fascinating, as barely anyone is purely good or purely evil- almost every character is a different shade of morally ambiguous grey, and this is what makes almost every character, major or minor, so interesting. The stand-out character of course is Tony Soprano; the show is about him after all. He is absolutely flawlessly played by James Gandolfini, who has done other stuff in his career, but never anything as memorable as his role as the lead in The Sopranos. Here is a character who feels like such a real person it's damn near scary- I feel like I know Tony better than some people I see in real life on a weekly to bi-weekly basis. This is perhaps one of the most fleshed-out and well-developed characters in the history of entertainment. Throughout the 6 seasons we see dozens of Tony's therapy sessions, with each one adding something to the character. We see many of his dreams too, with these sequences putting the viewer directly into his head and allowing us to see his most personal thoughts and feelings. He interacts with countless other characters too; in fact, almost every character in the show interacts with Tony on at least one occasion. It's a credit to both Gandolfini and the writers that the character of Tony Soprano felt so real throughout the show's run.<br/><br/>That's not to say Tony's the only well-developed character on the show, because that's not true at all. Almost every character has depth and is interesting in their own way- personal favourite characters of mine include Livia Soprano, Tony's delightfully crabby mother who's obsessed with control, Ralph Cifaretto, an absolutely horrible colleague of Tony's who is so much fun to despise, and Adrianna, a character who starts out as being there mainly for fan service, but becomes one of the show's most sympathetic and interesting characters further down the line. I would like to talk more about the characters, but honestly, to do so may cause this review to move into spoiler territory, because like I said before, nobody on this show is ever really safe from death. One character may appear to be the kind of person who'd last all six seasons, but may well be \"whacked\" after just a few episodes. On the other hand, there's characters who could only be seen in the background occasionally throughout the first season who become significant characters in later seasons. What I'm trying to get at is that the show's unpredictable and I don't want to go into discussing specific plot-lines or characters too much because you're really better off going into this series knowing as little as possible in order to get the most enjoyment out of it.<br/><br/>And by the way, try not to read too much about the show on the internet either before or while you're watching it, as it's an old-ish show, and that means people are generally less cautious about displaying spoiler warnings prior to discussing potentially \"sensitive\" material. The internet is a dangerous place to be while you're watching a show that's already aired, so just remember to be cautious.<br/><br/>The use of music in this show is also something that really needs mentioning. The show uses music frequently, and also uses a great range of music throughout its run. David Chase and the others who worked on the show clearly have a talent for selecting music that just works so well for particular moments. Special mention has to go to a few songs/scenes in particular:\n<ul><li>Alabama 3's \"Woke up This Morning,\" which is used so perfectly in the show's unforgettable opening sequence, which never fails to get me psyched for the episode to follow.</li><li>A lesser-known Rolling Stones song called \"Thru and Thru\" is used unbelievably well in the final montage of seasons 2's finale, \"Fun-house.\" (\"Fun\" fact: Funhouse is not only my favourite episode of The Sopranos but probably my favourite TV episode of all time. I think it's so good I might even write a blog post specifically for the episode, as I can't really go into why it's so good in this review without outlining the general plot-line).</li><li>Then there's the song \"Wrapped in my Memory\" by Shawn Smith used at the end of the classic episode \"Long-term Parking,\" which is season 5's penultimate episode. The way this bittersweet sounding song is used is phenomenal- a perfect way to end one of the most well-known episodes of the show</li><li>And I don't want to forget the use of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" in the show's notorious final scene. Most people seem to associate the song with Glee, but The Sopranos used it first, and so much better too. Like the episode Funhouse, the final scene of The Sopranos could use its own blog post also, but I probably won't ever talk about it because it's already been discussed to death all over the internet. Generally every episode of The Sopranos ends with a piece of music that plays over the final scene, and continues to play over the credits, and it's staggering how often this piece of music reflects either the style, tone, themes, or even the general plot of the episode it closes. I'm an absolute sucker for a good soundtrack, and The Sopranos, I'm pleased to say, completely nails it in the music department.</li></ul><br/><br/>The writing and the directing in The Sopranos is sharp as hell too. The writer's inject so much wit, tension, and pathos into this show (sometimes all at once) it's mind-blowing. The show has so many different moods and feelings, but somehow the writers manage to tie it altogether into something that feels very cohesive. Many, many quotable lines and catchphrases too. This show has some serious style too, and the look and feel of the show honestly looks almost movie-quality at times. This can be credited to the show's directors and cinematographers, who give the show such a unique and memorable style that really progresses and becomes more pronounced as the show goes on. There's a reason this show was so revolutionary and acclaimed when it first came out- no other show before it had ever looked quite so cinematic. I personally found myself forgetting at times that I was watching a TV show (worth mentioning is that the acting from some cast members is movie-quality too).<br/><br/>Mind you, The Sopranos is not a show for everyone. It's got some very adult content, and there's the fact that it's quite a strange show too- there's literally at least three episodes that are almost 45 minute long dream sequences inside Tony's head, and a sense of ambiguity is often present thanks to the characters' general sense of moral murkiness, as well as their often strange and ambiguous motivations that aren't always spelled out. Almost no character is ever easy to decipher and understand- there's few stereotypes on this show- and while this could frustrate some people, I personally like this aspect of the show, as it makes everyone feel a bit more \"real\" and compelling. And then there's that ending, which isn't going to be for everyone (I loved it though).<br/><br/>I also want to say that this show requires some patience to really get into. I don't think the first season was phenomenal, as the writers and cast members were still trying to work out the best way to portray and develop these characters, so it gets off to a slightly shaky and uncertain start. Mind you, I still thought the first season was very good, but it took me to the end of the second season before I started loving the show, and it was about a month after I finished the final season before I realised that The Sopranos was probably my all-time favourite show. The show will grow on you, but it'll probably take some time, so be patient. Pretty much every HBO show is like this (see Game of Thrones and The Wire in particular). Also, there are a huge number of characters, and it will take by my approximation at least 10 episodes before you'll remember most of their names (unless you've got a great memory or something). This can make early episodes a little difficult to get through, but if you stick with it it'll become something you get used to.<br/><br/>So if you're an avid TV watcher, I highly recommend giving The Sopranos a watch. It helped popularise the sense of grey VS grey morality that is so prevalent many recent shows, and also pushed many boundaries in regards to what kind of adult content a TV show could depict, as well as how cinematic TV could look. It's amazingly well acted, written, and directed, has an astoundingly diverse soundtrack, and features in my personal opinion one of the most deep and interesting characters off all-time- Tony Soprano. I see it as required viewing, and even though you personally may not love every aspect of it, I'm sure most of you will be at least able to develop a great sense of respect for the show. Don't be put off by its age, or the fact it ended 13 years ago- this is still must-watch television that has aged and will continue to age gracefully.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "31 out of 35 found this helpful.", "date": "23 April 2020"}, {"title": " Third time watch since the series ended.

I never underestimated this show, because I heard great stuff about it, but also bad stuff. And that's okay, because it is not a show for everyone. If you enjoy mafia movies, even on a small level, you are definitely going to enjoy this. If you don't enjoy mafia movies, then you're probably going to enjoy it anyway. The reason why I am comparing this to movies, is because it is a movie on some level. It is a cinematic show. Before The Sopranos, shows such as Friends, Seinfeld, etc, all shared the same thing. A 20 minute episode, they weren't necessarily connected to each other, but people still enjoyed them. Now The Sopranos, it has been said by many that it is basically a 13 hour movie. That is because each season has 13 episodes (except for the last one). I imagine what a challenge it must have been for David Chase (the creator) to get a television to pick the show up. Naturally, he got turned down. It would have been impossible for The Sopranos to be part of a network television. I believe that the limit in network tv, is about 42 minutes per episode (then you have the commercial breaks and other things). Luckily, HBO decided to put the show on the air. An episode is around 52-60 minutes, and it was this show, that put HBO on the map (later producing shows like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, Westworld etc). When the first episode aired in 1999, it started a new age of television. The viewers were introduced with the concept of an anti-hero, being the protagonist of the show. This shocked a lot of people, because they were used to seeing bad guys in movies, then getting killed at the end. Having said this, The Sopranos was immediately revolutionary. I imagine how people felt when watching it, thinking \"a show about a bad guy\"? It was never done before... But after the first season, people realized that it was special, and the reason for that is because it was different, unique. The greatest thing about this show, except the story line and structure, I have to say that it is the casting. It is not one of those shows where the lead actors are good, and then the extras are there to just do the part. Every single person withing the shot, is so spot on. I have to give credit to David Chase, who I know pays a lot of attention to detail. It is crazy how you can't imagine other people playing those characters, and that is because no one could play them like the cast did. James Gandolfini's performance is probably the most powerful performance on TV. I have watched a lot of shows, and I have never seen such brilliant acting. I hate it when people compare his performance to Bryan Cranston's on Breaking Bad. Don't get me wrong, it is also one of the best performances, but you have to know that if it wasn't for The Sopranos, there wouldn't be Breaking Bad, or Walter White for that matter. The Sopranos opened the doors for many shows, such as Breaking Bad, Mad Men, etc. The other great thing about the show is the writing. Every character has its own arc. You can see how they develop during the show. Except for the anti-hero concept, I think that it was also the first show to introduce character development. There's something about how the characters are written. Just the main idea of the show, the professional and personal life of a mobster, struggling with his work and family, is brilliant. It treats subjects like illness, the importance of it, loyalty, love, trust, hatred, death, and many others. You see characters change, evolve, you start to like them, you start to dislike them. It is the best written show to this day. It is dark, witty, cynical, and most importantly, addictive. David Chase decided to do what no other director did before. He showed violence, drugs, sex, and other elements that no one thought of putting in television. It pioneered cinematic television, it took mental illness seriously, it changed how we watch TV. I am not reviewing the episodes and story line, because I don't want to spoil this masterpiece, but I have to say one more thing... Whatever you're doing, stop!

Based on a typical mob story the Sopranos goes one step further (many steps infact) and not only provides probably the clearer social commentary on modern America but also delivers the most well written show in the history of Television. It serves as the profile of a man who-in his existential crisis- tries to understand humanity, violence and the meaning of true love. Tony Soprano is a ruthless mob boss but also an extremely loving husband. The whole show builds it's flawlessness and genius around that line: the violent monster and a wonderful human being. The Sopranos mastered the term of an anti-hero to a degree that cannot be surpassed. Obviously James Gandolfini's monumental perfomance is the strongest point of this show but everything work together so well that you can't just lay your eyes away.<br/><br/>The raw strengh of all this deeply affects the viewer, personally it changed the way I see things in a lot of ways. All the violence at times is extremely disturbing, the amoralism of the crime world has never been more believable and depraved. As I said, David Chase has mastered the term of the anti-hero. All these main characters are basically monsters, unethical violent killers but still so likeable, so believable and so trustable. Chase is trying to understand what a sociopath really is, involving psychology, and after one point the viewer starts to really understand the weight of these gangsters actions. Weird thing is the most you are shocked by those the more you want to see this show, the more you want to explore the darkest aspects of human life. I've been so moved by another show, it is really groundbreaking.<br/><br/>And then there is James Gandolfini who gives probably on the most momumental perfomances on camera. He has such a unique, charismatic aura in every frame he is in he simply is masterful. He can amazingly infuse anger, confusion, depression, love all on that same frame without making it less believable or overacting. He bases his perfomance with his eyes, heis simply jaw dropping in every minute of this show.<br/><br/>Then you got all the luben side characters, who all are so unforgettable, you think you really know them from one point forward. Paulie, Silvio, Furio all are classic to the mob universe, true gems.<br/><br/>This deep bond with all the characters make every dark decision they take so much more painful, you really start to feel the rage, the guilt, the grief and the existential crisis the characters are going through.<br/><br/>But besides all the nihilism there is love. Family, friendship, forgiveness. All these values have never been stronger in Television. It truly is Family Redifined. The nuclear American family is under attack here, constant analyzing with supreme social commentary on post 9/11 crisis and much more. Under all the hate this family keeps going through, never stops to fight for something better and as we can see in the final shot of the show it was really about family. Love, forgiveness, trying to understand each other, the basic values of every family are being presented with uch realism and fairness.<br/><br/>Hope is what holds Tony Soprano together, what keeps every human going.

Naturally, expectations were over the roof - and it was a forgone conclusion that meeting those expectations would be next to impossible. Well, here's the good news. Judging from the first couple of episodes, 'Better Call Saul' will be good. Just how good remains to be seen, but as far as promises go, those first episodes made a big one.<br/><br/>For those who haven't seen it yet: relax - I won't spoil a thing about the storyline. Instead, I'll concentrate on all other aspects of the show. The first thing you notice (as was the case with Breaking Bad) is the camera. The photography is simply gorgeous. All the visual trademarks I've grown to love so much in BB are there: the playful camera angles; the creative ways to establish even a simple scene with unusual, interesting shots (yet without ever distracting from the storytelling) - it's just beautiful to look at. <br/><br/>Then there's the music. From the wonderful introductions (before the opening credits) to the last scene of an episode, music is not just used as background \"noise\": carefully picked songs are there to give clues and are as much an integral part of the story as they help establish the tone of certain scenes. And the original music by Dave Porter feels as organic to 'Better Call Saul' as it did in 'Breaking Bad'.<br/><br/>The writing, directing and acting (so far) are on par with BB; anyone afraid this would be a rushed production trying to surf on BB's success can relax; not for a second did I get the feeling this was somehow not well thought through or cheaply constructed by a committee of writers - and although we do of course get some of our favorite characters back, new ones are introduced that promise to be just as original and interesting as the ones that helped turn BB into a cultural phenomenon. And adding high calibre actors such as Michael McKean ('This Is Spinal Tap') to the cast is probably an indication that Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould will not content themselves - or us - by mainly exploring the characters we already know. <br/><br/>And then, finally, there's the magnificent Bob Odenkirk. Starting off as a slightly one-dimensional character and comic relief in BB, the character we've come to love as the sleazy, slick Saul Goodman has already shown more layers in the first half of the first season of 'Better Call Saul' than over his entire run on BB. And that's as much thanks to Odenkirk as the fantastic writing: the actor obviously relished the opportunity to show what he's capable of as his character charms, squirms and threatens his way through his scenes, but - somewhat unexpectedly - he also manages to move you during the more quiet moments. <br/><br/>To sum up my overall impressions: 'Better Call Saul' is a darkly comic, multilayered story that could end up being just as unusual and exciting as we all dared to hope. The tone may be consistent with 'Breaking Bad', but make no mistake: this is very much its own thing. The writing, directing and acting - as well as the production values - are top notch, and if what we've seen so far is anything to go by, we're in for a great first season of a very promising new show.

I was furious when I heard about the spin-off to the amazing Break Bad. Nonetheless centering around the buffoonish clown of a character Saul Goodman?! I was livid and heartbroken. I wanted Breaking bad to end on a high note and not let this potential disaster ruin it's legacy.<br/><br/>Breaking Bad was an absolute masterpiece of a show, with an amazing story, script, cinematography; you name it, it's there. But the one thing that made Breaking Bad shine, and in my option, be one of the greatest series ever made was it's deep, deep burial into the characters that made us either absolutely love or loath them. It didn't rely on special effects and had no fat to it whatsoever. No other show encapsulated a slow unfurling of characters so well that it was as if we were getting to know them in our real lives.<br/><br/>I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot after hating it's first episode on release. I figured, maybe I could eventually forget about the fact that it was attached to my favorite TV show, and when everybody who watches it is telling you it's amazing, there must be something there.. right?<br/><br/>Boy, were they right. Better Call Saul is just as good as it's predecessor. It maintains it's very high standard to every aspect of the production, and most of all, character development, motivation and relationships are centerfold once more. It is easy to find Better Call Saul even better than Breaking Bad, although I would chalk this up to it being more current and therefore more in the forefront of our minds in the Breaking Bad universe. If you, like me, have hesitated to give this show a shot for the same reasons, stop it. Let yourself feel uncomfortable for the 1st half of the first season, and then let it get it's clutches into you.<br/><br/>I'm so, so very happy I finally decided to give Better Call Saul a shot again 4 years later.

Sure, in it's nature, that's what the show is. But unlike other TV spin-off's that are just 'extra' episodes that degrade the original show, Better Call Saul has significant promise as a standalone series that could come to rival it's predecessor.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, the show returned me to the universe of Breaking Bad. Not in the obvious ways of reviving characters and settings, but through the subtle cinematography and script writing of Vince Gilligan. The camera focus changes and the interesting angled shots are quite unique to Gilligan's shows. This artistic and cinematic experience that begun with Breaking Bad is now continuing with Better Call Saul, once again proving that television can be as good, if not better than films.<br/><br/>The acting in the series is incredible. I don't think anyone will be able to top Cranston's portrayal of Walter White, but Odenkirk forms far more depth in the character of Saul Goodman than we ever see in Breaking Bad. Moving away from just comic relief, Saul is now a darker version of his false identity, and Odenkirk finds the balance between these two personas very well. Hopefully he will continue this standard to give Jimmy McGill a Walter White-like descent into the criminal world. <br/><br/>The humor in Better Call Saul is really well done. The show isn't a comedy, but the occasional funny moments are quite akin to what was done in Breaking Bad. The dark, witty wordplay made me laugh quite a few times at Saul's... sorry, Jimmy's lines, with the subtlety of the script writing shining through. <br/><br/>The music by Dave Porter once again really adds to the engrossing cinematic experience of the show. The musical choices are reminiscent of Breaking Bad, but are moulded in a very different way to form a lighter tone in some of the more comical moments. The weird and wonderful musical montage songs are back (starting in the first scene), which brings us back to Walt and Jesse's cooking (Crystal Blue Persuasion, anyone?).<br/><br/>Gilligan and Gould start the story with quite a lot of missing context surrounding Jimmy's brother Chuck and his law firm. Although this may be confusing in the beginning, I later realized this was intentional. Instead of just spitting out the back story in unnatural ways, the writers make you think about the situations, and gradually piece together what happened before the events of the show. This widens the whole show's time-frame, instead of just being self-contained. The brief flash forward to the fragmented Saul Goodman after Breaking Bad was amazing. I really hope that the writers continue to play around with time, shifting between past and future guises of Saul Goodman.<br/><br/>Better Call Saul has a lot of promise to extend itself beyond its Breaking Bad spin-off status.

I did not read the comic, but this series got me already confused in the very first episode. So Lucifer(The Devil himself) takes a break from his duty and takes form of a rather charming looking man and owns a Nightclub in LA. No big questions so far, but then a famous hot model and former worker gets shot in front of Lucifer's eyes and is dead and instantly he cares about it and punishes the one who pulled the trigger. Already there are 2 major reasons why this set up makes no sense. 1: He is the Devil! He should not know better, than spreading evil. Why does he care? 2: Why does Lucifer punish sinners during his vacation? That is part of his work he is appointed for. So why does he rebel during his break on earth?<br/><br/>Still I was willing to give it a try after that confusing start. But after 3 episodes the show just does not go anywhere, we see that Lucifer, besides that he has sympathy towards others, also has an incredible amount of charisma. He also has a soft spot for women. He has control over his temper and he wants to keep punishing sinners during his vacation, because he is a white knight? although he despise children, which kinda makes sense, but the rest does not. So this show wants you to believe that Lucifer already changed in this good guy right from the start. But therefore the show took away a very important piece for the development of Lucifer's character: 'His change from bad to good'. He is tired of ruling the underworld, I get that. He takes a break on earth, but the show completely skipped the part where Lucifer has to adapt in the civilisation(his character arc), which is just a waste of potential and lazy written. With that being said, we are supposed to ask the question how this guy already made his development in being good instead, which is simply not appealing and also not explained. I have to force myself to watch a show further only because the character or plot wouldn't make sense or wouldn't be interesting in general otherwise. It is therefore very difficult(at least to me) to care about Lucifer. He is likable though, but after a while many of the jokes he makes start to fall flat or made me even cringe. Don't get me wrong. I think Tom Ellis is doing good in his role, but the writers only give us Lucifer's funny, juvenile and arrogant play-boy act and barely his dark, violent rage. They could have made him in the kind of character like Hades from Disney's Hercules, which had a very neat contrast between his humorous passive side and his raging dark side, but alas. I am not sure what the writers went for Lucifer's character and it won't stop with his personality either.<br/><br/>So later on as the show goes on, there is this angel that keeps appearing. Telling that Lucifer has to go back to his own world, and Lucifer rejects(every time). And the angel says: 'Ok' and then he disappears. His visits are neither threating for Lucifer that made me care about the situation nor did they offer much significant to the plot(seriously what was the point), only that there is this angel: Amenadiel, who wants Lucifer back in hell and can stop time, which Lucifer somehow can't? I am very suprised how little power Lucifer has. He can't control time like Amenadiel or teleport(otherwise he would've used it). He also can't manipulate weather, cast illusions, summon demons, or control animals, humans or objects, except for that coin. The only useful thing he c\u00e1n do is either punish sinners or make people say their darkest secrets.<br/><br/>The show annihilated the Devil by making him into a white knight right from the start, with hilariously little power only to make this work in the formula they went for: A cop/detective show with him solving cases. The more you think about it, the less it makes sense. The real Devil would just laugh at you: Solving cases at this scale, while he can punishes thousands of people every single day from his world. Instead of giving Lucifer the big treatment in why he is in the human world in the first place and why is he is so kind. The show focusses in the numerous cases that involves people/matters that we just don't know/care about. And as a result Lucifer gets too little effort that makes me care even less about him. There is just so little to say about his personality and his reasons about his actions, just like pretty much every other side character.<br/><br/>'Lucifer' just offered me nothing. The show keeps me instead wandering what the story could've been. Lucifer could've been the centre villain in during his vacation and that the police department has to find out who is behind the crimes he did or that Lucifer wants to explore the way how humans justify criminals and has a hard time in doing so, because he does not know better than spreading evil.

All of the duo's cases take place in the picturesque yet fictional county of Midsomer which must have the highest death rate anywhere in the world!<br/><br/>This highly popular detective series was first aired on 23 March 1997 when the pilot episode \"The Killings At Badgers Drift\" was transmitted. ITV announced it as a one off film but it was very successful with figures in the region of 13.5 million viewers, and the film won the Best Drama Award that year. The film was based on the 1987 novel by Caroline Graham which was regarded by the Crime Writers' Association as being one of the Top 100 crime novels of all time. The initial series which followed was based on Graham's other four Inspector Barnaby novels, these were \"Written In Blood\", \"Death Of A Hollow Man\", \"Death In Disguise\" and \"Faithful Unto Death\". Having filmed the majority of Graham's novels featuring Barnaby (A Place Of Safety &amp; Ghost In The Machine have not been filmed as yet) the producers turned to other writers to provide new stories for the subsequent five series. These have included contributions from prolific and accomplished writers such as Anthony Horowitz (\"Agatha Christie's Poirot\"), Douglas Watkinson (\"The Professionals\", \"Boon\", \"Emmerdale\") and Christopher Russell (\"The Bill\", \"Cadfael\"). In the past six years since it made its debut on British television there has been nearly thirty episodes and there is no hint of the series finishing yet. The series is notable in that it has brought John Nettles back to prime time TV after the \"Bergerac\" series finished in 1993. In this series he played Sergeant Bergerac, a Jersey copper fighting alcoholism and has had uncomfortable relationships with several girlfriends, a role far removed from that of Inspector Barnaby.<br/><br/>The first episode of the seventh series entitled \"The Green Man\" was aired on 2 November 2003. Daniel Casey who plays Sergeant Troy has left the series. The character has been promoted to Inspector and is leaving Midsomer to take up a position in Newcastle. John Nettles will have a new sidekick in John Hopkins as Sergeant Scott who will be introduced when the remainder of the series is broadcast in January 2004.<br/><br/>\"Midsomer Murders\" is a wonderful series, although like many long running series, it has occasionally fallen below it's own standard in that the ideas for new plots sometimes becomes strained after so many episodes. The characters are rich and well realised by first class actors and it gets full mileage out of it's rural setting. Guest stars have included Alan Howard (the nephew of Leslie Howard) and Samantha Bond (Miss Moneypenny in all the James Bond films since \"Goldeneye\"). The quality of this series to my mind is that it should make it to the big screen someday. There would be no need to change anything as all the ingredients for a good cinema feature are there already. These days most of the quality stuff is on the small screen and a lot of mediocre stuff is lumbered on our picture houses.<br/><br/>It has been announced that John Nettles will be quitting the show after playing Inspector Barnaby for twelve-years since the show made its debut. However, he will still be seen in it until 2011 and it looks very much like the show will still continue very much in the manner of other TV shows such as Taggart and McCallam, which carried on without their title characters.", "rating": null, "helpful": "116 out of 121 found this helpful.", "date": "3 November 2003"}, {"title": " Understated, witty and intelligent", "content": "This shows tongue is so far into its cheek it's a wonder there's not been a serious rupture! <br/><br/> From the outset back in 1997 there has never been a moment that we were meant to take too seriously - but we do!

My appreciation for this show has only grown; which leads me to substantially increase my rating from the first season or two. FYI: yes, while thankfully not too hard to understand here, there is closed-captioning.<br/><br/>Why I've grown to like this show so much: While the initial season or two were rife with annoying stereotypes, as the show matured, so did the characters. Barnaby, the lead, is a nice change from the sometimes deranged, immature and annoying detectives so popular on American television today. He's a laid back intelligent fellow, with a stable marriage and a lovely grown daughter with ambitions of her own. It's also a nice change for a detective show to not rely on any ongoing marital or family strife as a prop for ramping up tension and drama. Any marital spats here are realistically mild and short-lived (except for the first season or so, when Joyce (his charmingly age-appropriate wife) too often complains about his frequent and justified absences during \"family\" moments--that was irritating, as any cop's spouse--or doctor's spouse, or fireman's spouse, would know that is part of the job; especially in a rural district with low staff numbers. I realize I'm over thinking this, but I'm glad they dropped that trope relatively early, regardless). As of season 12 Joyce is secure in her relationship with Barnaby and a woman with an active life outside of her marriage. This is a healthy relationship with mutual support and affection. Such a nice change from the usual. His \"sidekicks\" have also matured and grown more believable.<br/><br/>Even better, the show has improved the mysteries and interjected a bit more dry and appropriate humor. The Barnaby of season 12 is a confident and relaxed, seasoned detective. Sure of himself and his team(unlike many shows of this ilk); willing to let others do the heavy lifting--far more realistic than an older lead detective charging off after a younger suspect--and even let someone else take the lead. By season 12 Barnaby is secure in his position and has nothing to prove to his superiors; he's good at his job without being a rigid moralistic crusader, and everyone knows it. Despite the fact that he despises office politics, he's an active part of a functioning team, and the other characters are also allowed to change, grow and mature, with character arcs that realistically portray their growing knowledge and confidence--and promotions.<br/><br/>Another thing I really like about the program (and for me a major point of appreciation for British programming in general) is that many of the characters are middle aged or elderly. The cast is composed of actors and actresses that look age-appropriate and like real people. These are not Hollywood plasticized, Botoxed and sanitized versions of the middle-aged or elderly. Victims and villains, and even those having romantic affairs look like ordinary people-in some cases very attractive ordinary people, but people with prominent laugh lines and even (gasp) gray hair. People with character. Senior citizens are actively having love affairs and sexual encounters and no one is acting shocked at their age (except perhaps a spouse or two, or maybe their grandchildren); and the writers don't treat it like a joke. <br/><br/>This show rarely makes any note about how old anyone is when they are getting up to whatever they are doing--except perhaps in admiration. What a breathe of fresh air! You do not have to suspend disbelief to accept that actor as the father of that middle aged child, or that one as the middle aged parent of that teenager, or that those people are actually married to each other and have been for 30 or 40 years, or that person was active in WWII, etc. Given some of the mysteries go back to something that happened decades or even generations before, casting age-appropriate actors matters a great deal, even if it didn't seem like an obvious thing to do anyway. (On a social level, it also demonstrates a much greater acceptance of aging and flaws in appearance. You can be attractive even with wrinkles and a saggy bum. An attitude we'd do well to emulate). Midsomer's murder demographic definitely skews older than we would assume from similar American programming. I like that very much.<br/><br/>Overall a very enjoyable program with interesting and believable characters (if you can get past the first season or so) and great actors. Usually not the most challenging of mysteries, but entertaining. The quality or challenge of those mysteries can vary. In general the audience is given the same knowledge as the Detectives, so in that regard there are few \"cheats\" (I can't stand mystery shows that cheat their audiences; leaving out crucial information that only the sleuth knows). Most of the time the Detectives spell out their logic (sometimes as the show progresses, but usually at the end) in figuring out the murderer's identity and/or the murderer's motive.

It is rare that an episode features a single murder, usually there are two or three. Given the high murder rate one would expect that the local constabulary would have a large murder unit but in fact all murders are investigated by DCI Tom Barnaby and his sergeant.<br/><br/>It is a mistake to join any club, society or organisation in the Midsomers as they are nearly all hotbeds of jealousy, rivalry and backstabbing and those that aren't will somehow offend other villagers. These feelings inevitably lead to murder, usually in a fairly imaginative way. Unusually for a TV detective Barnaby is happily married with a grown up daughter. It is surprising that wife Joyce and Daughter Cully have survived as they often found themselves in the groups where the other members were dropping like flies.<br/><br/>While there are plenty of murders it is never overly gory so it is suitable for all but the most squeamish. The cast do a great job, as well as the regulars you can expect to see several well known British actors appearing as suspects and victims. Don't expect it to be too serious though and don't expect it to accurately portray police procedure...

Two geeks have a beautiful girl (Penny) move to the apartment next door. The two geeks have two friends that are even geekier. Here is the many ways in which this show excels: the geeks are lovable and funny and human, not pathetic, you feel for them, the neighbor girl is a very sweet girl, and for once the characters are educated and thoughtful, not the usual \"dumb\" people we see on TV. The dynamics and the dialog between the four friends is fast paced, funny and rich with detailed observations. This is a comedy by Chuck Lorre, the guy who has created Dharma (from Dharma &amp; Greg) so I am fully expecting Penny's character to bloom into far more than what meets the eye. The four male leads establish their personalities in the pilot with such ease that it's clear we are watching a very well written and well acted show. Kudos to the whole cast and the writers.

Anyway, 10 minutes into the first episode I was bored out of my skull with the already repetitive and awkward humour. But, I knew that 10 minutes of one episode was not enough to judge a show by. So I watched the 1st season and a half and I can say not once through those 25 episodes did I even come close to cracking anything that even slightly resembled half a smile. It is the same sitcom show we've seen for the past 40 years disguised as a quirky show filled with intelligent characters. I've read a lot of the other reviews on here and a lot of them agree with the statement that this is not a quirky or even slightly smart show. The demographic it appeals to are brain-dead teenagers who think that when the extremely unfunny Jim Parsons says a few big words, it is the most hilarious thing there has ever been. Strip away the incredibly simple Star Wars references and the mumbled soliloquies of Parsons and what's revealed is a below average sitcom decades behind its time filled with unlikable characters.

A character will say something like, \" I want to be a robot.\" Than the laugh track kicks off, sounding like they just heard the funniest thing in the world. The whole series are based on socially awkward nerds who meet a normal girl and they try uselessly to fit in with society. How can an entire 5 seasons be focused on that?

Now coming to the show, starting with what I liked - Cavill's Geralt is absolutely spot on, he nails it. The production value is also decent and some of the side characters like Tissaia and Jaskier are done well. Fight scenes are top notch, Cavill brings the physicality to them that was required.<br/><br/>Now to the bad. Everything is rushed, the pacing is terrible and it's full of awkward timeline jumps that are done so badly that it will confuse even the avid fans of the series. Dialogue at some instances are horrific and the majority of the jokes did not land. The storytelling suffers because of the terrible pacing and the timeline jumps. There is no room for character development, if you do not already know these characters, the show doesn't make any efforts to make you relate to them or care for them(except for Geralt). Infact some of the character and their arcs are changed for the worse in the show. For example, in the books and in W3, Yennefer is sometimes arrogant but she's also genuinely intelligent and cares for people she loves. In the show she does nothing smart, we are just forced to believe that she's intelligent and she throws everyone around her in a dustbin. Yennefer's character segments are all either her whining about what she didn't get from life or acting smart(instead of doing anything smart). She's a complete fool in the show. Other characters like Calanthe, Vilgefortz and Eyck of Denesle are also portrayed horribly.<br/><br/>The casting is bad as well. Except for a few actors, none of them seemed like they belong in a Slavic/East European medieval fantasy setting. Beauty is subjective but some people look better than other in general, Triss looks nowhere near as good as she's supposed to, and infact the minor female character(Renfri) that we meet in the first episode looks better than almost the entirety of the rest of the major female cast whom we know are supposed to look beautiful.<br/><br/>And talking about Slavic roots, well, there doesn't seem to be any here. There is no hint of the Slavic folklore and culture present in the show. W3 did the adaptation of the folklore so brilliantly with all the different East European(and Scandinavian) dresses and costumes, the various folk monster/beast designs and lore, the stories and superstitions of the land, the little intricate details within the accents and the language, and the rituals and customs of the local people. These are the things that differentiated the witcher series from other medieval fantasy stories. There's none of that here. It feels like a generic 2019 diversified medieval show with high fantasy elements. This ain't witcher.<br/><br/>To sum this up, it's not a straight up bad show, but a painfully mediocre one. Though if not for Cavill's brilliant portrayal of Geralt and the very obvious high production value of the show, maybe I would give this a 3. What they needed to do was to take it slow and do what they did in the first episode(which was the best of the season imo) i.e. start with Geralt's adventures and stories and build up the main narrative(a shorter, more focused one than what this show had) towards a longer season of 13 or 24 episodes. That gives us more time with the characters, and gives the writers more room for exposition and world building, which would have eventually resulted in a more coherent experience. For season 2, I'm hoping they would honor the Slavic foundations and the identity of the witcher series, improve writing and pacing, and deliver quality over quantity without a rush for completing the saga.

I am no stranger to bad acting and can usually ignore it for an entertaining story as I have done with the Hercules and Xena shows but this show is not entertaining either.<br/><br/>The bare bones of the Witcher universe is that the characters should act more or less like real people in a less then friendly world with many injustices and where the protagonists usually get screwed in some way, either by \"destiny\" or by other people that are being petty and cruel or sometimes they get unusually lucky but very rarely.<br/><br/>What made Geralt an interesting protagonist is still there to some extent so that aspect is fine. Geralt is essentially a knight errant constrained by a personal moral code that contradicts with the Witcher code, which produces some less than ideal situations for him.<br/><br/>However what made Yennefer interesting is now completely gone and what replaced her is an idiot instead of a mature and powerful sorceress, we get a petty child that is angry at the world she asked for.<br/><br/>Then there is the casting of this show that is done purely for political correctness to fill some diversity quota and ruin immersion. I care little if they are not the right color but when they suck at acting too then I will call it what it is: a diversity hire.<br/><br/>The writing is probably the weakest part of the show with modern colloquialisms and bad story telling, it is an attempt at a less linear story telling that ultimately fails and just confuses people because there are no markers and events to give you a hint of what story tread you are following.<br/><br/>The directors and show runners simply suck in most aspects and were also probably hired to fill a diversity quota instead of merit. Something to the effect of we need a woman to direct this instead of someone that understands the Witcher universe and what makes it unique. Bad is bad I don't care who you are, your work sucks.<br/><br/>The cinematography is weak and the production values suck, you have a party in medieval times that looks like a pretentious modern party with bricks partially exposed and cheap lighting.

As I'm Polish and Witcher is a significant part of our culture, I have made an exception though to watch Netflix's adaption.<br/><br/>My expectations were high as both the book and the game are indisputable masterpieces.<br/><br/>Yet I feel that Netflix has wasted its potential.<br/><br/>Its problems start from the casting.<br/><br/>They have chosen the average-and-Gypsy-looking actress to play Triss role. Yennefer - even after the transformation - isn't stunning either. And that is surprising as, in Sapkowski's books, all sorcerers in the Universum were gorgeous as their appearance was magically modified.<br/><br/>Choosing Joey Batey to play Jaskier was also a bold move. How could this character sleep with all these women if he looks 23? The good thing is that Jaskier - unlike Triss and Yennefer - is played incredibly well and Joey defends the director's choice.<br/><br/>That thing can't be said about Vilgefortz. I don't mind that he's been played by an actor who looks exotic. The problem is different. He was one of the most cunning and powerful characters in the whole Witcher. But Netflix's version of the character is stupid, weak, and has a carpet salesman vibe.<br/><br/>But the casting problems aren't the biggest ones. The biggest problem of this TV Series is the script, which is just terrible.<br/><br/>The script has been written based on Andrzej Sapkowski's books. Therefore the main plot with all the twists has been already there. Yet it looks like the scriptwriters just didn't understand what made these stories great and modified them to make them worse.<br/><br/>The whole idea of Witcher's short stories before the main story starts is to build a relationship with the characters and learn about the world before the main plot begins.<br/><br/>Yet here they mix it up. There's 30 minutes of the short story and 30 minutes of the main plot. As the stories have been placed in different moments in times, it leads to tremendous confusion with the chronology. It can be seen the most with the Cintra plotline. I will only add a lesson from the scriptwriting 101 - if in the first episode, you kill a character with which the audience has no emotional connection, they will not care about this event. Apparently, it wasn't that obvious for scriptwriters.<br/><br/>Battle scenes are just weak. If you don't have the budget or skills to film a Helm's Deep style scene, it's better just to mention the battle than to show scenes worthy of a YouTube amateur production rather than a contemporary TV series with a multi-million dollar budget.<br/><br/>Also, almost all the changes made to the original plot are terrible. What they have done to the best story - the one with the dragon - is a scandal. All the fighting scene suspense is gone. And the dragon itself looked like a joke.<br/><br/>Also, if their goal is to create a series with a dark atmosphere, they must have dark colors and dark scenes. Think of LOTR or some Viking Episodes. I have no idea why they shoot a lot of scenes in an intense light, which wipes out the mystery and make it looks cheap.<br/><br/>Music is a particularly pathetic point of the series - it doesn't play at all. It does not build tension, does not add depth, does nothing. Some tracks sound as if the editor left them accidentally and forgot to delete before sending it to Netflix.<br/><br/>There are some bright spots, though. The most important is Henry Cavill in the role of Geralt. I couldn't think of a better match. He is Geralt.<br/><br/>Another great person is Joey playing Jaskier - even though he looks too young, he is an incredible actor, and the dynamic he has with Geralt is amusing.<br/><br/>The Witcher fighting scenes are excellent. Also, the magic spells look very natural. Although the music in the series is weak, Jaskier's song - \"Toss a coin to your Witcher\" - is outstanding.<br/><br/>All in all, I feel that this is okay-ish adaptation. It hurts me, though, as both the books and the game were masterpieces. Therefore, anything below the quality of Lord of The Rings is a massive disappointment for me. Unfortunately - mostly due to the lousy script - Netflix hasn't fulfilled the full potential of these series.<br/><br/>That said - I've still binge-watched the whole Season as it's a solid production. So watch it and form your own opinion!<br/><br/>And check the books guys - you'll understand why the Witcher could have become the best TV show ever made.

Sometimes even a very minimalist story can reach an incredibly successful point after the right production stages. The Witcher series is far from minimalist. The Witcher is one of the best Middle-earth works in the world. Production quality is essential if you want to handle such a topic successfully.<br/><br/>The world that The Witcher goes through is a world with its own rules, races, characters, creatures, beliefs, even if it does not seem too strange to those familiar with fantastic narratives. In particular, the first two chapters carry the risk of being too confusing while reflecting the details of this world to the audience. After the chapters where it is difficult to fully understand which character serves whom and why, the story becomes more beautiful as the other characters gradually increase in the narrative. There are two main characters in the narrative except Geralt. One of them is Ciri, who was advised to find Geralt when her lands were taken over by the enemies. The other is Yennefer, a kind of witch whose aim is to gain as much power as possible. While the goal of these two characters is evident, the fact that Geralt at the center of the narrative does not have a significant motivation due to the character's characteristics causes the story to be thrown from one place to another. However, the story deepens as the characteristics of this character become evident and the dynamics of the world in which events take place gradually emerge. It is the primary factor that gives the dark tone of The Witcher's world that people use their power and material resources to seize land. The dark narrative that expresses the evil within man is supported by the visual language of the series. The visual language, dominated by darkness and shadows, brings The Witcher closer to a gothic horror narrative from time to time when combined with the characteristics of the characters it contains. This dark atmosphere also gains a realistic tone with the violence of the series. The Witcher, one of Netflix's most courageous works to date, relentlessly conveys the mess of the world it tells. It creates a consistent and dark atmosphere thanks to well-captured battle and combat scenes and technical details such as image management and music usage. 9/10", "rating": 9, "helpful": "1,437 out of 2,153 found this helpful.", "date": "20 December 2019"}, {"title": " Is everybody watching the same thing I'm watching?", "content": "I think this is my first review.

What I ended up witnessing was some cheesy show that reminded me of a bad fantasy you'd see in the 90s.<br/><br/>The Witcher is based off a series of books, the first being The Last Wish. I've only read the first book but am by no means a purist. Changes can be made to the source material and still work, as seen with LOTR. It's just that everything else has to be good and that's where the Witcher fails.<br/><br/>The overall production of the show is garbage despite the fact that it had a large budget of $70-$80 million. Where did all that money go? Many of the costumes are akin to something you'd find in a bargain Halloween store (looking at you, elves). CGI is also noticeably poor. The world doesn't feel real and it's hard to get immersed when so many things look fake. It's rather impressive that the show looks this awful with such a big budget.<br/><br/>The script could definitely use some work. The dialogue at times is hilariously bad, often making a scene that should be exciting turn into something more like a parody. And even the non-dialogue actions ruin battles, like someone taking their helmet off during war to make a cringe scream while being immune to enemies for 30 seconds, or kissing mid battle to unleash a powerful spell.<br/><br/>The show is structured in an odd way with different timelines. For me it wasn't too hard to follow but I have seen many others wondering what the hell is going on. The problem with the timelines is that they throw the pacing off. I think the show would've been better if it focused mostly on Geralt and his adventures as those were by far the best parts. For example, Geralt has a battle but then they show Yennefer's story in a strange attempt to parallel the two, despite the events not even being in the same timeline or connected in any way.<br/><br/>It looks like the show runners are listening to criticism and they said that season 2 will have a tighter story. I hope the show can utilize the budget to improve effects and that the writers can fix some of the bad dialogue.

From the warden, the written phrase framed in the wardens office to what is in my opinion is the most evident form of proof, the rock hammer Archie found in the bible...<br/><br/>At first I was disappointed, later deciding to overlook those miniscule details in the episode. Then came the next few episodes. The writers decide to implement a thrilling game into the show as they implement a board game, changing \"dungeons and dragons\" to \"gryphons and gargoyles\". Next, the flashback episode, featuring a late 80's or mid 90's group called the \"midnight club\" similar to that of \"the breakfast club\". The similarities are uncanny, and unfortunately these examples don't even begin to include the dialogue in other scenes which mirror the movies that writers have been \"inspired\" by as well... Frankly, I'm disappointed. I'm not sure if the demographic for this show is comprised of people who might be familiar with those classic movies listed earlier, but one can think that the writers' goal is to steal from the successes of those past movies.<br/><br/>This is just lazy writing with no originality.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "181 out of 246 found this helpful.", "date": "14 November 2018"}, {"title": " No. Just.

Yes, I know, '13 Reasons Why' came afterwards, but the similarities are uncanny. ...Formulaic moody voice-over protagonist examining laughably clich\u00e9 and shallow life-lessons at the start of each episode with an ongoing 'dark' mystery that I have literally no interest in discovering 'who the killer is'... ...This is, quite literally, the g-rated version of '13 Reason Why'. The baby brother that should have been aborted long ago.<br/><br/>I'm hate watching this show just to laugh at how bad the writing is, and how over-the-top the actors are in reading the lines. I genuinely feel sorry for all of the cast involved, since they are all stunningly gorgeous, late 20-somethings, for what is supposed to be a high school drama.<br/><br/>A lot of investment has gone into the production values, episode direction and 'Glee'-like songs, but that doesn't make up for the horribly predictable 1 bit characters.<br/><br/>I guess, since this is based on a terribly banal comic strip, that I'm supposed to look the other way, and expect it to just be a skin- deep romp. Like watching the movie-version of 'Battleship', knowing, and accepting, that there isn't any real substance underlying the content of what the show is originally based off of.<br/><br/>It's a shame really. I feel like this could have been something, had there been just ever so slightly a bit more comedy and charm worked into the characters.

He is a teen version of 'Elijah' from 'Girls'.<br/><br/>Contrast him, with the main character Archie. ... Archie is the most hatable character, despite always having the smoothest things to say to work him out of the most terribly awkward situations. He never lies to anyone, but it's laughable how everyone fawns over his presence and excuses his poor decisions.<br/><br/>For instance, one minor plot spoiler here... I find it really hard to watch and empathize with a high school football captain jock, who friend zones his smoking hot best friend while in the process of having a scandalous affair with his music teacher. Oh, and when his love triangle explodes, everyone gives him a pass with even his father basically patting him on the back and saying 'it's not your fault'. Really? It's not? Are you sure? Something feels terribly off about the entire ordeal.<br/><br/>A. He's dating a teacher. While this has been done before in other shows, 'Boston Public' comes to mind... ...Here it feel very... very... wrong and superficial. In one episode he acknowledges that he's just having fun with her and celebrating the present with little regard to what repercussions their relationship may have on his family/friends/her career. In the next, he's demanding commitment, and then parting ways with her while gifting her a cello string.<br/><br/>I guess, we're supposed to roll our eyes and accept it. But there's something very cringe-worthy in doing that, as it is with so many other aspects of this show (such as, watching cheerleaders twerk to a hiphop remixed song of 'sugar sugar').<br/><br/>There's a very no-good, terrible vibe, underlying this entire show, Laughing off very real subjects with terrible dialogue, predictable plot twists, and glitzy dance numbers.<br/><br/>...And now I've written too much about a show that isn't worth my spit.

I started watching it following a friend's recommendation, but I warn everyone who is fortunate enough to read my review before it's too late; do not watch this show. I will help you out by outlining a few of the reasons why you want to avoid Riverdale.<br/><br/>The main issue with Riverdale is the way it deals with its two main story lines: the murder of Jason Blossom and the incredibly unrealistic love rectangle involving Archie, Veronica, Betty and Geraldine Grumby. When I started watching Riverdale, I was hoping for the main focus to be on the murder mystery, however the truth is that the writers prefer to devote most of the plot time to Archie's teen high school crushes. Most of all, I hate the way every female character in the show instantly falls in love with Archie. I can't fathom why this is the case considering he is probably the most boring character in the Riverdale universe. He is literally a whiny bitch who we are apparently supposed to root for because of his \"great\" body and passion for music, even though none of the songs he writes are even mildly impressive. My dislike of Archie further stems from the way he treats his supposed best friend Betty. Almost immediately after Betty confesses that she has feelings for Archie, he goes in a locker with their mutual friend and makes out with her when he could have either left the party or just pretended to go along with it. It's also just totally stupid because Archie, who is 15 BTW, apparently loves his music teacher: Mrs Grumby. Confused? So am I... What's disappointing is that all of the time wasted on these love triangles and angsty romances that belong in Twilight and The Vampire Diaries could have been spent on developing an original and interesting murder mystery. It has gotten to the point where I hardly care who killed Jason anymore. I think that one major improvement to the story would have been if they had gone into more detail about Jason's past (perhaps through flashbacks) to pique the viewer's interest. <br/><br/>Other issues with Riverdale are more minor, although collectively they are sufficient to drive me away from the show. Firstly, all of the actors on the show are way too old for the roles they are playing. I know that it is standard procedure for adults to play teenage roles in most TV series, but most of them honestly look like they are in their late twenties. Secondly, the romance between Archie and the music teacher is technically rape, yet the writers almost seem to romanticize it. Kind of creepy to be honest. Lastly, as someone else mentioned on here, the show just feels incredibly clich\u00e9. Just like in every Young Adult adaptation, there is the \"Mean girl\", the gay best friend, the jock and endless love triangles. Wow the writers were creative with this one!<br/><br/>I know you will probably dismiss me as a hater after seeing the overwhelming number of positive reviews for this show on IMDb. My explanation for this however is that the expectations and standard of TV shows has seriously decreased in recent years. In the past, there were brilliant shows such as Lost and Buffy that brought new premises to television and were genuinely entertaining to watch. Now it seems every show uses the same plot, with a slightly different spin, and resorts to using eye candy to hook in viewers. I just hope this trend eventually ends. <br/><br/>Anyway, just don't waste your time with Riverdale.

In about 2 minutes you have about 40 scenes. They cut everything into little tiny bits then stretch it the entire 45 minutes as a poor attempt at creating suspense. I'd much rather see the scenes in full.

This is a remarkable cast of mostly journeymen actors with a couple of newcomers, and they're all turning in star-making work. Even some of the cameos have featured recognizeable, talented actors (e.g. Mira Furlan, Victoria Hamel). <br/><br/>4) A mysterious and fascinating setting.

The problem with Lost is that it does not come through on it's central premise--- to explain the unusual events on the island.<br/><br/>First of all, the show is basically a revved up version of the show Mysterious Island, based of the Jules Verne book of the same title, which I believe was a Canadian television show. But Lost did bring a lot to the table that was promising, if not wholly new. The acting was generally good, and every now and then there were outright fantastic performances. The drawn out emotional montages in the first few seasons actually worked quite well. And the mysterious elements of the Island were intriguing: Smoke monsters, 'Others' weird scientific anomalies, possible conspiracies, etc... but then, once it becomes apparent (around S4) that the writers can't explain anything they've set up within the established reality they've created... they start adding alternate realities. They even jump the shark and add Time travel. And this wouldn't even be problematic for many viewers --- these are good sci-fi staples, and Lost always had a sci-fi appeal --- but rather than explain anything with these clich\u00e9s, the plot is simply muddled. By the last episode, it becomes apparent that neither the 'alternate realities' or the insertion of time travel into the story actually explain anything, but rather complicate an already complicated story into obscurification.<br/><br/>The final episodes of Lost, where 'all is to be revealed' leave plenty to be revealed. Even if you're willing to accept that there are god-like beings (or maybe gods, it's never clear) or simply 'magical' folk running things, this is not enough; you must accept that these gods act without any clear purpose, insisting on the legitimacy of 'rules' that they can't explain. And once you accept that, then you see that those 'rules' don't actually have any purpose, either. Anything an audience holds to in effort to make sense of the reason the island matters, or the reason these supernatural god-figures who can't leave the island (but do) should matter will be disregarded within a few episodes. In the end, Lost, which was so promising, doesn't really mean anything.<br/><br/>And worse, as it loses any attempt at making sense of itself, it revels in drawn out sentimentality. All the cut scenes become interchangeable dumb expressions of people refusing to explain themselves, or acting shocked when they're promised that they're about to be told something.<br/><br/>Why can't women on the island have babies (even though they do)? This is never explained. What 'sickness' on the island drives people crazy? Never explained. What is 'the light'? Never explained. What reality of the many glimpsed in this show is 'real'? Never explained.<br/><br/>There's sooooo much unexplained; and what does actually get explained is usually just explained poorly, and upon some examination falls apart. But all this aside--- is it a good story? Is the action worthwhile? Yes and no. The action scenes are good eye candy most of the time, although the actions of the main characters become more and more contrived. People begin initiating fights for no reason, and the characters seem to be acting very willfully against their own interest, as often pointed out by more reasonable characters; but it doesn't matter; these type-A characters are driven to act by fate itself, apparently. In fact, many of the 'main characters' (Jack, Kate, John, etc.) become irritating and unlikeable, despite their continual hero status. But action? Yes, as implausible as it all is, some of it is good action. There are good plot twists, but these are entangled with repetitive clich\u00e9s; guards are always easily overcome; something will always give one second before the explosion; someone always got away from that explosion, even though you didn't see it. It eventually just gets boring.<br/><br/>In the end, is Lost is the best-made dumb show ever. It severely underestimates the intelligence of it's audience, and this is a mistake when you're selling what's supposed to be a 'smart' show.", "rating": 6, "helpful": "154 out of 214 found this helpful.", "date": "24 May 2010"}, {"title": " Chilling, atmospheric and addictive \u0096 if the writers can weave all the clues and ideas together in the end, this will probably be stapled as the best show ever in television", "content": "While originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching \"Lost\", I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1\u0097the one with the polar-bear\u0097and it has had my undivided attention ever since. The show, that is. Not the polar bear. So bear (heh) with me while I throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster.<br/><br/>\"Lost\" takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchingly\u0097what drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they're running away from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or getting in touch with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But \"Lost\" also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses... and they all seem to be strangely connected.<br/><br/>While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, most of the cast of \"Lost\" are, in truth, spectacular actors for their respective parts, projecting heart and humour in their performances. There's also a multitude of eyecandy, but not generally of the plastic Hollywood kind as most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness, petty arguments or cheesy melodrama (although they are annoyingly secretive) \u0096 these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action. The realism of these characters facilitate an already well-sculptured plot. <br/><br/>About this plot... Imagine a tree as the template plot, then the branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for every character) \u0096 well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines. If you're a brother/sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks, you will get your own storyline. If you're a DOG you will have your own storyline. Unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end, they are setting themselves up.

Charlie Brooker has popped out of the internet at times when I least expect it revealing the more unsettling aspects of our culture through his program Screenwipe and others. That was my first exposure to Doug Stanhope, a comedian who among others brings us closer together via demonstrations of how media and technology are changing our society and rarely for the better. Black Mirror arrives in the form of anthologized science fiction in the vein of the Twilight zone. It is a series that examines our society's relationship with the media and how it allows us to both shape our own identity and imprison us in a space where empathy and truth are weaknesses and something to hide in order to get ahead. <br/><br/>I have always been interested in futurists and Brooker seems to fill the requirements for one. There is nothing in the first two installments that do not reflect current trends in our collective behavior but instead extrapolates where current trends in communications technology; avatars, social media and reality television might lead us if we do not seek to preserve what is beautiful and pure about our collective consciousness and humanity. <br/><br/>Having seen reviews here that feel there is no commentary embedded within these stories I couldn't disagree more. As the title suggests, Brooker's Black Mirror shows us a dark reflection of our selves and allows us to evaluate these scenarios through our own emotional filters. <br/><br/>There are no blatant soap box messages but I interpreted the narratives as cautionary tales and would hope that no one, when confronted with them, would hope for these near futures. The only thing holding them back from becoming reality is our own resistance to complacency and purely spectator culture. <br/><br/>Beyond these philosophical aspects, the program is incredibly well produced and executed in my opinion. The characters and sets create convincing realities and I was never once drawn out of the story due to poor acting, scripting or characterizations. I could not recommend this series more and hope that it will continue on. Congratulations to Brooker and company for their work and their apparent concern for all of us.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "386 out of 574 found this helpful.", "date": "21 January 2012"}, {"title": " Brilliant.

My personal favorite would be episode 2. The most futuristic but also the most accurate representation of what most of our lives look like right now. Just saw in a review that a guy stopped watching after 20 minutes at the second episode. That's the biggest mistake he could do. Definitely the best episode.

This means the series doesn't really have any synopsis I can say, the only thing I can say is just watch the bloody show already. Every episode is different, some horror, some romance, some drama, and if you don't like the episode then just skip it, it's not like you'll miss anything as the next episode on your binge watch will be the complete opposite of what you just watched. As far as acting goes, it's top notch, stars like Jon Hamm, Daniel Kaluuya also appear on episodes bringing their amazing performances to the table. Every episode has their own cinematography, some bright and colorful, one episode will be black and white, really adding in on the unique feel of the whole thing. I would definitely call this show a masterpiece, but i almost gave it a 9 because of the 5th series. 2 episodes from the fifth series were pretty sh*te. Smithereens was great, so was Andrew Scott's performance. So yes, a masterpiece still, I won't let 2 bad episodes change that especially when compared to the works of art that the previous series had to offer. So ignore season 5 apart from Smithereens, Smithereens had a very important message and was a wonderfully shot and acted tale. Think of it as a mix of mini films. Now there may be some things that you may not find good, but there's always an episode for you. There 's twists, laughs, scares all in hour long episodes and tied up in a neat little bow just for you. And the Christmas Special was stunning, don't forget to watch that. But if that isn't enough, they have their own interactive film, Bandersnatch. An. Interactive. Film. You choose what the main character does, and it is awesome. So please, If you have the time, try watching this, you will not be disappointed.\nVerdict: With something new every episode, Black mirror really gets to you, and in all the right ways.

Murder House: 7.5/10, Great season with some real scary things, not my favorite season, it had flaws but the casting was amazing.\n2. Asylum: 9/10, Scariest season of all for sure, my kind of horror. You'd expect that a season that is mostly filmed in just one building would be kinda boring, but it sure wasn't. Incredibly great season\n3. Coven: 8.5/10 probably the most hated season of the show, but why? I loved it. Sure, it wasn't that scary and it had flaws but the casting was perfect. Lange and Emma Roberts were both perfect for their roles. Evan Peters annoyed me though, his role with the whole love triangle with Madison and Zoe was stupid. Probably my favorite season although it wasnt scary at all.\n4. Freak Show: 5.5/10 Doesn't compete with the other seasons to me, the casting was good but that was about it. Overall I kinda enjoyed it, I guess? The ending was disappointing although Lange left the series in a great way. The only character I really enjoyed was the villain. Not a great season, sorry.\n5. Hotel: 6.5/10 Not a very beloved season by most, but to me it was watchable and I dont feel like I wasted my time watching it. The casting was okay, Lady Gaga did great job acting and definitely added a great touch to the season but apart from that it wasn't a really interesting season all around. A lot of blood and sex but not the best season of the show. Overall I would recommend watching it although most people aren't into it.\n6: Roanoke 7/10 Finally another scary season. The season felt like a haunted-House horror movie but longer. Sarah Paulson did incredible as the \"crazy, paranoid wife\". A big plot twist in the middle of the season and it left me with some confusion but I sure did enjoy this season.\n7. Cult 7/10 Before the season started I was really scared I wasn't gonne like this, politics, clowns and Evan as the villian, but after watching it I actually enjoyed it. The concept was alright to me and some episodes were just boring. Again, Sarah Paulson played the crazy wife but again, she portrayed it well. Her wife was very annoying and I hoped she'd die early on but she didn't. The \"different\" episode with Frances Conroy was incredibly boring and didnt feel needed but sure let's forget about it. Sarah did a perfect job and her character was great, excited to see more of her next season.<br/><br/>I love this show and I'm definitely excited for season 8 (Apocalypse) and season 9&amp;10.\nI can understand why people dislike it but it just is your cup if tea or it isn't.

It might be a problem with the time constraints of a 90 minute or 2 hour movie, it's hard to completely capture the audience and slowly twist the perceptions.<br/><br/>Another thing forgotten in recent horror movies is the fact of NOT explaining everything within 5 minutes of it happening, it's more entertaining and spooky to speculate why someone sees something or what actually happened in a particular scene. People forget that in some of the best horror pictures like \"Psycho\" the real horror came from the suspense and the wondering of what was going to happen and that the violence was secondary.<br/><br/>The dialogue between characters is actually impressive especially in a couple scenes that you will be able to easily pick out.

However, there's no denying it's divisive, and AHS purists probably won't be overly impressed. For one thing, it's a dark and camp comedy before it's a thriller or a horror. For another, it leans very heavily into '80s clich\u00e9s and slasher movie tropes. On the other hand, it's consistently hilarious, it doesn't take itself seriously, and despite the ridiculousness of the plot and the twists layered on top of twists, it manages to elicit quite a bit of empathy for a couple of characters who were introduced as one-dimensionally irredeemable. And the soundtrack, wardrobe, and hairstyles have more '80s cheese and excess than you could ever imagine.<br/><br/>LA, 1984. Montana (<a href=\"/name/nm6609666/\">Billie Lourd</a>), a fiery devil-may-care extrovert; Xavier (a superb <a href=\"/name/nm3719144/\">Cody Fern</a>), a self-serious aspiring actor; Chet (<a href=\"/name/nm4665281/\">Gus Kenworthy</a>), a professional athlete who has been suspended from Team USA for the 1984 Olympics after failing a drug test; and Ray (<a href=\"/name/nm5125871/\">DeRon Horton</a>), a friendly man with a troubling secret, are heading to work as counsellors at a newly reopened summer camp called Camp Redwood. They ask their new friend Brooke (<a href=\"/name/nm0731075/\">Emma Roberts</a>) to join them, but she declines. However, that night, she's attacked by Richard Ramirez, aka the Night Stalker (a brilliant <a href=\"/name/nm3262714/\">Zach Villa</a>). She fends him off, but the incident convinces her to join the others. At Redwood, they meet Margaret (an exceptional <a href=\"/name/nm0343678/\">Leslie Grossman</a>), who survived a massacre there in 1970 and now owns the camp; Rita (<a href=\"/name/nm2120241/\">Angelica Ross</a>), the nurse; Bertie (<a href=\"/name/nm0440160/\">Tara Karsian</a>), the chef; and Trevor (a hilarious <a href=\"/name/nm1285162/\">Matthew Morrison</a>), the activities director. Meanwhile, Benjamin Richter, aka Mr Jingles (a scene-stealing <a href=\"/name/nm0002253/\">John Carroll Lynch</a>), the former groundskeeper at Redwood and perpetrator of the 1970 massacre, escapes from a nearby mental facility and heads to the camp.<br/><br/>The first thing you'll notice about 1984 is how immersed it is in slasher movie references and tropes, with a particular preference for <a href=\"/title/tt0077651/\">Halloween (1978)</a> and, especially, <a href=\"/title/tt0080761/\">Friday the 13th (1980)</a>, both of which are referenced throughout the nine episodes. Not quite a post-modernist reimagining of the genre, the season could stand as a respectable slasher story in its own right, and in this sense, the tone is absolutely pitch-perfect. Take the opening credits. Whereas previous AHS sequences are usually unnerving, the opening to 1984 is a thing of tacky '80s beauty - shot on VHS in 1.33:1 (the recording even has some visible tracking lines from time to time), the pastel-infused credits are made up of shots of aerobics, tape decks, gaudy fashion, dodgy '80s video graphics, VCRs, Ronald Reagan, and roller skates. Meanwhile, the unsettling AHS theme music is here reproduced on a synth. It's horrible, cheesy, about as unthreatening as you can imagine, and awesome.<br/><br/>The show goes on to hit classic genre markers such the campfire scene used to provide heavy exposition, the clich\u00e9d chase scene where the girl being pursued keeps tripping and falling over, the characters continually splitting up for various (dubious) reasons, and the plethora of pseudo-POV shots from behind trees.<br/><br/>Having said all that, however, there are certainly elements of postmodern-esque deconstruction at play; the girl with the huge breasts becomes the guy with the huge penis, the black characters survive beyond the opening act, the quintessential shower scene upon which someone is spying involves not women but men, and there's a fascinating pseudo-meta defamiliarisation of the clich\u00e9d notion that despite being flesh and blood humans, serial killers in slasher films are notoriously difficult to kill.<br/><br/>A vital element of any season of AHS is humour, and so too 1984. Usually, the best laughs come from the earnestness of the characters, who are blissfully unaware of how ridiculous they sound. So, when Brooke meets Xavier, he tells her, dead-pan, \"I trained with Stella Adler. I'm method\". Later on, he discusses the dangers of being in a coma by referencing the song, \"Coma Chameleon\". After one of the characters is badly burned, an argument breaks out and when someone tells this character to breathe, they proclaim, \"I have breathed the fire of a thousand white-hot suns\". Discussing Billy Idol, a character points out to Ramirez, \"You can't sing \"Rebel Yell\" and not be a rebel\", a point he concedes as pretty reasonable.<br/><br/>Thematically, despite its campiness, 1984 does actually have some things to say. The most obvious issue is media commodification of serial killers. Whether it be by making a movie or putting their face on a magazine, serial killers and mass murderers sell, and there's something inherently wrong about that; why do we give serial killers cool nicknames and then endlessly engage with them in every way imaginable, thus giving them exactly what so many of them want - infamy. And, of course, it wouldn't be AHS without looking at gender issues. Here we see a critique of the notion that female victims of male serial killers are celebrated as \"feminist heroes\", as if they'd rather be an icon than be alive. There's also a nicely written reformulation of the serial killer trope whereby women are not believed as they fight male monsters.<br/><br/>In terms of problems, on the one hand, there is too much time spent on explaining things the audience already knows and hitting character beats we've already hit. On the other, there is a disorienting and not entirely successful time jump between the second to last and last episode, and it feels almost like there was an episode skipped between the two, especially insofar as the finale ill-advisedly introduces an entirely new character (this sense of truncation isn't helped that the season is only nine episodes - AHS's shortest yet). Some viewers will also undoubtedly find the humour too camp and too frequent, undermining the horror element, whilst some will find the plethora of references nothing more than pastiche, intertextuality for its own sake.<br/><br/>All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this season of American Horror Story. It's not the most thrilling or unnerving, but it is the funniest and most self-reflexive. Strong characters, typically tremendous acting, and some genuinely heartfelt moments combine with great costumes, foolish hair, and a soundtrack of so-bad-they're-great songs to produce a season that might mean little to those born post-1989, but to the rest of us is an ode to the achingly familiar.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "19 out of 24 found this helpful.", "date": "22 July 2020"}, {"title": " Classic Ryan Murphy gold", "content": "Initially I was left wondering how - what essentially is a short horror movie - could be made in to a long running TV series, but after a few episodes I started to realise that it's the Ryan Murphy magic that is sustaining this outstanding show.<br/><br/>Much like Nip/Tuck, you have to suspend your belief and see this as purely entertainment.

That the placid, peaceful, tranquil picture of the all-American family we have believed in (and taught to uphold and emulate) by our own parents, has always been a facade for all kinds of dementia and dysfunction? <br/><br/>If this is true, then what Ryan Murphy has done is taken the clich\u00e9s of everything from chief competitor Alan Ball's award-winning American BEAUTY and Stephen King's THE SHINING, put them on steroids and blended them together in his word processor. The result? American HORROR STORY, where the only thing more terrifying than a haunted house laden with secrets that rip people to shreds, are the secrets and lies infesting the lives of one family that threaten to rip THEM to shreds.<br/><br/>When a tragic miscarriage and an even more shattering act of infidelity threaten to tear apart their tenuous marriage, Ben Harmon (THE PRACTICE'S Dylan McDermott) and his wife Vivien (FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS' Connie Britton) take their teenage daughter, Violet (Taissa Farmiga) and move away from their \"house of horrors\" to find a new start somewhere...ANYWHERE that they can put the noxious past behind them and at least try to have a go at tending to their gaping emotional wounds.<br/><br/>The place they choose - or maybe that chooses THEM - a run-down manse on the outskirts of L.A., turns out to be a real bargain, and though irredeemably creepy, does have an antiquated charm...if you're into murals that would give even Hieronymous Bosch nightmares.<br/><br/>In no short order, unsettling and strange characters - as much as the house itself is - begin to materialize and insinuate themselves into the Harmons' lives, whether they want them to or not: next-door neighbor Constance (Jessica Lange in a brilliant turn), whose demeanor suggests a deadly combo of Blanche DuBois, Norma Desmond and Gale Sondergaard's Black Widow; Frances Conroy (Ruth Fisher from SIX FEET UNDER) as the mysterious housekeeper, Moira, who appears to the rest of the family as one persona, while tempting Ben's weakness for \"a taste of strange\" with another more lascivious presence, (played by Alexandra Breckenridge); Larry Harvey (TRUE BLOOD alum Denis O'Hare), a horribly burned man who seems to be stalking Ben, and who has his own deadly history with the house and what lives there, and Constance's daughter, Adelaide, (Jamie Brewer), with Downs' Syndrome, yet who seems to have it more together - and knows more about the house - than anyone else around her.<br/><br/>Even Ben's practice as a psychologist is fraught with peril, with the introduction of a teen patient named Tate Langdon (Evan Peters), who has an easier time picking apart and savaging the weaknesses in Ben's emotional armor than Ben does in probing his inscrutable and infuriating new charge's troubled mind.

More importantly, they have abilities that are not ghost-like (if you don't understand what I'm trying to state here, watch The Shining please). They can materialize anytime and anywhere inside the house, have therapy and a prescription for Prozac, have sex with each other and with the living thus conceiving a child, hurt the living with weapons like guns and fire pokers, stealing newborn babies, eat a sandwich and drink coffee, fall in love.....This premise is completely illogical since most of them died violently, often by the hands of another ghost, and are now stuck in this house forever.

This in conjunction with losing a lot, and I mean quite a lot of the \"horror\" factor and producing less of a cohesive and evolving \"story\" they created two instalments of an American Horror Story... where only the \"American\" part was more or less true.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Coven and Freak Show were bad \"mini-series\", they were both watchable, the former more so than the latter but they were not well produced, despite the potential.<br/><br/>(UPDATE) <br/><br/>Season 5 \u2013 Hotel is \"Substandard\" with 5/10 <br/><br/>Unfornatunely, the latest instalment of the AHS, Hotel, did not reclaim the past seasons' former standards, worse still, this season, was even poorer than its previous predecessor, as I personally feel, hence the overall rating from me for AHS will now go to 7/10 as just \"okay\". While the general \"film\" aspects such as the filming, audio, editing, production, style etc. remained fine \u2013 not the best but certainly not the worst, the rest that comes with making a series seriously lacked almost everything.<br/><br/>The story, which ironically the series boasts in its very title, lacked tremendously; once again it felt incoherent, inconsistent, insipid and this time had even more plot-holes than even a patient viewer, such as myself, can allow to pass.

I want to start off with the Pilot. When I first saw it, I had a lot of problems with it. It was messy, and some of the characters were dumb, and some of the acting was corny. However, after the Pilot ended, I realized just how intrigued I was by it. It sure was a messy Pilot, but that's the beauty of it. It was always moving, it wasn't your typical slow-paced suspense show. <br/><br/>In fact, that pretty much sums up the whole season. This is a crackling, fast-paced and entertaining horror series. I would never call this high- art, but that's what makes it great. The show doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it always remains fun, even when it's silly, and yet you get really invested in the story lines and characters. Sure, the performances are flawed at times, and the writing and directing awkward, but the fast pace in every episode doesn't ever let the viewer gasp for air. This is the true definition of a thrill ride. It also feels very experimental. It executes a lot of things in very unordinary ways, in ways that no other TV show does. It doesn't always succeed, but even when it doesn't, you can appreciate it. <br/><br/>Your friends might call The Walking Dead the better horror show, but I disagree. As far as Pilots go, no matter how entertaining or thrilling American Horror Story's Pilot was, the Pilot for The Walking Dead was better, masterful in every way. Since then, it's merely a good, sometimes great, TV show. It takes itself more seriously and is slower-paced, but it's problem is that a lot of times the writing just feels stale, recycled. You are intrigued by it, but it sometimes feels weaker than it should be. And the fact that it takes itself too seriously sort of dampens the fun one should be having with it, simply because its writing isn't strong enough to stretch out its story lines (like the two best TV shows on air, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, do). American Horror Story is better for these reasons- each episode by itself is exciting, it's always moving, and instead of trying to slow things down and makes its flaws more apparent, it even overdoes things on purpose. Messy, sure, silly, sometimes, but overall more intriguing, funner, and more exciting. I cannot wait for the second season of this, since I thought the resolution to the story of the first season was excellent, as well as the final shot. <br/><br/>P.S. Oh, I also want to add another note to take. The performances do hit their great marks, but the only truly incredible performance is Jessica Lange. Her character and performance makes all other supporting turns in television look stale by comparison, and all of her scenes are truly gold! She needs to win that Emmy next year!

So far, the only thing the series and the film do have in common is the title and the (fake) premise that both are - allegedly - based on true events that happened somewhere in Minnesota.<br/><br/>The writers (and the actors!) do a great job in creating new characters that are as strange and somewhat over the top as most of the iconic Coen creations we've come to love over the years - and Billy Bob Thornton's 'Lorne Malvo' (from season 01) has the potential to reach cult status. Watching bad situations get worse as bad decisions lead to even worse ones and the lives of ordinary people spiral violently out of control is - I shamefully admit - a lot of fun to watch, and it's told here with such a wicked sense of humor that I've so far enjoyed every minute of it. <br/><br/>The cast so far has been outstanding (this is an anthology series, so each new season will have its own cast and a new storyline) and the production values - especially the cinematography - are fantastic. Now whether 'Fargo' will appeal to a larger audience despite its quirky characters and non-mainstream look the way a show like 'Breaking Bad' did remains to be seen, but I would strongly recommend this to anyone who enjoys black comedies in general as well as pretty much anything the Coens ever did.

I went on a search for such exciting crime dramas and then I saw few people on reddit talk about Narcos and Fargo (most of them) to experience something similar. At first, I googled them and decided to watch Narcos as Google knowledge graph mentions Fargo as a comedy series. So, yeah Narcos was enthralling, but didn't really feel 10/10 especially with too much Spanish. Then I decided to give a try on Fargo and boy oh boy! It's simply sensational.<br/><br/>Season 1: The first episode itself left me exuberant. This Martin Freeman guy, right from the day I saw him as Bilbao Baggins, everything he does impresses me and in Fargo there's nothing less. And the others were excellent too, especially Billy Bob Throtton, that man is really one hell of an actor. He is an assassin, every scene of him is jaw dropping with some chills.

It opened off very well and the first episode here too ends dramatically. The next 2 episodes were slow-paced and I thought this might turn out like True Detective Season 2 as it couldn't really recreate the magic of the first season (just my opinion). So, right when I thought it's sinking, it just gets better and better from episode 4. There won't be a moment you could take your eyes off till the last minute of the season finale.

That a story with such beautiful potential is undermined by this storytelling irresponsibility just makes me mad.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT, STOP HERE! SPOILER ALERT, STOP HERE!SPOILER ALERT, STOP HERE!SPOILER ALERT, STOP HERE!SPOILER ALERT, STOP HERE!SPOILER ALERT, STOP HERE!SPOILER ALERT, STOP HERE!\nDon't get me wrong... It is intriguing and compelling that it is Phoebe's presence in the basement that fateful night which makes Cora so need to repress her memory of what happened. But it falls completely apart when we discover Phoebe is the one buried. That just can't be. <br/><br/>After all, we are told early on by Cora and Phoebe's mother that Phoebe died when Cora departed inexplicably and that Phoebe died because Cora left. But in episode 8 when Cora asks her mom why she didn't call the police when they didn't come home that eventful night, mom says she thought they went ahead and ran away to Florida! Huh? Cora has been repressing the unbearable memory of that night for five years, during which time she gets married, has a child, and reestablishes contact with her mom. Cora, who was utterly devoted to her sick sister, never wondered all that time what happened to Phoebe? Mrs. Lacey, the mother, for whom Phoebe was the worshipped favorite and Cora the black sheep, never wondered? Phoebe can't have just disappeared without Cora or her mother frantically wondering, and therefore the audience finding out that she didn't die, she vanished without a trace. This is sloppy and simply does not work. This is the difference between good story and bad.

It returns to the origin of the medium of moving pictures, storytelling. Beautiful, delicate, morally challenging and consistently human stories. <br/><br/>Technically the show is artful and precise, with a seemingly authentic, almost anthropological portrayal of a society that is generally inaccessible. Drama seems to arise slowly, patiently, through competent composition of scenes, performances that posses each character flawlessly, and again, stories that speak to the heart of who we are and how we relate to each other. Perhaps it takes a society that has not been swept by time as much as most, to demonstrate a few timeless truths that we can all relate to. <br/><br/>We live in the golden age of quality television, no doubt.

I'm not Jewish and have always been a bit scared of orthodox anything. The story is really elemental and could take place at any time. It takes its time to explore the impact of seismic struggles between parents and children and husbands and wives, the kinds of struggles - that can forge your character or wreck your life - that many of us are doomed to go through. But these people more so because God can called on by both sides to bolster their arguments. And there is much love in it, even when the characters are treating each other brutally. There is also playfulness and urbanity and some magic. It takes place in Israel but because the ultraorthodox don't approve of the society they live in ('those evil people' they call the Zionists), you can set aside your personal views about the political situation. The cast is incredibly well chosen for their roles, all very distinctive and lovable, even the bad characters; the acting is very fine; the pace is perfectly judged and the writing never intrudes; the locations are authentic-seeming; and the whole structure has the weight and momentum of myth, more truth than a true story and more treasurable and satisfying than anything else I can think of in any artform over the past decade or so.

Yes I agree there is much social injustice, but we don't need to have this pushed on us every time we want to just watch TV. I live here in LA the home of Hollywood. I am a true So Cal native, so I understand but give me a break. We hear what you are saying but can you do a better job of writing and not make the message and agenda you are pushing so obvious?

I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between \"your\" and \"you're\".<br/><br/>Someone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as \"superheroes\".

Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be \"savants\" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

It's almost impossible to take any Earth-resident Kryptonian by surprise. So get with it.

In fact a great deal of the Villains and plot lines in the show are poorly plagiarized from the 1996 DC animated series the Adventures of Superman. Except remove Superman and insert Supergirl. Now there is a fine line between an adaptation and blatant plagiarism but it says a lot that the writers of this show did not bother to look in to the myriad of sourced material available to them for Supergirl. For a show that expresses itself as a feminist platform slapping Supergirls face over classic Superman plot lines is beyond lazy and insecure.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most original part of the show has to be the adventures of Alex and her lesbian exploits. Imagine Supergirl and Martian Manhunter are off fighting a powerful villain, the suspense and drama is finally kicking in. Now fade to the next scene, Alex and her relationship problems. Alex is a good character. However the writers continue to focus on her homosexuality as the most interesting/important thing about her, to the point its almost comedic.<br/><br/>The universe of Supergirl mirrors real life political agendas and opinions of our real world. The writers dont give their viewers any sort of credit to be able to figure out whats being said before they blurt out \"HEY THIS IS WHAT WERE SAYING\" even though it is painfully obvious. The writing for every DC show begins to tank after the 2nd season its a running joke with in the community of DCU lovers but no one is laughing. Supergirl is no different and its a shame because the lead casts of the show are absolutely brilliant in their roles. In fact not only did the show manage to cast in my opinion the best on screen Superman, they managed to cast the best on screen Clark Kent.<br/><br/>So if you're a dedicated DC fan and want to enjoy the show its simple have the fast forward button handy after season one.

I'm a big time superhero lover. Truth be told, Wonder Woman was my true inspiration when I was younger. I could relate to her and admired her strength and courage. I felt like if she could do anything, so could I. Sure, I was just a kid, but that kind of thing is great for kids.<br/><br/>With that said, I feel like this will bring up a new generation of superhero lovers. Everyone basically keeps saying this show is too tropey. But who started those tropes? The classics, of course. Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman. These were our go-to since comics existed. Supergirl was later created so that girls could have a feminine figure to admire as well.<br/><br/>I feel like so many people are missing the point of this show because they think it's too silly, the writing is too immature, or the plot seems too on-the-nose. But look at it from a new perspective: Can parents see themselves watching this with their children? Arrow shows some rather steamy scenes when that sweet lovin' is going on. What are parents doing? \"No, sorry kids, can't watch this.\" But Kara is cute, dorky, and the Everygirl. She wants her boss to be more understanding, she wants to help people, and she always has an encouraging word to say. The most important thing -- she values her friends. What better lesson to teach your kids in a modern age? And for those who are kids at heart, it's still an enjoyable show. There's a great cast with lots of people we recognize (at least I recognize several). It reminds me of my youth and why I loved superheroes to begin with. She's a *clothed* feminine figure who isn't relying on the size of her chest or butt to show how capable she is. Wasn't that the biggest complaint of all scifi and fantasy? Now, anyone who remembers the classic Disney movie, Hercules, and loved it regardless of what age they are, I feel like that's the movie that best describes this show. I was young enough to appreciate it, and I've even re-watched it out of nostalgia a few times. The more I think of a dorky person who didn't know their own abilities, including that inner heroic capability, the more I see a parallel between that movie and Supergirl 2015. Both wanted to be more. Both wanted to find a purpose in life. Both found it by being a hero and saving others.<br/><br/>For people who missed that 90s happy campy nature, I feel like this show brings it back, but without feeling like an entire \"camping\" trip. Having also seen Arrow, Flash, and Gotham, Supergirl show is worthy of all ages. I just believe people need to give Supergirl a chance. Like any show, it will find that \"groove\" and improve.

Most museums barely stay afloat, this one has a budget/funding that would make several countries gross income seem trite.<br/><br/>The characters: Good lord these are awful people! In real life, practically every one of them would have been fired long ago, and a few would be serving prison sentences. Cronyism and favoritism are key words in this work environment. People are always talking about sex with each other, talking about having sex WITH each other, having sex with each other, flirting with each other, making generally unacceptable overtures with each other, or making horrendous life choices involving sex. I'm pretty sure the FBI and the museum would frown on their top two employees/partners engaging in a sexual relationship with each other. While I know its not a firable offence to have sexual relationships with your co-workers, but when it affects the job...it can be. The couples either engage openly and actively with each other in the workplace, or they distract the entire workplace with their arguments and petty sniping. Bones is with Booth, Bones and Booth cool it after a brain tumor, Bones and Booth are back together. Angela and Hodgins are together, Angela and Hodgins break up, Angela is with her ex-husband, they break up. Angela is with a woman, they break up. Angela and Hodgins get back together. Daisy and Sweets are together, they break up...now they're together....Oh when will this roller coaster of emotions end?! Is this a crime show or Days of our Lives?<br/><br/>The stories: Too much bad, to little good. I won't say there weren't good episodes and good stories, there were more than a few, and that's the sad part, the show really could have been more than it was. But it decided to opt for \"Soap Opera\" rather than good story telling. The one where Booth puts the medal on the young man's grave for trying to save a woman's life. When they were all trapped in the museum, but the ending where the old grandma finds out her lover didn't up and leave her but was murdered trying to arrange a life for them together. The murdered deaf kid trying to do the right thing...all very powerful. Where it went wrong? Take a cue from another good episode where Bones' trauma is used in court \"I don't matter! Only she matters! Only the victims matter!\", if the show had taken that advice, it could have been something remarkable. But instead it turned into: \"Who cares about that murdered 12 year old? I've got a date with a cutie-patootie!\". Another error on the shows part is straight up ripping off CSI and introducing \"Season Arc Villains\". While in theory, this could have worked...it didn't, and I think the failure was in timing. They pulled a Star Trek: DS9 move and would go half a dozen episodes or more without mentioning the killer. In real time that's 6 weeks we're expected to remember there's something that's supposed to be happening. Even with 'previously on', it doesn't really help. Half the time they're motivations were vague, or I completely forgot why they were killing. Gorgonzola (yeah I know it was Gormagon)....Cults? Secret Societies? Illuminati....who knows? The Gravedigger....buries people alive...for reasons? The sniper that killed the assistant...shoots people...for reasons? The guy that had it in for Hodgins...killed people for...reasons. It's rather hard to simultaneously concern yourself with the \"big bad\", and wonder \"Will Angela and Hodgins' baby be born blind?\" \"Will Booth and Bones finally kiss?\" The show really hampered itself with trying to get you to look in too many directions at once. The character stories, as I said; Are bland, boring, and repetitive to the point of madness.<br/><br/>The really far-fetched stuff: Stewie Griffin....Stewie Griffin! Need I say more?! Doing something like that just completely takes me out of the show and I can't take it seriously anymore. Imagine if in Law and Order the murderer was SpongeBob and they seriously just animated him into the episode. Santa Clause is real, the Blair Witch is real, Chicken Man is real. Angela's father....yeah cause that wouldn't make the headlines....\"Celebrity arrested on multiple counts of Kidnapping, Assault, Battery, Violation of Human Rights\". The worst example and where I dropped out of the show: Bones the fugitive. You work for/with the FBI! Even though you were proven innocent and that you were being framed...the simple fact is....you became a fugitive from justice! You don't get to go back to working for/with law enforcement after that...your credibility would be non-existent. \"Why should my client be charged and convicted of fleeing from police when the prosecution's own witness wasn't?\" Also, Caroline the attorney, is not the only prosecutor in the universe...she would not be the one dealing with cases that involve Bones personally...they have a personal relationship and Bones has been her star witness in multiple court hearings. Helping Bones, handling her/father/brother's cases would be a conflict of interest. Are you really going to give 100 percent to tracking down and arresting your very good dear friend? Likewise, Booth, as her partner (and husband) would not be allowed to be her parole/probation officer. A: That's not what FBI agents do! B: Conflict of interest! C: Assaulting a woman would likewise ruin your credibility on the stand (\"Why should my client get five years for assault when the prosecution's own witness only got six months? Maybe it's because she has a friend in the Prosecutor's office?\"). Also, as a world-renowned anthropologist and author...how did her being a fugitive from the law not make national attention? Wouldn't that be the catch-22 of being so ridiculously well known and beloved? Imagine J.K. Rowling being the number one suspect in a murder and going on the lam.<br/><br/>All in all: It could have done much better. There was some good stuff sprinkled about, but it was lost in a sea of Soap Opera storytelling, far-fetched concepts, bland villains, repetitive relationship storylines, and to me was far too much removed from reality to be enjoyable.

There were a few funny dynamics and some of the cases encountered were fairly interesting. However, as time went on I found the show to become increasingly more gimmicky and unrelatable. Each new episode involved the team to investigate a murder that occurred in some new niche that was far too extreme, in my opinion. The people didn't feel like real people, they were all defined by a single trait (artisan businesses, mole people, Amish life). <br/><br/>It all felt fake. Especially the \"lovable\" characters of our investigative team, or \"squints.\" Characters were given specific traits at what was convenient for the writers. Bones will be ultra- competitive, but it will be only noticeable in this episode. Or the death has something to do with something fairly obscure? Don't worry, this character has some background knowledge on this for no reason whatsoever. There just is no consistency in the characters. What made the whole thing worse was the inclusion of the interns in season 3 or 4(?) which only served to be a gimmick. It gives you the depressed one, the cocky one, the country one, the super smart one; extremes that just don't exist in the real world. And each one will have a dark back story for the purpose of drama that will just distance the characters farther and farther from the real world. <br/><br/>After realizing how incredibly ridiculous each character was, I chose to stick it through and just watch this show for what it is; a crime show. Watch the squints as they solve crimes through complex and interesting cases. But then there was an obvious pattern. Unlike most crime shows which shows how a series of events lead to capturing the killer, Bones provides a much simpler solution. Booth and Brennan will investigate and investigate until they find a small detail in the bones (a nick or grooving) that they somehow hadn't noticed until the last ten minutes of the show that miraculously solves the case for them. The first fifty feel pointless because of this.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say, I did not find this show enjoyable and can barely get through an episode anymore without finding it completely ridiculous.

Her speech pattern has become so terse and stiff that's it's hard not to see the character as one dimensional even though the script is telling us she has evolved and faced many changes over the years. It's inexplicable how stiff the mannerisms have become and how mechanical and one note the dialogue has become for her. It doesn't make sense for Brennan to be so stiff with people she has worked with for YEARS. She has gone through many tragedies and triumphs with Angela, Hodgins, Cam, Wendell etc. I can understand her being stern with a \"new\" intern but why would she be so detached and stilted around people she supposedly loves and has worked with for YEARS. She seemed to have MORE of a comfort level with them years ago than she does now! I miss the brilliant Brennan of earlier seasons who was arrogant and socially inept yes, but also SPUNKY and full of life. She had a zest for life and had a zest for Booth. Now she has no zest and has been reduced to mostly nothing but repetitive scenes of mechanical dialogue with interns and sprouting off meaningless scientific facts in a detached monotone voice. They throw in a few \"mommy\" scenes here and there and I guess that makes them think that they are making her seem to have more depth. Um...No. Just No. She still has chemistry with Booth (thankfully) but they get little screen time together and virtually no intimate scenes (another problem that's also very unfortunate). I don't understand the writer's difficultly in writing for her especially when they have done such a WONDERFUL job writing for Cam and Angela over the years.

Also, an autopsy shows that the corpse's neck has been wrung, like a chicken's. Bones and Booth trace the corpse to a chicken farm, which is being picketed by hipster protesters chanting, \"Cluck you, cluck you.\" Here they learn that the victim developed his chicken-like face when the farm's chicken stench caused his nasal passages to become deformed. Then, they probably solve the case. I don't know. I couldn't finish watching. I've never made it more than halfway through an episode. Not for lack of trying.<br/><br/>I don't remember exactly, but the chicken episode may be the same one in which the corpse is found by a troop of girl scouts who carefully preserve it and transport it to the FBI lab on their scout bus, with the consent of their scout leader. And let me tell you, the realism left me feeling refreshed.<br/><br/>The above plot description might make it sound like this is an inspired, surreal parody of cop shows, but it isn't. If this was parody, I'd expect the actors to play it completely deadpan. Instead, they're trying to be so cute and precious that we just want to eat them up. <br/><br/>There's Bones -- whose level of social awkwardness is wildly inconsistent, depending on which writer is phoning in the gags -- and Booth, her thoroughly bland boss, and a group of thirteen year old boys disguised as lab technicians. One of these guys is named \"Sweets,\" which alone is enough to push this show from annoying to intolerable.<br/><br/>There's also a slutty girl (Angela, I think her name is?) who has no identifiable function other than letting us know every six minutes that she's been sleeping around. How this advances the plot in any way is beyond me. Maybe it all comes together in the second half of the episodes, when I'm not watching.<br/><br/>The only unique aspect of \"Bones\" is the shockingly grotesque corpses. Now, if the rest of the show was as grotesque -- if these corpses were put into any sort of appropriate context, that is -- it would be one of the darkest, most compelling shows on television.

If there's a Harley and black leathers in the shot -- bad guys killing and doing bad things -- their work is done. Not so with Sons Of Anarchy.<br/><br/>While you will find all of the above elements, they're woven into a much richer fabric that brings each and every character to life in 16 million colors and full resolution, rising above the stereo-typical black-and-white portrayals of VGA-rendered knuckle-dragging villains.<br/><br/>And the casting! Katy Segal is phenomenal as Gemma, the widow of club founder and wife of present club runner, Clay Morrow, played by Ron Pearlman. Gemma's son, Jax, played by Charlie Hunnam, butts heads with his step-father's vision for the club.<br/><br/>But what really sets this biker drama apart is the context. The bikers are all natives of Charming, childhood friends in a small town. They've kept the town free of corporate tentacles and development, partly so they can run their legal and illegal businesses free of interference (gun-running and porn), and partly because the town itself might as well be a club member. The characters have deep roots to the townspeople who fear but also trust them to a degree, at least in the sense that it's sometimes better to deal with the devil you know and sometimes it's even handy to know the devil. The Sons have 'profitable arrangements' with certain local law enforcement officials, including the Chief of Police played magnificently by Dayton Callie, better known as Deadwood's Charlie Utter.<br/><br/>Conflict arises from neighboring clubs, gangs and criminal organizations trying to horn in on the action, and to an Aryan businessman and politician, played by Alan Arkin, who wants to set up shop in Charming and take out the Sons of Anarchy so he can take their place at the top of the criminal heap.<br/><br/>As if this wasn't fodder enough, Ally Walker joined the cast in season two as ball-breaking FBI agent June Stahl, going after the Sons and IRA gun runners who are selling to the Sons. Her quest, made painfully personal, by a meeting-gone-wrong with an imprisoned club member.<br/><br/>The action is gritty, the anti-heroes are plentiful, the characters are full-bodied and the writing is Class-A.

An excellent season with multiple story lines that could have produced more stories to come\u0085but did not. Season 3 was downright dragging and poorly written filled with characters you will never see again in a plot in Ireland that wasted the entire season. However, towards the end the season somewhat redeems itself. By season 4 the show goes back to being great, establishing the main rivalries, cementing its main villain and giving the characters the drive to move to its ultimate finale. Season 5 shows a violent leader in charge heading the SAMCRO gang, it has a slower pace than the rest of the previous seasons, but still good. The focus is on the main relationships and its effects of betrayal. Somehow, this season makes it hard to understand why the show is not getting closer to its end, it felt a bit dragged and somewhat unnecessary. However, it's the quintessential season that establishes the main character as the true VILLAIN! And the addition of new characters was excellently casted. Season 6 is definitely more brutal. It felt dragged and long with episodes over extended, but it it's the season that stages the beginning of the end. Season 6 seems like it could have been mixed with season 5... to create a more superior whole and complete season. One interesting element of the season is that WOMEN are the true power players of the season, GEMA VS TARA VS WENDY. The main thorn in SAMCROS thumb is a female DA, and yes there's also a trans character. Margaret should have been given a stronger role, but it was still good. Season 7 \u0085Probably my least favorite season after season 3. It was dragged and extended and had too many new characters, that we are not really invested in. Too much violence on these un-invested characters that make the action scenes lacking in payoff. By now you want Jax to die, and there's no one left to root for, with the exception of maybe Gema/Juice. The final episodes were powerful, tying up the main characters journeys (the ones who made it to the end) in dramatic and emotional fashion. There is something very deep and memorable about how thing tie up in the end for everyone. <br/><br/>Its closing shot is poetic, metaphoric and downright beautiful. It ends as all strong shows with a strong lead do (Sopranos, Breaking Bad) with a tragic ending worthy of discussion. Ultimately what the story is, is about a man being controlled by the two main women in his life, by his need to bring the club back to the \"good old days\" as it being led down a destructive path of violence, law enforcement corruption, drugs, prostitution, revenge and lies. Its about a mans identity and his self fulfilling prophecy to play out his fathers vision as stated in the manifesto that drives the story. Its about loyalty, power, control and fate.

The plot is moved by a chain of quests and little else. I need to exit the dungeon, but I need a key. The wizard has the key, but to get it, I need the unicorn. To get the unicorn, I need to get the princess. To get the princess, I need to get the rose. To get the rose, I need to get the painting. ...and so on, ad nauseam...<br/><br/>Once you pick up on that dynamic within this show, it becomes sort of laughable. Every time they encounter and interact with any external person or entity, they are left with a quest. Seriously. They could approach the local grocer to pick up a gallon of milk and, somehow, leave with no milk until a task to set up the grocer's son with a prom date is completed.<br/><br/>This method is not unique to this show, so it is not a deal-breaker.<br/><br/>2) \"If it wasn't for bad luck...\"<br/><br/>Jack Bauer is the only dude I know that has more problems in a given day than Jax Teller and his pals. I understand why Bauer's day is so unfairly loaded with horrible circumstances - that's the premise of the show 24. With SoA, however, the sheer number of horrible events in a short period of time is, frankly, exhausting. It feels unnecessarily compressed. They finish up their Irish adventure, return home, immediately deal with the Kim Bauer, er (sorry!), Tara kidnapping situation and, whew, relax for 10 minutes. Enjoy it, cuz, tomorrow, you're all going to jail! Real humans saddled with such an utter concentration of tragedy would have an uncommon tendency to find out what the business end of a pistol tastes like. Just sayin'.<br/><br/>I think the show's creators recognize this which is why they, very occasionally, show moments of levity or even (*gasp*) normality.<br/><br/>3) \"Imperial Stormtroopers meets the A-Team\"<br/><br/>This SAMCRO gang can do *nothing* right. Nothing. Even routine criminal activities reliably end in failure. They are the Gang That Can't Shoot Straight, yet almost always emerge unscathed. Handing off some scripts/drugs to a black market doctor? By all means, do it outside, in full view of the neo-Nazi guy! All the \"bad guys\" going to a rally? Simultaneously have your club show up with automatic weapons *AND* arrange for the cops to be at the scene! It is confounding. There is very little reason for me to believe this numbskull SAMCRO outfit would remain in business for more than a few weeks. I don't know who would pay them for \"protection\" or risk getting pinched buying guns or drugs from them.<br/><br/>4) \"Beefcake! BEEFCAAAAAAAAAAAKE!\"<br/><br/>I get it. Jax is \"hot\". My wife tells me so. Given we're watching the DVD release and there are no commercials, I actually appreciate the occasional Jax-shirtless-Diet-Pepsi-commercial thing - my cue to hit the kitchen. (Jax's accent - especially when he has to act alongside dudes with any accent native to the U.K. - drifts in and out, which is a riot.)<br/><br/>We dudes are hosed, though. To paraphrase Cleavon Little's character from Blazing Saddles, \"Where all the women at?\" We got a fairly worn out Peg Bundy, a tramp-stamped doctor with more baggage than sense, prostitutes and porn stars, and psychotic lesbian federal agents. How about throwing us a hot chick with a head on her shoulders and, just for good measure, make her immune (if not hostile) to Jax's, um, \"charms\".<br/><br/>I'll keep watching in spite of my sneaking suspicion that I have been Jerry MacGuire'd (tricked into watching a chick flick). The writing is pretty nimble - they haven't painted themselves into a corner quite yet. They have a sense of humor about themselves - I particularly enjoyed Jax telling the Porn Lady that he wasn't there to \"Adriana her\" (a reference to Jax's ex-wife's character on The Sopranos) and Gemma saying she'd rather go bald than red-head (Al Bundy is predictably indifferent on the subject). There are some fine moments with nice payoffs - even if you see them coming in advance to some degree.<br/><br/>So, it's a video game in TV-show form and it will make your wife hot for scumbags. It is simply *loaded* with supporting characters from all over the entertainment spectrum (You will spend a fair amount of time wondering exactly from where you know Characters X and Y...and who knew there was a *low rent* version of Eric Roberts out there?). You know, you just haven't lived until you've seen Gerry Bertier empty a MAC-10 into the back of a chick's head. Strong side, left side, indeed.<br/><br/>By all means, enjoy this show. I know I am.

If you plan on diving into this show expecting the universe in which this story takes place to even remotely resemble our own, you too will feel this frustration. I am actually thoroughly appalled to see such high praise for this show, and it troubles me to think that this might somehow be The Best Thing On Television Right Now. <br/><br/>The show centers on the follies of a gun running motorcycle gang in a fictional California town, ostensibly ran by a young blonde man named Jax who appears as though he was ripped, pixel for pixel, right out of an Abercrombie and Finch magazine ad. His mother, stepfather, and girlfriend get much focus as well, and a handful of other gang members get minor attention in an attempt to give the ensemble a little substance. However, each and every one of these characters are completely unlikable. They're nasty, manipulative, murderous, sexist criminals. This group of alcoholic racists (the non-allowance of blacks in the group actually becomes a plot-line) runs guns (and later, drugs) and seems to pull in huge profits in the process, and yet still live relatively meager lives in modest homes. There is never an explanation as to where these funds go, and there is only a half-attempt to explain why the gang even carries out this type of shady business in the first place.<br/><br/>Now, stories centering on anti-heroes CAN be enjoyable. Nabokov's Lolita, American Psycho, Dexter come to mind. However, this show feels as though it actually endorses the actions of our biker friends, and I felt as though I, as the viewer, was expected to give myself a high-five every time the Sons of Anarchy (the name of the gang) killed an innocent bystander or screwed someone over. The main pull for this show is simply watching to see if these thugs ever actually get what's coming to them. (Spoiler Alert: they don't. Not in the first five seasons, anyway). This brings me to my main peeve: the characters outside the inner circle.<br/><br/>Rest assured, any character in this show that is not a member or affiliate of the Sons of Anarchy is going to be a cartoonish, one- dimensional, unintelligent tool that always seems to be just one step behind our lovely Sons. Authority figure, public official, rival gang member, it doesn't matter. For example (spoiler here), one character sets a scenario in motion in which Jax's best friend is beaten to death right in front of him. Then, this same character instructs Jax to turn over ANOTHER member of his gang to be murdered, and then leaves himself completely open for a strike from Jax as he carries out the task of killing the second member. This character is supposed to be a super- intelligent, insanely powerful person in the story, and watching him and other characters do insanely stupid things that allow Jax and crew to constantly get the scoop on them is absolutely cringe-worthy. Furthermore, none of the gang members, save for one named Opie, ever have to experience the consequences of their lifestyle.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, I don't mind rooting for the bad guys from time to time, but this show makes it impossible. The characters are invincible, and therefore completely unrelatable. The story lines are easily predictable (hint: Sons always win. Always). The acting is pretty good, particularly from Katey Sagal, but it's hard to revive the believability of such poorly written characters. Watch Mad Men or Breaking Bad if you actually want a story in which the characters are human beings. Watch this if you like motorcycles and brawls and gunfights, because that's about as deep as this show is willing to go.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "152 out of 272 found this helpful.", "date": "16 December 2012"}, {"title": " Cartoonish, not Dramatic", "content": "This show has officially jumped the shark...The club members are near bullet/bomb/fist proof and even when held at gunpoint, manage to get the jump on their attacker with skill that would make James Bond look like Forrest Gump.

And without those stories we would have not had a TV show. <br/><br/>The show has a great combination of funny and heartfelt moments going on that I've only seen matched with Friends and Scrubs. There were some episodes along the way in season 7-9 that were forgettable but a lot of shows get like that when they're on past their prime. Now that I know the full story and that Ted ends up with Robin, I want to watch the entire series over. To me it makes perfect sense to end the show the way they did, because Robin was a main character to the story and not necessarily so with Tracy. It was clear through most of the series that Robin was the one that got away from Ted and the one that had the biggest impact on him. Robin helped make Ted into the man that the kids saw and helped shape him into the man that would fall in love with their mother. <br/><br/>Barney's story was also very interesting. A lot of people felt that the writers undid all of his development in one show. The thing I like about what they did, was that it felt real. Barney's character was complex. He had been let down throughout his life and had his own very deep seeded psychological problems. Those were not necessarily gone by the time he married Robin. I think they were still within him, hence the jokes that he was still able to make about other women's boobs and so on. The thing Barney gained from his relationship with Robin was that she helped him love someone. She helped him see that he was capable of doing so. Little by little, Nora, then Quinn, then Robin helped Barney see that he was capable of more. I think Barney was heartbroken by his marriage with Robin. He felt that it was going to be a certain way. He was as excited if not more excited than her to be married to each other. Hence his nervousness leading up to the wedding and how perfect he wanted it to be. I just think that he couldn't handle what their relationship was becoming kind of like the first go around. He loved her too much to lie to her. But he learned how to love and become a bit more stable. His 31 day spree after his divorce was more about him going to a dark place than it was about him wanting to be that guy. The other thing is that Robin never would have been able to give Barney a child. His daughter was the love of his life and I found that sweet. She changed him forever. <br/><br/>Going back to Ted and Robin. What people might forget is that present Ted is telling the story and not past Ted. People felt like he wasn't genuine in his love for the mother Tracy. I think he loved her with every ounce of his heart. Present Ted was 6 years removed from his wife's death. He wanted to tell his kids the story of how he met the most incredible woman of his life. The only problem was that there was more than one woman that had that effect on him. He just didn't realize the effect Robin still had on him and how important she was to him. His kids helped him realize that. He wasn't the only person in the story who loved multiple people. Robin fell in love with two different men and Tracy had fallen in love with Max before Ted. The show was very real in that sense. <br/><br/>So to sum it up, the mother was a Macguffin but a very beautiful one and one that helped the story have a direction. The last scene b/w the mother and Ted where they finally met was beautifully written and acted. And the final scene to me has not stopped running through my head. The music hit, and Robin brought out the romantic side of Ted again. No words needed to be spoken there and I'm happy for that. We all knew and in the end I was happy b/c these fantastic characters that I've come to love were all in a better place.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "109 out of 132 found this helpful.", "date": "1 April 2014"}, {"title": " Thanks for everything Ted, Marshall, Lily, Barney, Robin, and HIMYM Team", "content": "Greetings,<br/><br/>I know it's weird, but I have to confess it. Maybe I'm not the first guy who confess his thoughts about HIMYM.<br/><br/>First of all, I want to thank for everything it's taught me. First time I watched How I Met Your Mother TV Show, some thoughts are started to appear in my mind. It's very strange to tell, I don't really know how to start or how to describe it. It's like panic attack, you can't describe it too, you know. But these thoughts are good. I started watching in 2005. As you know start day is September 19, 2005. If I remember true, I started on October. Anyway, I have no idea what will happen in this show in the future. I have never expecting to watch it for the last episode. This show is different then others, it's teaching many things to it's followers; friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity et cetera and et cetera.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth, I did not establish a deep friendship until now. I tried too much, but why is it not work, really I don't know. I don't know. Ted, Barney, Marshall, Robin and Lily taught me too much things about friendship, love, kindness, sacrifice, generosity. I learned more. Until now, I learned that there are too many things that I must learn. You look like you have too much free time in my country. But in the end, there is a free time they seen but you have not, and they are steal your free time for nothing... Instead of this, I can travel to more country, and learn more. I can work more, more and more for me and my family, friends... It's started eat my mind.<br/><br/>Anyway, as I said, I have watched How I Met Your Mother too many times. And this show, these cast and the team, who are stayed background, taught me too many things. I'm still continuing to watch this show on TV. Even I realized that, I have to own bundle box of this show. I found a site, and I will buy this bundle.<br/><br/>Maybe you said, \"I don't understand why you are yelling?\" Believe me, there are some things that can hurt. HIMYM helped recognize myself. I believe that, all of these main cast is reflects an idea. Ted is ambitious for his dreams. If you believe, you can do anything. Barney is looks like lecher, but he is not. Just like Ted, he is looking for a door to happiness. Lily. Ah she is adorable and interesting person (but she is very professional to hide her thoughts). Robin is unperturbed, but she is very professional just like Lily. She is hiding her good feelings during some situations. Marshall is childish, and this is a virtue too.<br/><br/>As you see, I discovered these emotions in these characters. All of them was a very good lesson for me; Always be an ambitious, and release your emotions while reaching to these dreams. But at the same time, be lecher for your dreams. Do interesting things and do not listen/see what people talking about yourself about these situations. And of course, don't forget to do some childish things. This will make you happy.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.

I laughed continuously when everyone kept on dismissing his ideal of them all wearing suits. Its great that Doogie finally comes back to television in a great new series. Their are other great characters i feel give great comedy to the show such as the couple Lily (Alyson Hannigan) and Marshall (Jason Segal) who make a great team.

After all, I was only watching in the first place because it aired before my favorite show of all time, \"Supernatural.\" I'd seen (and read) the \"Twilight\" series and found the teen vampire romance story lackluster and redundant. It's been done before about a thousand times, right? But I remember reading the original \"The Vampire Diaries\" books by L.J. Smith and decided it couldn't hurt to give this supernatural soap a try.<br/><br/>The most important thing to know about this show is the first four episodes are seemingly pointless; focused on cheap thrills, romance, and teen drama. Then something magical happens, creeping up silently and latching on without the viewer's notice: interest. By the end of the fourth episode the many story lines pick up and take off, and suddenly a silly or meaningless event becomes important. Things move fast in \"The Vampire Diaries.\" This is a show that takes risks: people die without warning, stories that you thought could go on forever take only a few episodes, characters do and experience things you wouldn't have thought possible. Even better, there is no character who is wholly unlikeable. Everyone in the large ensemble cast has a story and a 3-dimensional structure, and even if the viewer decidedly doesn't like a character, the swing from one storyline to the next never lingers in one place for too long.<br/><br/>Some people have called this show their guilty pleasure. I refer to it as smart writing, good acting, excellent storytelling, and wonderful viewing. As of right now the second season is in the first few episodes of airing and the magic has not gone out. Far from it; this show only gets better. The lesser episodes are still fantastic, and the truly great ones are rich with everything an episode of television could possibly desire. I have yet to finish watching an episode without cursing the screen to give me more - my addiction to such a fresh show sometimes keeps me up at night.<br/><br/>For anyone (yes, even non 18-49 women demographic - we welcome the men!) interested in watching vampires, witches, and more, take the time to view beyond the first four episodes.

Nina is, maybe, one of the best actors one could watch, because of her portrayal of completely different characters which is really impressive.<br/><br/>A scene that will remain in my mind FOREVER is the season 3 three finale,when Elena is under that bridge with Matt.

The juxtaposition of Elena's accident with Matt and her accident with her parents was symbolical, tear-breaking, jaw-dropping and it really makes you think of all she had to go through, how this will affect the whole series and create one of the best cliffhangers I have ever seen in any series that I have ever watched in my whole life. This is one of Nina's best performances EVER. <br/><br/>The Vampire Diaries has talked about importance of family, friends, life, love, and coming to terms with who we are.

It has been update to fit with the times a bit more.<br/><br/>It appears that they are loosely following the story, and that is fine if they are making it into a series. To follow the books, they would have just needed to make a mini-series and been done with it. For a full-on TV series they needed to make many adjustments. I'm a little sad that they are aiming so very hard for the Twilight crowd by throwing the romance factor in right away, but it has the potential to be pretty good.<br/><br/>The acting isn't the greatest, but I have definitely seen much worse. This felt to me like actors that had not yet fit themselves into their characters. It will smooth out with time and become more comfortable for them and it will show through in the series. They have managed to obtain a bit of balance between the almost care-free world of high school and the dark gritty nature of what they can't see and don't know about.

In fact, the first season is a very simplistic, clich\u00e9 and tasteless novel by a young human and a vampire, tempered by the appearance of his evil brother. But things are gradually getting better and the hooks for the second season were so promising that I continued to see. It was then that the series showed that it had potential, and it only improved, season after season.<br/><br/>Eight seasons later, I saw the end yesterday. It's a long story, as it couldn't be. The skeleton of the plot is based on Elena's melodramatic and sugary romance with two vampire brothers, Stefan and Damon (one after the other). In between are immense characters, whose individual stories intertwine. The plot, slightly based on books, is sometimes imaginative and there are a number of unreliable elements such as the siphon witches, strange amulets and deconstructed religious elements (see the example of Cade, or Devil, and the question of life after the death). But as a good part of the final product is based on the charisma and strength of the characters, this ends up being reasonably well swallowed by the audience.<br/><br/>The series is full of strong and dramatic characters, made by actors who have shown talent Nina Dobrev was very good as Elena / Katherine and her disappearance, from the seventh season, was one of the most unfortunate options in the script. Much better was the direction of the brothers, played by Ian Somerhalder and Paul Wesley. The two actors were incredible and were up to the challenge. In addition, the following actors deserve to be congratulated: Kat Graham, Candice King, Michael Trevino, Matthew Davis, Michael Malarkey Joseph Morgan, Marguerite MacIntyre, Claire Holt, Daniel Gillies, Chris Wood, Elizabeth Blackmore, Torrey DeVitto and Arielle Kebbel. Everyone was committed to their characters, regardless of their importance to the plot, and gave their best. Zach Roerig is a good actor, but his character is not so good and it was only last season that I was able to feel some empathy for him. Steven R. McQueen suffered from the same problem. He was a rebellious and somewhat boring teenager in most of the series, and he suddenly appears full of muscles as an action figure, eager to kill vampires. Sara Canning and Susan Walters are also good, but their respective characters also only become pleasant around the time they must die.<br/><br/>At a technical level, the series has few flaws.

Season 1 is one of the best seasons ever. Ranking my Top 10 seasons, Season 1 of Westworld makes the cut. The first season featured brilliant acting from the likes of Sir Anthony Hopkins (as park founder Dr. Robert Ford), Evan Rachel Wood (as original park host Dolores Abernathy), Jeffrey Wright (as park behavorial expert Bernard Lowe), Sidse Babett Knudsen (as company exec Theresa), James Marsden (as host Teddy), Shannon Woodard (as park programmer Elsie) Jimmy Simpson (as park guest William), Angela Sarafyan (as host Clementine), Thandie Newton (as host Maeve), and Ed Harris (as the mysterious park guest The Man in Black). There were also entertaining minor characters like Lawrence, Armistice, Hector, and Logan.<br/><br/>Of course, it wasn't without flaws. There were a couple of poorly realized characters like Lee Sizemore and Charlotte Hale (more on her later), and in retrospect, the Maeve character was always the worst thing about this show, which started with that dumb subplot of the two butchers Felix and Sylvester (also really bad characters in retrospect) who gave her god powers. But a few mere blemishes on an otherwise spotless season. But the real problem was the writers didn't see one. In particular, Maeve was so popular after the first season that starting in Season 2, the writers devoted a huge chunk of screen time to a very wasteful and filler side story of Maeve dragging her lackeys along with her to the dull Shogunworld, which at the time, was easily the worst episode of the show (Season 3 changed this, more on this later).<br/><br/>THEN Season 2 happened! What started out as an engrossing, well-written, acted, and plotted ensemble multi-genre (sci-fi, Western, action) tale with deep philosophical themes turned into some weird feminist fantasy star vehicle for Dolores and Maeve. Dolores went from arguably the best character of the show to arguably it's worst because Wood forgot how to act! The sweet, inquisitive, philosophical Dolores became a 1-dimensional terminator. Maeve got more and more stupid powers, filler side quests and obnoxious \"dahling\" dialogue. Newton's \"acting\" consists of 2 or 3 facial expressions, with her go to expression being smugness. This character is a slow-acting infection that is a huge reason it went stale. I promise if you took out Maeve's parts of the show the first 2 seasons, not only would Season 1 have been perfect, but Season 2 would have been much better than it turned out.<br/><br/>And what a terrible season that Season 2 turned out to be! Upon realizing that fans figured out all the twists in Season 1, the creators and showrunners Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy opted to make Season 2 even more confusing to the point they forgot to write a good story within all the confusion. Instead, it was mostly a bunch of unnecessary flashbacks, characters talking in meaningless riddles, and a dubious new aspect of the series...action scenes! Trained security and mercenaries were incredibly inept, fighting without proper gear and cover, missing wide open targets, getting themselves killed in the most dumb ways. Personally, I think that Riddle of the Sphinx is the only truly great episode of the second season and belongs in the ranks of Season 1. The rest can go fly a kite as far as I'm concerned, including Kiksuya, which most fans actually believe to be the best of the show, which is fine, but I just didn't care for that episode.<br/><br/>NOW to Season 3. For me, this was the make or break season. Would the show return even close to it's Season 1 form or would it continue the trend of mediocrity established by Season 2? It most definitely went the way of the latter! The first mistake was the addition of Aaron Paul to the cast. I don't care about his Breaking Bad pedigree (a show I never watched, yeah I know blasphemy). This isn't Breaking Bad. Sometimes, an actor just doesn't translate well to another show and Paul most definitely does not here. His character Caleb Nichols has got to the worst, most uninteresting character this show has ever had! The writers ingratiated him in the Season 3 premiere with a mountain of cliche, boring backstory to make us feel for the guy, but it all rung hollow, especially as the season progressed. Caleb was just as dull in the end as he was at the start. In between, he just walked around in an eternal state of confusion following Dolores around like a pet.<br/><br/>While Season 3 started out somewhat promising in the first half, that terrible Genre episode was the start of something bad! Finally, an episode that was actually worse and more filler than Shogunworld. Featuring the dull Caleb, Genre consisted of a slow car chase, pretentious camera filtering, loud music, terrible acting, and a weak ending. It can't get worse than that, right? Wrong, because the last 2 episodes of Season 3 were somehow worse than that! And guess who the focus of those last 2 episodes were? Yes, our new main character Caleb. The writing just went off the rails down the stretch. Season 3 \"featured\" mindless, poorly written action scenes, unnecessarily vague dialogue, pretentious monologues and flashbacks, and some really BAD acting. Surprisingly, I actually thought the best character in Season 3 was Charlotte Hale (essayed by a much improved Tessa Thompson), who was previously terrible the first 2 seasons. Just when the show goes bad, her performance gets good. Too bad no one else lived up to her character in the third season.<br/><br/>In addition to Paul, there was a ton of awful acting in Season 3, mostly from minor characters and a few major ones as well. Whether it be a random Delos board member, a security meathead, an assassin goon, etc., it's like the directors this season didn't have any kind of wherewithal to tell these actors how to deliver lines that don't sound like they're in a high school play. The original main characters didn't fare much better. Dolores continued to be annoying and Bernard, Maeve, William, and Stubbs were just there and completely irrelevant to the plot. Serac was a decent character, but he's no Ford, the very mention of whose name reminds of how great this show used to be. This once-masterpiece has devolved into a forgettable Syfy-like series. Speaking of, I can think of a few things I've seen on Syfy the last few years that are probably more re-watchable than Westworld is now! After Season 1 of this series, I thought it put the classic 1973 movie to shame. Now, 3 seasons into this show, I'd recommend to anyone to watch the '73 film (which doesn't take itself too seriously and is just the right mixture of sci-fi, humor, action, and heart) over this increasingly pretentious and poorly done exercise in TV futility.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "168 out of 210 found this helpful.", "date": "7 May 2020"}, {"title": " Good gone Bad", "content": "Having read the original book (script) and seen the original films, I knew that a televised seried would be different, especially giving the time between both, nearly 40 years.\nSeries 1 and 2 I accepted and actually enjoyed.

Within 10 minutes of the first episode, the basic rules of \n the theme park are established: paying guests called \"newcomers\" get to \n interact with androids called \"hosts\" (which to the naked eye are \n indiscernible from the guests) in a world dressed up like the Old West \n - and in this world, the guest truly is king. The rules are brutally \n simple: the visitors get to do whatever they like with - or to - the \n androids. They can have a friendly chat with them, flirt with them or \n embark on a spontaneous (or scripted) adventure with them - but they \n can also shoot them, rape them, torture them and kill them at will. \n Imagine a real-life version of the game 'Grand Theft Auto' (in a \n slightly different setting) and you'll get the idea.<br/><br/>The androids, on the other hand, are constructed and programmed in a \n way that is supposed to inhibit them from physically harming \"living\" \n creatures. At the beginning of the show - thanks to an interesting \n choice of storytelling - we get to experience Westworld from the \n perspective of the androids, which reveals a cruel detail about their \n nature: they apparently experience emotions. Artificial or not, they do \n feel pain and fear - as well as affection and anger, and they have no \n idea that they don't count as \"real\" people (at least not to those who \n call themselves real people). And while that detail certainly makes the \n \"game\" even more thrilling and more realistic for the visitors, it \n means that the shocking abuse some of the androids have to suffer is \n harrowingly real to them.<br/><br/>The way the show is constructed - so far - it immediately confronts the \n viewer with very uncomfortable questions. How do we as humans behave \n towards creatures we consider non-human? How excessive do we become and how thin does our layer of morality turn out to be if we're allowed to \n live out all our fantasies without having to fear any consequences for \n our actions? And at what point should a creature have rights similar to \n those we demand for ourselves? How do we define \"sentient\"? How do we \n define \"human\"? And how well do we actually understand - and how well \n are we able to control - the amazing technology our species seems to \n have acquired so suddenly?<br/><br/>As an avid film fan, I found 'Westworld' immediately intriguing; not \n only because it dares to challenge the viewer with fascinating \n philosophical questions and scientific concepts, but also because its \n premise offers the chance to explore a wide range of film genres: sci- \n fi, western, drama, horror - to name but a few. In the first few \n episodes alone, there are hints of many of my favorite films and \n stories such as (obviously) 'Frankenstein', 'Blade Runner', 'A.I.', 'Ex \n Machina', 'Jurassic Park', 'The Truman Show' and 'Rise of the Planet of \n the Apes' (and I suspect somewhere down the road there will be a strong \n 'Spartacus' vibe). As for the non plot related aspects of the show: \n production design, music and effects are fantastic - as we've come to \n expect from HBO's high concept productions - and, with very few \n exceptions, the impressive ensemble of high caliber actors do a great \n job at bringing their respective characters to life (artificial and \n otherwise).<br/><br/>A special mention needs to go to Ed Harris and Anthony Hopkins: their \n charismatic screen presence is once more just impossible to ignore and \n they simply own every scene they're in. Generally speaking, there \n really isn't much to complain about in 'Westworld' (so far), and I'm \n pretty sure HBO have another winner. Given the amount of talent \n involved, anything else actually would have been surprising. Produced \n by J.J. Abrams, created by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy Nolan based on a \n concept by the late - great - Michael Crichton; directed by Neil \n Marshall and Vincenzo Natali (among others), and with a cast most shows \n would kill for, the stars really seem to have aligned for 'Westworld'.<br/><br/>My overall verdict so far: 'Westworld' is intelligent science fiction \n for adults (some scenes are very graphic) which offers more than just \n eye candy and is full of mysteries for the patient viewer to uncover. \n The show's main themes may not be new, but I found the way they are \n presented never less than compelling. It succeeds in creating a \n powerful metaphor for oppression, and by showing how quickly humans \n tend to deem \"un-humane\" treatment of other beings acceptable - once \n they've managed to convince themselves they're \"less\" human than they \n are - the show drove a point home that resonated strongly with me. 8 \n stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/", "rating": null, "helpful": "691 out of 1,023 found this helpful.", "date": "3 October 2016"}, {"title": " Rating for Season 1 and 2", "content": "Seasons 1 and 2 are both great.

If you watched those other shows I mentioned into the second season and then basically said 'hey, wait a minute, all they've done during this second season is ask questions without giving answers and shown confusing and uninteresting story lines.'

Most of the futuristic hightech stuff is gone, except for a few mercenary-type guys to replace all the wanton murder from season one.

The main story moves along at a much slower pace. Towards the end, the focus on AI development and AI trying to \"free\" itself seems lost almost completly.<br/><br/>If I wouldn't know better, I'd think the producers of this show were so surprised by their own success that they had no real idea of how to continue, and are now just cobbling up random ideas.<br/><br/>Season two is not bad, but its nowhere near as unique or visionary as the first.

But it turns out to be a whole new thing, only loosely connected to the previous show.<br/><br/>True, Young Sheldon does pick up the backstory established for the Sheldon of Big Bang. But the writing takes off in a whole new direction. Gone are the zippy one-liners, the exaggerated characters, the zaniness, What we get instead is something no one could have predicted: heart.<br/><br/>It's a huge mistake to think of Young Sheldon as a prequel to Big Bang. Think of it, instead, as a 21st Century reboot of Leave It to Beaver. This is a slice-of-life story of growing up in Texas. Instead of being set-bound like Big Bang, Young Sheldon is shot largely on locations. Instead of being stylized, it's realistic. Instead of being glib, it's thoughtful. There's plenty of humor, but it's gentler and more complex.<br/><br/>The third episode, for example, deals with a child coming to grip with the possible death of a parent, and with the role of faith in his very logical universe. The script doesn't judge, and it doesn't forget to be, at times, hilariously funny. (The last line had us in stitches.)<br/><br/>The acting is uniformly superb. Sheldon's mom perfectly evokes Laurie Metcalf's older version from Big Bang. Annie Potts playing Sheldon's 'Meemaw' is as brilliant as she's ever been (and that's saying quite a lot.) And then there's Iaian Armitage in the title role. He doesn't mimic the older Sheldon, but he does ring absolutely true as a precocious yet naive kid, totally out of step with his surroundings. After watching him for a half-hour, I no longer cared whether he was supposed to be a younger version of some other character. He's a totally memorable character in his own right.<br/><br/>Chuck Lorre has taken a huge risk, defying audience expectations with Young Sheldon. Let's hope he and Steven Molaro (who've co-written the early episodes) can keep the series going as powerfully as it has begun. And hope also that audiences can shake off their addiction to Big Bang Theory long enough to appreciate something that's as fresh and ground-breaking today as Big Bang was eleven years ago.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "31 out of 62 found this helpful.", "date": "12 November 2017"}, {"title": " Love it!", "content": "Obviously, from reading some reviews here, there are people who wouldn't enjoy life if they won the lottery!

Sheldon's portrayal is wrong. Granted, Iain Armitage is a child actor and I can't expect the same level of acting skills from a child than an adult, but his portrayal of Sheldon is a complete failure. The actor's portrayal of Sheldon is way too wooden, older Sheldon is enthusiastic about everything he says, he prides himself on his knowledge and revels in imparting that knowledge, he's all giddy when he talks about his interests or pursues one of his hobbies etc. Iain Armitage's Sheldon is just a robot. There is no emotion, no conviction behind anything he says or does and that's just not Sheldon.<br/><br/>I'll have to watch more episodes to see where this is going before I can rate it but the pilot episode was a 6 at best, and with more episodes this show could easily turn into a 4.", "rating": null, "helpful": "56 out of 131 found this helpful.", "date": "26 September 2017"}, {"title": " A FEEL GOOD Retro TV sitcom that tells a new and interesting story each week, its much better than most of the other camp comedy TV series", "content": "I love it!

I won't compare The Wire to these shows because they are not really comparable other than the fact they are some of the greatest shows ever, but are completely different. The wire isn't about drug dealing, the police, politics, or the education system, it is about the entire city of Baltimore. I'll admit The Wire isn't for everyone, it may be too violent or complex with the vast amount of characters and side stories for some, but I guarantee if you are a film and TV series lover and appreciate writing, acting, and an abundance of interesting characters, the wire is pretty much perfect in these regards. Each Season changes slightly in which facet of the city it will mainly cover, and becomes more complex as the series progresses. This show has without a doubt some of the most interesting characters, and best writing I have ever seen on a series.

That wasn't the case here.<br/><br/>The show is a cross between the Sopranos and the old NBC show Homicide: Life on the Street. The crime/sopranos side and the law/Homicide side run in parallel. Individually, the parallel plot lines are compelling. In tandem, they are complimentary and brilliant.<br/><br/>There is no way to avoid having \"the best show ever\" tag sound like anything but silly hype--regardless, what makes this show substantially better than any other realistic and compelling crime or police drama is the fact it is... searching. It doesn't just delve into the individual psychologies motivating these people (ala the Sopranos) or the complex interactions amongst the members of a community (ala Deadwood) it asks \"what the hell can be done for all of these people\" and points out the problems with any and all of the answers.<br/><br/>It's truly brilliant.

The Wire's importance, beyond setting the standard for all modern television, is one of a historical document. 500 years from now, the show will surely be one of a handful that allows future generations to glean the state of American society during this time period -- it's problems, it's people, it's language, it's institutions, and the constant tension that exists when all of these are forced to coexist.<br/><br/>This is due to the fact that the Wire, through nuance and true-to- life portrayal of human interactions, constructs an extremely lucid and heart-breaking evaluation of almost every aspect of society. Most of you reading right now wake up every day as a cog in the massive, interwoven, and fundamentally autonomous institutions which together make up a capitalist society. However, given that we are all a minuscule part of this larger whole, it is nary impossible to take a step back and objectively evaluate just how much influence these institutions hold over the course of our lives. It's not unlike trying summarize a 1000-page novel while holding a single random page less than an inch from your face. Our perspectives are inherently limited in this regard, and so too is any vain attempt to connect the pieces and make sense of it all.<br/><br/>This point is one of the many reasons that the Wire warrants our time and careful consideration. From a bird's-eye perspective, each season builds on those prior until at the very end we have no choice but to reckon with vast tapestry of individual strands as a singular work. One that feels so true to life that it's near impossible for me to think of anything else, fiction or non-fiction, book or movie, painting or play, sculpture or architectural feat, which in their combined power holds the volume of educational lessons, thoughtfulness, humanism, pure ethos, or entertainment that the Wire does.<br/><br/>\"All the pieces matter,\" a quote that flashes across the screen at the beginning of an episode in Season One, is prophetic in it's understanding that the totality of something can have a much greater impact than its individual parts. And that is why I find it upsetting when reading reviewers which call the show \"boring\" or \"slowly paced\" or \"overrated\" and then go on to admit that they gave up watching before the end of Season Two. <br/><br/>I am not a cynic by nature and in general tend to dismiss the common criticism that our generation is one that needs constant gratification all of the time in order to stay engaged with something for the long haul. But in this case, I truly believe that the Wire is so much different than what most people are used to watching on the medium of television that some may get confused or frustrated when the show refuses to pander to the standard beats and thrill-inducing plot devices on an episode-by-episode basis which we have been trained to expect with TV shows. There are no neatly wrapped episode arcs, no spoon-feeding over obvious plot points via voice-overs or flashbacks, and no musical score to tell us how a particular scene or moment should make us feel.<br/><br/>Instead, the show forces us to become witnesses to a series of events in much the same way we would witness something unfolding right in front of us. Especially during Season One, David Simon and his creative team give us a lot of footage that looks like it should be from a documentary. This is all intentional, of course. The 4:3 film, the non-HD look, the way the camera seems to lack the traditional god- like power to always know that a character is going to say something important so that it shows us that character a second or two before they say their line (indeed, if you watch closely you'll notice that there are times that the camera will only pan to a speaking character after they begin saying their lines, giving the viewer the distinct feeling of a real-life situation unfolding in real time) -- all of these things are by careful design. And all of these devices add to the show's power because the characters become more real when depicted in this way. This makes it all the more devastating every time one of these characters is chewed up and spit out by the merciless wheels of capitalistic institutions surrounding them. <br/><br/>I chose to write a review which differs from many of the others here because simply rehashing why I love Omar so much, or which season is the best, or why I think it's better/worse than the Sopranos or Breaking Bad are all things which are touched upon over and over again. Instead I wanted to provide my own analysis about why the show succeeds and stands apart of from others to the point where comparison is futile. Some people, including myself, think that the show will provide you with such an empathy-rich experience that when you have finished you may potentially see the world a little bit differently, that you'll feel a little bit closer to all of the people you share this country with, no matter how different their persona or background is from your own.

Let me introduce you The Wire, the best TV show put on small screens. The show that will, after you've finished it, live you empty inside, because you'll never find another TV show that can rival it. With it's five seasons, The Wire raised the bar of quality for TV shows, the bar that no TV show to date has managed to reach. <br/><br/>The Wire's story is set in the city of Baltimore, and it's about the slow fall of Baltimore city, about the pointlessness of the war on drugs, the bureaucracy and corruption that infest both the police force and drug-dealing gangs, class war against the labor unions, and the city's dysfunctional public schools system. And it's all shown through the perspective of law enforcement and drug dealers. As the story goes, you'll encounter well thought out plot twists, and you'll see a lot of characters die, because, as David Simon said: \"We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. The Wire is making an argument about what institutions\u2014bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even\u2014do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I'm afraid, a somewhat angry show.\", and that makes the show so great, because deaths have meanings and consequences, and aren't just there for the shock factor like in Game Of Thrones. It also helps that Simons knows what he's talking about since he was writing a lot for the Baltimore Sun, and he saw a lot of things on the streets that are portrayed in the show. <br/><br/>One of the things I really love about The Wire is that characters aren't all good or all bad. They're gray, when it comes to their morality. Simon challenges the viewer to like characters, a lot of characters will do some bad things, and you'll probably agree on a lot of them given the situation they're in. The writing is just great, The Wire has a web of a lot of characters and the show spins them well. From McNulty to Stringer Bell, there are a lot of complex and great written characters, but there are also some weaker ones, but that's also to be expected, because the show has more than the hundred characters and you can't expect that they'll all be on the same level of writing. There is no plot armor in this show, a lot of characters will die, and, as I've already said, their deaths have consequences, and aren't just meant to be shock factor. <br/><br/>Acting team consists of familiar HBO actors, and of real cops and criminals, and they all did a pretty damn good job. Some are weaker, and that is most notable during season 1 and 5, but weak actor aren't that usual in the show, so don't worry. I'd say the best actor is easily Dominic West as McNulty, who stole the show for me, but since I'm biased towards McNulty, don't take my word for granted. <br/><br/>The only problem I had with the The Wire was one of fifth season's arcs, the one with the newspapers. It felt out of place for me, and it wasn't that interesting. It didn't introduce interesting characters nor was it on par with The Wire's better arcs.<br/><br/>In the end, The Wire did what little to no TV show could hope to do, it succeed with it's extremely ambitious, and I'd say impossible mission to tell a story of Baltimore's crumble. The social commentary, the writing on the characters, the well thought out plot twists, great directory, and David Simon's expertise on the case made The Wire the best television show ever seen on small screens.

But I soon realised that The Wire is more familiar than foreign to me; the emotions it portrays are so beautifully and often devastatingly evoked by the wonderful cast of mostly unknowns that I often find myself relating to and empathising with the police department's moral dilemmas or the actions of the Baltimore drug dealers.<br/><br/>What makes The Wire so special is its unpredictability; unlike most ratings-conscious American TV shows it has no qualms about killing off its protagonists midway through a season, notably Stringer Bell's demise at the end of season three. It never panders to the viewer's shallow desires but instead goes ahead and above all of their expectations, which of course makes for a better show. Conversely, it always allows its viewers to judge moral situations for themselves and is never preachy, thus explaining why my favourite characters on the show, Stringer Bell, Bodie, and Bubbles rack up multiple murders, drug heists and other dubious acts between them. You often find yourself sympathising with, for example, the mass-murderer Wee-Bey over Police Chief Burrell in season one, which exemplifies the shows' genius.<br/><br/>That this show never won a single Emmy or other award is tantamount to a crime in my opinion, when you consider that cookie-cutter, one-murder-solved-per-episode crime shows like CSI rake them in every year. As clich\u00e9d as it sounds, other programmes just don't take you on the emotional journey that the Wire does. I can't think of a single time where I have been moved to tears by another show in the same way that the fate of sweet, enterprising Randy in Season four or the necessary but horrific death of Stringer Bell in the preceding season moved me.<br/><br/>I could write all day about this wonderful show, closer to a novel than a televised programme, but The Wire's makers and producers- and more so the near-perfect cast- say more than I ever could in sixty hours of television.

It starts out by introducing the key players and the central theme. During the five seasons we follow some very realistic characters on both sides of the law, occasionally trailing off to the other side and then back again. It's never been harder to tell who the good guys are.<br/><br/>This show is addictive, but an acquired taste. At first the bleak setting and hyper realistic portraits might put you off, but just watch one full episode and you will find that there is no coming back.

The writing is of course sublime as it relies heavily on real events. The characters are complete and some of them you will remember decades from now.

Suffice to say that the two main characters are two Baltimore city detectives. Jimmy McNulty (played by Dominic West) is a white Irish rebellious detective who will screw anyone to get to the criminal he is chasing. Along the way he hurts a lot of his fellow cops, his bosses and lets down his immediate family time and time again. With all his faults though once he gives you that great Irish grin of his all is forgiven, no matter what the circumstances.<br/><br/>McNulty's partner is Detective William Moreland, better known around the station house and the bars simply as \"Bunk\" who knows McNulty best. Bunk is a heavy set well dressed black cop (played by Wendell Pierce) who likes to chomp on a cigar and drink hard liquor to extremes. Bunk has a lot of life in him, and is considered a cops impression of what a real detective should be. A hard drinking, womanizing, persistent cop who really wants to get the worst criminal elements behind bars serving hard time. <br/><br/>Both Bunk and McNulty have ex-wives and two children but their lives really evolve around the city of Baltimore's urban city corners where drugs are always readily available, and murders are popping up within the walls behind condemned row houses by the dozens. The other two characters who deserve special mention are the drug lords, Avon Barksdale (played by Wood Harris) and Russell \"Stringer\" Bell (played by Idris Elba). Now these two gangsta's grew up on the city streets of Baltimore like many other city hoods but the difference is they had both street smarts and the will to kill anyone who got in their way. Theirs are interesting story lines throughout the series and keep the audience guessing what they will do next. No spoiler alert so I will defer from giving away too much on their path to destruction.<br/><br/>Two characters who you can't help but feel compassion for due to their diverse journeys throughout the series are the drug addicted junk man Reginald \"Bubbles\" Cousins played to perfection by Andre Royo, and the shotgun wielding gay drug thief Omar Little, also played with fearless perfection by Michael Kenneth Williams. Now their lives when involved in any scene are never predictable and you cannot help but root for them to win. Hell, even the cops cut them a lot of slack as they can see that their hearts are big, but their minds are twisted after living on the streets their entire lives.<br/><br/>I could go on and provide details on at least another dozen strong performances by other cops, attorneys, judges, police captains, shipyard workers, and even kids, but I suggest instead that you keep this crime themed television series on your \"must watch\" list and if you ever want to see a series that captivates the drug crime world of a major urban city such as in this Baltimore story you won't be able to stop watching until you watch at least a couple more episodes before you go to bed far too late in to the early morning hours because it is just that good a dramatic crime series.

I didn't watch much movies, but just some random movies aired on HBO (not a whole movie of course, but segments of one). I had no idea how to start and a friend of mine suggested to watch according to IMDb list, and I did so. I then watched highest rated movies post 1990 (I didn't like cinematography of movies before 1990). I spent about 6 months watching movies, and next 6 months re-watching them. I wasn't that dedicated in anything till then. I then had rough ideas what a good movie is like. Next three months I watched movies irrespective of their rating. Then I started watching pre-1990 movies. I used to see long reviews from movie critics, and users (from IMDb and Quora), just to check if my view in a particular movie tallies with their or not. I thus spent a year and half watching and re-watching movies. I think I watched few movies more than 15 times. 'The more re-watchable is the movie is, the best it is', this is my view on movies now, after a year of continuous watching. There isn't a single good movie I have watched just once. After I was satisfied with that, I started watching series.<br/><br/>Then I wasted next 1.5 year watching series. My grades were falling miserably, because I was literally addicted in it. I watched a lot of series (according to IMDb ranking, and popularity of course), and maybe I was biased, Breaking Bad was my favourite one. It was just slightly better than The Sopranos according to my view. have watched every episodes of Breaking Bad and The Sopranos 3 times, the second time to understand missed details and the third time to search for mistake and fact-checking. For fact checking of The Sopranos I watched podcast (or interview, whatever) with Michael Franzese, and found out it was not that factually correct, so BrBa just slightly surpassed The Sopranos. I knowingly ignored some goofy science of BrBa (like blue meth being the purest, mercury fulminate being so crystal clear and being explosive only after throwing, and so on) thinking that they were there just the tools to spice up the plot, which was acceptable to me. I watched GoT, but it wasn't my taste (only thing I love in fantasy genre is 'Lord of the Rings'. Besides the final season took it far from league. 'The Office US', 'It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia', 'Curb your Enthusiasm' and 'Seinfeld' are my personal favourites in sitcoms. I don't mix sitcoms with series because I believe they are two separate things. I love 'True Detective S01', even more than BrBa, but I classified it under mini-series (I couldn't watch True Detective S02 after True Detective S02E01, and same goes for S03). So, by comparison Breaking Bad was my favourite series until I watched 'The Wire'.<br/><br/>I started watching 'The Wire' in this COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. At first I found it quite difficult to catch up with it's content because I had trouble remembering character's name (because there are too many), and it's vast plot. Nonetheless, I never lost my interest watching it. Most people say it's boring, but I didn't feel that way. It's different from other series because other series wrap everything interesting in each episodes, but The Wire wraps things up in each season. I believe the flawless flow of episode was interesting enough to keep me moving on. The acting of each actors and actresses is good. I won't say acting is the best, but it is good enough for their character. The realness and authenticity of the series is it's signature. The writers (David Simon, Ed Burns) are authentic source of the material of the series, one being former Baltimore journalist and other being former Baltimore cop. William Zorzi (Portrayed as William Zorzi in S05), Baltimore City Hall reporter was excellent source for internal politics depiction of show. Snoop Pearson was real life gangster who depict as such in the show. Former Baltimore drug-lord Melvin Williams (portrayed as Deacon) was there to check the portrayal of Avon Barksdale and Stringer Bell (and maybe Marlo Stanfield). Former Baltimore City Police Commissioner Ed Norris (depicted as Det. Ed Norris) was there to check the portrayal of Police Commissioner. Donnie Andrews for Omar Little, Ed Burns himself for Baltimore Homicide Detectives, David Simon himself for Baltimore Sun journalists. There is not a single main and recurring character who is not checked such way. Season 06 was proposed to depict Latino-immigration in Baltimore, but was abandoned because there were not good fact checker among the writing and creating crew. I haven't seen such genuine and stressful effort to maintain authenticity in any movies or series. So, despite 'The Wire' being fictional, it is as real as it gets.<br/><br/>All this effort makes the entire city of Baltimore as a main character. Each season of The Wire is pillar for a stable depiction of city. Season 01 introduces us to Baltimore drug crime, and pathetic Baltimore City Police Department (side story - character study of very interesting characters from Bubbles, a drug fiend to Avon, a drug lord, and crews of Barksdale Organization, and stick-up boy Omar). Season 02 shows how international trade of drug occurs in Baltimore, and adds new set of characters from Baltimore Port stevedores, while continuing character study from Season 01. Season 03 adds politics to the show and shows how downtown politics affects the ghettos of Baltimore. More interesting characters are added (Marlo Stanfield and crew). From Season 01 to Season 03, The Wire shows the problems, and gives hints for it's cause. Season 04 is the one where The Wire gives core answer for everything it shows in former 3 seasons. It shows how there is endless cycle of social dysfunction, and how kids of city become victim of the society they live on. Season 05 adds journalism as new aspect. Season 05 is the one where we really realize that 'The Wire' is fictional. It has more drama compared to other seasons. The only weak point about Season 05 of The Wire is that the drama in S05 is not as subtle as in other seasons. It doesn't make S05 any bad. In my opinion there is no quality drop in S05 whatsoever. The series finale and last few episodes of the final season are absolutely phenomenal. The series finale wraps the whole series in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Now Breaking Bad is no longer the best show for me, for the reasons now I believe are plotholes:-\n(a) Law Enforcement in BrBa is not authentic. DEA gets a good budget, and even so it couldn't track Tuco Salamanca in the first place. Even Walter White knew the location, how couldn't DEA not know his location. They sure must have had some fiend informant, and could bust Tuco for firearm possession and drug possession.\n(b) How DEA could be so late for witness protection of Mike's crew, even the single one of them. 'Heisenberg' was already the priority of them, right?\n(c) In The Wire, Stringer says that the more weak the drug is, the more is the earning, which is very true. Sure very pure sample of meth can be adulterated to earn more, but DEA always say that the market always has the purest form. This very fact makes the whole theme of Brealing Bad a joke.<br/><br/>BrBa is the best if perceived from psychology of Walter White. I still love Breaking Bad, but now I can't ignore those plotholes. I am now happy that I can't watch most of the movies and series anymore. I have watched 'The Wire' 4 times already and I'm pretty sure I can rewatch it more. I tried to watch other series, but I couldn't. I think the only other show that has accordance with the cop authenticity as shown in The Wire is True Detective S01. There might be other as well, but I have to think hard to find them. The whole business of addictively watching movies and series is now over for me, and I am glad that 'The Wire' brought that closure. Now I can take a good care of my grades.

Many times it was spurned as \"The Office Rip-Off\" in its starting days, despite it being more of a brainchild of the writers than anything. It seems safe to say, that after more than seven years on the air, Parks and Recreation has carved its own spot amongst the quirky and well-loved comedies that are hard to come across today.<br/><br/>The show stars hard-working public servant Leslie Knope (played by the amazing Amy Poehler) and a cast of humorous and memorable characters that navigate through bureaucracy and red tape in the local city government to complete projects. The most notable--and perhaps most powerful--asset of this show is its lovable and unforgettable characters, some that will leave you rolling your eyes and chuckling while others will simply make you smile in the most joyous kind of way. The cast has obvious chemistry amongst one another, and this certainly breaks through into the characters in ways that will make a viewer grow more attached to them. <br/><br/>The humor of the show itself also sets Parks and Rec apart from other television shows. While it's apparent the first season struggled to differentiate itself from The Office's \"awkward humor\", Parks found its stride in the simple \"cute humor\", the kind that is so innocuous and dumb and simply \"cute\" that it becomes hard not to laugh at the bumbling antics of the Parks and Recreation branch of the city of Pawnee. The episodes are mixed with the right amount of comedy, wit, and actual drama and storytelling; each character is crafted with the perfect amount of depth, that really separates from other comedy shows that rely on cardboard characters with running jokes to spew the funny. Even in its heartfelt moments, there is always room for laughs, but it never pushes aside the rest of the characters or their development. If you find yourself immersed in Parks and Recreation, it is almost certain you will find yourself immersed with one, more, or maybe all characters.<br/><br/>The simple genius, the style and passion this show was borne of, really marks it as a one-of-a-kind show, one that may not have had all the high ratings or prime-time slots or huge important newspaper reviews, but it became its own, and that's really what mattered in the end. After struggling in the shadow of The Office, and finding its stride in later seasons, Parks and Recreation became its own kind of wonderful recipe, one that delivered its own style of warmth and humor not found in many television shows. It may even define the style of comedy itself; after all, both Parks and The Office made famous the \"mockumentary\", \"talking heads\" sort of humor that others are sure to try and replicate. What gave Parks and Recreation a \"name\" per say, is the fact that the characters were so much larger-than-life, the stories so innocuous and believable, that the avid viewer can begin to believe them too, and find that this show is as heartfelt, funny, and enjoyable as I found it. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpful": "45 out of 59 found this helpful.", "date": "8 July 2015"}, {"title": " Please and Thank You.", "content": "Recently rewatched the whole series yet again.

It is truly Amy's strong point, as we saw during her (too short!) run on SNL and in movies like \"Blades of Glory\" and \"Baby Mamma\". Amy absolutely steals the show, but it might be just because that's how the show has been written; the supporting cast are all strong actors, and, with the right material, could all bring in huge laughs for the show.<br/><br/>It is obvious when watching \"Parks and Recreation\" that there has been a lot of effort put forth to put out a great show, and I believe they have pulled it off.

Amazing!", "content": "Ok, I've read a few reviews here and I couldn't stomach reading all the negative \"edgy\" comments. So, it persuaded me to write my own review and argue some of the points stated :<br/><br/>First of all, one of the many reasons Homeland is amazing is that it is depicting a very close reality. That being said, it is a tv show! How interesting can a tv show be without being dramatized to a certain extent? You want history and facts, you go watch a documentary on WWII. Otherwise, myself and (I'm sure many others like me) like to step out into a world of fantasy where some things aren't 100% accurate and that's OK. As long as it keeps me entertained, and boy does it entertain! Drama, Action, Romance , Sarcasm, Mental breakdowns, Terrorists, Traitors, Presidents, Deaths, Sex, Manipulation. You want it, Homeland has got it!<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting is superb from most if not all the cast. How can you call Claire Danes' performance annoying and Mandy Patinkin's character \"boring\"? Are you sure we're watching the same show here? They are brilliant, so much so they've remained the focal point of this series and is what probably kept it running for as long as it did. Yes, Rupert Friend and Damian Lewis are greatly missed. But to me, they just made me love Carrie more, and the show more. Knowing every character, whether the ones that have stayed or the ones that left, have made a mark on this show that we are reminded of in an endlessly developing story I just can't get enough of.<br/><br/>Finally, Americans, Russians, Arabs.... I don't know any of them who hasn't messed up before. Whether in the show or real life. In fact, the last season is focused on this specific point. That believing you can win some war will somehow resolve conflict is bewildering. And that the only way forward is peace. Some people wrote it's against these kinds of people or this kind of people. Really? Are we in the 21st century? To the contrary, it shows us more about what's wrong with how Americans deal with Terrorism and how sometimes they're self righteous whilst throwing stones at one another to get in power. If that's not something you can believe, than this show is probably not for you.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I love it and I highly recommend it!", "rating": 10, "helpful": "27 out of 31 found this helpful.", "date": "28 May 2020"}, {"title": " I'm gonna miss Homeland", "content": "Just watched the last episode of the series, which was a perfect ending to an amazing show!

And at first, S2 seems to support that arguement, as initially it does feel a little bit like a retread, that it would just be a repeat of S1.

And from thereon, it was fantastic.<br/><br/>3 - Painfully slow start - not to mention that seeing Carrie and Saul crap on each other felt wrong. But midway into the season, they reveal THE twist, which retroactively makes you go \"oh!\" And from thereon, amazing.

However, no matter how much the twist may \"redeem\" the early episodes, in the moment, they were just not very enjoyable.<br/><br/>6 - Similiar story to S3 - a very slow start, then suddenly the big event occurs, and everything gets shifted into top gear.

But.. on rewatch, I realized how much I hate what they've done with Quinn after the first few episodes. He just stumbles from one bad situation to another. The writers had the right idea of Quinn essentially fulfilling the role of an assassin initially, and I wish that was just how it was the entire season.

Bad writing can, and did...<br/><br/>First, let me say two things that writers/producers/directors seem not to understand:<br/><br/>#1 - People do not watch television to have moral lessons shoved down their throats. They watch television to be entertained. Moral lessons are (typically) not entertaining.<br/><br/>#2 - Never, ever trade good writing for special effects. You will always end up in the red. Nobody cares if there's a superbly-crafted monster shown on the screen if the plot doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Now, let me cover why (in addition to these two points), why this season went horribly, horribly wrong.<br/><br/>First, let me say that it isn't a problem that Dr. Who is female. Or, rather, it didn't HAVE to be a problem. The writers (and wardrobe department) made it one by not dealing with that shift properly.<br/><br/>1. WARDROBE\nDr. Who is an absent-minded, eccentric genius. The suits that previous incarnations of Dr. Who would wear would give him an air of respectability while he was making a fool of himself on his way to ingeniously solving some complex problem. This incarnation of Dr. Who looks like she stole the clothing of a gender-fluid toddler. It doesn't give her any air of respectability, so she ends up looking ditzy, crazy, or ridiculous. The very obviously bleached hair doesn't help because it goes against Dr. Who's very long history of not caring much about appearances (and when Dr. Who has cared, the fashion choices were more geeky/dorky, not superficial).<br/><br/>2. PREACH, PREACH, PREACH\nI watched years worth of Dr. Who and never - EVER - have there been so many moral lessons shoved in my face. Typically, there is a good balance of: (a) random adventures, (b) the occasional horror episode, (c) races that were interacted with in the past come to continue the story line, (d) an old acquaintance of Dr. Who asking for help (so we get to learn a bit more about Dr. Who, who is a bit of a mystery), and (e) some well-crafted moral lesson. This season is completely imbalanced. Every episode is some social justice lesson and it's not entertaining. Beyond the irritating condescension, it is incredibly presumptuous. Even if I did manage to make it to my age without any knowledge of morals, quite possibly the last place I'd look to educate myself on how to be a moral person would be television. Not only isn't television a trustworthy source, it's also not the point of television: ENTERTAINMENT is. If I were watching Mr. Rogers or Sesame Street, that would be one thing. But, this is Dr. Who. Come on!<br/><br/>3. POOR EXECUTION\nDr. Who doesn't like guns. This is established. Dr. Who gets ANGRY when people are killed. This anger is driven by empathy, but also by having seen too many people die and being fed up with it. Having this Dr. Who play that anger off as mopey (as in the witch-related episode) is weak and pathetic and shows no conviction. This is very out of character. I realize that anger can be harder for a female character to play without seeming hawkish, but deal with it. This is Dr. Who's established personality. You can't just change who Dr. Who is as a character. This is something that even stayed the same through previous male incarnations, so biological differences didn't make a difference. You need to keep the continuity. Write it better, act it better.<br/><br/>4. TOO MANY PEOPLE\nAnother huge mistake was adding so many sidekicks. Imagine the episode duration as a pie. More people? Smaller slices. BAD plan. We're hungry. We want a generous slice of Dr. Who - not fifteen or fewer minutes, with the rest of the time dedicated to humans and their personal problems. Dr. Who is a Time Lord. We're still unfolding all of what that means and trying to learn more about Dr. Who's past. There are so many species out there, so many unexplored worlds. But, here you are filling up our time with the problems of a few human characters. If we wanted that, we could've watched another show! ANY other show. The point of this one is to see all of time and space - which (believe it or not), does not revolve around a few humans.<br/><br/>5. IDENTITY CRISIS (!?)\nThe whole \"I don't know myself,\" \"I'm lost,\" bit was taken way, way too far. Yes, we get it, it's disorienting being reconstructed from scratch in a new body and having to reorder hundreds of years worth of memories. But, having a female Dr. Who in the midst of an identity crisis is more the plot for a Lifetime movie than an action/adventure sci-fi series. It makes Dr. Who seem neurotic. This incarnation could've been made a bit more serious to compensate for the difference in sex stereotypes and norms. That would've kept Dr. Who's personality and personal strength more intact. But, as is, it's a mess. You turned Dr. Who female and didn't do enough to compensate for it and now female Dr. Who seems weak, pathetic, mopey, and ditzy. What a total disappointment! (And, I say that as a woman, myself.) It didn't have to be this way.<br/><br/>6. BAD WRITING\nThe writing for this season (11th) is absolutely horrendous. Have any of these writers ever actually watched Dr. Who? Do they know what the word \"continuity\" means? How about \"character\" or \"established personality\"? It doesn't seem like it. It seems like you recruited people on to write for this show who didn't give a toss about the personality of Dr. Who, the continuity of that character, and the balance of themes that previously existed in the series. Get people working for this series that actually care about keeping it as good as it WAS (I say \"was\" because this season is the worst I've ever seen). Not only is the character of Dr. Who being slowly dismantled over the course of this season, the overarching themes are imbalanced, and nothing about this series which drew me to it to begin with has been left intact. Find a crazy, obsessed fan that can recite lines from various episodes by heart. Then, hire this person as a consultant (they'd probably work for free just to be part of the production, so you might not even have to pay them). Make sure you actually LISTEN to this person when it comes to wardrobe, character, and plot lines. If you did that, maybe you'd actually have a chance of recovering from this train wreck of a season. To be clear, it's not bad because Dr. Who is female. It's bad because your writers don't know what they're doing and your lead actress is either not being properly instructed on how to play off certain personality traits (see the previous note about anger over people getting killed) or she doesn't have the acting ability. Either way, this isn't a problem with Dr. Who's sex. It's a problem with other people not doing their jobs sufficiently. Please fix it, otherwise you will not only have ruined an incredible series, but you will have ruined it with a woman (which, given your seeming obsession with moral lessons, would probably be a big no-no).", "rating": null, "helpful": "530 out of 635 found this helpful.", "date": "25 March 2019"}, {"title": " Bitterly, bitterly disappointed", "content": "I see I am not alone in deploring the decline in watchability of Doctor Who with the 2018 season.

We thought, with the Doctor becoming a woman, that we were in for one of the most singular Doctors of all time. The possibilities were incredible! Sadly for us, it has been a crash and burn. It's as if the writers are determined to not use the fact of her womanhood at all, except as promotion material. For example, previous Doctors have had so much compassion (Matt Smith especially), but I feel nothing from Jodie. You could plug any guy into the current roll and barely have to rewrite. Her character is so bland. Other than the obvious play of having male characters having a problem with listening to a woman (as tired a story trick as any), there's been very little difference between Jodie and the other Doctors, as far her gender plays. It's tragic. No femininity at all.<br/><br/>As for the companions......too many, and I don't care about them. At all. Might as well throw some red jerseys on them.

For instance, I have never even thought about race or gender before in Doctor Who, but now, every episode, I feel as if political correctness is playing an important role in everything. Story elements seem to be included for the simple correctness of the choice, and that is awful, because Political Correctness ruins pretty much everything it touches, and now it is ruining one of my favorite shows of all time.<br/><br/>My last two points are strictly about personal taste, but I have just got to say something about them.<br/><br/>Jodie Whitaker's outfit.

I personally love the universe Sutter created and am thrilled that he is adding to it. I do still hope that he does something with the original nine of SOA, but that is a different story. Mayans is hitting that same place for me that SOA did. Its been hard to find another show like that as SOA is my all time favorite. To the ones saying that it isn't original the way SOA was, well ... That particular concept will never be completely original again because its already been started. That said, this show does still have its own sense of originality within the same universe and is standing on its own just fine. As for all the complaining about the subtitles... I'm not exactly sure what they were expecting.... I mean, it is a Mexican biker club .... Of course they are going to be speaking Spanish at least half of the time. It would come off fake if the whole thing were done in English. Js. Same thing with the music, if it were all the same type of music used in SOA it would be out of place as well. The culture is a huge part of any show wanting to come off with as much authenticity as possible. Giving mixed types of music ties in to all of that. As to the arm being cut off during interrogation of the Samoan leader, well that guy is the Cartel. Not the Mayans, and yes... Even in real life getting caught stealing from the real Cartel is a death sentence. Period. The Mayans were just the hired muscle to escort the Cartel shipment on this side of the border.

Sub-plots, alliances, family, betrayal, secrets, intrique, enemies and the ever looming multi-level law enforcement will feel familiar. Not much black and white, just a lot of gray.<br/><br/>Let me quickly get this out of my system, I LOVED SOA and Kurt Sutter is a great writer, but when it comes to his wife, he just cant help himself. Why must he put her in everything he does nepotism be damned? The most unrealistic character in SOA was Gemma. No woman would ever wield that much juice (no pun intended) in the inner workings of a major MC.<br/><br/>We start off appropriately enough seeing a crow, you know as in Sam Cro, dead in the road with a scavenger picking its carcass. We see things mainly thru the eyes of E-Z (The Mayan's Jax) who is a prospect with a blood brother in the club and an old girlfriend he still pines for (sound familiar) . Apparently he just did only 8 years in prison for killing a \"dirty\" cop which one would think is a major red flag. Hopefully prospect E-Z will live long enough to see his patch unlike SOA's Half Sack and V-Lin.<br/><br/>E-Z's father, who apparently knew a really good criminal appeal attorney or something like that is the venerable Edward Olmos who is once again type cast as the wise, sage, Yoda like character just as he was in Miami Vice and Battle Star Gallatica.<br/><br/>Instead of the Mayans running guns their interest is in dope. Their H-D's don't have flat t-style handle bars but ape hangers. No exclusive dull gray or black paint but some of their bikes have other colors. Call backs to SOA abound: the church table, instead of Jax reading his father's journal E-Z reads books suggested by his father. There is a sex change joke that will immediately remind any serious SOA fan of Tig and information extraction ala Happy.<br/><br/>We actually see SOA's San Bern chapter and occasional SOA ally Marcus Alverez. It doesn't take long for the action to start and things to get dicey. You can just see the wheels turning inside of E-Z's head as if he were saying WWJD (thats Jax not Jesus).<br/><br/>Once again a Mexican Cartel chiefdom is a major player with the inner workings of moving dope from Mexico to the US fleshed out: tunnels, legit business fronts and protection runs from wholesaler to retailers.

I also refrain from comparing wife number #1 to my wife number #2. Nothing good would come from it anyway. A sufficient amount of artillery action, drugs and crime were delivered in the first episode without having to overdo it simply for the gratification of a few who enjoy that kind of graphic violence.<br/><br/>Oh sure, the Mayans have their own way of interrogating their enemies which may seem a little unrealistic but there is a reason why the term \"an arm and a leg\" is used when a costly decision or error is made by the Mayans competition, namely the Samoans. Watch the pilot episode and you will get my drift as I don't want to spoil your viewing pleasure.<br/><br/>The main character is a young Mayan M.C. prospect named Ezekiel 'EZ' Reyes played by JD Pardo. EZ recently got out of prison after serving an 8 year term and while he was in the slammer he found out his girlfriend was expecting his baby. EZ seems to have a head on his shoulder so we are to assume he eventually will do well within the M.C..<br/><br/>EZ also has an older brother named Angel (played by Clayton Cardenas) who is a full patch rider in the Mayans M.C.. The two brother's father whose name is Felipe Reyes is the local butcher who appears to be carrying the world on his shoulders. Felipe is played by the very cool and always in control actor Edwards James Olmos who is a well known star both in film (1988- Stand and Deliver) and in older TV series such as 1984 - Miami Vice, and 2002 - American Family.<br/><br/>I like where the series is taking its viewer audience and how the young prospect named EZ's wit will be pitted against the chapter's President, as well as the drug cartel head named Miguel Galindo played by Danny Pino who previously starred in TV's 2003 - Cold Case series, as well as 2011 - Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.<br/><br/>EZ's past love life is evident throughout the pilot episode and the series also outlines where EZ's love life may be headed in future episodes. There is a lot going on in this pilot episode and EZ's introduction to us the audience in the pilot episode is starting from the ground up...literally.<br/><br/>I like very much what I have seen so far and it is worthy of a 9 out of 10 rating.<br/><br/>HEADS UP!

The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately. <br/><br/>SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact. <br/><br/>The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclich\u00e9d, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera.

Even so, I have to refer to the development of plot lines, so if you are a beginner, perhaps it is better to stop reading.<br/><br/>Suits' Pilot was frankly very engaging and interesting in terms of characters and situations, bringing a new turn on \"another lawyers' series\". I loved it instantly. It was frivolous but witty and sassy, the dynamics between Mike and Harvey was magnetic, the production was elegant, and the constant threat of revealing a serious secret was a compelling argument to keep watching a show. It also had humor and certain characters (like Donna or Louis) added enriching details.<br/><br/>The series had a bright first season, in which Mike's ordeals and his master-disciple relationship with Harvey were at the center of the plot, and Mike's exceptional gift with memory played a fundamental part in the development of the plot line, justifying why the cheating was sustainable and why he could actually be an asset at the lawyers firm.<br/><br/>Suits maintained interest and quality in the second season, with other characters gradually becoming stronger and widening the plot.<br/><br/>But starting from the third season I started to observe a gradual decline in the plot line, and the exhaustion became conspicuous in the present, fourth season, the weakest of all so far, to the point that is has now, really, become \"yet another lawyers' show\".<br/><br/>Mike's exceptional abilities have completely disappeared from the action in seasons three and four, and now he has become a bland character with nothing standing him above any other ambitious young executive. Jessica's new romantic interest is utterly unbelievable and it has negatively weighed in the show. Louis has been portrayed as a clown in seasons 3 and 4, and instead of being funny, he has become anti-climactic and unbelievable. Donna's place as Harvey's \"counsellor\" has been overextended and her \"knowing things in advance\" is, in my opinion, overused as a clis\u00e9.<br/><br/>In short, the series had something different at the start, and it has veered into the road of losing its original allure and interest in a very noticeable way.<br/><br/>PD: Jessica's amazing wardrobe, though, is always a pleasure to appreciate.

Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications. The show follows both characters as they face different legal and personal challenges in each episode whilst maintaining the gregarious and quick-witted rapport between the two.<br/><br/>The show offers plenty of variety besides the law by developing the relationships of many characters inside the firm, \"Pearson Hardman\", managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a career-minded powerful woman. Jessica must balance between her two best lawyers, a devious Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Harvey, whose relationship is filled with rivalry and playable banter, is certainly one to make you laugh. The show also follows the stories of the beautiful Rachel (Meghan Markel), a paralegal whose test anxieties are stopping her from fulfilling her ambitions of going to Harvard to study law and Donna (Sarah Rafferty) a smart, sexy secretary.<br/><br/>Besides the two leading characters, Suits is balanced excellently with an ensemble cast filled with intriguing relationships and an original and sharp script combined with the beautiful backdrop of New York City to make this a thoroughly enjoyable TV show which I can't help but grin ear-to-ear from start to finish and I hope it continues its high standards for seasons to come.

Sure, there are some common elements surrounding Harvey being cold-hearted and cocky yet excellent as his job.

There are charming, proud, extremely competent, rude, driven, and ruthless lawyers in every major firm in every major city. At some point it becomes a requirement of the job. Doctor House meanwhile is too much of a self-destructive train wreck for my taste.<br/><br/>If you want to get a glimpse into working at a high power law firm, an investment bank, or any other high stakes pressure-cooker job look no further.

It would have been a very much alike to the ubiquitous TV shows' on lawyers/law firms, but Suits brings together a curl to the high flying lifestyle of lawyers, or as has been showcased on the screen. Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is nothing short of a genius with his brilliant mind and photographic memory, but due to his unimpressive history in his previous years has stymied him in achieving his dream from becoming a lawyer. To make ends meet he takes on a few jobs whose legality can be questioned. When one of these jobs takes a dark turn, and Mike trying to fend off the police of his shoulder, serendipitously runs into Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). Harvey is interviewing candidates for his firm. Harvey extremely impressed by Mike offers him the job despite knowing that he does not have a law degree. The basic premise of the story works on this with Mike &amp; Harvey trying to keep Mike's identity a secret, along with taking on difficult cases and trying to find solutions in unconventional ways.\nCreator &amp; writer Aaron Korsh doesn't disappoint much throughout the series, with well thought of stories &amp; scenarios. Gabriel Macht does an amazing job portraying an uptown playboy-esque New York lawyer. Patrick J. Adams too does a good enough job, but sometimes does not meet the high standards set by Macht. Other members of the main cast should also be appreciated for their efforts, particularly Sarah Rafferty as Donna Paulsen &amp; Rick Hoffman as Louis Litt. The music and background score is satisfying and gives a bit of excitement which works in the series' advantage when some episodes' story is not good enough. Direction &amp; Cinematography too does not fetch too many complaints.\nThe series runs for 9 seasons and by the end feels stretched out lacking much depth. It would have been better if they would have taken the Breaking Bad route of limiting the seasons. Initially the cast remains standard across seasons with a few additions here and there, but by the end it's a jumbled up cast with a few original members and additions, who too are changed time and again, which is not always received well by the viewers. Story-wise it is plausible and remains to the point, but by the end it lacks quality, as it is being tried to be overextended. For a legal series if a few more storylines/scenes would have been based in the courtroom like Boston Legal it could have been better.\nIt kicks off with a bang but by the end loses its touch, but it is surely entertaining throughout even with its flaws. If you choose to see only the first 7 seasons, it would not be the worst idea. It can be boring for people who are not much interested in business/corporates type of genres, but if you are into it it's a must watch.\nActing- 8.5\nCasting- 8.5\nCinematography- 9\nDialogue- 8\nDirecting- 8.5\nEditing &amp; Effects- 7.5\nSound &amp; Music- 9\nStory- 8\nStorytelling- 8.5\nRating- 8.5", "rating": 9, "helpful": "8 out of 8 found this helpful.", "date": "29 December 2020"}, {"title": " Feel that you are part of them", "content": "A very lovely would say one of the best series ever watched.. you feel that it's all happening around you are part of it you feel to become Harvey or Mike.

And apparently, I was somewhat late to the party, as the show already began to air in 2015. I'm an avid sci-fi fan, but I hadn't heard or read anything about 'The Expanse', and yet it's one of the most ambitious sci-fi (or generally high profile/concept TV) shows I've come across in recent years. <br/><br/>First, I believe a little (spoiler-free) information might be helpful prior to watching the show, because the viewer is thrown right into an incredibly detailed world where much is shown rather than explained (which is certainly an elegant choice in terms of storytelling and world-building, but there's so much going on and every shot is packed with so much visual information that it can be a little confusing during the first 2 or 3 episodes). So what you need to know is this: A couple of hundred years into the future, humanity is spread out throughout the solar system and divided into 3 opposing forces who are on the brink of an all out war for political power and resources (mainly water - which is harvested in the form of asteroid ice). The 3 fractions consist of the two superpowers Earth (governed by the U.N.) and Mars; the third party are the \"belters\", which is basically everyone unfortunate enough to be living on poor dwarf planets like Ceres or other large rocks in the asteroid belt (hence the name \"belters\").<br/><br/>Those belters are the future equivalent of the 3rd World population, as they represent the poor, exploited and underdeveloped colonies in the solar system. Many belters feel represented by the \"Outer Planets Alliance\" (short: O.P.A.) which is a radical group demanding more autonomy and fairer distribution of resources for the inhabitants of the asteroid belt, but is viewed as a terrorist group by Earth and Mars. Belters are badly affected by the harsh conditions in low (or even zero) gravity (which is often referred to as \"low-G\" or \"zero-G\"), as well as low oxygen levels and the strict rationing of water; their bodies develop less muscles and their bone structure has less density compared to that of humans born and raised on Earth or Mars. The belters' life expectancy is roughly half of that of humans living on Earth.<br/><br/>So that's the backdrop to the story told in 'The Expanse', and it all may seem a little complicated at the start, because the plot unfolds through several separate story lines. The key parts of the story are told through the eyes of three different protagonists: a high ranking U.N. official on Earth named Avasarala (played by Shohreh Aghdashloo); a cynical belter police detective named Miller (Thomas Jane) whose story starts on Ceres; and a young executive officer named Holden (Steven Strait) working on an ice freighter in space. Although those three don't know it (yet), their stories are connected - and that's all I'm gonna say about the plot, because this show deserves to be watched unspoiled.<br/><br/>Featuring visual and narrative elements that reminded me of almost every sci-fi film I ever loved - 'Alien', 'Outland', 'Serenity', 'Blade Runner' and many more - this is an R-rated space opera no sci-fi fan should miss. And although it probably can't compete with 175 million costing blockbusters like the new 'Star Trek' movies in terms of visual effects, 'The Expanse' looks fantastic. Given the insane amount of effects work involved, it must have been a very expensive affair for SyFy (who ordered the series from production companies Alcon Television and The Sean Daniel Company), and although I doubt they were able to afford the kind of budget HBO usually spends on shows like 'Game of Thrones' or 'Westworld', in terms of scope and complexity, this new SyFy show easily matches HBO's flagships (it appears Syfy is trying to get rid of its reputation as \"shlock-channel\").<br/><br/>The storytelling is meticulous and perfectly paced; the world-building richly detailed and always credible, and the patient viewer who doesn't demand everything be explained within the first episodes is rewarded with a thrilling, mysterious tale of adventure and discovery. The cast is terrific (especially Thomas Jane who seems to fit his character like a glove) and the writing manages the astounding feat to elegantly lead us through a very complex world and complicated story without ever feeling forced or weighed down by expository dialogue. Showrunners/writers Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby (known for their Oscar nominated work on the screenplay for 'Children of Men') really have done a fine job bringing the series of novels by James S. A. Corey (aka Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck) to life.

They did a stellar job with gravity. It isn't perfect. But they emphasize realistic ways to simulate gravity (ships under continuous acceleration, spinning, ring-shaped space stations). And they shut gravity off when appropriate.\n* Space ship battles are incredibly thoughtfully designed, with an eye for small details. They pump the air out of the ship before a battle, for goodness' sake. I can't think of *any* other scifi space show that goes into these details\n* Consistency. Characters act consistently. Environments act consistently.\n* Details. So many details! Mag boots. Ship maneuvers. technology such as computer/handheld devices. All so believable.\n* Mormons! There are mormons, because, of course there are. And they aren't even the bad guys! (I only state it this way because too often, mysterious religious groups are used as hollywood shorthand for \"bad guys\"). The presence of Mormons just enriches the worldbuilding.\n* I love the fact that Eros station just looks like a giant potato with a porthole on its butt. It isn't polished. It isn't flashy. It's grimy and utilitarian.\n* I love that every move made by a spaceship has corresponding thrusters pushing it in that direction. The space ships do not fly like fighter jets, like they do in other typical sci fi shows. They fly like rocks.\n* I love the fact that space craft tracking screens look like legitimate space object tracking screens, with curved, mathematically drawn projected trajectories.<br/><br/>I can't gush enough about the \"hard\" sci-fi elements. I haven't even gushed about the production yet:<br/><br/>* Story is detailed, in-depth, and engaging. It's basically a political/war drama, but it is very well written.\n* Acting is great. Seriously. Even the throwaway characters are great.\n* Anyone can die at any time. Very Game-of-Thrones-y in this regard, in a good way. Builds tension very realistically.\n* Costumes, sets, graphics, cinematography are all excellent<br/><br/>Star Trek. I used to like Star Trek. Have you seen Star Trek Beyond (2016) though? That was terrible. Everything that is done wrong in Star Trek Beyond is done correctly in The Expanse. In fact, I'm not sure I can watch any Star Trek show or movie again after The Expanse.<br/><br/>Ultimately The Expanse feels like a combination of Battlestar Galactica (2005 one) and Firefly, more than any other series I can think of.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "356 out of 438 found this helpful.", "date": "4 April 2018"}, {"title": " Season 5 - WOW", "content": "Season 5 back with a bang today.

I can't get into Dark Matter, which otherwise would be a decent show, but after watching the Expanse, it pales in comparison. <br/><br/>I don't have issues with the accents.

Of course after years apart, people will have new accents. <br/><br/>This is the only show I watch where I can't be doing anything but watching the show.

I have never written reviews, although I've had an IMDb account for a long time. I give all the new sci fi shows a try, but I end up not following most. So I have a good idea of what's out there for fans. Most new sci fi is ... unscientific, to put it kindly, or just techy stage furniture with soap-opera dialogue and character development. Like most fans, what I want to watch is a great sci fi story that seriously takes into consideration the effect of technology on the world around us, and intelligently explores the possible futures of humanity. I'm also interested by stories that consider the social issues of an alternative world shaped by different forces -- what would happen if, say, people lived on different planets, or if water was scarce, or if you had to live in 0g all your life. I know no sci fi will ever rise to the standards of physics PhDs, but it would be nice if writers occasionally paid attention to one.<br/><br/>This review is based solely on one episode so hopefully this was not a fluke, but the quality and writing are outstanding (better than most good high budget movies).

Adding insult to injury, the fates seem to seek and destroy the few high-quality TV series that do emerge from the pack (Firefly, Dark Matter).<br/><br/>As another reviewer well said, the Expanse is an \"island in television.\" Not since Battlestar Galactica have we been treated to motion-picture art so well-conceived in the sci-fi genre. Hollywood seems to believe that \"sci fi\" fans are easy to please with superficial stories, predictable characters, and eye candy special effects. NOT TRUE. Although the \"production value\" of The Expanse seems near unprecedented, it is NOT why there are so many 9-10 star reviews on this forum.<br/><br/>Rather, the reason is good story-telling. Not too much reveal too fast... but enough to keep big, interesting questions smoldering. And mercifully, the writers spare us long passages of explanatory dialog. Instead we're invited to use our imagination, and even watch episodes repeatedly.<br/><br/>If you've read the SA Corey books, you'l delight at the manner in which they are here brought to life. If you haven't, you'll be seriously entertained, and perhaps inspired to do so.<br/><br/>With all the high-quality literary works in the genre, Hollywood has no excuse that something as good as The Expanse is so rare, as there is certainly no shortage of deep, multi-layered, captivating universerses.

I did not even watch the trailers, somehow curiosity got me to watch the pilot episode. I was pleasantly surprised by the production quality. Syfy is clearly putting a lot of resources (and a big bet), that the series will be the winning horse. The actors so far are sticking to the characters James Corey sketched out, but some of the main characters personality is yet missing (Naomi comes to mind the first).<br/><br/>The actors are too early to comment, but Holden (Steven Strait) seems promising, a little younger than what Corey sketched. Detective Miller is a very crucial character, and Corey had given him a fantastic gray, sarcastic humor (hope Thomas Jane can pull it off). But thats the beauty of a series based on a brilliant book, the story-line and the universe the author has built is so good, that it will be able to mask some mediocre actors too. Unlike the TV shows at present who have a rudimentary story line but rely more on script and acting to pull it off.<br/><br/>The pilot episode largely sticks to book (a huge relief), in fact the producers have even stuck to what sort of background music is playing. I really hope this show receives the positive feedback, the sci-fi fans need it, sci-fi is so much more than comic books.<br/><br/>I do hope viewers appreciate the intricacies of the story line, the politics between Earth, Mars, and the Belter region. The relatively more accurate space physics. The attention to smaller details (on why just having a normal Earth pressure, is a grievous torture for someone who has been born on null or lower gravity etc).

They both make poor decisions, both are dealing with the traumas of their youth (which, in Danny's case, comes down to Johnny himself in many ways), and they both pass on the positive and negative experiences to their children and/or students in various ways. Danny is often motivated by petty revenge and unable to see any good in Johnny and his Cobras (and not entirely for no reason), and Johnny may be saving himself from....himself and his past and giving his students confidence, but also seems to be making them somewhat into monsters.\nThe show is able to balance all this thematically and do so with poignancy and humor.

It's certainly not the first series I watch, nor it's the first series based on books, not even historical fiction books. But it's the first series which I'd read the books it is based on way before it was even announced. So seeing it rumored, then officially announced and finally premiered was very interesting and exciting. I had a lot of hopes and fears for this. And I'm so gladly to say that based on the first two episodes of the series, my hopes were made into reality and my fears into joy. And so, inspired me to write my first review here.<br/><br/>I'll try to keep this as spoiler free as possible, but some are impossible to avoid.<br/><br/>The Last Kingdom tells the history of Uhtred of Bebbanburg, a Saxon noble who is captured and raised by the Danes, first as a slave and then as a son. His future will be one of battle within and without, fighting against powerful warlords and struggling between his love for the Danes and their culture and his duty for the Saxons.<br/><br/>In many ways, talking about how this series make this simple enough premise into a engrossing story full of nuance is talking about how the books do it. Here there is a commitment to reality that goes beyond most historical shows, and I'm not talking only about the clothes, weapons or history itself, but characters, their motives and relationships. At the center of The Last Kingdom is its characters and the show presents and develops then masterfully. <br/><br/>Take \u00c6lfric (Joseph Millson) for example, Uhtred's uncle. When the young Uhtred (Tom Taylor) wakes up and realize his father went to war without him, he promptly go and ask him why he was left behind. His uncle barely talks to him and say he has to go and clear the stables. But the directing and acting in the scene makes it clear \u00c6lfric has something sinister in mind. Uhtred get his pony and goes to join his father, and then you realize that that was \u00c6lfric's plan all along. It's subtle and skillfully done, and with something that feel effortless you have a lot shown to you what \u00c6lfric is all about. <br/><br/>When it comes to characters there is no compromise, they feel like real people that are just living their lives. Doing what they think is right and/or what is best for them and their loved ones. You won't find good or bad here, nor one dimensional characters. By the end of the first episode, you will find you will have feeling for these people, both positive and negative. And in the end, that is what keeps you interesting in a series. And you will care for the fate of Uhtred (Alexander Dreymon), Brida (Emily Cox), Alfred (David Dawson) and the many other great characters that are present in the first two episodes.<br/><br/>And from them stem all the other conflicts in the series. The political plotting and machinations are ever present in the fractured world that these people inhabit, and the leaders of both the Saxons and Danes are constantly trying to get things working in their favor. Together with political issues, there is religion. Christianity is a defining characteristic of the English, and because of the Norse paganism, they view the Danes not only as enemy of the Saxons, by enemies of God. The Danes of the other hand, view Christianity with a disinterested curiosity. In one opportunity Uhtred explain Heaven as Valhalla without all the drinking, fighting and humping. This passage helps to illustrate a kind of 'lightness' that the series, just as the books, have. Maybe lightness is not the best word, since there is plenty of violence and moments that will leave you shocked, but the story is told in a way that feels amiable and pleasant. That is done is the series by skillful directing , writing (in the first two episodes done by Nick Murphy and Stephen Butchard respectively) and editing. That, along with its character, might be the two most appealing things about The Last Kingdom.<br/><br/>Add to that a great score, beautiful scenery and great acting (although a little bit inconsistent in some moments) and you have the recipes for a series that stand tall and deserves to be seen. No matter what you like, The Last Kingdom (the first two episodes together are a nice demonstration of everything good about this story) might offer something for you.<br/><br/>For the books fan in particular, this is a series that even when it changes the story of the book it feels it belong, Bernard Cornwell's tone is ever present in it. Not to mention many small moments that shows the people responsible for the series really cared about the source material, like in shield wall battle (it doesn't reach the greatness of the book, but then, what battle scene anywhere does?), there is a scene of people walking over a dead body, something that feels taken right from the book. Or a sword strike that comes from bellow. Even some of the more questionable changes feel justified. Like giving the Saxon rectangular shields. In the end it proves extremely valuable as a tool to differentiate Danes from Saxons. But without a doubt, this is a adaptation that work is all levels and will delight most readers.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "298 out of 341 found this helpful.", "date": "12 October 2015"}, {"title": " History with a twist.

People might love The Crimson Field but in no way did people speak or say things in WW1 that they did in that particular drama. For a reality check watch The Great War: The People's Story.<br/><br/>Leaving that era aside we have now watched four episodes of The Last Kingdom and all have been excellent and \"believable\" if that's the right word for what remains fiction.

You only get occasional violence within the story line so this gives you the opportunity to get interested in the love scenes too and these are not over the top. Also people are allied in all sorts of ways. The end scene in Ep4 was brilliant and sums up what I mean.<br/><br/>You can't expect killings all the time.

I was constantly comparing the Outlander books to the show and disappointed at times that it was not same as the books which I loved.

I also liked Emily Cox portrayal of Brida, Uhtred's strength, I'm curious as to why Uhtred let her go back to the Danes when he obviously loves her.

The student body is quite diverse, and the cast of the show represents all the stereotypes of people who end up in such a place. However, it also reflects the actual sense of community that can be formed in a smaller university and the bonding between students who otherwise would have never met let alone become friends.

I am glad I did.<br/><br/>What I like about this show in particular is that it is primarily concerned with the platonic dynamic among the members of a mish-mashed group. For me, that is really refreshing. I have never been a real fan of major network sitcoms because of what I perceive as a complete lack of ingenuity and a revolution around unoriginal themes (I actually started tuning into the Disney show, Suite Life of Zach and Cody for the reasons stated herein). There have been a few good ones here and there, but most friendship-oriented sitcoms geared towards adults seemed to develop the over-used story of a group of friends sitting around crabbing about their love lives and how to fix them, i.e. Friends, Will and Grace, O.C. (not exactly a sitcom), Sex and the City, even 30 Rock to a certain degree. I realize the bulk of those shows are from a few years back, but it was those sorts of shows (not to mention the devil-conceived reality shows) that really turned me off from major network programming. I enjoyed them at the time, but they all seemed to grace the same themes: we're such close friends and we're going to help each other find boyfriends. Puke! I got so sick of seeing friendships revolving around getting someone laid. <br/><br/>Then I came upon Community. I've watched every episode thus far in the first season and I really appreciate its commitment to focusing on the core relationships among the friends. Of course they delve into the sexual tensions that naturally exist, but it always remains focused on the friendships, and through funny means. I think this kind of theme is so necessary in today's programming. It's OK to \"just be friends\" with someone. It's OK to be yourself, to be dorky, funny, fussy, uptight, bitchy, whatev. There are still people out there that can care about you. It doesn't have to be about finding love or sex, being sexy, or being desired by the gender from which you seek attention. That is what I like about Community, it just shows friends being friends without pretense. <br/><br/>As far as the show goes substantively, I think it is quite funny. It sometimes misses the mark, but I think those moments are rare. Some episodes are funnier than others, some characters are funnier than others, but everyone has their moment. I love Joel McHale, I think he's a riot, and Chevy Chase is really great. Someone else mentioned how they were glad he wasn't over-taking the show's humor elements and I also appreciate that. His humor is well- spaced throughout the show. The guy who plays the dean is a riot as well. I love his scenes.<br/><br/>I also really enjoy the community college setting. It's a very appropriate setting for a show about a diverse group of friends that each have their own special and interesting reasons for being there. I know some people dislike the overt, \"politically correct\" representation in the group. There are some stereotypes, the culturally- insensitive older person, the fabulous African-American woman, the WASP-y, pretentious brat, the hipster, the cool guy, the nerd, etc. It can get a tad clich\u00e9d, but I think it works specifically because the community college setting is a place where you might find that mixture of people. It appeals to people from all walks of life: younger, college-aged students, people who have time on their hands and want more education, people trying to make a new start in life, etc. I think it's a great and interesting setting to use in a show about a unconventional group of friends. I really think the creators planned it out well. <br/><br/>So yes, if you are like me and enjoy seeing shows about friends being just friends, and developing those platonic relationships, its definitely worth the try.

The writers managed to create an intellectual and off-beat sitcom, which is a welcome change in a genre that has seen tons of generic titles come and go.

One that made you mockingly laugh at something you were thoroughly enjoying at the same time. Perfect examples are of course the paint ball episodes, in which external influences force the school into an absurd mayhem.<br/><br/>As Chevy Chase, the actor that portrayed Pierce, mentioned in various interviews and a disturbing voice mail (look it up!), over time Community has fallen into its own trap. By focusing more and more on predictable sitcom story lines, such as those regarding love interests within the group and the pregnancy of the character Shirley, it slowly turned into another one of those shows. We do not care. We just want to laugh.<br/><br/>The reboot at the start of the fifth season looks promising, but the forced nature of the fourth episode is a terrible sign. It is abundantly clear that the writers wanted to do another paint ball-type episode, because they know we enjoyed the others. But the thing is, we didn't enjoy it just because of the blazing guns and outright craziness. We enjoyed it because it poked fun at the action genre - and most importantly, at itself. This time the premise was weak and the execution was predictable. The joke was gone.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed shows like How I Met Your Mother and The Big Bang Theory for more than a couple of seasons, you may or may not appreciate Community.

The X-Files will forever be remembered as a true hit TV show, and a breakout accomplishment for Fox. Its survived cast changes, location moves, ups and downs in ratings, and years of airing. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it has been a thrill. Chris Carter has created one of the most defining shows of the '90s. People that don't even watch the show know what it is, and EVERYONE knows who Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are, whether they've ever seen one episode or not. The show brought on a whole new level of TV entertainment in 1993, with its different, moody atmosphere, intriguing lead characters, and mind-bending plots. I admit, while watching most of the episodes, I thought, \"This isn't very scary...\", but then I payed attention to the detail and it got so good...the lighting, the sets...even when Mulder and Scully are outside (which is often), the sky is hardly ever sunny and bright, but rather dark and shadowy. The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the \"Mulder and Scully in love\" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people. And whenever someone, whether a fan or not, hears anything referring to aliens, they immediately think of little green men with small bodies, big heads, and large eyes...all courtesy of The X-Files. In short, this amazing television series has affected so many people. I feel blessed to have grown up with this show, rather than being born after it, doomed to see it in reruns.

I look at TV these days with disappointment and boredom most of the time since most television drama series/movies deal with one of three genres:  law, medicine, or science fiction.

I disagree with all of these.  The writing is as good as ever (This year had excellent shows; check out Redrum, This Is Not Happening, and the two-part season finale for a peek.).  David Duchovny leaving the show may be a blow to fans, but I think Robert Patrick has done a terrific job in stepping in so late in a series.  The acting is as good on that show as it has ever been.  As for what we have learned from the show, I think that if one expects to be content with knowing why things that happened on the show happened, he is missing one of the major points of the show.  The show is half the story; your imagination is the rest.  Chris Carter has found that happy medium ground of saying enough but not too much.

The conspiracy theorie's \"on-off is it-isn't it\" nature makes for confusing twists and turns which is exactly what it is supposed to do.<br/><br/>I can't really say whether the earlier seasons are better than the later ones or not. When you watch that many episodes over a few months they all seem much the same in terms of quality. There are standout episodes just as there are the odd turkeys, but overall the quality is good and fairly consistent.<br/><br/>What most people don't get, I think, is that the show became less about the conspiracy theory and weirdness and more about Mulder and Scully as the seasons rolled by. Perhaps this was why it was such a shock when Mulder vanished at the end of season 7 and was replaced by Doggett and Reyes. I too, was inherently antagonistic towards them but, I am very glad to say, they do grow on you. But the two seasons they were in were not really enough for you to get to know them intimately, as you did Mulder and Scully.<br/><br/>The show was filled with memorable characters such as CSM and the Lone Gunmen. Special episodes gave you an insight into these recurring characters and how they came to be who they are. Indeed, the Gunmen got their own show, albeit only for a run of thirteen episodes (unlucky for them!). Other characters like Gibson Praise, The Alien Bountyhunter, Pusher, Tooms and Agent Harrison also recurred and were pleasant enough to watch whenever they were on screen. Old faithfuls, if you would.<br/><br/>I've become, from an indifferent beginning, a definite fan of the show. It was a shame to watch the final episode and think that it was over, but here's hoping they make a couple more movies. I think it's probably a foregone conclusion that they will, since the ending of the show was left wide open with unresolved issues. But maybe that's what was intended, that the ending be a non-happy one. Only time, and another movie (or series) will tell.<br/><br/>EDIT FOR SEASON 10: Well, this is a review I never thought I'd update! A new series picking up where it left off, though years later, of course. It is looking pretty good so far, though the pilot was a little odd. Ep 2 is an improvement and Ep 3 shows that the show can poke fun at itself. Ep 4 is the best so far. Here's hoping it continues to get better and better.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "100 out of 114 found this helpful.", "date": "11 August 2004"}, {"title": " Scully?

I think I was 11 or 12 when the Pilot first aired. I didn't watch the show then because I was afraid of it after I saw episodes like \"The Jersey Devil\" and \"Born Again\" when they first aired, which is really funny because theses are some of the tamest episodes to me now. So unfortunately I wasn't quite ready or prepared for the X-Files during it's running. Later I remember watching TV one Saturday and there was a Chris Carter double feature. First \"Jose Chung's From Outer Space\" and then the Millennium episode \"Jose Chung's Doomsday Defense\". Both episodes had me in tears laughing at the dark humor.<br/><br/>I later found out that FX had an episode every night at 9 and so every night for an entire summer I got to watch an episode and I quickly became immersed in the mythology of the alien conspiracy. Some of the most memorable episodes for me from this period are \"Bad Blood\", \"The Host\", \"Darkness Falls\", \"E.B.E\", \"Little Green Men\", and countless others. I quickly became a fan but I had yet to see every episode and I avoided watching it new airings for fear of spoilers. So I began to buy the seasons on DVD. Over two years I was able to purchase and watch every episode. Interesting to me was the fact that I had already seen most of the episodes through syndication but there were many that I hadn't.<br/><br/>Anyway enough about my history with the show. The elements of the show that I think make it a great are simple. Likable characters, psychopathic bad guys, enough dark comedy mixed in with the horror and drama to give the viewer a healthy balance. The writer's of the show have a wonderful talent of leaving certain stories hanging only to the extent that does not make the viewer feel betrayed but wanting to watch more.<br/><br/>The X-Files defined an era of television and opened the way for other Sci-Fi related shows as well as helping define the crime drama shows that are all over the place now.

Admittedly it was once a better show than it is now, but most episodes are minor masterpieces.  But when it peaks, like with \"Redux\", \"Triangle\", and \"One Son\", it peaks like no other show has before.<br/><br/>  It is completely unclassifiable.  It is a mystery, a sci-fi, and sometimes self parody, and the show has several markedly sexual overtones (the cigarette smoking man).

It has no peers. The story of two FBI agents working in a small office in the basement of the FBI to uncover, prove, disprove supernatural and unexplained phenomena and alien presence builds beautifully in the nine seasons the show existed. And having seen every episode in chronological order, they build with purpose, continuity, and innovation. Sure, there were set-backs when one actor didn't do most of a season, or another actress was pregnant, or whatever might have arisen, but the show's writers and creator - and make no mistake here that creator Chris Carter and his staff of writers/directors are the reason for this show being what it is - always met each and every set-back with a creative, engaging response. When Fox Mulder's character was gone for most of two seasons, they created two new characters that were every bit as solid as Mulder and Scully. Robert Patrick's Doggett and Anabeth Gish's Reyes were equally compelling characters. There are so many good things to say about this show. The two leads, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, grew as characters and thespians before our very eyes. They honed their crafts and became stronger screen presences. These characters were characters that we learned to like and wanted to follow. Duchovny brought some much needed wry humour to an otherwise serious subject. He was able at one moment to convince you that the world was one big conspiracy and in the next moment comment on the lack of movement from a dead person with lighthearted appeal. Anderson softened each year, becoming less rigid and inflexible. The cast of supporting characters was always first-rate with Mitch Pillegi as Skinner and William Davis as the antagonistic Smoking Man never giving a bad performance. The three Lone Gunmen were excellent light diversions in bloody cases or cases involving alien invasion or what not. The first season will always be my favorite. Mulder and Scully are finding themselves as characters and the idea of conspiracy is all too real. Jerry Hardin plays Deep Throat, the man feeding Mulder news of government conspiracy, with strength and a true believability. But before I get too compartmentalized, The X Files was able to be two series in one - perhaps its greatest achievement. One the one hand, we had Mulder and Scully battling conspiracy, aliens looking to invade Earth, Mulder finding his sister that had been abducted by aliens, and other plot strands of a similar nature. But the show would also show totally unrelated episodes that were very scary and horrifyinfg. We saw worm men, killer insects, a man that sucked the fat out of his victims, cannibalistic cults, and the list goes on and on. I love the myth episodes, but these horror episodes are my favorites because they are so creative. I cannot remember how many times, having just watched and episode, saying how does someone think this stuff up? Whether The X Files is spoofing the Brady Bunch or alluding to Moby Dick or creating a homage to Frankenstein and movies of its ilk or just trying its best to scare you or disgust you(the episode Home - a favorite of mine), it is always true to itself in terms of the creativity that courses through its proverbial veins. Yes, sometimes, it is a bit full of itself, and, yes, sometimes, the creativity falls right down on its face(as when the show combined the X Files with Cops). But the show has far more, far more hits than misses. I think that as time goes by, this television show will be remembered for much more than what we remember it for today. I think it will be one of the all-time greats.

This appears on the opening screen of one of my favourite music videos based on the X Files saga.<br/><br/>I agree!<br/><br/>I started watching the X Files when I was 10 (I am 17.5 at the moment). My first episode was Home and my mum was there when I saw it. BAD way to start my experience! She freaked a bit (make that a lot) and of course never let me see another episode. But, in December 2000, I got to the video club and guess what I found! X Files tapes! I was thrilled! I took and watched each one of them. Luckily the show was still on t.v. so I became an instant addict. I already knew the plot backbone, so it was easier for me to follow all the plot-twists. I came to love the Mulder-Scully dynamic but I must admit that all the dynamics were great. (May I remind Mulder-CSM or Mulder-Krycek, or Scully-Skinner, or Bill Scully-Mulder). As most fans, I was anxiously waiting for that kiss in the movie, but that #$%@ bee ruined it. But anyway, the kiss came in triangle (even if not \"real\") and the romance found its way. However, the reason for watching the show was never the \"relationship\". I think I watched the show, because simply, it was superb. The actors, the director, the writers, the visual effects, the creepy Mark Snow music, the innovative ideas, the \"mutant of the week\", the Morley cigarettes, the story itself and its implications. That is what I loved in this show and that is what made me an avid X-phile!<br/><br/>The X Files has become my personal addiction. If I am tired or need an energy boost, then I know that my tapes (71 of them!) always wait for me and the VCR is ready. When I press \"play\" my world is gone in an instant and the wonderful world of Mulder and Scully sneaks in and takes me completely.<br/><br/>Now that the show is over and I have seen every episode (except some of s9 -that I don't have the courage or the wish to see), I seek my X Files drug in collecting music videos, creating videos, downloading X stuff, playing the X Files games in Playstation (Resist or Serve was amazing!!!), reading lots of fan-fiction, watching the episodes (of course), and generally trying to compensate for what is lost. <br/><br/>I am looking forward to the next movie. I feel like I am in withdrawal and it isn't a nice feeling! I am amazed at myself for being so needy. Everyday I catch myself thinking about the show, the plot and its characters. And it is never enough. I wish I didn't need to sleep to keep doing this for as long as I can, until I get completely repelled by the idea itself. I honestly believe it, that until something happens and I hate the show, I will continue to adore it and treasure it to the extreme until the day I am gone. My love will never fade, if it has to end, then it will end abruptly. <br/><br/>Favourite episodes of all times, include all the Mytharc ones, and especially Duane Barry, Ascension and One Breath of s.2, Anasazi, Blessing Way and Paperclip of s.3, Tunguska and Terma of s.4, the Redux trilogy, the movie, Triangle and the Sixth Extinction trilogy.<br/><br/>The last episode had a non-happy end! I don't believe any of the X-Philes was truly surprised at that since no one expected closure. On the contrary everybody secretly wished for reasons to keep the show going. The Truth leaves untouched questions, answers some of the existing ones and creates more! A true X Files episode. As David Duchovny said once in an interview, \"Mulder can never find happiness, he is a questing hero\".

Scully is ordered into the assignment, and everybody believes Fox Mulder saw something awful happen to his sister, but they think his mind created the alien abduction scenario to help him cope with the shock. And so for seven years they encounter things for which maybe a logical explanation can be found, maybe not.<br/><br/>I really loved X-Files, but I think I liked their individual episodes more than their story arcs, which, actually, were quite confusing. Was smoking man Mulder's biological father? Was Mulder's sister really kidnapped by aliens and gone for good or did she come back as some kind of cloned pseudo daughter for Smoking Man? Was Scully's baby just a case of \"the doctors were wrong you can get pregnant\"? Was he a product of an alien experiment she does not remember? I dunno. But the fact is people all over the Internet will tell you they do know that this or that was true when largely all we have are insinuations in the show itself, never explicit facts. Maybe this was done on purpose, and sometimes it made the show confusing but it always kept an air of mystery going on that was thoroughly compelling.<br/><br/>As for the idea that Smoking Man - one of the true villains in the series and brilliantly and subtly played by William B. Davis - was at the center of every assassination of the 1960's - I always found that a bit Forrest Gumpish for me, but an interesting idea. (He wanted to be the one to kill Martin Luther King because he respected him so much???? What the...) My two most favorite episodes of the entire series were \"Home\" and \"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\" - neither of which did anything to advance a story arc but were great examples of just how good X-Files could be when everything came together to tell an interesting story in 50 minutes or so. If you watch \"Home\" from the beginning of season four I'll just tell you that you'll never be able to listen to \"Wonderful Wonderful\" sung by Johnny Mathis in quite the same way again.

Zone' and 'Dreamwatch', all defunct alas ) from the mid-90's. The show everyone was talking about then was 'The X Files'. It debuted on U.S. television in 1993, and two years later scored the highest ratings for Britain's B.B.C.-2 channel ( it was then promoted to B.B.C.-1 ). The country ( nay, the world ) went 'X Files' crazy. You could not pick up a paper, turn on the radio nor switch on the television without seeing or hearing it being mentioned. I went into W.H. Smiths once to buy 'Private Eye' and David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson were on the covers of practically every magazine ( including 'Yachting Monthly' if I'm not mistaken ). Books about the making of the show or tie-in fiction took up whole shelves. Even Jonathan Ross' wife Jane Goldman had one published. Each time something odd happened in the world, reporters mentioned that it was like 'something out of the X Files'. Why was it so popular? The '90's saw a boom in television sci-fi, with umpteen 'Star Trek' series, 'Farscape' and 'Quantum Leap' on air, but this only partly answers the question. The plain fact is that 'The X Files' was a very good show.<br/><br/>Created by Chris Carter, it told of the exploits of two F.B.I. agents - the enigmatic Fox Mulder ( Duchovny ) and the sceptical Dana Scully ( Anderson ) - whose job it is to investigate the unexplained, from alien abductions to mutants living down sewers. Mulder is obsessed with the idea that there is life on other planets ( he believes his sister was kidnapped by aliens ). The U.S. government, rather than be portrayed as the good guys, was depicted as being behind a major cover-up, hence the show's famous catchphrase 'The Truth Is Out There'. It owed a great debt to 'Kolchak: The Night Stalker' which starred Darren McGavin ( as roving news man 'Carl Kolchak' ) and ran for one season in 1974/75. Carter openly acknowledged this. But there was more to 'Files' than just aliens and other assorted grotesques. The relationship between Mulder and Scully had viewers fascinated; it was coldly formal, yet the possibility existed they might throw self-control to the wind and leap into bed. It was one one of the first shows to benefit from the then-new Internet as viewers could watch episodes and then debate them online. Anderson and Duchovny became sci-fi sex symbols, Mark Snow's catchy theme tune even made the British pop charts. An amusing sketch on 'Spitting Image' had Mulder and Scully confronted by the cast of the 'Scooby Doo' cartoon series, enraged at the blatant theft of their show's format. <br/><br/>The stylishly directed show was both critically and commercially acclaimed, winning awards by the score for its writing and acting. Imitations came out of the woodwork - 'Poltergeist: The Legacy', 'Strange Luck', 'Dark Skies', and a retread of 'The Outer Limits'. But over time, viewers grew weary with the show's refusal to provide answers to the enigmas posed, and to make matters worse, Duchovny's involvement decreased to the point where he left eventually to be replaced by Robert Patrick ( from 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' ). I cannot recall at which point I stopped watching. It could have Season 6. The show had run out of puff, and with Duchovny gone there seemed no point in tuning in anymore. The final blow for the show came with 9/11. Nobody wanted to watch a programme about government conspiracies in the aftermath of the horrific tragedy, and its ninth season a year later was to be its last. Two movies - 'The X Files' ( 1998 ) and 'The X Files: I Want To Believe' ( 2008 ) were made, but as the latter was a flop, it is unlikely we will see more. Mulder's sister will have to stay with the little green men.<br/><br/>It is strange to think that a show so loved at the time could go on to be virtually forgotten now. I'm inclined to think it would have benefited from being cancelled a lot sooner. It is a reverse situation from 'Dark Skies' which suffered from having too few episodes! These days, Britain's main television obsession is 'The X Factor', a bizarre situation itself worthy of a Mulder and Scully investigation ( could Simon Cowell be an alien? ).", "rating": 9, "helpful": "12 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "31 October 2010"}, {"title": " X-files shouldn't have come back", "content": "I used to love the X-Files. It was my favorite TV shows of the 90s and I enjoyed all the seasons, with the exception of S9 which was complete and utter garbage. I still think it's one of the best TV shows ever, so when I first heard of the upcoming 6 episode mini series, I was naturally excited.<br/><br/>Once the familiar intro music played and we immediately get to aliens and UFO action scenes, for a moment, I felt a great feeling of nostalgia. It was like seeing an old friend again that you haven't seen for years. Still, it was immediately familiar and interesting again. <br/><br/>But then, all of a sudden, everything changed halfway during the first episode. Mulder goes from believing to disbelieving almost instantly, by some words of some new guy and starts rambling about various seemingly uncorrelated things, creating conspiracies as he Goes along or so it seems. Total chaotic nonsense it seemed to me. In half a episode, all his believes of the past 9 seasons are gone, seemingly overnight. Really? Then it all becomes even more unbelievable by the re-opening of the X-Files for no apparent reason. Mulder, who doesn't seem to have done any paid work is hired again as a FBI agent and Scully, who seemed happy in her current job as a doctor, let's it all go away to go back to the X-files without a doubt. Very unbelievable. Who would hire anyone with a 15 year old gap in their resum\u00e9 for a department without a budget. What a crap.<br/><br/>After that, it all quickly deteriorates even further. I won't go into all the details, but it's smooth ride downhill from here for the next 5 episodes. It makes that X-file movie turd from 2008 seem like the good old days. Seriously, what where they thinking. Chris Carter must have some seriously money issues or lack of ideas for pushing this crap forward. They should not have brought it back with this lack of quality.

By having a resounding premise of catching a notorious serial killer while trying to conceal his own identity, Dexter enters each week with a new sociological dilemma as well as a new criminal to dispatch. What is best about Dexter is his own personal facade of trying to be normal.

Awkward Dexter is best Dexter, and you're really inside the characters head. The second best antagonist throughout the series is also featured here, with strong performances all round. The writing is great, the humour is even better, and the whole season fits together. I honestly can't pick one quote for this incredible season, but if I had to... ''You can't be a killer and a hero... it doesn't work that way!''<br/><br/>Season 2 / 9/10: The premise of the BHB investigation is solid, and the investigation ran by Doakes on Dexter is even better. The way the season unravels is great, besides the slight deus ex Lila in the finale. Unfortunately, the finale isn't as good as the episodes before it in terms of tension. Besides that, another brilliant season. ''I just know there's something dark in me and I hide it. I certainly don't talk about it, but it's there always, this Dark Passenger. And when he's driving, I feel alive.''<br/><br/>Season 3 / 8/10: I love this season, though it was never going to live up to Season 1/2. It's very important in terms of the character development of Dexter Morgan. Jimmy Smits is great, but the side plot and antagonist were only good, and not great, unlike in past seasons. ''I killed my brother... I killed yours too.''<br/><br/>Season 4 / 10/10: This is the final season in my eyes, and it has a fitting enough ending for me to be satisfied with to call a series finale. John Lithgow is terrifying. The writing is sharp. Lundy's death is shocking. Rita's death is beyond shocking. Everything about Season 4 is on point. ''I thought I could change who I am, keep my family safe. But it doesn't matter what I do, what I choose... I'm whats wrong. This is fate.''<br/><br/>I really don't feel like reviewing Seasons 5-8. It's not that 5,6 and 7 are bad, it's just that they completely destroy the character of Dexter. They give a psychopath feelings, and that's a MAJOR misstep. This is all the result of Clyde Phillips leaving the show, and he being replaced by incompetent writers.<br/><br/>Season 5 / 7/10: Straight up bad ending. Characters forgetting they have evidence against a serial killer. Terrible villains. Writing is still surprisingly good.<br/><br/>Season 6 / 6/10: Writing is straight up bad. The protagonist is terribly portrayed and written. Terrible twist in episode 9. Great ending, but that's about it.<br/><br/>Season 7 / 7/10: It would be higher rated, but it is ruined by Hannah's inclusion, and the death of Isaak way too early.<br/><br/>Season 8 / 2/10: Terrible. Treadmills. Dumping loved one's in the ocean. Standing outside a cafe, stalking a serial killer, and wondering why he saw you when you stood in one place for AN ENTIRE HOUR. TERRIBLE SEASON.

Greenberg, and the cast includes Buffy / Angel mainstay Julie Benz).<br/><br/>Dexter is a sociopath, someone with no human feelings and hence no natural, inner moral compass, and he has an unquenchable blood lust that drives him to kill. But he had the great grace to have been the adopted child of a police officer, who (as we see in terrific flashbacks) successfully instilled in him a complete moral code, which he adheres to on a strictly intellectual level. This is an utterly brilliant concept (which I assume derives from the novels it's based on), one that allows the writers to explore the nature of moral behavior and of what it means to be human (Dexter is, in a sense, an alien).<br/><br/>Another thing the show is doing brilliantly is moving at different speeds in parallel. There is a primary apparent season-long story arc (concerning a cat-and-mouse game between Dexter and a serial killer), and a a secondary arc involving Dexter's sister's police career. The first handful of episodes include a very powerful completed arc concerning one of Dexter's police colleagues and a local crime lord, while two of the four episodes so far have also included a self-contained story spliced among (and playing off) the ongoing ones.

This type of irony runs throughout every episode.<br/><br/>The banter between the characters in the show is what tends to be particularly funny. The actors - although novices - are all great. Charlie Day in particular has me laughing like crazy every episode. And his interaction with Danny DeVito (who's been brought in for season two) is hilarious. Season two is more polished so far in terms of the mechanics of the show - the characters have all been setup now and they know what they're doing - and in that regard it is seeming to get better and better with every episode.<br/><br/>You do have to have a very sick sense of humor to like some of this - DeVito's character, Frank, is the father of Dennis and Dee, and his reason for being in the show is that he is getting a divorce and wants to relive his glory days as a youth. He tries to re-ignite a relationship with an old girlfriend of his from high school - but when he finds out she's a grandmother and not interested in doing anything wild, his attention instantly turns to the waitress and he tunes her out. It's cruel, sick and hilarious. DeVito is playing another ruthless character (same as in \"Taxi\" all those years ago) and it works splendidly.<br/><br/>Overall this was a delightful blast of fresh air - after seeing so many stale sitcoms, this proved to me that FX really is becoming the new lead in character-driven comedy-dramas (such as the equally superb \"Rescue Me\" which isn't quite as funny, however).<br/><br/>My only hope is that \"Sunny\" doesn't become so popular that it attracts controversy and sells out and dumbs down its humor. Right now it's on par with the early episodes of \"South Park\" and \"SNL\" in terms of how irreverent its humor is - and personally, in my opinion, its plots are better than most comedy films I've seen within the last few years.<br/><br/>If you want to see something new, different, and funny, check this out. I have a feeling it could either become huge, like the next \"Seinfeld,\" or - more realistically - it will become a cult phenomenon.

In the same fashion as Seinfeld and Arrested development, this show deals with a group of unlikeable misfits while they engage in moronic adventures based in equally moronic impulses. The difference with those spiritual predecessors is that Sunny takes it a step further. As the tagline of the show indicates (\"Seinfeld on a crack) the writers of this show not only embrace the selfishness of their characters but takes it a step further by completely severing their social awareness and empathy towards other human beings. The result, needless to say, is not only sometimes disturbing, but utterly hilarious. Here is a small introduction of each one of the characters:<br/><br/>-Dennis Reynolds: A malignant narcissist in its truest form. Dennis believes he is the closest to physical perfection a human can achieve. A reputed ladies man, he is not above using alcohol, lies, emotional abuse and even the implication of danger (if they say no) to get girls in bed with him. He shows great amusement by watching how other people might get hurt by his actions, even if those people are his friends or his sister (who he constantly refers to as a bitch). <br/><br/>-Mac: Dennis's best friend and roommate, he equally enjoys to be part of the gang's plans even if that means hurting or offending innocent people. He even benefits from Dennis's system to pick up and seduce girls, because Dennis let's Mac hit on them when he gets bored with them. Mac believes himself a skilled martial artist (Even if he has not taken one lesson in his whole life) and enjoys resolving problems with violence or vandalism.<br/><br/>-Charlie: Although equally impulsive and alcoholic as the other's in the gang in many ways, he is the only one who has shown he has some empathy for his fellow human being. He spends his time drinking beer or huffing glue (yes, he huffs glue). Being the most na\u00efve from the group he is easily manipulated by the others, although he has shown he isn't above manipulating them either. He is highly resentful and is prone to violent outbursts.<br/><br/>-Deandra \"Sweet Dee\" Reynolds: Dee is as manipulative ad his brother and has been shown as only motivated by her own agenda. She is heavily picked on by the others on the gang because of their misogynistic views. Although as the other characters of the group, specially his brother, she shows no regard for how other people might be getting affected by her actions. She is highly vindictive and she goes to great lengths to make sure her schemes and her lies are being bought by the people involved.<br/><br/>-Frank Reynolds: An impulsive, violent and eccentric ex-millionaire he is highly delusional and carries a gun all the time. His likes include prostitutes, drugs and ham (Yes, ham). He is highly irrational and is always looking to crazier and more idiotic ways to deal with the possible issues that might arise for the gang.<br/><br/>This show appeals to your inner child in the way that this characters really have the mental development of a child, and you will find hilarious how they will impulsively engage in idiotic plans without showing any preoccupation of how the consequences could be for them, their friends or for the people unfortunate enough to get involved with them. Is a refreshing show because it is one of the first comedies that embraces the darkness of its characters and the comedic possibilities of having a group of alcoholic, impulsive, borderline criminal, but dim witted protagonists. These are highly unlikeable people, and their humor might offend you in one way or another, but mark my words: You will enjoy every minute of it.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "93 out of 101 found this helpful.", "date": "5 December 2011"}, {"title": " One of the funniest shows on television.", "content": "There hasn't been a show in the world that makes me laugh as hard or as often than It's Always Sunny in its prime. Seasons 1 through 5 have some of the best, sharpest comedy writing in ages. Since then, the show hasn't been as consistently brilliant, but there are gems in every season. The premise is very simple. It's about the life of four Philly bar owners. At least until season 2 brings in the father of siblings Dennis and Dee, Frank Reynolds, played to perfection by Danny DeVito, where it becomes a fearless fivesome of hilarity. The thing is, these aren't your ordinary people. They're delusional, narcissistic, borderline-psychotic idiots. The show has been described as \"Seinfeld on crack\" and that's about as good a descriptor you can get. The gang are always coming up with ridiculous schemes and stupid ideas which consistently result in awkwardness and belly laughs. <br/><br/>One of the best parts of the show is the characters themselves. They come across as shallow douchebags most of the time, because for the most part, they are, but they each have their own distinct personality that mesh so well with the others. Dennis Reynolds is about as close to an everyman that you can get from the gang, and he's a manipulative, insecure, raving sociopath. His sister Dee is almost as depraved but with more self-loathing and less psychopathy. Their father Frank is a rich businessman who traded that life away for living in the slums as a lascivious alcoholic. Specifically, he shares a bed with Charlie, the illiterate, idiot savant wild card of the group. Dennis' roommate Mac is an oblivious closeted homosexual that favors badassery above all else. To put it lightly, they get themselves into some interesting scenarios. Whether they're all together or broken into various group combinations, you can guarantee laughs are to be had.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the actors really sells the whole thing. Rob McElhenney, Glenn Howerton, and Charlie Day are geniuses. Their writing, their acting, it's all so natural and infectious that you can't help but get immersed into any zany idea they come up with just to see how the gang comes out the other side. Kaitlin Olson and Danny DeVito are just as much necessary pieces to the cast. The humor ranges from uncomfortable to terribly politically incorrect, and that's the beauty of the show. It takes these \"delicate\" topics and shines a light on them that many people are afraid to address. The first season alone deals with racism, abortion, transsexuals, and child molestation. And no matter the topic, they find a way to make it hard-to-breathe hysterical.<br/><br/>I can boast about this show for days, but the fact is you either enjoy the humor or you don't. There's a lot of yelling and plenty of curse words, and it may be grating for newcomers to dip their toes into something like this, especially if they don't know what they're getting into. But for those who do and appreciate clever unrestrained comedy, treat yourself to It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Great intro episodes: (#3.9) Sweet Dee Is Dating a Retarded Person - (#2.4) Mac Bangs Dennis' Mom - (#2.3) Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare - (#4.10) Sweet Dee Has a Heart Attack - (#4.12) The Gang Gets Extreme: Home Make Over Edition - (#6.3) The Gang Buys a Boat", "rating": 10, "helpful": "76 out of 84 found this helpful.", "date": "15 August 2016"}, {"title": " One of the best comedies of our lifetime", "content": "This is one of the most consistently funny shows I think I ever have seen and I say that after watching another hilarious season(14).

In most cases, these shows are being deservingly dumped in the summer because most of them are terrible. Surprisingly, \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\", which premiered earlier this month, is not terrible. Even though it seemed like it might have been, it ended up being one of the better shows to come along so far in the 2000s. The show is about four friends who own a bar in Philadelphia. At first glance, it doesn't seem like anything special. The owning a bar scenario has been done several times before in a variety of other sitcoms including \"Cheers\" and the recently canceled \"Grounded For Life\". However, since the show is more clever and much funnier than the previous sitcoms who have used the device, one can forgive the lack of originality.<br/><br/>What makes \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" better than any other of the sitcoms that are on today is the clever writing. The writing on sitcoms these days is beyond awful. The writing on \"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\" is great. In fact, if the show doesn't receive an Emmmy nomination for writing, there is no justice in the world. The three episodes that have aired so far have been incredibly well written and unlike with most sitcoms, the dialogue doesn't seem like typical sitcom dialogue. The dialogue comes across as natural as opposed to coming across as forced like on network sitcoms and other cable comedies. The writers are also the stars and executive producers of the show, which gives them almost complete control. Let's hope the writing staff doesn't change.

Only character worth applause is Raven. In every season it is only her who saved people in the end. And people are killing each other for no reason. The decisions taken by the leaders are so pointless. Seriously, this show would have done wonders if the character writing and the scripts were better. The story is so so so so good.

It is needless to say that the show is going to ask viewers to suspend their disbelief for the 40 minutes it takes to watch an episode. <br/><br/>A lot of people tend to criticize the show for being unrealistic scientifically. The problem with this being that of course the show is going to be unrealistic. You have to accept that the premise of the show is that 100 teens get stranded on earth by their race of space people 100 years after a nuclear disaster.<br/><br/>Sometimes television programs don't abide by standard rules of physics, or any kind of science for that matter. Sometimes that's what television is there for - to give you a break from the believable. <br/><br/>If you are a stickler for scientific accuracy or a big fan of classic sci-fi the reality is that this might not be the show for you. If, however, you are someone looking for something exciting and (honestly) addicting to watch you might be in luck.<br/><br/>In regards to the script I can honestly say that I suffered through 90210 cringing all the way and while some of The 100's script might be a little cringe-worthy to start, it is certainly much better than most (if not all) of the teen dramas on television. <br/><br/>This is a good show!

Approximately 3 seasons each.\nSeasons (1, 2, 3) quiet a nice show. Full of action, drama, surprises, and unpredictability.\nSeasons (4, 5, 6) as you go further in the series it becomes total opposite. Full of dumb fiction that is only fitted to make the main characters (Clarke &amp; Bellamy) who by the way happen to be the top 2 annoying characters in this show ever.\nMy Advice: Either watch until end of season 3 or Don't watch it all.\n*Spoiler Alert* ( in case you plan on watching passed season 3 )\nTo the point that towards the end of it you'll be rooting and hoping that they die especially when Clarke was so close to. However as boring and predictable it is the writer saved Clarke over and over with so many ridiculous ways including surviving a brain wipe, death by root plants while hidden in a secret hatch, and a magical CPR by Bellamy that revives her \"brain\" haha.\nWhat is very clear, is that the worse thing about this show was the writers.\nWhat is not clear, is why depressing characters that had so much potential and were fan favorite like Octavia, and even killing off characters earlier on that could have had much better role and added much better story in the series such as Lincoln, Finn.\nOf course in the end, the go to another planet, kill an entire civilization and win every obstacle against all odds, by any means without losing any of the main characters (unless you count Abby as main character) and yet Clarke, Bellamy, Madi. All alive and well. Only characters that we were happy to see alive were Octavia (who was killed in last scene) and Murphy even though they turned both of them into puppies in the last season to help Clarke and Bellamy.\nBottom line; one of those series that started well the writers started to run out of good idea so kept going with crappy ideas. A total waste to watch past 3 seasons", "rating": 5, "helpful": "68 out of 97 found this helpful.", "date": "21 September 2019"}, {"title": " My humble opinion about this show", "content": "S7 is a trainwreck, it totally lacked a good direction. the storylines are disjointed and confusing, some main characters were killed off with little to no reason. tho I got to admit, the finale is not bad, it managed to wrap things up nicely tho it needs some more explanation but it's good considering the prenultimate and the other last few episodes were bad.<br/><br/>\nS6 is totally unnecessary, it's a carbon copy of S1 with some differences; the sanctum people as grounders and earthlings as sky crew. And the whole mind drive thing is a bit similar to the City of Light in S3. s6 is unoriginal but good compare to S7.<br/><br/>\nS5, there it is, the actual finale of the series, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who think it actually the best ending for this show. Really good especially the ending. it wrapped up things amazingly good, the show should have ended there, the show should ended when Earth was destroyed. The idea of another survivable planet or moon just felt too fictional and far from reality even tho the show is fiction-based. they got greedy and add two unnecessary seasons that brought nothing to the table.<br/><br/>\nS4 saved this show, because s3 left a bad taste in your mouth, consider s4 as a honey or something sugary. it brought back what makes the show great in the first place; suspense, nice plot, making hard choices, how far are you willing to save your own people, the effects of the radiation. At the ending the crew went their separate ways which makes interesting, and it set up the plot for S5 nicely.<br/><br/>\nS3, well, I consider S3 to good not great. it started out rather good with the City of light storyline but it was poorly executed at the end. They built up Ontario as a real threat and badass, only to use her as a blood bag later. killing off Lincoln and Lexa really wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>\nS2, otherwise known as the masterpiece, this season is the peak of this show. Nothing can beat s2 and it's my personal favorite in the whole series. it beats S1 is every way. The mountain men V the Grounders V Sky Crew, you know, there's going to be some real action there. it's thrilling and suspenseful and have a lots of heart-pounding moments. I mean, Clarke actually pulling the lever, I was like \"whaaaaat\", it was jaw-dropping moment. killing 500+ people because of your 47 friends. What she did was justifiable to her, because it \"HeR PeOpLe\" and they do it to \"SuRvIve\" God , it took me two seasons or so to start liking Clarke again.<br/><br/>\nS1, I don't like the way the characters were introduced, they were ill-mannered and unlikable in the first few episodes. Bellamy and Clarke just took charge with little or no explanation. S1 could have been better, it will take a bit of time to start liking and understanding them because of the way it all started. I got to say, I wasn't expecting Wells to die so soon, he was introduced as a main character, that's supposed to stay at least three to four seasons, same with Finn btw.<br/><br/>\nThe great; Season 2, Season 4, Season 5\nThe good; season 1, season 3, season 6\nThe bad; Season 7 (not bad, just so-so)<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good adventure science fiction show, that you can hardly come across these days. they're making a prequel series, I might check it out when it comes out 'cause the back door seemed promising.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "9 out of 10 found this helpful.", "date": "2 October 2020"}, {"title": " Season 2 was it's peak. Now it just feels meaningless and repetitive because of the bad writing", "content": "(A science-fiction series about teenagers sent on Earth to examine if it's finally livable again after a nuclear apocalypse that happened almost 100 years ago and forced the survivors to live in space stations.)<br/><br/>In the beginning of season 1, the 100 was basically a cheesy teen show, but then at some point the tone changed. And season 2 was what it could have been as its best: a show that explores what is morally right and wrong when you are desperate to survive. How far can you go and still be deserving of surviving? There was still unintended melodramatic tackiness in it, but it was going to the right direction.<br/><br/>But instead of continuing with this tone and enhancing and deepening the morality aspect, they decided in season 3 to go for a shock value road. Traumatic things just happen now to characters but they are never really explored. They build up tension, there's a shocking moment and then the story line is done, ignored. Viewers don't get a satisfying emotional payoff for the suspense.<br/><br/>It's like the writers are fixated serving \"unexpected\" shock value moments after another. I write \"unexpected\", because in reality they are just repeating story lines from a slightly different ankle. Unexpected deaths become expected deaths. Especially if you are a love interest for one of the main characters.<br/><br/>The writers don't seem to care that much, what these traumatic moments and hardships would actually do to a person and how that should affect the writing of these characters in the long run. It's forgotten or it's explained away with an off screen development. Or you can just write that chip in the character's head made the character do it, so does it even matter what they did previously?<br/><br/>Things just happen because they happen. Because it's \"shocking\", because \"you don't see it coming\", because it's \"surprising\". And whatever the characters do, they just write them to parrot: it's us against them, I had to do it, you had to do it, my people, our people, for our people.<br/><br/>No deeper push or a meaning is needed for a genocide. No deeper meaning is needed for wanting someone close to you suddenly to die, no deeper meaning is needed to torture someone etc. Even child abuse is presented simply as a way to protect that child, because the child is \"my people, us against them, I torture my child, so no one else can use her etc.\". And then it's ignored. Everything is fine again. It's very cheap writing. Characters become soulless plot devices who never stop to think, feel or reflect what's happening and what are they doing. They just do whatever they have to while repeating those same old lines like brain-dead robots.<br/><br/>There is no reason to trust any character development you think you see on screen, because the writers seem to get fed up easily with previously written arcs. Characters and relationships are basically rewritten in every season. It's also odd that relationships mostly form off screen, as a surprise. It's like the writers think it would be boring for viewers to see relationships developing on screen.<br/><br/>But anyways, by season 5 you don't even recognize the characters anymore. Maybe it's fun for the writers and the actors, as they get to do something new and play a different character every season, but this leads viewers to feel detached. There is no continuation or coherence in the storytelling. The characters don't learn anything. It's like they forget what they have experienced. They repeat the same things or are continuously unable to see the other side, even though they have self experienced that other side! And when viewers become more and more detached because of this poor and lazy writing, it leads to a realization that you don't even care who survives anymore. Which is pretty bad if you are watching a survival show.<br/><br/>The choice to mix up relationships, dynamics and even personalities and writing the characters to betray someone just because suddenly \"my people\" is different than previously, makes all their bonds seem meaningless. One moment they are friends and the next moment they torture each other, betray each other, leave each other to die etc. Then they just write a fast and easy fix to start a new plot with new dynamics. It's very hard to sell these relationships as something true and deep because they keep ruining them again and again like nothing.<br/><br/>For some reason the writers don't even want to let their own main characters, who are supposedly best friends, directly talk to each other. It's so odd it becomes extremely funny when characters have their most \"meaningful\" discussions through middle hands. They use for example the other one's child or the other one's significant other as messengers. Or even a dead person who talks through a third person! Whatever it takes to avoid an actual conversation.<br/><br/>So it's a very plot driven show. Which is kind of ironic, because there are also many plot holes in it. And because the writers have such an urge to invent something new all the time (it's predictable, repetitive nonsense mostly) and reinvent the characters, all the twists and turns and shock moments feel very forced. So in the end even a plot driven viewer needs to ignore quite a lot of stuff to enjoy it. When the pace is quick enough, I guess ignoring is possible. But when there's time to reflect what actually was shown, you probably start to feel like someone thinks you are a very stupid viewer to write something like this and thinking it's good enough.<br/><br/>For a viewer who enjoys watching the development of the characters, it becomes a very frustrating show. If you like to understand the characters, get to know how they think and feel, and how situations effect them, this is definitely not a show for you.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "166 out of 255 found this helpful.", "date": "12 January 2019"}, {"title": " It's getting good!", "content": "The series was off to a slow start, but it is getting better and better.

It doesn't differ much from the big bang theory or How I Met your Mother in term of style. If anything it is better. But I don't see how you can not appreciate these characters. Saying they are unrealistic is like saying the ocean is full of water... It's a comedy TV show, not real life. So it's not a valid point in my opinion.<br/><br/>You should take it for what it is. They are very caricatured characters but it doesn't stop you from getting attached to their unique personality.

Hands down my favorite character in the show. He is not only hilarious but it's the way Jake Johnson delivers the comedy, as well as the emotional stuff, that makes his character so special. Most would probably say Schmidt is the funniest character in the show, portrayed by Max Greenfield, and I couldn't really disagree with them. Schmidt is much like the Barney Stinson or Dwight Shrute of the show in the sense he is the hilarious supporting actor who's lines are always quotable and who's character you're always waiting for to come back on screen.<br/><br/>The other characters, Winston and Coach and Cece, are all amazing in their own right as well.

I hate that many reviews are negatively reviewed on what little they've watched &amp; complaining about aspects of the show that ARE actually evident in the bigger picture (other/later episodes). One reviewer I noticed, said that there wasn't enough storyline development, saying the characters were too boring and going nowhere. It is a television show. Anything huge that happens, is gradually built up, because if it weren't, shows would be over before you know it (due to nothing left to write about). It takes time to learn to love or recognise characters' chemistry, it's wrong to judge a show's characters if you don't know them well enough yet.<br/><br/>Recent episodes of New Girl have specifically revealed a lot of good and huge movements in characters, which has effectively kept the show interesting (bad critics, you guys are missing out). I honestly think the writers are doing a great job with their pacing and highly creative interactions with characters. The amount of views has been charted high in the ranks (top 10) and has been increasing with new episodes. Would it make sense if it was a low rated show?<br/><br/>I am definitely picky when it comes to TV shows for I've always noticed and hated when minor to rather large flaws would be evident in shows. You know, when a character does an action that doesn't fit within the storyline? Or a scene hasn't been included, and it confuses the plot? Well, I found that New Girl isn't like that. It has no flaws pretty much 100% of the time (if it has, I've hardly noticed them), which means the show flows really well. Also, like many would have mentioned, the chemistry is incredibly significant between characters, which is really what brings out the humour of the show that makes it so much more funnier.<br/><br/>New Girl isn't like other comedies. I'd always hated popular comedies that were apparently 'funny' because of their offensive, violent or stereotypical ways. This show is hardly like that, and I think that's what really attracted me. It also has no background laughter (bonus!), which allows viewers to really let loose and choose what's funny (majority of content will at the very least make you smile, I promise).<br/><br/>If you want a fresh, creative, original and/or unique show that genuinely makes you laugh, you have to give New Girl a shot.

Honestly, I'm a fan of the whole Deschanel clan including Emily Deschanel in \"Bones\" and even the mom, Mary Jo Deschanel in \"Twin Peaks\" from the early 90s.<br/><br/>The first episode started off pretty great. The concept of the show while not original in itself (one girl and several guy friends - \"My Boys,\" \"Two Guys, A Girl, and a Pizza Place\" etc.) still manages to show a unique perspective. This girl with her many guy friends, while a typically weird Zooey Deschanel character (she got a show because we love this about her) is oddly quite feminine as are the guys that surround her. The initial scenario of the break-up while in the midst of a surprise seduction was hilarious and fresh at least for television.<br/><br/>There was a change-up with the cast where the token black roommate (\"Coach\") was replaced with another token black roommate (\"Winston\"). This was done early enough that it didn't phase me all that much when it happened.<br/><br/>The pilot being a great beginning, what I've noticed with the latest episodes is that Zooey Deschanel (\"Jess\") doesn't seem to have any character depth. There's no explanation or deeper understanding of why she does what she does or is the way she is. I'm not even sure she has a job. All of her relationships with the current boys, her friend or her ex seem to be superficial and mere affectations of her quirky persona rather than in anyway real or relatable.<br/><br/>The character of \"Nick\" seems to be sucking all of the character depth. He's obsessed with his ex (ok we've all sort of been there though not to his level) and his behavior is understandable, and relatable. This also gives him a back-story and explanation for his actions. I actually am starting to like him more than \"Jess\" at the moment.<br/><br/>I'm putting five out of ten down because I expected more from this show. I'm also putting five out of ten down because I am desperately hoping that when the show comes back in November that it will add more depth to Jess and the other guys. What does she do for a living? Was her mom an agoraphobic shut-in? Was her dad a narcissistic workaholic that wouldn't pay attention unless she sang? How did she meet her model friend? Why did her ex cheat on her?

While I am not a super-fan and I will admit, I am a bit late to the party, that doesn't stop me from having tons of fun with what should be an average TV show. The dynamic of Rick and Morty is off the charts, and it's honestly one of the best duos ever. It combines sci-fi with comedy and drama. The aliens are clever and humorous but some offer actual depth to the story and reoccur within the script. Rick is practically a god, but he gets drunk a lot and he refuses to do stuff for others. He isn't a good person, but he's a good character to watch on screen along with his grandson Morty. The teen demographic will relate to his odd and naive nature. It's so iconic and quotable, and each season offers episodes full of dark humor and great moments. Some of the best episodes stand out as some of the funniest ones to ever exist on television.

Rick's controversial immature and edgy personality paired with the self conscious and significantly less intelligent Morty makes a really entertaining duet with an interesting dynamic, given that they have a grandfather-grandson relationship.<br/><br/>Another reason I classify this show as a perfect 10 are the adventures themselves. You will not find any pattern regarding the plot of each episode: Each and every one of them are unique, creative and mind blowing science fiction wise, that's something that will get you hooked to see what happens in the next episode over and over again.<br/><br/>The pop culture references were also a nice touch in the series: from Inception and The Purge episodes to Mac Donald's chicken nuggets, this was something I really enjoyed seeing.<br/><br/>And now a personal favourite that made me stick to the show and wait in agony for the rest of the episodes: The Evil Morty episodes. These two episodes captured the silent rise of what appears to be an evil intelligent wannabe commander of the lower class (the Mortys are being treated badly by the Ricks). These episodes are written in a way that Evil Morty isn't the center of attention but later on we see that he is the real deal which is exactly the way Evil Morty acts: Being a silent threat and a malicious commander without anyone noticing; until it's too late. This unfinished storyline really keeps me at the edge of my seat. I mean, who didn't get the chills during Evil Morty's speech and him doing what every tyrant does: killing off the ones who found out or standing in their way of ruling unfairly.<br/><br/>Overall Rick and Morty is an iconic show GUARANTEED to keep you hooked with it's amazing Sci-Fi adventures, unique characters and interesting storylines.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "21 out of 32 found this helpful.", "date": "14 April 2020"}, {"title": " Simpson's haven't done it.", "content": "I like this show,and I've told everyone from work to give it a go.

A good show needs more than a good concept at the start, it needs good storytelling, good acting, likable characters and it needs to find a good pace.<br/><br/>The pilot of Chicago Fire was very weak. The story lines felt too familiar (old friends drifted apart through tragedy, secret painkiller addiction, unrequited love etc) and didn't blend together. And, as you can see on this IMDb page, in the next few days a lot reviewers burnt Chicago Fire to the ground.<br/><br/>For some reason I kept on watching. The second episode was a bit better, but by the third episode the show really found it's stride. I've just finished watching the fifth episode and came the conclusion that 1. Chicago Fire somehow ended up to be my favorite new show of the year and 2. All the negative IMDb-reviews are now really unfair. <br/><br/>Which is why I suddenly felt compelled to write a review of my own. I never do this, so bear with me. <br/><br/>Chicago Fire is not a procedural 'fire of the week' show. It actually does the ensemble drama really well. There is nice balance between the characters and I especially like how these characters connect with each other and how the story lines are slowly developed. In a way, it reminds me of The Good Wife, but with more action scenes (which is a great compliment in my world) <br/><br/>The friendship between roommates Leslie Shay (Lauren German) and Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney) is great. Severide plays the tough on the outside, soft on the inside guy, who walks away from his medical problems by secretly taking lots of illegal painkillers. Not very original or interesting, but I've got to admit that my cynic self is really warming up to Kelley. Partly because Kinney plays the part very well, and partly because of his genuine scenes and aforementioned friendship with Shay. <br/><br/>Shay is gay, but that's not an issue on the show, just a part of who she is. As it should be, I applaud the CF writers for the way they portray her. Her scenes with fellow paramedic Dawson (Monica Raymund)are among my favorites. <br/><br/>Dawson also has some cute scenes with new kid on the block Peter Mills (Charlie Barnett), but is too much in love with lieutenant Matthew Casey to notice their chemistry. Sadly for her, Casey is already engaged to another medical professional. This may sound a little soapy or gooey, but actually, Dawson kicks ass. Literally. Which gets her in to trouble sometimes.<br/><br/>Lt. Casey is arguably the real star of the show. He is played by Jesse Spencer, whom I liked in his House MD days, but who really impressed me on Chicago Fire. He plays the classic good guy, but not in a boring way. His intense storyline involving a dirty cop truly propelled the show to greater heights. <br/><br/>I'm not gonna name every character or storyline, but they're all getting better very fast. (Quick shout out to Eamonn Walker who plays the awesome Chief Boden.) The show may be a bit unrealistic, but that's not what I look for in a good drama. I'm a big fan of Breaking Bad and Dexter, both are very entertaining, and excellently written \u00e1nd acted shows, but both are also very unrealistic. Chicago Fire may not yet be on their level of awesomeness, but it is getting there. My point just is, I am really glad I gave this show another chance and I hope that you will too.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "97 out of 120 found this helpful.", "date": "8 November 2012"}, {"title": " Mixed Feelings From A Real-Life Firefighter-EMT", "content": "I am a firefighter-EMT on the west coast, and wasn't sure about this show going in. <br/><br/>My first thoughts were, \"It can't be any worse than 'Backdraft',\" and, \"Please God, let this be better than 'Rescue Me'.\"<br/><br/>It's nice to see a show that doesn't make us all out to be lying, cheating, philandering d-bags the way \"Rescue Me\" did (although that show could always make me feel better about my own life...). This is not to say its characters are paragons of perfect virtue, but it does at least show them as worthy of the public's trust.<br/><br/>The station environment is semi-realistic. Of course, messing with the Probie/Candidate/New Hire/FNG/Boot is a time-honored tradition and rite of passage that all of us endured when we were new. However, the co-ed locker room is a stretch. Yes, we often share the same barracks with females, but we don't strip down for the shower in full view of the opposite sex. Just doesn't happen. Also, \"incidents\" like LT Severide sneaking into the gear room for a quickie with ANYBODY would result in serious disciplinary action.<br/><br/>The cast seems mostly believable to me. Eamonn Walker feels exactly like many chiefs I have known. Both LTs seem a bit young to be company officers, especially in a department like Chicago, but stranger things have been known to happen. The crews feel real enough.<br/><br/>The subplot that has LT Severide getting morphine from one of the medics is ridiculous. Every medication on an ALS ambulance is tracked, and the potentially addictive ones like morphine are watched like a hawk. They WOULD get caught, they WOULD get fired, and they WOULD do prison time for that.<br/><br/>As for the incidents, I am disappointed. The \"medics\" can't even perform basic C-spine immobilization for starters. I almost threw up in my mouth during the pilot episode when Dawson tells the little girl in the back of the wrecked car with head trauma and obvious mechanism of injury to turn her head. Any EMT student can tell you that YOU NEVER EVER DO THAT!!! I understand it's Hollywood, but come on, it's not that hard to show it done the right way. I'm a guy who has crawled inside a lot of mangled cars to pull people out; I know whereof I speak.<br/><br/>Many of the operations performed on incidents in the show are real, or at least close to it. Some people have criticized the \"slide down the charged line\" stunt. That is actually taught as a way to bail out from an upper-story window if you get trapped upstairs. I'm not so sure about suspending it from the truck's aerial the way they did it in the show. I'm an engine firefighter, and my truckie friends haven't gotten back to me on that one yet. However, I could think of at least two or three better ways to access that collapsed floor section. Some have also criticized the scene with LT Severide visiting the victim's widow to bring her his last words. I have had to comfort more new widows, orphans, and grieving parents than I care to think about, and it has kept me up at night. I don't carry my Iphone around in my turnout coat pocket, but this one is still perfectly plausible.<br/><br/>The third episode featured an overturned SUV teetering on a guardrail above a tunnel entrance with occupants trapped inside. I have experience with this type of incident (mine was on a steep hillside with the vehicle balanced on a rock). The stabilization methods they used on it would not have worked. Stabilization struts support an overturned vehicle, they don't hold it down, and placing cribbing on the guardrail would have done nothing useful that I can see. Then again, at least they sort of C-spined the kid from that wreck.<br/><br/>I'm unimpressed with the fire scenes so far. I've been inside lots of burning buildings. Most of the time, you're snake-crawling on the floor and you can't see your hand in front of your face. Multi-story apartment buildings with open stairwells can be a little different if the fire is on an upper floor, but not if you have fire established in the basement. If you take off your BA mask, you're probably going to die very quickly. If you stand straight up for more than a few seconds, your gear is going to fail and you're going to be in serious trouble. And while they did do most of the Pittsburg drill correctly to pull a downed firefighter out of the basement after the floor collapsed, they kinda forgot to pull out the other two guys who were down there, which is to say they only did part of the real operation. Also, they are way too clean. When you come out of a structure fire, you gear is filthy and so are you. You clean it when you get back to the station. So why do these guys come out looking like their turnouts just got dry-cleaned? I will give them this, they seem to be getting a little better in realism with each episode. I'm going to try to give this show a chance, as I think it's got some potential, though it certainly doesn't live up to \"Emergency!\", which to this day remains probably the most realistic Hollywood production about firefighters ever made.<br/><br/>If there's one thing I really hate about this show, it's the fact that after every episode I have to calm my fianc\u00e9e down and convince her all over again that I'm not really cheating death twelve times a day. They do try to overdramatize the job. I get that, as I can attest to the fact that it's a lot more boring in real life (isn't everything?) and nobody would be that interested in a real day on the job, so I'm trying not to hold that against them.", "rating": null, "helpful": "60 out of 73 found this helpful.", "date": "4 November 2012"}, {"title": " Excellent Show", "content": "After watching all the episode of \"Chicago P.D.\" in a one-month marathon, I decided to do the same with \"Chicago Fire\".

Chicago Fire, Chicago P.D., Chicago Med, and Chicago Justice, make up the new look of drama on NBC, and the ratings have been hotter than the show that started it all, Chicago Fire.<br/><br/>As I said the show, the story lines, and the realistic way that it's filmed are very reminiscent of Third Watch, which was one of my all-time favorite shows, however, by splitting, the Firemen, Police, and Medical personal into three shows, the story lines run deeper, and the characters and character development is much stronger.

Casey is very by the book and believes in the system, although that faith is tested on a regular basis. The other main focus is Taylor Kinney who plays Kelly Severide, who is the complete opposite of Casey. He will do anything to save lives and get to the bottom of a situation and the rule book be damned! The dynamic often causes conflict and causes people to choose sides, which further lends to the drama of the show.<br/><br/>The one negative I have is with how believable the stories are. Obviously it's a TV show and Hollywood is going to take it's liberties. The firemen are going to do things that are impossible and take risks that no one would ever take or survive if they did, but my issue is with things like the time. Someone will be injured and we'll be told they need months of rehab and could be out a year. The captain will talk about not having the money for a replacement and having to work short handed, putting the other men at risk. Then the very next episode, the injured man is back at work and cleared for duty. The actor doesn't even miss a couple of episodes, he's back the very next week. I don't know about you, but things like that bother me. Another timeline issue is involved with the crossover cameos, which don't always line-up. For example, Severide was involved in a Chicago P.D. matter, that was serious, and involved his whole family, but at the same time, there was no mention of it on Chicago Fire and it was business as usual? Obvious timeline issues aside, the action is fantastic, the story lines are gripping, the actors and actresses are as hot and exciting as the fires they are fighting, and there is a reason this is a top ten show. If you haven't started your journey into the heroes of Chicago, start at the very beginning with Chicago Fire Season 1, you won't be sorry.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "9 out of 10 found this helpful.", "date": "25 October 2016"}, {"title": " Less personal relationships and more action", "content": "I have been a fan of Chicago Fire since day one.

If Jane Austen were alive today, she'd be writing this show.  It's a great show, first and foremost, because it treats the viewer as an intelligent person and requires one to pay attention.  The rewards for doing so are the dozens of subtle jokes and pop references contained in the torrents of conversation that issue from the characters' mouths - (\"Gilmore Girls\" must have the highest words-spoken-per-minute ratio in the history of TV.)<br/><br/>The writing and acting are both superb.  The familiar setting of the small, quirky town allows for the use of many inventive plot devices, like 24-hour dance marathons, picnic basket bachelorette auctions, and vagrants who apply to become the \"official town troubadour.\"  You can even throw in a smart-mouthed kid from New York to see how he fares (maybe a tribute to \"Northern Exposure\"???)  The progression of the story is well thought-out and well paced.<br/><br/>Each actor really gets a chance to inhabit his or her role because each character, even the most peripheral, is defined by a very distinct personality and not just an occupation (e.g. hotel desk clerk.)  Thus we vividly remember sweet and shallow Shelly, mean Mrs. Kim, and shy guy Brad from Chilton even though they don't appear very often.  The principal actors are tremendous, especially Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, Liza Weil and Scott Patterson.  Ever notice the way Luke will sort of tense up/puff up his chest whenever he walks up to Lorelai's table?  That's good acting.<br/><br/>On top of all this there are three characteristics of \"Gilmore Girls\" that make it an exceptional show instead of just high quality.  In the first place, it has good drama without being either melodramatic or manipulative. Think about the way the writers handled the Jess vs. Dean issue, and compare that to \"Friends\" where we have Is-Rachel-Pregnant-Or-Not one episode, Is-Ross-The-Father-Or-Not the next, Did-Joey-Propose-Or-Not the next ad infinitum.  On \"Gilmore Girls\" the drama unfolds not according to plot formulas but the interactions of the characters.<br/><br/>Secondly, the show is female-centered without being self-consciously so or politically charged.  The main characters are female human beings, not symbols.  To whatever extent they are feminist or empowered, the show presents them as such without commenting on it, and that is refreshing.<br/><br/>Finally, \"Gilmore Girls\" takes a unique, thoughtful, and complicated view of the relationship between the generations.  It's billed as a mother-daughter show but is actually a grandmother-mother-daughter show. On most TV shows, the roles of Grandma and Mom are restricted or stereotyped, but here we have three women of a line, Emily, Lorelai, and Rory, who are made of the same material but have led VERY different lives and are trying to get along and be a family.  Occasionally one woman will step outside her role and be a Mom or Kid to one of the others.  And this is also refreshing to see on TV.<br/><br/>If you enjoy quality entertainment regardless of genre, \"Gilmore Girls\" is for you.  Enjoy it while it lasts.", "rating": null, "helpful": "213 out of 234 found this helpful.", "date": "26 February 2003"}, {"title": " A Chick Series Even Boys Could Love", "content": "I missed THE GILMORE GIRLS first season because I'm generally not interested in series television, and I'm a man in his early 50s and this is a series about a mother and a daughter, and I'm frankly not interested in WB shows which focus on a more youthful audience. However, a year of reading rave reviews of the series, got me interested in tuning in during season II. It was instant love.<br/><br/>I think this is the best series on TV, a thoughtful, funny, beautifully written and well observed show about the relationship between a loving mother and daughter. At the same time, if features the quirks and tics of a fictional town with the kind of appeal that is unrealistic, but makes us nostalgic for a sweet and picaresque hamlet that has taken the two formerly outsider main characters and claimed them as one of their own.<br/><br/>Lorelei Gilmore (the stunningly beautiful and hugely talented Lauren Graham) is a young, single mother in her early 30s who is raising her daughter, Rory (a sweetly restrained Alexis Bledel) on her own. Lorelai got pregnant when she was sixteen, dashing the ambitions of her wealthy, snobbish parents (Kelly Bishop and Edward Hermann) for a fine college and a brilliant marriage.<br/><br/>Lorelei has moved away from her parents home in Hartford, CT, taking her daughter with her to Stars Hollow, where she eventually becomes a manager of a bed and breakfast inn. Lorelai is determined to raise her daughter in a loving, if bohemian atmosphere. Most of all, she wants her daughter to be her friend and encourages this amazingly close bond. The town, composed of eccentrics and other comic types, has accepted them, watching over both women with love and affection.<br/><br/>When it becomes clear that Lorelei will need financial help in order to put her daughter into Chilton, a local private school in order to prepare her for Harvard, Lorelai swallows her pride, and hat in hand, goes begging to her parents. They agree, but on one condition. The girls are to have dinner with them at their stuff home every Friday night. Lorelei agrees.<br/><br/>This forms the basic story outline of the show. We see Rory blossom into a lovely and smart teenager. Lorelei, though responsible and a fine mother, is still a young and vibrantly sexual woman, so there are the complications of her love life, including an unfinished attraction with Luke Danes, the town's cranky, but hunky coffee shop owner (well played by Scott Patterson).<br/><br/>Lorelei's best friend, is Sookie, a cook at the inn. Rory's best bud is Lane, a gawky Korean girl who lives under the absurdly strict iron rule of her judge mental mother, who thinks Lorelei is a loose woman who should be keeping a more watchful eye on her daughter. Rory has fallen in love iwth Dean, a young man she goes to school with (before she switches to Chilton). That love suffers a number of tests, most disastrously in the third season with the arrival of Luke's nephew, Jess, who asserts his own romantic mystery.<br/><br/>Well, I'm going on and on. The entire cast is first-rate. It's fun watching series veterans, Sally Struthers and others as the townspeople. I love the pompous character of Michel, the asst.<br/><br/>manager. He's a riot. The tension between Lorelei and her mother often explodes in angry confrontations that are very real indeed (Kelly Bishop, an original CHORUS LINE cast member is outstanding).<br/><br/>But make no mistake about it. Lauren Graham is the glue that holds this show together. Sexy, funny, she handles the smart dialog with all those cultural references like a virtuoso. She deserves to be a movie star. P.S.

'Gilmore Girls' has to be the only quality show on WB and one of the few on television in general. It's about the relationship between a mother and daughter in a small town in Connecticut. Lorelai Gilmore had Rory when she was 16 and ran away from her uptight, old money parents to start her own life independently as a maid at an inn and then working her way up to general manager. Their relationship is more like a sister relationship than a parent-child relationship. The townspeople only add charm to the show.<br/><br/>'Gilmore Girls' is an intelligent show with quick, witty dialogue that often refers to literature, music, movies, and pop culture. The characters talk extremely fast, which can be quite unrealistic sometimes when in a span of five seconds, two people can create comebacks for each other that contain references to Shakespeare and Madonna. But c'mon, it's just a show, and the point of the fast-paced dialogue and references is for the entertainment of audiences. We watch the show, hear the dialogue and laugh hard because we know what they're talking about. It's what makes 'The Simpsons' enjoyable, and the same can be applied to 'Gilmore Girls'. We know that such a quirky place as Stars Hollow most likely doesn't exist, but we watch it for the admiration for a dedicated single mother, hard-working daughter, and their minds that are abundant with intelligent and witty remarks about everything from Billy Bob Thornton to Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>Give it a try.

And not teen pop bunk adorable, but as in they're easy to love. I was surprised by the quality of the series, considering it's on the WB. It's intelligent, creative, and sophisticated in an everyday way. And even though this show has enough sarcasm to give you heartburn (it's fueled by sarcasm, in double digit gallons) the characters are fleshed out and live an alternate lifestyle that may be foreign, but is completely believable. These aren't people who live stereotyped mid class American TV lives, they live like the people next door, but like the strange people next door. They're those specially chosen eccentrics, small town hicks, artists, and snobs who are so full of quirks and idiosyncrasies they tend to make our lives colorful.<br/><br/>And this show is about characters and how they relate to each other. The crux of the show is the relationship between the close in age coffee addict mother (Loralai, played by the fantastic Lauren Graham) and daughter (Rory, beautifully played by Alexis Bledel) who have an unusually close knit, and witty, relationship. The two are an eccentric pair,  they live for each other and pay no heed to those who sneer upon them and indulge in their wacky Bohemian-ness. They eat at Luke's Diner for breakfast and order economy size platters of Chinese food from Al's House of Pancakes. Rory likes chaperones, Loralai intrinsically trusts her daughter.<br/><br/>When Rory is accepted to a posh prep school (which she doesn't care for, but deals with because, quite simply, she has a higher IQ than most of the town and wants to get to Harvard) paid for by her incorrigible and borderline personality grandmother  (another recurring character), her mother has to take a job she doesn't want at a first class hotel, and thus a whole passel of problems and dilemmas occur. Long term plot lines gracefully combine with town occurrences, scandals, gossip, etc, and create a show with as much flavor and pizzazz as Stars Hollow can take.<br/><br/>And where the sarcasm and one liners, bizarre scenarios and crazy happenings flow freely there's always an underlying riptide that surfaces quickly here and there, and the tensions that arise can become especially pungent because we're allowed to be close to the characters. For example, in one episode Rory accidentally falls asleep next to her boyfriend late one night while they were both reading a book together, and next morning they are found by Miss Patty (the fabulously fabulous Liz Torres who is also from \"American Family\"), nothing had happened, Rory is completely innocent, but Loralai is worried when she's alerted that she hadn't come home and receives the call that they had been found together. Rory's grandmother jumps to conclusions and starts harshly saying that Rory has ruined her life just the way Loralai had, but her mother adamantly sticks up for her. Yet when Rory comes in, they have an explosive fight, with Rory crushed that her mother didn't trust or believe her.<br/><br/>And yet situations with even a slight potential for sugaryness are resolved with lightning fast dialogue a la `Philadelphia Story'. The fact that they're close is already there, anything else feels wrong. This is the genius of the show's writing and acting. All said, whether during revealing moments of emotion or poignancy, or the standard rib cracking, fire crackling wit and sarcasm, this show gets under your skin and refuses to let go.

Rory's boyfriends are all incredibly hot as are her friend Lane's. basically it's a cool, funny, very satisfying show which encompasses all the aspects of life and gives you a feeling of -if you work hard enough and wait patiently, you'll get what you want even if it wasn't what you intended.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "52 out of 69 found this helpful.", "date": "3 September 2007"}, {"title": " Welcome to their little corner of the world.", "content": "\"Gilmore Girls\" (like Leonard Maltin, I usually like to use the title as it appears on screen, but we'll forego the nomenclature \"Gilmore girls\") is one of those shows that positive word of mouth and the \"You know, this does seem like a good show\" vibe from hearing about it made me want to get a look at; the series has finally started UK airings on Nickelodeon, a strange choice for the channel - it's certainly comedic, but it's more of a comedy-drama than the usual stuff that's on Nick. (Plus, unlike all its regular shows it's an hour series.)<br/><br/>My rule of thumb is that if a series doesn't encourage me to keep watching by its third episode, it won't do so after its thirtieth; Amy Sherman-Palladino's series passed by the end of the first one. A number of viewers have commented that the dialogue isn't too realistic, and Lorelei Gilmore is certainly so quick with the witty repartee you wonder why she's not a stand-up comic instead of managing an inn (possibly a clue as to why one of the companies involved is called Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions?), but it does have the saving grace of actually being funny... something that can't be said for a lot of official comedies.<br/><br/>\nWhat helps the series work so far, apart from the dialogue, is the characters - just as \"M*A*S*H\"'s laugh track was kept out of the operating room even in the American broadcasts (it was initially broadcast in the UK sans track), the relationships between Lorelei and Lorelei (that's Rory - in the pilot we learned that she was named after her mother) aren't actually played for gags endlessly, and her mother's certainly strong but not a bitch, the way the makers could have easily done. No one in the show so far is truly bad or good, which bodes well, and the bond between mother and daughter is a rare thing for TV - they're both relatives and true friends without making you want to vomit, not a common thing in family dramas.<br/><br/>We're about three years behind the WB, and I'm looking forward to catching up with the Gilmores and their friends (it's impossible not to symapthise with Rory's best friend in particular, what with her health-food-obsessed/antique-selling mother).

Please help me....", "content": "Looking for something new to watch, I perused the ratings of various television shows and noticed that the \"Gilmore Girls\" had an astonishingly high 8.6 rating and was intrigued. I came to the show with absolutely no preconceptions The title indicated it might be a \"chick show\", though was not discouraged as I loved Buffy the Vampire Slayer and appreciate shows featuring strong female characters. So, I managed to find a copy of the first season, and set about watching it. From there, it was all downhill.<br/><br/>The first few episodes were by and large exposition, introducing the ensemble cast and the relationships among them. Center stage are the titular Gilmore Girls -- mother, Loreli and daughter, Rory. They are depicted as best friends, and more often than not, Rory as the voice of reason contrasted to her over-the-top, pop-culture-referencing, care-free, dare-to-be-different clich\u00e9 of a mother. At first blush, the script seemed witty, the banter playful. But, after about three episodes, the style became forced and horribly contrived. Loreli's inability to provide a straight answer or simple declarative sentence under virtually every circumstance quickly turns from endearing to irritating.<br/><br/>Though the show's writer would have us embrace her as a free-thinking, independent woman, that facade quickly breaks down, and any sentient being watching sees her as little more than a selfish, vain, egotistical spoiled rich girl, who demands to be the center of everyone's attention. She demeans those who do not share her free-spirited world view, dismissing them as droll conformists who cannot appreciate her off-beat demeanor. She despises her parents, a wealthy insurance executive and his socialite wife, ridiculing them mercilessly and mocking them for their shallow need of respectability. But, her disapproval of them does not interfere with her turning to them for money when Rory is accepted to an exclusive private school. One need not be a PhD. in literature to spot the dripping irony of Loreli not only asking for the money from those she abhors, BUT for the purpose of sending Rory to a school that institutionalizes all that Loreli stands against. To stack the deck on her side, her parents are depicted as stodgy dullards, who have never resolved themselves with Loreli for getting knocked up at 16, and running away from home and have her child alone. (As an aside, Loreli's mother, Emily, though very much flawed, stands out as the only genuinely compelling and sympathetic character, as she struggles with her obvious mixed emotions for her ungrateful and overbearing daughter.) But, Loreli now puts up with their intrusive behavior in exchange for some quick cash. Free-spirited, indeed.<br/><br/>What is most appalling about show (and there is a lot of competition) is its depiction of men as either spineless, unreliable, effeminate, wimpy, or imbecilic, or all of the above. I appreciate a TV series or movie that features strong female characters that defy the brainless-bimbo-mold that makes up the lion's share of the women we see on TV. Smart, independent women are hot. It was one of the things that made Buffy such great television. However, in order to elevate the female characters, it does not require that you denigrate or marginalize all their male counterparts. The male character are clearly the creation of writers who demonstrate a profound lack of understanding of the male mind, or, worse, a deep-seated loathing of men in general. Not one male character is admirable, and all are reduced to little more than sounding boards for the unbearably whiny Loreli. Loreli's attitude towards this collection of eunuchs is, at best, dismissive, and, at worst, abusive. In one particularly egregious incident, in a display of monumental bad judgment, she begins an affair with Rory's teacher, then after breaking up with him, she entices him back with words of love and respect and promises of commitment. In no time, she impetuously agrees to marry him -- a decision based entirely on her fear of losing him and having nothing to do with love...again, what a free-thinker. However, the day of their wedding, Loreli suddenly panics at the prospect of sharing her life with this gutless panty-waist (the source of her panic is, it turns out, that up until the night before her wedding, she never gave thought to the fact they would live under the same roof, and, now, is repelled by the idea...bright girl...) and, being the free-spirit for whom convention will not suffice, she skipped town with Rory without so much as a word of explanation to her betrothed, the wedding guests and those who worked diligently to arrange the reception...including among them, her BEST FRIEND! And, of course, the writers have kindly presented the rough-edged, plaid-flannel-and-backwards-baseball-cap sportin', tactiturn, though deeply soulful local diner owner as the Sam to Loreli's Diane, in one of the least compelling \"will they or won't they\" story lines ever hatched in Clich\u00e9 World.<br/><br/>In the case of Rory, her love interests have included a narcissistic, self-destructive preppy, a whipped townie whose most salient quality is his mistrustful attitude and soul-crushing neediness (whom, incidentally, pure and holy Rory lies to on a regular basis in order to hide her true feelings for another....seems the apple really doesn't fall far from the tree...), and a broken-home-bred bad boy who is equally at ease vandalizing property as he is quoting Steinbeck and Kerouac. You see, Rory is the only person in town who can see the true beauty of the aforementioned bad boy, ne'er do well, and, as we are so earnestly led to believe, she can tame his restless heart and draw forth the true potential that lies within.<br/><br/>And here is the part of the show that I find most troublesome: even though I hate most of the main characters, think the writing is contrived and the stories simple-minded clich\u00e9, find the depiction of men deplorable...despite all that...I can't stop watching the damn thing!

Hell, you can't get from Culiacan to Mazatlan in less than two hours, and they're connected by major highways. Then, in one episode, someone says \"there's only one road to Mexico\"... from Texas?

(And afterwards the actors who do a great job!)<br/><br/>THUMBS DOWN FOR THE FOLLOWING ACTORS:<br/><br/>1. Sonequa Martin-Green as Michael Burnham is a drama queen and cries way too much. She is far too intense and overacts in situations where a relaxed smile would have been better. After 2 seasons it's clear that she isn't up to the lead character of Star Trek Discovery. Her role as the main character should be more subtle and there isn't any chemistry when she interacts with the other crew members/actors. It seems forced. She's the show's main problem because the crew revolves around her, but she's not likeable, a Mary Sue and hasn't managed to earn respect and gain any real authority over the last two seasons. It's hard to say it that clear but the failing of Star Trek Discovery is due to Sonequa Martin-Greens bad acting performance as the lead and also her incapacity to step back and let other actors and characters shine.<br/><br/>2. Mary Wiseman as Tilly just isn't believable as an ensign. It is very hard to accept that in this position on a spaceship you are so confused and unfocused. Her acting is mediocre which makes it even worse.<br/><br/>3. Anthony Rapp as Paul Stamets is painful to look at - he's boring and his facial expressions are almost always the same: worried and compassionate.<br/><br/>4. Wilson Cruz as Dr. Hugh Culber is the most boring and uninteresting doctor in Star Trek history. Where are the rough edges, where is the personality?

Now, if you're more into action films, avoid this at all costs - but if you like amazing performances and dark, brooding cinema peppered with some black humour and a slight psychedelic touch, you're going to love this. The atmosphere and the southern ambiance of this show are so rich and the cinematography is so beautiful, I can hardly think of anything in recent TV-history that compares to this. To make a musical analogy: if the crazy, creative energy of 'Breaking Bad' felt like 'Led Zeppelin', this feels more like 'The Doors'. The slow, bluesy, hypnotic pulse of this show draws you in and hooks you - and then it doesn't let go. By the way, the original music is also excellent (T-Bone Burnett) and fits the mood perfectly. <br/><br/>As far as the actors are concerned, there's nothing but great performances. Even the smaller parts are perfectly cast and the two leads: wow, just - wow! Harrelson (freshly returned from 'The Hunger Games'), plays the \"normal\", more down to earth character, while McConaughey (still marked by his own personal hunger games) nails the part of his slightly mad, highly intelligent but nihilistic and severely depressed partner. Watching them play off each other (again, after 'Edtv' and 'Surfer, Dude') while their conflicted - and conflicting - characters try to solve a ritual murder is so captivating (and so much fun) I honestly don't care that much if they are ever going to solve that crime.<br/><br/>So for the moment, I'm giving this 10 stars (I can still take back a few if it all goes downhill from here), because in my opinion, there wasn't a single note out of key so far. The writing is top notch, and if the creative team behind this can keep it up, this could turn out to be HBO's next 'Wire' in terms of quality. Cary Fukunaga ('Sin Nombre','Jane Eyre'), who will hopefully one day adapt Stephen King's 'It', proves once more that he's a very accomplished director and a talent to look out for in the future. <br/><br/>My verdict: if you like a well told, character driven story (that might lead you to some very dark places) and if you're not put off by a rather considerate pace, I can't recommend this show enough - this is some great television.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/", "rating": 10, "helpful": "968 out of 1,083 found this helpful.", "date": "13 January 2014"}, {"title": " Matthew McConaughey OWNS this gem!", "content": "If you want to skip this review just jump to the IMDb list of awards and nominations, and you're done.<br/><br/>If you want the skinny, let me say this is one of the most perfect dramas ever to grace your flat screen.<br/><br/>Harrelson, you need to understand, is no slouch.

But now i am addicted to it.<br/><br/>With 2 more episodes of the season to go , one can only expect the best from this fast-paced , beautifully crafted show.<br/><br/>So far, an obvious 10/10.<br/><br/>Final update: ( Episode 7 &amp; 8 )-- Well the series ended last night on a very thoughtful note. Up until the 7th episode, the show had picked up so much speed and given us so much to think about that i was expecting a little too much from the last couple of episodes. Who wasn't.<br/><br/>*********** If you haven't seen the series , please Don't read on*********<br/><br/>The 7th episode was truly amazing as it set the stage for Rust and Marty's final adventure of the series. There was too much anticipation for the final episode, but did it deliver. Yes and No, depending entirely on how you look at it. There were no unusual shocking twists and there were no unrealistic happenings. It was quiet a daring and a brilliant end to a show that explored beyond any other show's reach. But to be very honest, as a single episode , the finale wont stand out. But as an entire series , i believe we have been treated to one of the best television series ever made. The writing and direction have been top notch. Acting has been flawless.

I'm not a particular fan of crime mysteries, but I figured I'd give the show a shot. After all, IMDb ratings had been pretty reliable in giving me an idea of good a show would be. I thoroughly enjoyed Season 1. In fact, I'd say it's one of the best pieces of television I've ever seen. Yes, one of those rare masterpieces that stick out from the usual assembly of cheesy sitcoms and thrillers.<br/><br/>Season 1 verdict: If I had to give only season 1 a rating, I would give it a 9/10 with no hesitation, and possibly even a 10/10. The show was everything I had hoped for and more.<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was excited for season 2. I waited for the entire show to air so that I could binge watch it without having to wait a week between episodes. I eagerly turned on the first episode of season 2, but as the episode dragged on it became apparent that this episode was a real let down. It was a series of of plots that all seemed to have no relation to each other. It was hard to even follow what was going on. \"Hey, that's okay\" I said to myself. I figured it was just a necessary lackluster episode that would set the stage for all of the glory of True Detective that I knew and loved. Instead, I continued to be disappointed by episode after episode. Sadly, it became very clear that Season 2 sucks. I don't use that word too often, unless it's warranted, but in this case it surely is. During the middle of episode 4 of Season 2 I just turned it off. It was so poor that I couldn't even watch it anymore. I came back the next morning hoping to try again and got the same result. Season 2 is basically unwatchable.<br/><br/>Most of Season 2 involves a few seriously depressed brooding alcoholics staring at each other with sad serious faces uttering dark cheesy lines like \"Those moments, they stare back at you, you don't remember them, they remember you\". I mean, come on, really? The whole thing is just cheesy and I lost all interest in the problems of these people. I want to give Vince Vaughn some credit here, because he did some fantastic acting, but that couldn't come close to redeeming this season.<br/><br/>Season 2 verdict: Don't even bother with season 2 unless you like being disappointed.

But the cast surely isn't complete without the irritable family dog Brian, the lovable and psychotic football shaped head baby Stewie, and their spooner street neighbors: the hilarious hornball Glenn Quagmire, the physically crippled (yet hostile) Joe Swanson, the charming Cleveland Brown, the creepy John Herbert, and the extraordinary nerdy Goldman family. However, don't you worry. As a longtime fan of Seth Macfarlane's work, I have certainly formed my own thoughts of this brutally over the top parody of a cartoon.<br/><br/>One extra topic I would be a lunatic to ignore is how consistently stellar the production value has remained throughout the course of airing that the cartoon has undergone since its inception. Regardless of how you feel about the shift in comedic values that the series has brought to us all over the years, you can't deny that all of the staff have been passionate and devoted to this form of art since the beginning. The value in the voice acting and animation have never seem to spiral downward, despite the universally agreed shift in the writing quality over the years. The soundtrack is also brilliant, as it pays homage towards jazz music, and it has successfully defined the mood of this show for the last two decades.<br/><br/>Each season is basically an entirely different program, so they all get their own individual scores:<br/><br/>1 - 3: Extremely fun, faced paced cartoon comedy that can be entertaining for anyone, including even children. Intelligent humor and slapstick mash together like bread and butter in every episode. It's a shame that Family Guy got canceled once in 2000, and again in 2002, because this show had something to truly offer for everyone. The biggest highlights of the first 3 seasons include \"Road To Rhode Island\", \"Emission Impossible\", \"A Hero Sits Next Door\", \"Da Boom\", \"Road To Europe\", and \"Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington\". 9/10<br/><br/>4 - 5: Improved animation and edgier humor make this time period a gold mine for teens and young adults, but there's still plenty of smart humor in episodes such as \"PTV\" and \"Road To Rupert\". However, the wackier humor became wackier than ever before, and the casual family episodes in these seasons are witty and hilarious in classic Family Guy fashion. Seasons 4 and 5 is when the show truly peaked in quality in my eyes and when it had something to offer for everyone. There's not a whole lot more to add in this paragraph, the fantastic episodes speak for themselves. 10/10<br/><br/>6 - 9: The popularity peak of the show and when it's humor became more controversial than ever. Cutaways became more extreme and the jokes became increasingly politically charged and even mean spirited. Episodes like \"420\", \"Dial Meg For Murder\", \"Quagmire's Dad\", and \"Family Gay\" contain some of FG's most extreme humor and morales. Hell, the specials were getting more intelligent as well, with phenomenal special episodes such as \"Blue Harvest\", \"Road To The Multiverse\", and \"And Then There Were Fewer\". Overall, the show had declined a bit in comedic value for the most part, but it still contains all the fun, wacky madness the Family Guy is known for. 8/10<br/><br/>10 - present: This particular era is where most of the negative reception that this show has comes from. The show's mean spirited nature became increasingly repetitive and tasteless, and the characters became much less likable overtime as a result. Peter's mean spirited behavior makes many modern FG episodes completely unwatchable in my eyes. However, that's not to say that this season didn't have its moments. Particularly \"Back To The Pilot\" is quite an epic tale of time travel, starring the show's most likeable characters Stewie and Brian. Hell, I even enjoyed the simpsons crossover in season 13. 5/10<br/><br/>My overall rating for this show is an 8/10. Bashing Family Guy is extremely cliche and distasteful in this day and age, especially considering how much it revolutionized this generation's sense of humor in both good and bad ways. Statistically speaking, if you've ever been into cartoons, there's a good chance you've been at least hooked on Family Guy once. And whether you love it or loathe it, it'll always contain a special place in cartoon history.<br/><br/>Essential episodes of this cartoon include \"Road To The Multiverse\", \"Road To Rhode Island\", \"Patriot Games\", \"Da Boom\", \"Stew-roids\", \"I Dream Of Jesus\", \"PTV\", \"And Then There Were Fewer\", \"Petarded\", \"A Hero Sits Next Door\", \"Stewie Kills Lois\", \"Lois Kills Stewie\", \"Blue Harvest\", \"Something, Something, Something, Dark Side\", \"It's a Trap!\", \"Stewie Loves Lois\", \"Death Has A Shadow\", \"Emission Impossible\", \"North by North Quahog\", \"Meet The Quagmires\", \"Brian And Stewie\", \"Play It Again, Brian\", \"420\", \"Back To The Pilot\", \"Peter's Daughter\", \"To Live And Die In Dixie\", \"Road To Europe\", \"Mr. Griffin Goes to Washington\", and \"Baby Not On Board\".

The once very promising series is beginning to wear down however as season 5 was full of very dull and humourless episodes and i believe it is because of Ricky Blitt temporarily leaving the show to do The Winner which coincidentally flopped. Seasons 1-4 have been as pleasure and the first six or so episodes of Season 5 as well but only time will tell if this series stays as consistently funny as it's almost always been.<br/><br/>Many criticize it and claim it as a Simpsons rip off which is totally inaccurate and unfair. Homer Simpson is a dim witted easy angered character while Peter Griffin is a pop culture obsessed moron who always means well. Marge Simpson is an intelligent, nagging, wife while Lois Griffin is a good hearted mother whose party girl side is always emerging. Bart Simpson is a little hell-raiser who loves to cause trouble and pull pranks while Chris Griffin is a slow, dopey, lummox. Lisa Simpson is an intelligent, kind, liberal while Meg Griffin is a self pitying, neglected, border line suicidal loser. Maggie Simpson doesn't speak or do much throughout the show while Stewie Griffin is a quick witted baby bent on world domination with a lot of homosexual tendencies. The shows are very different and share few similarities.<br/><br/>The show revolves around family and the struggles and over the top things that occur throughout their daily lives. The humour is totally random with irrelevant and hysterical flashback sequences occurring throughout the episode and contains a ton of satire that is both offensive and true.<br/><br/>Seth MacFarlane reminds me of Quentin Tarantino with the way he pays homage to things he loved or remembers growing up and the pop culture references will make you think \"oh yeah i remember that\".

He deserves his two Emmy's for providing the voice of evil baby genius Stewie. Adam West also steals the show with his funny and completely insane regular character the mayor of Quahog.

At first it all appears relatively routine, even - as many have accused - a ripe-off of \"The Simpsons\". Fat, child-like, head of household Peter Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane) screws things up while dotting wife Lois (Alex Borstein), put-upon daughter Meg (Mila Kunis) and genetic copy Chris (Seth Green) look on. Also in the mix is genius, homicidal infant Stewie (MacFarlene) - one of the most deserving break-out characters in TV history - and Brian, the family's talking dog.<br/><br/>If the characters sound like clich\u00e9s, that's the point. MacFarlane uses them simply as vessels and with the show regurgitates every pop culture childhood memory to create a full-length parody of 70s and 80s sitcoms. Even better than a parody, a satire. Just as Archie Bunker was a product of the 50s being imposed on by a changing 70s culture, \"Family Guy\" is about the new millennial values juxtaposed on sitcom camp of the last century. In MacFarlane's world there are child molesters on \"Lost in Space\" and \"Eight is Enough\" actually refers to disciplinary beatings.<br/><br/>Yes, \"The Simpsons\" have covered similar ground, with a particular emphasis on random flashbacks and fantasy scenes. But with \"The Simpsons\" in a creative tailspin for the last decade, MacFarlane and crew swoop in to fill this gaping void. To out-Simpson \"The Simpsons\" if you will. What MacFarlane brings to the table is pitch-perfect comic timing - an ability to know how quick to cut or how long to drag out a particular bit to get the laugh. As well as utter fearlessness. From bits in which Jesus Christ turns water \"into funk\" or a TV parody \"Gumble 2 Gumble: Beach Justice\" staring Greg and Bryant Gumble as bicycle cops, \"Guy\" isn't just one of the funniest things to grace TV, it was freakin' brilliant. This breaks from are more often like an animated version of \"The Far Side\", then \"The Simpsons\".<br/><br/>Then it was canceled only to be renewed at the 11th hour. And then it was canceled again, brought back supposedly by strong DVD sales. But given the networks ownership of the show and how Fox beat to death the equally strong \"Futurama\", it's hard to buy that. This constant shakeup has got to take a toll on a series' rhythm. When the show returned for a 3rd season it felt lacking of something. As if the network notes to \"slow the pace\", \"tone down the fantasy scenes\" and \"thicken the story lines\" were rigidly being followed when the breaking of these rules was what made the show great in the first place. Still it contained classics like \"Emission: Impossible\", \"The Thin White Line\", \"Road to Rhode Island\" and \"Brian Wallows, Peter's Swallows\" to keep us satisfied.<br/><br/>Upon the 2nd return, giving us seasons 4, 5 and beyond, the show has completely lost it's footing. After a LONG agonizing wait, the 4th season premiere is a disappointing \"North by Northwest\"/\"Passion of the Christ\" parody. The rest of the season follows suit in which only \"PTV\", the show's satire of the TV ratings system, recaptures it's prior lunacy. MacFarlane makes the crucial mistake here, actually wanting us to care about them. Given that they where envisioned as clich\u00e9s in the first place, putting the weight of a story on their backs only shows how lacking the show is for character depth. Even Stewie, once a source for huge laughs, is stripped down to a single latent homosexuality joke. The show gets story heavy where it shouldn't. Slows down when it should speed up. Goes broad when it should go cult. Gets political and angry when it should be mindless escapism. \"Family Guy\" was about velocity, randomness and obscure 1% gags.<br/><br/>I won't go as far as to say that \"Family Guy\" beyond seasons 4 and 5 is proof that a dead show should probably remain dead. But it is proof that a show can't go through constant cancellations and reshuffling and remain intact. It also suffers from the same fate that has plagued \"The Simpsons\". It is full of itself. It has become lazy in a belief that it can do no wrong in the eyes of it's fans. \"Family Guy\", in many ways, has sold out. It isn't the acerbic TV rebel it used to be. It is now part of the system itself<br/><br/>\"Guy's\" humor has a masterful ability to appeal to \"Star Trek\" nerds and drunken frat boys alike. And it is hard to deny the TV geek in my doesn't flip out when they do something half of either audience won't get like weave a \"Star Wars\" joke into a \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" reference. But the show's die-hard legions of fans (some damn near sycophantic over the show's brilliance) have allowed it to be lazy and complacent and paved the way for MacFarlane's head to slide right up his own posterior. In some ways he deserves it, the show can still be very, very funny.

With the 1990s containing a wealth of clever, surreal cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life among other fine cartoons(Yes, this includes Spongebob).All had quirky, dreamlike animation and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialog. The Simpsons became an outright phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its biggest defenders claim it to be, but a very fine investment of your time and certainly dismisses the false axiom that all TV is junk. South Park started out as a crude but hilarious attack on everything with unique and intelligent satire underneath. It evolved to become a Monty Python- esquire show with outrageous concepts and brutally swift and sharp societal critiques(Such as their defense of the noble underpants gnomes) and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and \"meta\" like the Simpsons did, and has unfortunately jumped the shark. Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. It pushes buttons and is a favorite among college students and bestiality enthusiasts. However, what it has in loquacity it lacks in true wit.<br/><br/>The show is famous for its use of gimmicks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms or commercials. Some are funny(Especially from the first two seasons), most are not. Are references inherently funny? I'm not sure, but they are mostly what the show stands on considering that its characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have charm, and Cartman has an artillery of self awareness and pure outrageousness to back up his awful behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. He's just a loud, obnoxious pig. Anything funny coming from his character is only because the writers forget how to be unfunny that day. Lois is also very shallow and dull; Meg is a prop, only to be abused; Chris is borderline retarded and only occasionally funny, and the two main stars of the show(Stewie and Brian) are so inconsistent in their characterizations that it all really kind of pointless.<br/><br/>Other gimmicks I can't stand are when a character points to something obviously and lingers on it for an uncomfortably long time. This happens a lot lately, and I can't bear it any longer. Not just the oft mentioned chicken that likes to beat Peter up, I'm talking about the painful moments where they talk about pop culture and prod it as if they are alien spectators. That's not wit or even ironic humor, it's totally boring and lifeless.<br/><br/>Not that the show can't be funny, in fact some of the earlier episodes had me rolling. Highlights include the pilot episode, where Peter loses touch with reality after losing his precious television; when Peters religious zealot father shows up and wreaks havoc; When Peter becomes a narc at Megs school, and the \"pancake\" episode. I suspect these are the episodes that accidentally incorporated actual human traits in its characters, or merely were times the writers had actual comedic inspiration.<br/><br/>One last thing, the show is not offensive.

It didn't help matters that one of the earliest episodes, \"The Naked Now\" was a superficial retread of the classic \"The Naked Time\" from '66. The new episode should have served as a way of spotlighting several of the new crew, but all it did was show them all in heat. I wasn't too impressed. What did work was keeping the central theme of exploration (something lost in the offshoots, DS9 &amp; Voyager). The new Enterprise was twice as large as the original, with about a thousand personnel aboard. Capt. Picard (Stewart) was a more cerebral, diplomatic version of the ultimate explorer we had known as Capt. Kirk. Again, Picard wasn't too impressive in the first two awkward seasons, as some may mistake his caution for weakness. The Kirk-like first officer Riker (Frakes) was controlled by Picard, so the entire crew of Enterprise-D came across as a bit too civilized, too complacent for their own good. It's interesting that this complacency was fractured by the most memorable episode of the first two years, \"Q Who?\" which introduced The Borg. All of a sudden, exploration was not a routine venture.<br/><br/>Other memorable episodes of the first 2 years: the double-length pilot, introducing Q; \"Conspiracy\"-an early invasion thriller; \"Where No One Has Gone Before\"-an ultimate attempt to define the exploring theme; \"The Big Goodbye\"-the first lengthy exploration of the new holodeck concept; \"Datalore\"-intro of Data's evil twin; \"Skin of Evil\"-death of Tasha Yar; \"11001001\"-perhaps the best holodeck story; and \"The Measure of a Man\"-placing an android on trial. Except for \"Q Who\" the 2nd year was even more of a letdown from the first. Space started to percolate in the 3rd season. I liked \"The Survivors\"-introducing an entity resembling Q in a depressed mood, and \"Deja Q\" with both Q &amp; Guinan squaring off, as well as other alien beings. A remaining drawback was the 'techno-babble' hindering many scripts, an aspect which made them less exciting than the stories of the original series. As Roddenberry himself believed, when characters spoke this way, it did not come across as naturalistic, except maybe when it was Data (Spiner), the android. The engineer La Forge (Burton), for example, was usually saddled with long, dull explanatory dialog for the audience.<br/><br/>In the 3rd year, truly innovative concepts such as the far-out parallel-universe adventure \"Yesterday's Enterprise\" began to take hold, topped by the season-ender \"The Best of Both Worlds,part 1\" in which The Borg returned in their first try at assimilating Earth. After this and the 2nd part, the TNG show was off and running, at full warp speed. There are too many great episodes from the next 4 seasons to list here, but I tended to appreciate the wild, cosmic concept stories best: \"Parallels\"(s7); \"Cause and Effect\"(s5); \"Timescape\"(s6); \"Tapestry\"(s6); and the scary \"Frame of Mind\", \"Schisms\" and \"Genesis.\" There's also the mind-blowing \"Inner Light\"(s5), \"Conundrum\" and \"Ship in a Bottle\"(s6), \"Second Chances.\" The intense 2-parter \"Chain of Command\" was almost like a film, and the great return of Scotty in \"Relics\" was very entertaining, though it showed you can't go home again. The show also continued to tackle uneasy social issues, as in \"The Host\", \"The Outcast\", \"First Contact\" and \"The Drumhead\" as well as political:\"Darmok\", \"Rightful Heir\", \"Face of the Enemy\" and \"The Pegasus.\" The series ended on a strong note, \"All Good Things...\" a double-length spectacular with nearly the budget of a feature film. But it wasn't really the end. A few months later, an actual feature film was released \"Star Trek Generations\"(94).

Roddenberry decided to make the new series with few connections to the original, so that it could stand on its own. Many fans didn't like the idea of new characters, but Roddenberry pressed ahead, and Star Trek: The Next Generation was born. British stage actor Patrick Stewart assumed the role of Frenchman Captain Jean-Luc Picard, bringing gravitas, phenomenal acting skills, and an English accent that would become the boon of many jokes; Jonathon Frakes became William T. Riker, the Kirk-esque \"Number One\" with a love for the ladies and jazz; Brent Spiner was cast as Data, the android who envied human emotion; Gates McFadden was Dr. Beverly Crusher, the CMO with a complicated past with Captain Picard; Wil Wheaton was her irritating son Wesley, who would long annoy the fans; Michael Dorn brought a distinct presence to the recurring role of Klingon officer Worf, so much that he was promoted to regular. Marina Sirtis looked good as Deanna Troi, the psychiatrist who had once been involved with Riker; LeVar Burton was cast as Geordi LaForge, the blind Conn Officer; finally, Denise Crosby was Security Chief Tasha Yar.

The series gathered its own following, although it continued to exist in the shadow of TOS. Q became an ongoing presence, appearing twice more after the pilot. His third appearance had him introducing the crew to the Borg, the fearsome cyborgs who would become Trek's most famous villains. Denise Crosby left TNG near the end of the first year, saying that her character wasn't being given enough to do. The producers also removed Gates McFadden's Dr. Crusher, introducing Dr. Kate Pulaski (Diana Muldaur) to induce more conflict. The fans did not take to Pulaski, so McFadden was brought back for the start of Season Three. That season was when TNG really came into its own, ending with the reappearance of the Borg. The Borg abducted Captain Picard, and turned him into one of them; Riker, now in command, gave the order to destroy the Borg Cube, while Picard was still onboard. That was the greatest cliffhanger in TV history, and TNG received a great deal of media attention as a result. Droves of new viewers tuned in for the fourth season premiere, which many perceived as a bit of a letdown after all the hype; but the viewers stayed, and TNG soared in the ratings, producing more and more quality episodes.

Data is a unique character, his interaction with the captain (and the rest of the crew) is uniquely enjoyable, often giving insights into the evolution of human ethics, as for example in an episode where Captain Piccard is called to support the view that Data is a conscious life form and thus has the right to decide for his own fate; that he cannot be considered as property, even though he is a human construct. You really never know where the next episode will take you...from MacBeth to Cyrano, or from Data's love affair to the first contact with the crystaline entity, or Sherlock Holmes mysteries. Truly, I have never seen any other series with such a broad range of ideas and references. I wish to thank all those who made it possible, and Patrick Stewart for adding such a dramatic depth to his role. Truly, in no other case has an actor in TV done such a great job at combining so diverse elements in a single character, and with so superb acting...Patrick Stewart really carries you away with his acting, it is epic to say the least.

The show also deals with a great amount of philosophical ideas and moral issues.  The character of Data is a perfect example of that.  is he self aware?  Or is he just an emotionless machine?  I've always leaned towards the former...Brent Spiner does a wonderful job of giving a slight little hint of emotion that really makes you feel for the character and makes you doubt that he's nothing more than just a machine, and makes you question, just what is sentience? These are the kind of wonderful themes this show deals with.  I'm not a big fan of TV in general...and there's very little on that will actually grasp my attention.

In action how like an Angel! in apprehension how like a god!\" But he delivers it with conviction instead of irony, and by doing so creates the thesis of the entire franchise.<br/><br/>Star Trek was never meant to be a realistic depiction of what the future will be like; rather, it's an optimistic argument for what the future could be like. Our heroes on the new Starship Enterprise are noble and rational, and the writing is more concerned with ethics than with punch-ups. Fans of Captain Kirk's red-blooded man of action might be disappointed, but then this is a more mature version of Star Trek. As we mature, we realize there are better ways to solve our problems than with violence. Patrick Stewart's Shakespearean captain is a renaissance man, capable of using the right words and unexpected actions to overcome obstacles, and he needs neither a hairpiece nor a fight scene to prove his character.<br/><br/>The show's other standout star is the android Data, Spock's opposite yet kindred spirit. Where Spock repressed his emotions and was disdainful of illogical humans, Data is curious about our foibles and aspires to be more like us. That implies that being human is not a curse, but something wonderful and virtuous.<br/><br/>There are no space wars in The Next Generation, and for a good reason: creator Gene Roddenberry hoped that by the 24th century war would be a thing of the past.

It's funny TNG wound up so brilliant, considering the first two seasons were a bit iffy in terms of quality. The show ended up the ultimate representation of Star Trek, with an immensely engaging crew with a great sense of camaraderie, intelligent and intriguing stories, and special effects that were excellent by television standards.<br/><br/>With the exception of Wil Wheaton, the cast was uniformly superb. Patrick Stewart had a lot to live up to as a successor to William Shatner's Kirk. With his magnetic presence and wonderful acting chops, he's crafted a very different individual from Kirk, and probably my favorite Trek character, period.  Jonathan Frakes made for a likeable, intriguing Commander Riker, who's occasional rowdiness reminded me a bit of good old Kirk. Brent Spiner is simply terrific as the android, Data, who aspires to be more human.  I can't imagine anyone else in the role, which is probably the highest praise you could give to an acting performance.  Michael Dorn excelled as the tough Klingon Worf, Levar Burton was immensely likeable as chief engineer Laforge, and rounding out the cast were the series' two sexy and smart women, Marina Sirtis as Counselor Troi and Gates Mcfadden as Dr. Crusher (the latter of whom looks even more beautiful now than she did in her first season on TNG).<br/><br/>The series has had a barrage of standout episodes, whether it was with suspenseful ventures into the unknown (the first appearance of the Borg) to the ultimate cliffhanger in The Best of Both Worlds, The Next Generation was an exercise in masterful storytelling and vivid characterization.

Can we all agree on one thing: that the universe of Star Trek changed (perhaps in a modest way) not only the way people viewed sci-fi but also how they envision the future?<br/><br/>Each of the four series is excellent in their respect ways:<br/><br/>(1) ST-TOS for starting it all and for revealing Roddenbury's creative genius. TOS has influenced American culture in many subtle ways (\"beam be up, Scotty\"). Sure, some of the old episodes were weak (\"brain, what is brain?\") but compare those to the many excellent, thought-provoking episodes. TOS stands on its own (much like the original \"Star Wars\") and all other ST series are compared against it.<br/><br/>(2) ST-TNG resurrected the series with fresh characters and technologies (can you forget the always malfunctioning holodeck?). Patrick Stewart was a bold choice to play the captain and the supporting cast was excellent. While the first two seasons were weak, the series was going full steam by the third year. The story lines overlapped episodes (which many of you deride as soap opera-ish, but I loved it) providing a sense of character development. While I love all the ST's, TNG is my favorite.<br/><br/>(3) ST-DS9 overlapped and continued where TNG left off. A darker vision, it also maintained the continuous story line technique. Like its predecessor, it was weak in the beginning but soon came into its own. While I will miss DS9, I feel that seven seasons is enough; any longer and you will weaken the production values.<br/><br/>(4) ST-V departs from the other three series (where the players start from Earth and move outwards), Voyager has an original twist: start far away and revolve the show around the characters getting home (moving inwards). And while there's a certain \"Melrose Place in Outer Space\" feel to it, Voyager is a fine show (I can't quite get myself to call it \"excellent\" yet). Starting in June ST-V has a new, critical mission: it will now carry the ST franchise alone.<br/><br/>In summary, I believe that each show has brought its own unique contribution to creating/continuing the ST phenomenon.

Patrick Stewart as Captain Picard is stunning and eloquent. Every thing he says you feel he means. While Kirk in the old series was quick to kill, Picard is more laid back and reserves blood shed for only the more extreme cases (like the Borg). This difference is mainly from the times of which the series were created. Kirk's show had the stigma of the Cold War and Communism to fuel it's story line and reflect on the time it was created which was the time of much great fear and revolution in the world especially even in the U.S with racial tensions which that show dealt with in a good manner. Now flash forward to the late 1980's when America and Russia are quickly coming out of the Cold War. This was a time ripe Captian Picard and his resiliency for humanity. Picard remains calm and collected in his shows and always beats the enemy with wit, not might, like Kirk. <br/><br/>The Next Generation is also cool because it had a stellar supporting cast. Michael Dorn as Worf is classic and to date he has more appearances in Trek than anyone else. Johnathan Frakes as Number one is cool too, he's not quite the foil to Picard that Spock was to Kirk, but it work. The foil to Picard that equals Spock's levels is that of the character Data, played to perfection by Brent Spiner.

Yeah, those ones using canned laughter which relied completely on actors and people being loud as an excuse to be funny with a roaring laughter every 5 seconds spoon feeding the audience of when to laugh, with an exception of Seinfeld these were just boring shows for boring people, The Simpsons was intelligent, heart felt, structured and most of all...

In an ideal scenario, The Simpsons ended on season 10 and season 9 didn't include the infamous 'The Principal and The Pauper', it lives its legacy as one of the greatest TV shows of all time and is passed down from generation to generation. Sure, the season 9 and 10 weren't golden age material, they were still solid entries in The Simpsons canon but then from season 11, things started to drastically change, we were getting episodes which would've been some of the weaker episodes in a golden age era season that were the best episodes of the season they were actually in. Sure, season 13 was pretty good but the show was tanking in quality almost directly after, pretty much season 14 onwards was terrible (not to mention the really bland movie). Now we're on the 31st season, the show is just completely unwatchable, the best episodes are mediocre and boring and the worst episodes are... 'Lisa Goes Gaga' (if you know what I mean).

All the regulars have their quirks, but in some episodes you can understand what certain characters are going through because the show is so life-like at times. Former President George Bush (the one from 1988-1992) once made a statement that families should be more like \"The Waltons\" and less like \"The Simpsons\". His opinion is somewhat old-fashioned and unrealistic. In other words, many topics dealt with in \"The Simpsons\" fit life for people in the 1990s and 2000s better than \"The Waltons\" did in the 1970s.

I was 15 when the Simpsons first aired and I'm 25 now.  I've seen every single episode, and I'd have to say it's a rare combination of factors that come together to make The Simpsons the best show ever.<br/><br/>It's a very clever and intelligent show - they never dumb anything down - and as creator Matt Groening has remarked, \"The Simpsons is a show that rewards paying attention.\"  There are always enough obscure pop-culture references or subtle background gags to ensure that the second, third, or tenth viewing of an episode will find you noticing something you hadn't before.<br/><br/>In the early days of The Simpsons, they derived a large part of their popularity from the everyday, down-to-earth, unglamorous, average-blue-collar-slob aspect of the Simpson family.  Homer is lazy and doesn't like his job, Bart doesn't excel at school, the plastic ketchup bottle they use at the dinner table makes that farting sound, and so on. This aspect of the program contrasts it with popular 80's family sitcoms such as The Cosby Show which always featured impossibly well-functioning families who got along a little too perfectly and usually learned a neat little lesson at the end of each episode.  An early tag-line for The Simpsons said that they \"put the Fun back in Dysfunctional.\"<br/><br/>Perhaps this blue-collar-slobness by itself is nothing shockingly original - think of previous TV shows such as Roseanne, Married with Children, All in the Family, The Honeymooners - but the Simpsons doesn't stop there.  This show is extremely densely packed with jokes - everything from cerebral witticisms and sly satire to Homer falling down and going \"D'oh!\"  Because it's a cartoon, the writers can get away with surreal gags such as the time Homer tells a joke which falls flat, after which a long silence happens which is punctuated by a single tumbleweed rolling through the Simpson's living room.<br/><br/>There are just too many things to mention about The Simpsons.  It can be touching occasionally; more often the viewers are treated to an unequalled cavalcade of obscure references, surreal sight gags, wacky adventures, self-mocking irony...

Nor could anyone anticipate it could become so cultural. \"D'oh\" is in the dictionary, and it has spawned off several catch-phrases and one liners. Truly, The Simpsons is the biggest thing since Seinfeld! The first three seasons showed them as if they were an actual family. Like the kind of family you'd meet on the street (only a lot more dysfunctional). Homer trying to do the fatherly thing in each episode. Marge being the voice of reason all the time. Lisa and Bart with their sibling rivalry. These first three seasons are not usually sighted as being the best, but they are often brought up when one speaks of \"The Best Episode Ever!\" By Season four, the show took a turn for what may have been the best. It left it's more realistic roots and became more of a satire. With more zany antics and more clever, witty, and often times sophisticated humor, The Simpsons became the most popular family on television. Each episode still contained it's own merits, themes and messages. Seasons 4 to about 10 are often said to be the \"Golden Age\" of The Simpsons.<br/><br/>However, as the year 2000 came, fans began to see themselves divided. Those who stuck with the show since it came about in 1989 were quick to jump on how the show changed. The humor became more lurid and toilet like, with antics becoming heavily more unrealistic and zany (to the point where some even say it isn't funny... but stupid). Some characters becoming unrealistically stupid, and the show shifting gears from focusing on Bart to Homer... to everyone outside of the Simpson family. The show also began to see more cumbersome and meaningless plots. Plots that didn't focus on current issues, or that didn't seem to be as strong as older episodes. Despite this, new fans seem to have come about to replace then, and the show continues to remain at the top of its game, even today.<br/><br/>I'm sure you all know where I stand on that debate.

Simply because The Simpsons is just so hilarious and incredibly clever and has been ripped off so many times, but nothing has come close to the brilliance that the Simpsons writers have brought us.<br/><br/>We have Homer Simpson, one of the most beloved TV characters of all time, with his famous quote \"Doh!\". He's an overweight, lazy, and not the brightest bulb, but so incredibly lovable for the fact of how bipolar he is! One minute he can be so incredibly depressed, but the next minute really happy and giggling. My favorite Homer quote is when he kills the zombie Ned Flanders in a Halloween episode, Bart tells him \"Dad! You killed the zombie Flanders!\"... \"He was a zombie?\" Marge is Homer's wife and a homemaker. She is at times naggy, but always manages to get in some terrific humor and some deep sympathy with all she puts up with. My favorite Marge quote is \"Bart, don't make fun of grad students. They've just made a terrible life choice.\" Bart is the oldest son and a rebel. His usual quotes are \"Don't have a cow\" \"Cool, man!\" \"Ei Carumba!\". He's this generation's Dennis the Menace. My favorite Bart quote is \"I need a soul, Ralph, any, your's!\", you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>Lisa is the second oldest and the smartie pants of the Simpson clan, she's kind of the know it all who solves all the adventures of the Simpsons. My favorite Lisa quote is \"They're only using you for your pool you know... shut up brain! I have friends now, I don't need you any more!\". Last, but not least, Maggie, the eternal baby of Homer and Marge, always a great love of the screen, but no famous quotes, just memorable moments like when she turns into an alien.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is a terrific addition, my favorites include Mr. Burns, Homer's boss, Groundskeeper Willy, the school janitor, and Mr. Skinner, the school principal.

Luckily, Swedish television are rerun experts. It is also the only show that I make sure to follow apart from perhaps \"Friends\", but in entertainment value, \"The Simpsons\" is way ahead.<br/><br/>What makes this show so great is its attention to detail, its outrageous dialogue and its completely fearless way of dealing with any issue that crosses the writers' minds.

Another very important element is the mocking irony and sarcasm which permeates the entire series. The smarmy and cheesy moments that a great many episodes end up in are extremely clever and becomes an important part of the fun.<br/><br/>What impresses me the most about the series is, however, the enormous amount of detail: the attentive spectator is not just in for the obvious gags - there's always something going on or something to read in the background, which makes a VCR mandatory so you can go back and check that special detail out again.

Based on other reviews here, it appears that I hung in a lot longer than most. But I gave up eventually.<br/><br/>From 1992 until 2007 I used to record, save, and constantly re-watch the Simpsons on VHS. Once the DVDs started coming out, I would buy every single box set and watch those to death as well. I used to drive my friends nuts with quoting lines or referring to episodes. I looked forward to every episode, what new disaster Homer could get into, and what goofy plot they would come up next. I loved every diverse and wacky character and how they all interacted with each other, good or bad. The writing was top notch, the parody of real-life things was great, and voice acting was flat-out superb. From the time I started watching until the early 2000's, it was heavenly. From 2002 - 2006, it started showing some signs of weakening, but still managed to make me laugh.<br/><br/>Then the movie came out in 2007.<br/><br/>It had a few moments (Marge's choice words about the bomb got my one \"out loud\" laugh), but it felt lackluster and pandered to a generic audience instead of staying really true to the diehards that were with the show since the beginning. The movie also marked the start of the show eventually going to CG versus traditional animation.<br/><br/>And here is where things start changing. Eventually, the writing went from meh (and later super-meh) to flat out lazy and about as funny as a terminal disease. Since CG animation no-doubt faster to produce than hand-drawn, the Simpsons went from feeling hand-made to mass-produced. This effect eventually seemed to spill over into all aspects of the show. Despite this, I was willing stick it out so long as it made me laugh, but it stopped doing that and I just couldn't bear to watch any longer. For me, it was really like a dear friend or relative was dying before my very eyes, albeit slowly and painfully.<br/><br/>But what really buried it for me was when that loser and complete no-talent \"comedian\" Hari Kondabolu cried and whined that Apu was somehow an insult to the entire Indian race (a farcical cartoon character, really?) which eventually stopped Hank Azaria from voicing it. Congrats Hari, you ruined one of my favorite characters on the show. What is it that you are known for again? Oh right, we're still waiting for all the brilliant comedy that you have yet to produce. It appears that Hank will no longer be voicing Carl either, who is now replaced by a \"correctly-raced\" actor. Because, you know, the earth was going to explode or something if that wasn't done. I supposed it's just a matter of time until Dr. Nick Riviera will be saying \"Bye Everybody!\" as well.<br/><br/>But it's OK, I've reached the level of acceptance and abandoned the show several years ago. I honestly don't know anyone who still watches this show either, but for those that still do I would ask that you please stop. Let the viewership die so that the show can die right along with it. It really needs to be put out its misery at this point. Every once in a while, I catch a glimpse of recent episodes when switching channels and most of the voice actors sound tired. I'm sure this is easy money for them by now, but really, I would think they are all talented enough to do other voice work in many other places. Or not - maybe they all need to retire. Poor Julie Kavner's voice sounds like it's practically gone now.<br/><br/>There was a time when I used to hope the state that Springfield is in would be revealed in the final episode, but now? I couldn't care less. What once was a show that screwed with the established order eventually got swallowed up by it and drowned in a sea of political correctness. I sold off my Simpsons box sets years ago and moved on to other things. The classic version of the show still exists for me now, but only in my memories.

The oafish Homer who can barely go a day without slacking or getting mixed up in crazy adventures. His wife, Marge, who tries to hold it all together.  His duaghter Lisa who is smarter that her gene pool should allow, Bart \u0096 every inch the classroom rebel.  The family is rounded out by the youngest \u0096 baby Maggie.  The family interact with those around them and learn lessons or sometimes fail to change completely.<br/><br/>When this series started in 1987 as a string of rough shorts in Tracey Ulman's show it would be a brave man who would have predicted that over a decade later that this series would be as huge as it is.  However the series got launched with the Christmas special in the early 90's.  The first series saw the animation greatly improved and the characters developed fully to be more involving.  However the story lines were not as sharp or as full as they were to be.  The second series and onwards saw the Simpsons have better stories \u0096 often multi-layered stories filled with pop-culture references and background jokes that reward the careful viewer\u0085to try and list them would take ages.<br/><br/>For an American sitcom (for that is what it is) this is amazing \u0096 the intelligence of the script is fantastic.  The depth of the stories are involving, witty and packed.  For a movie buff like me, this is a gold mine \u0096 from sly references in the background to full blow scenes almost spoofing movies this has them all. In some programmes that have background jokes the main stuff at the front often suffers or is ignored totally.  However here the main plot and dialogue is fresh and well thought out \u0096 it is amazing that for almost all of it's run The Simpsons rarely had a bad episode.<br/><br/>True \u0096 recent shows have begun to show a slide in quality but this is to be expected after more than 10 years at the top.  However it is generally brilliant and clever.  After the first series everything improved.  Not only was the series used for political comment, satire and ironic humour (in a country that generally can't do any well) but it is also heart warming and funny.<br/><br/>The characters live in a balance between reality and surreality.  They are sort of recognisable as real people in terms of habits and experiences \u0096 but in another way they are out there\u0085..Homer has been in Space, stopped a nuclear explosion etc.  The mix of this makes for an unique programme.  What makes it better is that the makers never draw a line between the madness and the normality \u0096 one episode is made up of a bad-neighbour type war between Homer and George Bush Snr!  The mix is seamless and adds layers to each show.<br/><br/>The wealth of characters is another strength. The main family is strong \u0096 even Maggie has regular input and adventures!  However where most sitcoms really rely on their main subjects for the stories, The Simpsons has a supporting cast of dozens and dozens of really good characters \u0096 all of whom are able to carry an episode.  They range from the normal characters (an inept  Police Chief, an Asian shop keeper who is used to being robbed at gunpoint) to the referential or well imagined, (the well-educated Sideshow Mel, a bitter Krusty the Clown, an useless lawyer).  All the characters have become more fully used as time has gone on.<br/><br/>The voice actors are all excellent and all do a huge range of voices\u0085of course they get very well paid for it!  Unfortunately the late Phil Hartman provided the voices of two of my favourite characters and I really miss his dry humour and strong all-American voice.  Lionel Hutz was a great character and my favourite, Troy McClure is a wonderful spoof of 60's B-movie actor Doug McClure.  This depth really helps the show and has allowed it to feel so very fresh years on.<br/><br/>I could go on for ever, but the series is a wonderful bit of proof that sitcoms don't have to be simple, full of canned laughter and focus on sassy teenagers!  The joys of the dialogue are backed up by movie references and crazy adventures.  The wonderful Simpson family are supported by a huge cast of imaginative characters who are always well used and a queue of celebrities just lining up to have a few minutes in the show.

The killing of Maude Flanders was inexcusable, and characters like Milhouse and Moe have become sometimes frighteningly weird (references to Milhouse-a ten year old boy-being gay and/or a cross dresser, for instance). Apu having all those kids was absurd. The shows now revolve around \"wild and crazy\" plots, with Homer constantly in the forefront.

But here we are and while 'The Simpsons' has become the longest running show on TV at the cost of its core integrity. \"Simpsons\" in its prime was the best things to grace the small screen. A funny, ground-breaking animated comedy with lightening-quick wit, insightful social and brilliantly integrated parody. It created its own universe with an entire town of original characters. Most importantly, it actually helped shape the sense of humor of an entire generation. That generation which has now grown up and is now creating animated shows in direct competition. <br/><br/>\"Simpsons\" is a pale shadow of its former greatness. It gradually slipping this way for several years, but it wasn't until the 2002 and 2003 seasons that the show really smashed up against the rocks for good. I used to delight in each new episode of \"Simpsons\". But now the show clunks along each week in what appears to be filling time. The free-wheeling gags it used to deliver with such ease are now weighted down by an unnecessary over importance on story. The show at its best may get off a funny, sharp one-liner every now and then. It's biggest asset currently is it's willingness and given latitude to slam its own network. I do delight in their \"Joe Millionaire\" on-air promo parodies or a recent episode where Homer calls to give the network an idea and the recording says something like \"If you know of another network's reality show we can rip off, press 2...\" <br/><br/>So what happened? There really is no one thing that can easily be pointed out to all the late-commers and say \"this is what happened\" - you have to have traced the history. The 'jump the shark' moment could have come as early as the infamous Frank Grimes episode where our vision of The Simpson family was suddenly turned into something to aspire to instead of parody. It could be the legion of big name celebrities forced into every episode. To bring down a show as great as this, it was a slow convergence of several things. <br/><br/>Watching it, 3 differences are evident on-screen at any given time: First, the stripping down most of the characters to 1-note cartoons. Notably, British favorite Homer Simpson going from child-like, hard-luck father to a rag-doll for wild animals to rip apart as each episode closes. I'm particularly appalled at its attempts to use Homer as a political mouthpiece. Did you know that a guy who once lit a Q-tip so he could see inside his brain has an active concern for global politics? Yeah, I didn't either. <br/><br/>Secondly, the classic Baby Boomer voice of the series has evaporated and was replaced with contemporary generation X and Y jokes. Now, it's the internet and Tony Hawke. The voice of the series used to be one of creator Matt Groening's, seen through the eyes of Homer and Marge. That voice has been lost as the show has turned into an assembly line institution, repackaged and been homogenized for the masses and a new generation of writers lead by Ian Maxton-Graham has come in to \"keep it fresh\". <br/><br/>Thirdly, it has run out of creative juice. Anyone who has stuck with the show long enough can see it literally re-telling jokes and recycle previous story lines. When the recycling becomes too obvious or the episode makes no sense, they merely double back and declare it all a big self-parody. Not even Al Jean (architect of the show in its prime and the Larry David of \"The Simpsons\") can save it now. <br/><br/>Since the talented voice cast has remained the same low these many years, I put all the blame on this squarely with the Fox network who refused to let this show go out gracefully when Groening siphoned off his role to work on his dream project, the now far superior 'Futurama'. In Fox's race to claim this endurance record they have turned a once edgy and visionary show into an institution with an assembly line production and revolving door of writers to match any of the other lame shows on TV. Behind the scenes, maybe the condescending we-can-do-no-wrong attitude of Maxton-Graham has dealt the show its biggest death blow, while producer Mike Scully sat back and ineptly let Maxton-Graham run it into the ground. <br/><br/>In the end, the biggest blame may actually land with the \"die-hard fans\" that embolden the show by letting it get away with this junk. Yes, \"The Simpsons\" was ground-breaking and every adult animation in the future owns it a bit of gratitude, but blind loyalty to a show only for how it performed in the past isn't healthy. <br/><br/>Since it has hit long-running status the critical bandwagon jumping has begun and \"Simpsons\" is more popular than ever amongst critics that want to be on the inside of history. We've now reached a point where the bad episodes and bad entire seasons outweigh the good and that, I'm afraid, is going to be the sad legacy of \"Simpsons\" . A train-wreck of crass, childish humor, grainy animation, oddly misplaced satire and forced parodies of only the most obvious pop culture targets. <br/><br/>10 years ago I didn't know what I would do without \"The Simpsons\" but now, particularly with the emergence of satisfying new adult animated shows ('Futurama', 'Family Guy' and 'South Park'), living without it might be pretty good. <br/><br/>* * / 5", "rating": null, "helpful": "79 out of 120 found this helpful.", "date": "25 January 2004"}, {"title": " Two Ends Of The Scale In One Show", "content": "I think I know exactly what the majority of the people reading this interview are saying- \"5/10?? What the hell is going on here?! Has this guy lost his mind???!!\" I admit, it was quite a difficult rating to give, and not one that I imagine will go down particularly well. But the unfortunate fact about this review is that I can't just look at the show's \"Golden Age\" when it was widely considered to be one of the funniest television shows ever created, cartoon or otherwise. Nor can I talk about the almost inconceivable plummet in the show's standards over the past five or so years, though God knows I could talk about that for hours. I have to look at the whole series, from the very beginning to where we are now, and take the whole of The Simpsons into account, from the ingenious hilarity of the past to the staggeringly awful quality we have today.<br/><br/>First off, I should make it abundantly clear that to me, The Simpsons, from season one right up until season ten, was one of the funniest television shows ever to air, past, present and I strongly believe future. Creator Matt Groening, together with Sam Simon and James L. Brooks, should be very proud of the work they achieved with them. These seasons are simply incredibly, painfully, blood vessel-burstingly hilarious. Blessed with an incredibly talented and naturally comedic cast, nearly all of whom have stayed committed to the show since its beginning, it has been host to a huge amount of characters who are all brilliantly funny in their own unique, very original way. The jokes range from silly slapstick, all the way through to sharply satirical, and everything in between, and they are nothing short of fantastic. The sheer amount of hilarious quotes and one-liners The Simpsons has in these seasons is nearly unfathomable, and it's not mystery as to why people all over the world can quote them so easily. Truly, they have set the bar for not only television comedy, but comedy on a whole.<br/><br/>As well as this though, it never lost sight of the three-dimension of its characters. What makes it great is that we feel for all of them, and watching it, it never feels as though we're watching a cartoon comedy, because it engrosses us in the stories of the people in it, and because there really is so much depth to the characters and the stories that concern them as well as excellent comedy that they almost feel like real people. This of course is especially in the case of the Simpson family themselves, all of whom are excellent characters in these seasons, who have real emotional reactions and feelings, which makes their short-comings all the more relatable. The ability of the cast to convey these emotions as well as the comedy is remarkable, and has led to some truly touching and poignant moments over the seasons.<br/><br/>Once we move past the end of the tenth season, there is a definite drop in the quality of the show, though not a drastic one. The jokes are a little less funny, the characters somewhat wasted, and the stories aren't quite as intelligent and enjoyable as they used to be, however it is still excellent television and extremely funny. The cast are still as inspired as they always were, and despite the tragic loss of Phil Hartman by this time, which saw the loss of two excellent characters Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz among others, they are still displaying immense talent and understanding of an astronomical amount of characters.<br/><br/>Now, we come to the problem. The reason for the 5/10 rating. A truly heart-breaking moment in television history, because once we reach the fifteenth season, we see the standard of The Simpsons has dived. And it has dived pretty deeply. From this point of the show to where it is today, it's as if we are seeing a different show. The stories are moronic, the jokes are cringingly awful, exchanging intelligence and wit for silliness and humourless exclamations, and the characters are mutilated. The fact the animation has improved only emphasises the change, and all the guest-stars and guest writers in the world can't salvage this shipwreck.<br/><br/>The awful jokes and lack of good stories are bad enough, but the worst problem with The Simpsons today, is that the characters have been ruined. All of them were once three-dimensional, interesting and real, but they are all now nothing but background pictures, opportunities for jokes. And bad ones at that. My answer to the question that everyone asks about The Simpsons is my favourite character (other than Homer) is Sideshow Bob, but even one as hilarious as him can't seem to manage one good joke. The worst offence is of course ruining the Simpsons themselves. It started early on with Marge, who was given terrible jokes and pointless stories, and now has even spread to Maggie, who is also stuck with uninteresting, unfunny stories.<br/><br/>I don't fully understand how people can stop being funny. It doesn't sound like something that can just happen, but that is exactly what has happened to the writers of The Simpsons. The show that was once ground-breaking and ingenious is now pathetic, a tired old dog limping to the grave that it should have reached years ago. I may sound bitter, and in truth I am, because this was a truly spectacular, one-of-a-kind show, and now it will not be allowed to be put to rest. I love the Simpsons. I love the characters, I love the cast's performances and I love the stories. But that was quite a long time ago, when it deserved it. When it does eventually end, I will of course be extremely sad, but I will be more relieved that finally this great television programme can call it a day at last.", "rating": 5, "helpful": "62 out of 93 found this helpful.", "date": "26 February 2013"}, {"title": " Boreing Lisa", "content": "When is there going to be a significant reduction in the time given to the bore, egotistical, do gooders, know all, dictatorial Lisa.

The writing is as good as everyone says it is, the cast is on par with that of Seinfeld or Roseanne.

It was used to entertain, inspire, and evoke a connection with the people. There was time in television when the programs would challenge not only the standard, but also the viewer. It started with things like Sanford &amp; Son and All In the Family. Then the Richard Pryor Show shook people to the bone. From these gems came further explorations of the comic genre. We were treated to things like The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Seinfeld. Shows that broke the mold of the typical sitcom formula. They found their actors and made them stars. They didn't take washed up has-been film actors and try to turn them into the affable characters that they obviously were not. They simply took fresh talent and gave them the environment to get better and eventually captivate. <br/><br/>Then something terrible happened in 1993. A show, on what was supposed to be a music video network, got the idea to film real people living together in a house. From the first episode of The Real World, the Golden Age of Television was over. From this little show spawned a countless number of reality TV Shows that have paved the way for mind numbing experiences of watching people acting \"real\" while they are being filmed. It showed us all that not only is this medium of television completely unoriginal, but that it also provided people with insight into just how far somebody will go to get themselves on the airwaves. In 1994 something else happened. A little show called \"Friends\" hit the desk of the execs at NBC. From that we now have an endless string of formulaic, hokey, poorly written buddy sitcoms, all focusing on the same issues that plague the \"poor\" yuppie world that these people all seem to inhabit. Gone was the time when you didn't really need the laugh track; gone was the time of multi-plot line programming.<br/><br/>And then, something truly amazing and inspiring happened. In a collaborative effort from the Hurwitz Company and Imagine Entertainment came a brilliant piece of intelligent programming; a show that had no precedent. A truly talented ensemble cast, a brilliant writing team, and an amazing staff of directors and photographers that changed the art form like never before. Gone were the days of traditional, canned laughter sitcoms. It seems that we had all been saved from another infinite line of weak programs, and by whom? The FOX Network. Who would have thunk it? But then again, it made perfect sense. FOX brought us The Simpsons, Married With Children, and Family Guy. They had been known to challenge the bar that was set by regular programming. But instead of living on with those classics, it was forced to willow away in the doldrums of cancellation alongside other brilliant yet failed shows, like Action, Titus, and Greg the Bunny. Some people like to watch clich\u00e9d, overplayed, over done formulas every week. Some people like the safe humor, the one-two camera angles, the boring sets, and the canned laughter. Some people just don't want to think.

They were right to re-edit season 4 into 20-minute episodes after the original releases were too long. But, this means that 25% of every episode is now a recap of what's already happened, as you try to follow a timeline chronologically from several different arcs which eventually interlink.<br/><br/>The template to the first three seasons are similar in terms of jokes, but they fall flat, and there aren't anywhere near as many laughs. Frequently in every episode voices are dubbed and it's so evident that it can't fall into fourth wall breaking but just amateurism. The decision to cast Seth Rogan and Kristen Wiig as the young Bluths seems like an attempt to shoehorn in a couple more big names, but their scenes lose a lot of the humour created by having the original actors playing their younger selves. It's disappointing that the original show couldn't hold on to its quality after Netflix picked it up.<br/><br/>Season 5 is more of the same. Fortunately no constant recaps, and it actually has arcs where the family are together, plu sBarry and Buster offer some relief occasionally, but ultimately the show is no better.

It's not that they're unfunny, but it just seems like by now, the creators of the show are just capitalizing on what made the first three seasons so great without putting an effort to develop the humor and take it further. An increasing portion of the newest episodes is taken up by flashbacks accompanied by Ron's voiceover to explain things, or to fill the gaps in narrative, and it's just too much. Moreover, because of the way the latest season is written (5th as of the time of writing), it always seems like everything that's happening in the show is supposed to lead towards something big that's going to unfold in the season finale, which weakens the viewing experience, making it impossible for any single episode to stand on each own.\nI'm still giving the series a 10.. pretending the reboot never happened.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "15 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "19 March 2019"}, {"title": " Comedy Gold.", "content": "*Note: My review refers ONLY to the original series (seasons 1-3).<br/><br/>What can I say ? This is a flawless and brilliant character-based gem of a comedy. The show's premise (how rich people would cope if they lost all their money) is ground for massive potential, and the show's creators do not disappoint. This show is also in a sense prophetic as it cleverly anticipated the boom of reality-TV, being shot in brilliantly amateurish fashion. <br/><br/>The story revolves around the super-wealthy Bluth family, rendered penniless after the patriarch is jailed for embezzlement. The one 'normal' son, Michael, tries to salvage his eccentric family as they get into blunder after blunder. This includes his elder brother Gob (a 'magician'), younger brother Buster (an 'academic'), twin sister Lindsay (an 'activist'), brother in law Tobias (an 'actor'), niece Maeby (a slacker), mother Lucille (sharp-tongued socialite) and son George Michael (an innocent). <br/><br/>The show is brilliant on so many levels, and the writing is incredibly smart. The show is highly quotable, and throughout its original 3 series never lost momentum. The beauty of this show is definitely the delusional characters. They all clearly suffer from a delusion of still being rich, and each character has a particular quirk. Even the supporting characters are brilliant (nods to Liza Minelli as Lucille Ostero, Henry Winkler as Barry Zuckercorn, Julia- Louis Dreyfuss as Maggie Lieser, and Ben Stiller as Tony Wonder). <br/><br/>Brilliant brilliant show, but I advise against watching Netflix's 2013 4th season.

It's to show growth and her transition from an emotional girl who can't control her power to a more mature teenager who's much more relaxed, mono-toned and in control.

Go watch it first (it's ultimately worth it) then come back and rant about how this review is preposterous and unfair.<br/><br/>I put off watching the series until after Series 2 had wrapped, having over-dosed on superhero TV series. The first series is an interesting take on the 'New' Teen Titans of Wolfman &amp; Perez - with enough nods to the comics to please readers whilst remaining accessible to non-aficionados. On the whole, the first series is thoroughly engaging and keeps you wanting to watch and find out how things develop. There are a handful of annoying (gaping) holes in the narrative (what was Kory doing in Austria with a lost memory, when she was allegedly sent to earth to seek out Raven in the U.S.A., where her spaceship resides, and is subsequently very adept and competent at locating her quarry in short time?) - but if you can ignore those it's an entertaining and well-paced yarn. Some of the casting is excellent and the sparring banter between the protagonists is a treat. Everything leads up to a creepy denouement for the Season 1 finale - which cleverly ends on a cliff-hanger and leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>Cue Season 2.<br/><br/>Overall it kept me watching and mostly caring for the characters but the opening episode resolving the entire first series was a HUGE disappointment. Trigon and the cult bent on restoring him to 'this' reality were a major threat for a full season - and then the demon lord is dismissed at a whim by his daughter, when he had only just ripped her of her powers in the previous episode? Erm - what?<br/><br/>Thankfully, the season is redeemed with the whole Deathstroke story line, even if the character has zero connection to his Arrow counterpart (anyone for a 'Crisis' style multiverse plot complication?). The season thread then proceeds well despite Dick Grayson making utterly ridiculous decisions purely because the plot narrative requires it. Opening episode aside, the first half and more of the series is great. Wondergirl shines and the introduction of Superboy, and how that is done, is a delight - Krypto may well be the star of the show.<br/><br/>Sadly the pace nosedives with the most ridiculous plot device ever, when Grayson inexplicably contrives to get himself incarcerated. There are then a number of very turgid episodes that feel like total padding and detract from the goodness that preceded them. The season is somewhat redeemed by the final episode which goes swimmingly until the needless and pathetic scenario leading to Donna Troy's demise, just when everything in the garden was rosy. If you are going to dispense with a major lead character then the scenario needs at least a pinch of gravitas - and there was none to be seen anywhere. Clearly the actor decided she wanted out, so the writers hurriedly penned what is possibly the most disappointing exit of any character on screen.<br/><br/>Despite these failings, there is still enough to warrant ongoing interest - and with Blackfire clearly on her way to deal with Kory in Season 3, there is the potential for a better third outing. Perhaps we'll get a Wondergirl 2.0, an Arsenal or a Kid Flash into the bargain - who knows? Oh - and as gaudy and exploitative as her costume and look was in Season 1, Kory really needs to revert.<br/><br/>Overall: 20% 'Gripping', 50% 'Very Good', 20% 'Meh' and 10% 'What were they thinking?'", "rating": 7, "helpful": "4 out of 4 found this helpful.", "date": "12 December 2020"}, {"title": " Artful In Confusion", "content": "This show is what I imagine the televisual equivalent of schizophrenia would be.

I was never a SEAL, but rather a Pararescueman for the USAF who served two tours overseas; many of the \"cheesy\" interactions and \"campy\" dialogue alleged by non-military serving reviewers are very realistic. This is how we talk. We crack poor, inappropriate jokes at the worst times because laughter - regardless of the timing - is our only weapon against the crippling anxiety that comes with combat deployments, regardless of who you are. Most of us shield ourselves from our own thoughts, especially when it's quiet, and even our loved ones (including those we served with) through humor. That is how we act and this series portrays that sense of fear amicably from the perspective of a real soldier. We speak quickly, we use jargon, we live and breathe what we do at that level because of the years of dedication to the cause that it takes just to get to that point.<br/><br/>Second, this inane need to downvote the series based on a \"female operator\" is not only ridiculous - but inaccurate. She is not an operator like the rest of the men, clearly acknowledged in Episode 2 when she tells Clay (the strap) to sit in the back with \"her\" and the \"rest of the support team\". She works in a TOC, a 'Tactical Operation Command'; the TOC is our lifeline when we're out in the field. Often times, your commanding officer, a procurement officer (supply), relief team and general support staff (including special JTF attachments like OSI, ATF, JAG, etc.) are on standby and are communicating with other assets in the general vicinity to coordinate the mission as it progresses.<br/><br/>Third, the technical adviser for this show is far more capable of portraying our armed forces in a respectable fashion than the vast majority of other shows on television. I saw a lot of complaints about Episode 1's \"boat scene\" shootout; clearly you've never fired a weapon on a moving skiff in the dark to understand that you're firing for effect - to suppress. Sure, you hope to land the shot, but a bouncing, lightweight skiff on top of firing at a moving object from another moving object makes even the best shooters in the world miss shots; that's just practical application to a common sense scenario. The show handles some complex issues, and my only complaint thus far has been the HALO/HAHO jump (would have to re-watch to see which it was) without the proper altitude gear - a minor flaw, certainly not enough reason to \"stop watching\" in disgust. I've also seen a few comments about how \"predictable\" and \"archetyped\" the characters are - well, no shit. That's precisely the reason they've made it to such top-tier outfits; no loose cannon or quirky halfwit makes it to teams like these because there's no spot for someone who's unpredictable.

Above and beyond all of this, the characters and their interactions have an authenticity that is better than The Brave or even The Unit, to name a couple at random.\n(The last paragraph contains a minor spoiler)\nI want to address some of the complaints from other reviewers. \nFirst of all, the dialog. It _is_ brisk, it is salted with acronyms and military slang, and all in all has a ring of authenticity that once again outscores other military dramas that come to mind. If you can't hear it, I suggest you improve your TV sound, or it may be time to invest in a hearing aid. If you don't understand it, google-fu is there to help you out. \nPolitics. You salty dogs who complain about \"PC\" in this series need to pay more attention. For one thing, PC culture has definitely infiltrated the military, but this show is definitely sending all kinds of signals that are contrary to that. The latest episode, Getaway Day, even made reference to the current administration's changes to the rules of engagement in Afghanistan, and in a subtly favorable way as well. The thing is, the politics in this show are done deftly and in an understated way that in my opinion is more effective than would be the case with too much boo-rah, and it definitely does not have the level of false equivalency and apology for the enemy that you see in, for instance, The Brave. They are much more respectful of the military (well, except for the \"cake-eaters\"!) than anything else I have seen in a long time, and that certainly includes The Unit with all of its manipulative \"conspiracies in high places\" and \"you can't trust anyone\" nonsense. \nRealism. Yes, this show gets some details wrong: weapons, uniforms, equipment, ranks and ratings, etc. All of this stuff is way less important than the story, the characters, the dialog, and the acting. And this series does very well in all of those areas, and continues to improve. It is really hard to get info on all of the details stuff that every military-knowledgeable person will agree on - at least partly because so many of us are arrogant SOBs who won't admit when we get it wrong ourselves. Listen, uniforms and equipment do change over time, top-tier SOP guys can often carry what weps they want, and everything is subject to the chaotic circumstances of conflict. At least this show is trying to tell stories about a real military unit, not some fantasies about a bunch of near-freelancers living in a bunker somewhere. In addition we should consider that too much realism in details might not be best for the security of the real operators.<br/><br/>I want to finish with a comment (here's the minor spoiler) on one scene from the last episode that really got to me. The team was on its way to a mission and came upon a set of flag-draped caskets in a hangar. No one said anything, but the looks on the faces, the body postures, said more than enough. This scene was eloquently set up, and then sprung with no warning. A series with even slightly worse writing would have had someone lash out with some clich\u00e9 phrase about how \"we're gonna get the bastards that did this\", etc. But the approach taken here was so much more effective.

The writing is good just looking at the arc of the story, but I have a bit of a problem with the dialog between characters. They are rude to one another. All of them are with the exception of maybe Jack, Amy, and Ty. In addition, no child in the show is made to suffer the logical consequences of their behavior. This is especially true for Tim's and Georgie's character. Georgie will blatantly not do what she was asked and when a consequence is given to her, the adults rarely follow through. As a matter of fact she gets her way because she acted out. No child in real life would grow into the well rounded adult we see her moving towards. They would have simply been taught that I can do what I want when I want and still get to trick ride! I find it so unrealistic! Also, Tim is really rude, but everyone just puts up with what he does and says and so his behavior is tolerated as though it is normal. And it may be, with some people in real life, but someone who acts like he does would have few friends and be barely tolerated by family. It isn't normal in my world. If I talked to people at school where I work the way Tim Fleming talks to people, I would not hold a job for long. And Lou is so neurotic it is horrible. The world must revolve around her. So what if Jack and Lisa were married in a way that they wished to. Nothing wrong with that in my book. But to Lou, everything and everyone must meet her expectations or you are wrong! So, I don't think the give and take between characters is realistic. And worse than that, I think this show teaches kids that nothing is wrong with being rude, petty, and selfish.

Now, we get to see inside the daily lives of a family whose job is to solve crimes, instead of committing them, and thanks to an ensemble of gifted actors, it's quite interesting to see their interactions, both personally and professionally.<br/><br/>Frank Reagan is the chief of police in New York City, a man deeply respected by his family and the people he works with. His oldest son Danny (Donnie Wahlberg) is a homicide detective with a reputation for not doing things by the book, and in the first episode already he sticks someones head in a toilet to get the location of a missing girl out of him. While people admire as someone who gets the job done, he has alienated several people over the years through his views and methods, including his sister Erin (Bridget Moynahan). She is a district attorney, and since Danny often uses unorthodox and even illegal methods to arrest criminals, she has a hard time with convicting them, causing them to argue quite frequently. Jamie (Will Estes) is their youngest brother, and after finishing law school, suddenly decides to become a police officer, much to the dismay of his fianc\u00e9. Although still a rookie, he is approached by a secret society called the Blue Templars, who wish to hire him to investigate the death of his brother, who was a cop himself and was shot while investigating a case.<br/><br/>The show comes up with an interesting concept,showing us the interaction of these four family members while investigating crimes and how they often clash in their believes and principles. Donnie Wahlberg's character Danny is probably the most interesting one of the bunch, mainly because it's hinted at that he was in Iraq, and that his tendency to loose patience with the people he arrests is rooted in something he experienced there. It's good to have Tom Selleck back on TV, who is a better actor now than ever, and since I already liked him in the Jesse Stones movies, it's great that I get to see him every week now.<br/><br/>You can watch Blue Bloods every Friday at 10 on CBS, and since it's one of the most successful shows that have ever aired in the time slot, it looks like it stands a very high chance of surviving for more than a season, which will be an achievement not shared by too many of the new shows, I'm sure.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "110 out of 149 found this helpful.", "date": "10 October 2010"}, {"title": " What a great show!", "content": "I'll be honest at the outset and say I've given this show a very solid 8 out of ten.

But they're always interesting, and the show's constantly funny. The love-hate relationship between Dr. Cox and Jordan is a pleasure to watch and keeping the J.D.-Elliot love/relationship off-kilter is a smart move on the writers' part.<br/><br/>At a time when American TV audiences seem enraptured by garbage, such as \"Survivor,\" \"The Bachelor\" and \"Who Wants to Marry a Gold-Digging Slut/Hunk on a Deserted Island While Answering Questions With 19,000 Chances to Telephone Relatives and Friends for the Answers,\" NBC's \"Scrubs\" provides a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>It is the best sitcom on TV today and I only hope that NBC does right by this show and promotes it as much as it did the over-hyped \"Friends.\" Because \"Scrubs\" deserves all the promotion so that it can stick around for a long time.<br/><br/>Addendum: The current season of \"Scrubs\" - where NBC runs two new episodes every Tuesday - is particularly good.<br/><br/>This show gets absolutely no respect from its network and the show's creators, I think, believe this might very well be the last season. So they're pulling out all the stops and the lunacy is inspired, inventive and unquestionably funny. <br/><br/>The remarkable thing about this show is that is so deftly balances wacky, wild humor - the non sequitur fantasy sequences are hilarious - with surprisingly moving and quiet moments.<br/><br/>Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Donald Faison and Judy Reyes have a wonderful sense of comic timing. And even though the series revolves around Braff's character, J.D., the show, I believe, belongs to John C. McGinley as Dr. Cox. <br/><br/>His riffs are howlers and, yet, McGinley always finds the humanity in his character and the situations.

I'm going to say something here and now.<br/><br/>The end of the world is this show being canceled.<br/><br/>It hasn't happened yet. And God hope that it doesn't happen soon. But if NBC continues it's overexposure of the \"Friends\" franchise as it no spins off into \"Joey\", continuously promoting the \"third-to-almost-fourth-last-of-the-season\", and not on quality shows like this. It will happen.<br/><br/>Using the free-camera style of sitcom to the greatest extent and directing possibilities since Malcolm in the Middle first aired, and simply the best writing ever since \"Family Guy\" went off the air (but the king shall return!), this is the greatest sitcom on the air, possibly in the last decade or more.<br/><br/>Every character has a personality that lends itself so beautifully to the show. From Dr. Cox's usually emasculating speeches that are highly anticipated every episode (sometimes, you get two, and a little part of you cries for joy on the inside), to the Janitor's way of playing the game of life between he and JD (and always somehow wins), to the main characters' individual blends of awkwardness and realistic smugness at whatever recent job-well-done they have done. But, of course, when it does, it's always fun to see that all fall down.<br/><br/>And each joke (out of all of them, approximately 98% is found in the witty dialogue itself) are executed perfectly by the cast and mixed in with a usually solid plot that sets itself up for jokes yet is satisfyingly emotional and realistic. I mean, really, who continues an argument for 7 years about whether or not they were on a \"break\"?<br/><br/>Each plot-important scene is treated like one and doesn't stand out as a laugh-dry one either. The usual plot advancement, one that regularly makes a character stare at another with their jaw slightly open and possibly enough time for a quick one-liner, is led into another scene effectively probably with a pan behind some object and the camera reemerges straight into a scene in progress, most of the time able to mix the character's home lives with the hospital life. More creative directorial touches that take full advantage of not using the traditional laugh-track/studio audience/3-walled room is a full hospital set where conversations can be taken around corners, can lead the camera to another character's conversation going in the opposite direction, with which the camera follows, and simply the funniest way to show viewers physical comedy (which never feels too slapstick).<br/><br/>The comedy itself is original and only an experience found here. Anyone who has seen the episode that briefly talks about JD's 'hair-met' can agree. JD and Elliot's love lives, whether together or with others, is always good for laughs, and together, they've even started making fun of their fairly clich\u00e9d off-again, on-again relationship (this season ending when JD proclaims love for Elliot, and when they get back together, he realizes, as his last girlfriend said, he only wants what he doesn't have, meaning, he realizes the second she hugs him again that he doesn't actually love her). Other story arcs, whether seasonal or over the series, are always dependable for the series to fall back on a little more than they traditionally do every episode (like the Janitor, or the Janitor and the other janitors, possibly along with Sloppy-Joe-guy, the cook, can have a small yet hilarious part or a large and still hilarious part). Mix in some surprisingly insightful philosophy from JD's narrative (though I like that they've started having some other character's narrating or just with their thoughts heard by the audience) near the end of every episode that ties all the sub-plots together, good music, the directing and plain laugh-out-loud comedy, and this is one show that I eagerly await syndication, DVDs, and, hopefully being one of the few sitcoms NBC will be airing this coming season, an award-winning show that will return to the Top 10 Weekly Nielsons and get more notice by the general public now that what's-it's-name is gone from people's minds.

To this end you can't help but feel that if he spent less time thinking about himself and more time thinking about the people he cares about and the patients in his charge then half of his problems would go away.<br/><br/>so with JD you sort of feel the character, instead of developing, just hits the 12 year old maturity roof and then travels sideways for 9 seasons, it would be unfair to say this about his medical skill though as you do see him come into his own as a professional, but then that's not what this particular show is supposed to be about and if ever one of his colleagues betters him at anything he flies off the handle and sulks until one of his (surely be now) tired friends gives him a pep talk.<br/><br/>in earnest JD is at best the glue that holds the rest of the characters together, interacting through him and coming together to help him and so on, so perhaps it was intentionally written for him to be irksome in order that the other characters would have more interaction with each other as a consequence.<br/><br/>i would recommend scrubs to anyone as i think that mostly the characters in it are top notch and the laughs come thick and fast.<br/><br/>*also, although i dislike JD's character it is in no way a reflection on Zach Braff, i've seen him in interviews and think he's a very level headed individual, plus he definitely called time on his character at the right moment rather than staying on for the money. good on him.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "14 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "20 June 2010"}, {"title": " I'm no Superman", "content": "I've watched through this show so many countless times.

Bergerac, Inspector Morse and Frost have trained us to expect quirky, interesting shows with characters who become part of British culture. It's early days yet, but I think that 'Death in Paradise' has the chance to join them.<br/><br/>Backed by Danny John-Jules, Sara Martins and Gary Carr, Ben Miller brings the quintessentially quirky detective to life in this brilliant show. A fish out of water, DI Richard Poole must handle the transition from safe, temperate London to the bright colours of a small French Caribbean island, St. Marie, and bring the essence of British policing to its very un-British environment.<br/><br/>The show's funny, interesting and very addictive. The writing is great and the acting just perfect. Carr and John-Jules bring the underdog policeman to life in the time-honoured way (complaining whilst showing just how much more they know than their boss believes) and Miller plays the lost Brit abroad perfectly whilst adding that touch of off the wall brilliance that a British detective is meant to bring to a show. Martins adds a sparkling performance as his sidekick with a wonderfully wry view of the British policeman's inability to adapt to the island's lovely lifestyle.<br/><br/>This show's one to watch and one I hope will carry on in this vein.

You can tell it's trying REALLY hard, but whether it's an issue of character chemistry or writing, something just seems \"off\" about it.\nObviously the immediate, inescapable comparison to this show is \"Rick and Morty\", and knowing that going in, I tried to avoid comparisons. Tried being the key word, because having the lead voiced by Justin Roiland, doing a slightly more curmudgeon take on Rick, I think was a major misstep for the series. I just can't get \"Rick\" out of my head every time the character speaks, it hurts my ability to differentiate the show from its sibling, and not in a good way, because far more jokes in this series seem to fall flat, by comparison.\nAnother major gripe I have is the voice acting of the children characters, the girl's voice is basically impossible for me to listen to.\nThe grub / dog or whatever goes on some little \"cute\" adventures that don't add much (baby Yoda he is not) to the story, it's yet another throwaway character in this show.\nThe bright spot that I've seen others speak of, is the mini human subplot that takes shape 1/2 thru the season. It's \"good\" enough, but isn't it telling when the best part of a series has nothing to do with the main characters??\nSpeaking of them again, the main alien characters seemed interesting enough at the start, but again, their adventures (even maintaining the same exact Rick and Morty dynamic of one \"smart\" alien and one \"dumb\" alien) tend to just feel like watered down Rick and Morty B plot lines.\nAnother small point, I'm not a prude by any means at all, I don't mind \"sex\" in cartoons, or any genre, but Justin Roiland just can't write sex funny. Even his sex jokes in R+M are the weakest part of those episodes, and that trend continues here. The sex in this series just feels so forced, and unnecessary, and dumb. Having people say shocking stuff just for shock value adds nothing.\nI love Rick and Morty, the writing is smart and routinely \"surprises\" me. I wanted to love Solar Opposites too.

While it is possible that this show will end up taking a dive as it progresses - I can say that the beginning so far has been great and has true potential. It sort of reminds me a little of a Breaking Bad type of show. I seriously doubt it ends up being as good as Breaking Bad, but if that is the type of show that you like then you should really consider giving this one a shot.<br/><br/>For those of you who wrote negative reviews, I can understand if it isn't your type of show. The most popular TV shows on today such as reality shows I can not stand yet they seem to get the most attention - we all like what we like. I think the acting has been great so far, and I feel as if I can connect with the actors and I imagine it will get even better with time. I like shows that feel like they can be halfway realistic and not ones that have over the top action where the good guy always wins and never runs out of ammo as he shoots his way through the whole show. So far this show has felt fairly realistic and very plausible, I just hope it stays that way.<br/><br/>One other thing I would like to mention is I love shows that take us back in time such as 11/22/63 or Boardwalk Empire etc. I believe this one was done very well in that regard, the scenery is great and really brings you back to that time period. Some shows like to make the past look different in some regard but with this show it is bright and looks the same as if you were there in the 80s with them.<br/><br/>Will this show stay on track and be one of the greatest shows? I don't know but I certainly hope so. For now I rated it as a 9, but it has the potential to be an easy 10/10, or take a dive down to a 5/10.

Obviously not all characters have gotten fleshed out yet, but as a manga reader I know they all will so I'm giving out the 10 rating.<br/><br/>Sound - 9/10 There are a lot of OSTs that are absolutely amazing and serve as brilliant accompaniment to whatever scene they're in. Most of the soundtrack can be listened to on their own, without the context of the show, and still be epic. However some of the songs don't have much variety, which does knock it down a few points. Then we have the voice actors - something I forgot to mention in my Made In Abyss review - and oh boy the voice actors are amazing. While I personally prefer sub, as I think Deku's VA expresses much more emotion, the dub is extremely solid and one of the best in a while. It's also very good at not changing really important lines which is always appreciated.<br/><br/>Art - 9/10 The art for this show is pretty goddamn awesome. It's a pretty new art style while still maintaining that \"Japan\" feel. The animation and visuals are normally very fluid and everything looks much more polished than before. The show has also drifted away from the \"tell before you show\" aspect that was present in the first season, with the fights allowing you to try and figure out the strategy in your head before directly explaining it to you. And while the art is nothing revolutionary it certainly deserves a 9.<br/><br/>Overall - 9.5/10 Here in the West, where every third film is a comic book film and a lot of superheroes are becoming over saturated or boring, HeroAca is a breath of fresh air. Not only does it perfect and put a twist on common Superhero/Shounen tropes, it also manages its wide cast very well and tells a story that turns out to be very intricate. While I admit some characters haven't gotten their turn in the spotlight yet and the repercussions of a certain few events haven't been fully explored, the show is worth a watch for anyone who wants to watch a well written shounen or a new take on the superhero genre. Or someone like me who just really wants to see superpowered teenagers punch each other silly.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "48 out of 64 found this helpful.", "date": "18 October 2017"}, {"title": " Any fan of comics would enjoy this", "content": "I dont care if your not into anime.

It looks 100% childish trash, I could not comprehend what people were seeing in it. The ONLY reason I decided to watch episode 1 was because of the massive hype, I'm SOOO happy I did. The first episode starts slow, there's no question but thats because this show knows pacing perfectly. Its not rushing into it at all, its setting itself up right because its quality in every aspect. This is going to be the next \"Naruto\" but unlike \"Naruto\" as of right now they're doing it 100% right, they're not cutting corners with animation or reusing the same things just constantly. The story is perfection, not to slow nor to fast, every episode feels like only 5minutes have gone by, it'll have you holding your breath in suspense &amp; your heart beating in excitement. The animation is amazing, it puts Naruto &amp; Bleach to shame in nearly every way. The artwork is beautiful, the character designs although my first impression was how childish it appeared it's actually quite older audience aimed. The music is amazing, the op &amp; ed match the show perfectly and all the music during the show is right on. If your a shounen fan or a fan of \"Naruto\", \"Bleach\", or \"Hunter x Hunter\" you NEED to watch this. Its going to be better than Naruto &amp; Bleach by a long shot.<br/><br/>5/5 Why?

At first the story- line seemed out of place and slow, but as you watch more and more episodes you become aware as to why exactly that was the case. It's about heroes but not what you'd expect. Most of the population are born with a unique ability-cleverly named a 'quirk'. Unlike other superhero stories, however, you can only use your quirk within a certain threshold. Anything more, and you risk serious injury. This is brilliant, because it's so peculiar. <br/><br/>The last time an anime left me in awe was when Goku first went SSJ.

In the past 23 years of my life, the movies or animation that made me tear up is usually about loss, death and sadness. But the Hero Academia is different. I teared up for the will of the characters who are paying tremendous effort for their dreams; I teared up for the heart-warming scenes; and for a few moments, I cried like a baby for the feel of overwhelming hope the show brought me. <br/><br/>We usually see overpowered protagonist saving screaming civilians in ordinary superhero movies. But things in Hero Academia are different. In the world of Hero Academia, 90% of human have super power and being hero is more like having a dream job instead of doing volunteer work. Surprisingly, it talks a lot about the core values of hero. And how the young students in Hero Academy struggle a way to reach their dreams, as well as fighting villain who targeted on young heroes. It made me understand that, no matter is it a success or a failure, learning from experience is part of life. <br/><br/>Take my favorite line in the show to end the review - \"If you are designed to fight my 100% power, I'll force you to surrender from beyond that!\" <br/><br/>I can't spoil the story as it will be much less fun to watch it. <br/><br/>The only thing I can say is, you will not regret watching My Hero Academia.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "26 out of 39 found this helpful.", "date": "22 May 2018"}, {"title": " Awesome Anime", "content": "I only started to watch this anime because of good reviews i saw on the net, and being naruto fan i never thought this anime could get any better than naruto,the initial intention was to only watch 2 episodes and before you know it i was already finishing episode 8!!

Fun show with memorable fight scenes throughout. Unfortunately it suffers with some issues that I will outline here.<br/><br/>Plot/Story(8.5): Although a bit cliche with the noble kid who doesn't have a superpower but wants to be a superhero anyway. Definitely got a Kickass(Movie) vibe going for it as far as the main character is concerned. I do still like the journey and all the possibilities. The dynamic of many superheros, and by extension super villains, existing in a world could bring about many fun, interesting and deep narratives. I like how Deku gets his power and still has to work and develop it. The hero school setting is interesting, although feels a bit Harry Potter Hogwarts-ish with the kids trying to learn but bad guys plot intertwines with the school.<br/><br/>Characters(7.5): There are many characters in this show. All have very unique powers/quirks. When I mean unique..I mean very unique. The names of their quirks give me a chuckle sometimes. I don't expect all the school characters to get developed. So I will go over some of the issues I had with some of the top appearing characters in the show and some that I liked.<br/><br/>Deku is a great character that I enjoy watching develop throughout the series. My only complaint is that he is overly emotional at times(cries a lot). Even the writers, through All Might's character, tell him that he cries too much. It gets a tad bit eye-rolly sometimes.<br/><br/>Bakugo is probably the worst of the bunch. I've noticed that he is a favorite among the fan base so I know I will get ire for this. He is powerful and has a great quirk. Unfortunately, I feel like he is one dimensional and hasn't grown much at all. Him developing his quirk and becoming more powerful isn't the growth as a character I am talking about. Episode 1, we find out he is a hot headed, in your face bully who wants to be the number one hero, just like All Might. Coincidentally just like our main character, but much less selfish. Season 3 episode 12, Bakugo is STILL the same character with the same motivations, with almost no information on his background or home life. We FINALLY saw his mom and dad. His mom being a carbon copy of him and his dad being the chill one. Not much to go off of beyond the mother mistreatment and him emulating his mom. Not very good..of course there is still more to the show but the fact that he is practically the #2 character in this show with so little back story and development is just not OK.<br/><br/>All Might is an interesting one. I like how they show that he has flaws as a teacher even though he is the number one hero. I like his fatherly relationship with Deku. I do have to point out that I am not too fond of the design of his skinny form. His sunken in eye sockets are distracting for me considering that he is supposed to be human (I think). <br/><br/>Todoroki is probably my favorite of the classmates. His back story of how he refuses to use part of his quirk because he hates his abusive father. His back and forth with Deku in the Sports Festival Arc on how Todoroki needs to embrace his other half. His father doesn't own him, etc. So good. Love it. Bakugo needs this kind of treatment.<br/><br/>Stain is my favorite villain and I was sad to see him go. I loved his motivations. I am glad they are continuing his narrative of how heroes need to be truly selfless if they want to call themselves heroes. How he hates all the heroes who do it for money, fame and glory. <br/><br/>Writing(6): I have issues with how this show is paced. And I think that the pacing is off because of their decision to use internal monologue and flashbacks. I don't mind if they use it, very sparingly, but this show uses it a lot. They need to let the visual(animation) speak for itself. Meaning they don't need to explain why (insert character) is (insert emotion) through internal monologue when the audience already sees it in their face. Or they don't need to explain why Deku is doing what he is doing because (insert 30 sec long flash back). It eats up run time. The audience isn't that forgetful. This explains why some episodes have odd cliffhangers in the middle of fight scenes or other places. They also don't need to internal monologue so much fight strategy. It is more fun seeing the strategy play out and the audience saying, 'Wow, didn't see that coming'. So I hope that they would take the audience a little more seriously. I can see why people wait until the whole season is out so they don't have to wait a week to see a fight finish.<br/><br/>All in all, it is still entertaining. I do want to see Deku's journey to the top. I just hope it doesn't take 10 seasons to do it.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "30 out of 51 found this helpful.", "date": "26 June 2018"}, {"title": " I can not get enough!", "content": "I can not get enough of this anime, I want to watch it every day, all day long.

One major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show, another will be how the story doesn't follow up as well with the Green Arrow comics. If the show sticks to its action first and love story later, it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see, and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons. The best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes, and team ups with other super hero shows such as the Flash. These crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy.

Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet. How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s. Now all that has changed. You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged. And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed. All this is positive evolution I think. But here the catch. There are no more \"closed\" story-lines. In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex. ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map). Amell is great. He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting. The supporting cast is great. In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a \"10\" are the flashbacks. They are terrible. They are like some silent Hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes. It is almost as if the lead writer, as a small child, was locked in a closet with a DVD looping KUNG FU, and grew up to believe that you cannot advance 10 minutes of plot in the present, without 2 minutes of flashback to fortify it.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "56 out of 78 found this helpful.", "date": "8 November 2013"}, {"title": " I recommend arrow and arrowverse shows!", "content": "Arrow and arrowverse shows are simply divine.

What few people knows is that Michael is the architect of the prison and so he knows his way around.<br/><br/>The characters are really good.

Wentworth Miller also does a great job as Lincoln's brother, Michael Scofield.<br/><br/>The story may seem a little incredible and some facts may be wrong, but never the less it's made quite believable. You believe the locations and the characters and how they behave and react. The story is well written and detailed and it all seems possible. They've managed to give this series kind of it's own style and personality. The basic idea of escaping a prison is old and so you might not wanna call this show original. On the other hand you don't know what else to call it. It is a new twist to an old idea (and a good one I might add) and it is not filled with clich\u00e9s. It gives a realistic image of what could very well be. At the same time you got the old hero who's out to save the innocent. Yet, Michael is not treated like a hero.

Season 1 - 3 I have been watching over and over again. As you know I am a big fan of Prison Break! &amp; and Season 1 - 3 were at it's best! I am in love with that show it is still the best one at it is. We are 2012 now three years ago Prison Break end it and i still adore it and love it so much. My favorite best Season is the Second Season of the show. I still don't know why some fans are criticizing saying that is not as good as The First and the Third Season? I don't get it, i think i have different taste than other people have. Season 2 is the best one and awesome ever it really is. I have Season 2 &amp; 3 on DVD complete original DVD's all are original i really worked hard to get them. Story's: Season 1: Most men would do anything to get out of Fox River Penitentiary, but Michael Scofield will do anything to get in. His brother Lincoln has been sentenced to die for a crime he did not commit, and the only way to save him is from the inside out. Armed with prison blueprints and an impossibly intricate escape plan, Michael gets himself incarcerated, and the race against time is on. Now, he'll need all of the cunning, daring, and luck he can muster... along with the assistance of some of the prison's most vile and dangerous felons... - The story revolves around two brothers: one who has been sentenced to death for a crime he did not commit and his younger sibling, a genius who devises an elaborate plan to help him escape prison. The brothers, along with six other prisoners at Fox River State Penitentiary, manage to escape at the end of season 1. In Season 1 i love episodes the most: Go, Pilot, Riots, Drills and the Devil (Part 2), English, Fitz or Percy, Cute Poison. Season One was good intense drama but just too much Drama for me i expect more.<br/><br/>Season 2: Is about escaping and been on the run behind the walls. The Second Season begins with the manhunt of the fugitives \"Fox River Eight\". Eight hours after escaping from Fox River state hires FBI Special Agent Alexander Mahone who is assigned to lead the pursuit of the escapees he has specialized himself to hunt fugitives. Portrayed by one and only awesome William Fichtner he was so amazingly awesome and the best nemesis of Michael ever.The Second season follows a massive manhunt chasing the group. Dubbed the Fox River Eight, the group splits and members go their individual way, occasionally meeting up to help each other. They struggle to escape from the police while avoiding a secret group of multinationals called The Company, that wants them all dead.The most of characters i love and idolize are ( The Fox River Eight are: Michael Scofield,Lincoln Burrows and Benjamin Miles C- Note Franklin. Others not escapees are Dr.Sara Tancredi, C.O. Captain Officer Brad Bellick and FBI Special Agent Alexander \"Alex\" Mahone. I loved Lincoln how he sacrificed everything for saving his son LJ and Michael he sacrificed everything to save his brother Lincoln,Sara and Sucre. I love how Sara was fighting after she commit suicide at the end of the first season but she survived. Her relationship with her estranged father got better they become close than in season 1 were, but her father was murdered by the company when he found out that Linncoln Burrows was really innocent they tried to kill her but failed, she skipped bail and she had to run for her life.She meet with Michael in Episode 10 Rendezvous. Brad Bellick portrayed by awesome and amazing Wade Williams was fired in Episode 2 Otis along with Stacy Keach Warden Henry Pope he was in 3.episodes in Season 2. Brad Bellick's life was over when he was fired but instead he decide to get revenge on the escapees. With his C.O. co worker Roy Geary he come after 2 escapees and he catch Michael Scofield and his brother Lincoln with Nika. He tried to collect Westmorland's money in Utah but he got tricked by Nika and captured by the brothers. Later he tracked down T - Bag with his partner for Westmorland's money but he got tricked and betrayed by Roy Geary and than framed for a murder of Fomer C.O. Roy Geary which he did not committed.25 to life sentence in Fox River state by T - Bag Bagwell Episode 14 John Doe he was so awesome, but Mahone gave him a deal in Episode 16 Chicago so that he could track down and find other escapees, he come out of the prison and all chargers against him was drooped. He later capture Haywire, Sucre and Michael but got framed by Bagwell for a murder again and was imprisoned in Sona. Benjamin Miles C- Note Franklin was million times better in second season than in the first Season was. He never was caught and all he thought was his family. He was a soul and heart in this season, i loved him so much specially in Episode 16 Chicago and Episode 20 Panama. Portrayed by one and only Rockmond Dunbar.Season 2 is the far best, best one ever in the show. Season 1 was too much intense drama and less action on it. Season 2 was action explosion it blows the third season ever. My favorite best episodes are : Sona,Manhunt,Otis, Fin Del Camino,First Down,Subdivision,Buried,Dead Fall,Rendezvous,The Killing Box - the best episode ever\",John Doe,The Message,Bad Blood,Wash,Sweet Caroline and Panama.

Prison Break has everything from petty crooks to government conspiracy to crooked cops. One could have never thought that you could make a show about breaking out of jail so entertaining, or could one? This show reminds me a lot of the ShawShank Redemption. I wonder if that movie inspired the writers at all? Even though they could have been inspired, this show is definitely unique. It all starts because Linc (Dominic Purcell) was falsely accused of killing the vice presidents brother, and is now sitting on death row. Linc's brother Michael (Wentworth Miller) robbed a bank so he could land himself in prison to help break his brother out. To do this Michael has the blueprints of his escape secretly tattooed all over his body.<br/><br/>Now Michael has some pretty good luck, what are the odds that he was sent to the same prison that his older brother is at? I would have to agree with Gillian Flynn from Entertainment Weekly When he states, \"Let's pause, laugh, and salute this series for being so well shot and acted that these little dragonflies of illogic buzz us only briefly. (But seriously, how lucky for Michael that he was sent to this particular prison \u0097 otherwise we'd be watching him in Leavenworth hitting his head and muttering ''Stupidstupidstupid!'' for five years.)\" It is very convenient that he helped design this particular prison. What would he have done if his brother got transferred or if Michael was sent to a different prison, I bet he would have felt pretty stupid. I am also very impressed that not only does his full body tattoo look good, but it is a map of their escape. Another pretty amazing thing is that he can actually remember what everything means. I don't know about you but I think I might get some things mixed up.<br/><br/>Putting aside the unlikely elements of this entire show, it is actually rather entertaining. It is very suspenseful and you never know what is going to happen next. Also people can somewhat relate with this show seeing how it is not exactly science fiction. Everybody knows that there are innocent people that are sent to prison, and even put on death row just like Linc in this show. So except for the \"government conspiracy\" for some people this show might hit at home, making it very entertaining.<br/><br/>The acting in this show is done very well. I have not once said to myself wow he sucked. From the main characters all the way to the extras the acting has been superb especially on Michaels part. I think his best acting episode had to of been when he was pretending to be insane. I could have sworn that he was not faking his mental illness. Another character that stands out in my head that is a very good actor is Haywire. If I did not know better I would honestly believe that he was mentally insane. He plays this part perfectly and makes his scenes very entertaining.<br/><br/>The graphics and the special effects in this show are not bad as well. From Michael being burned to Linc getting in the accident, it all looked pretty real. I never saw anything that looked really fake. I did see some things that were rather unlikely though. Like when T-Bag got his hand cut off and sewed back on. He was about to get caught so he ripped his hand off to get away. To me I think I might have passed out or at least have to go to a hospital afterwards, which he never did. He just put a fake hand on his arm like it was not going to get infected. Now even though this is a little for fetched it does make this wonderful drama a lot more exciting.<br/><br/>One thing I noticed when I was watching this show is that there is no narrator. There is nobody telling you anything about the show. I think that this makes the show more exciting. It is like it adds more suspense to it. When you have a narrator he/she tells you wants going on and what to think. Two examples of dramas like this are Grey's Anatomy and Desperate House Wives. When you do not have one you have to think for yourself. Therefore your mind is racing with ideas of what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>Even though this show has a few things that are very unlikely to happen, it has a lot of things that are very likely to happen. It has a lot of good qualities to it. It has good acting, graphics, and special effects. It has all the elements of a very entertaining television drama.

Regina and Rome are seriously a fist bump away from a \"You go, girl\" or some other old, tired \"urban\" phrase.<br/><br/>Basically, this show is what happens when old, privileged white men (and their female counterparts) try to create a drama with a \"diverse\" cast (blacks, check, Asian, check, interracial romance, check, gay teen, check) and a unique plot--dry, boring, unrealistic tokens and exaggerated, ridiculous story lines.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "10 out of 15 found this helpful.", "date": "27 March 2020"}]}, "/title/tt7335184/": {"title": "You", "reviews": [{"title": " Second season even better!", "content": "I can't believe I just binge-watched the whole season, with barely any pauses between episodes.

The series attracted my attention thanks to Netflix. I started watching the series without much anticipation. It was very immersive and fluent. The monologues were fine. It's nice to be told the events through Joe's eyes. I think that's what keeps the series going.<br/><br/>The series tells the story of an obsessed perverted man falling in love with a woman. When Joe first sees Beck in the bookstore, he falls in love. We are going to see Joe's interaction with Beck, which starts with a book offering, and turns into a relationship. Joe proceeds to stalk Beck on every available social media site, quickly determining that she's the one for him. In the process, Joe is doing some amazing things. He's watching Beck's house, following every step. He goes into her house and steals her stuff, her clothes and her phone. He kills her lover, researching her friends. In doing so, he remains so calm that everything he does looks normal to the viewer. You realize you're wrong, but you don't hate Joe. Joe's problem is actually his background. His past experiences make him obsessed. Both Joe and Beck are two problematic people. \"How is the relationship between two problematic people?\" We find the answer to this question. Although it isn't true, Joe is doing everything for the woman he loves, Beck doing it for herself. You decide who's worse. Despite the bloody appearance, the series is not horrifying.<br/><br/>I found acting performances in the series successful. The soundtracks of the series was good. Colors, sounds, frames - everything works correctly on the atmosphere. Although it is simple as subject, its immersiveness increases the traceability. If you don't watch with too much expectation, I think you'll have a good time.<br/><br/>The series has a lot to say about our society's addiction to social media, and the dissonance between the curated images we project of ourselves online and our authentic selves. While You offers some suspense, it also offers a distorted way of looking at Joe's criminal behavior.

He's a \"niceguy\" who would be \"so perfect\" for the woman he desires if only she would \"see how good he is for her\". The object of he obsession, Beck, is a cute, flirtatious burgeoning writer who he idolizes in the most bizarre way and pushes to be her best, truest, most writer-est self. He basically hacks into her life by researching her social media, her friends and her interests. He hates her vapid friends and tries to pull her away from them any chance he gets.<br/><br/>His obsessions constantly lead him into situations where he's broken into other characters homes, showed up at random events and searched computers/phones and always seems to be on the brink of being discovered at all times, wears a ball cap in public while stalking his love interest and and assaults her friends, and never seems to be noticed... by anyone, at all!

Despite this, the first few episodes are somewhat interesting: Joe has his own ironic way of articulating his thoughts through narration, with just the right amount of disdain for all these boldly clich\u00e9d, despicable characters that surround Beck. I am talking about Benji, some archetypical, douchey fortunate son, who's (obviously!) vegan and gluten-free, has his own soda company and plays with Beck's easily fooled heart. Yeah, you read that right, that's how stereotypical the writers went with this one. But buckle up, he's not the only one: I'm also talking about Peach, and Beck's entourage of shallow, Instagram-obsessed type friends, who are as snobby and as self-absorbed as they come.<br/><br/>At first, these stereotypical characters all seem like a big joke, a bunch of idiots who the audience will delightfully watch Joe outsmart and probably eliminate one by one. You'd think there will be some social commentary with plenty of bite in there, as Joe stalks and disses the social media profiles of different characters. If you watched the first few episodes, you're probably thinking that a sardonic tone is being set, as it seems unconceivable that any writer in the world would create such characters with any intent, at some point, to make anyone like or even tolerate them. You're probably thinking that you're in for a show where you'll be brought to the morally ambiguous dilemma of whether you should be \"rooting\" for Joe. But don't get lured in just yet...Because after a few episodes, the deceit becomes obvious and everything is a complete mess, thanks to poor writing.<br/><br/>The core of the mess, actually, lies mainly within the character of Beck. While, at first, she seems like a nice, emotionally vulnerable girl caught up in the middle of a circle of fake people, every time you are about to feel sympathy for her, she does something devaluating. It literally becomes a gimmick mid-way through the season. After a relatively short while, it becomes absolutely annoying, and you actually don't care for her anymore.<br/><br/>When it comes to Joe, while he has a few good lines here and there, his obsessive behavior ends up nullifying any of his earlier displayed smarts, and he becomes amazingly pathetic. In this regard, the writers made Beck so unlikeable that it's barely believable that even the most desperate fool in this world would still have the slightest bit of interest towards her. As they show flashbacks of him in a previous relationship, you get to understand that he's just a psychopathic, hopeless romantic who's also a magnet for slutty and confused ladies, which makes him even more pathetic.<br/><br/>As the series goes on, the interactions between the two main characters become annoyingly gimmicky, and you'd just wish they'd both get hit by a truck, seriously. Through midway of the season, the story becomes quite a drag of the same gimmicks and every twist and turn is highly predictable. You find yourself thinking this should have been a film or a miniseries.<br/><br/>There is also plenty of nonsense throughout the season: Joe keeps stalking Beck and her friends and follows them everywhere they go, always staying close enough so he can hear what they say in public places like bars and restaurants. Obviously, they never notice him...he's wearing a cap! Of course they won't! But hey, they'll notice a private investigator following them in the blink of an eye, though. And Beck's apartment, what a great view it gives to anyone passing on that New York City street, right at RC level! On the other hand, she's portrayed as such a dumb and naive gal, it's almost believable that it never crossed her mind that she'd probably need curtains. And what about these people who suddenly disappear, but Joe sends a tweet or two from their stolen phone, so everyone thinks they're alive and well.<br/><br/>There is one subplot that fostered a hint of interest, and that's Joe's relationship with Paco, the boy who lives in the apartment next to his. Unfortunately, this relationship remains underdeveloped, and the whole purpose of that subplot ends up being minimal.<br/><br/>All in all, the boldness of the stereotypes at the core of almost each character made me believe there would be plenty of sardonic humour aimed at millennial bourgeois hipsters, but no, these are the characters populating the entire show, and none are likeable. NONE, besides Paco.<br/><br/>Whatever trace of an ambiguous dilemma it successfully achieved to create during the first few episodes is barely a flash in the pan, and fades away about as quickly as Beck and Joe's senselessness gets unveiled.

Frequently, they are people who haven't really seen enough episodes to form a well thought-out opinion on the series, the content, and the characters as a whole--especially, people who have only seen a few eps from season one. Season one is the most shallow end of the series. It really gives you no clue as to what the series ends up being. Believe me, it gets more intense and complicated and dark as it goes on. If you decide to give it a try, I suggest checking out a handful of episodes from season three on before passing judgment. Some good examples are S3--The Wish, Helpless, Doppelgangland, S4--Something Blue, Hush and Restless, S5--Fool for Love, Triangle, Weight of the World, The Gift (I'd also say The Body but that one gives too much away) S6--Bargaining, Tabula Rasa, Older and Far Away, S7--Beneath You, Selfless, Conversations With Dead People, The Killer In Me, Get It Done (I'd say Chosen but it's the series finale which also would give too much away).<br/><br/>About the show itself--Buffy is the antithesis of the \"pretty-blond-victim\" who runs from the \"psycho ax-murderer\" in horror films past--the girl who always twisted her ankle and fell in her attempt to get away. How many times did we see that scene and feel just a little bit disgusted with the victim for not even trying to fight back? How many times did we see that scene and feel disgusted with the directors for typing female victims in this way over and over again? Buffy, herself, isn't the \"traditional\" feminist TV icon. Many of those are women who have forfeited the ultra-feminine symbols of their gender--love, compassion and vulnerability in order to maintain equal footing with men. Buffy doesn't do this. Buffy embraces those symbols in one hand and hones and wields them to fight evil in the other.<br/><br/>The show appears as a bubble-gum program, aimed at teens and while it's fan-base is largely younger viewers (teens-twenties), it's major themes profoundly confront the more mature ideas of good vs. evil, life and death, friendship, religion, the soul and the true meanings of power and love in such a way that is rarely addressed in current entertainment. It challenges the traditional ideas of religion as being an \"institution\" and asserts that it is something to be lived, that real love requires self-sacrifice, that true friendship requires far-reaching forgiveness, that true power is rooted in love and compassion and that good and evil, while in shades of gray can still be defined.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "344 out of 379 found this helpful.", "date": "20 November 2009"}, {"title": " A review, 20 years later", "content": "I only started to watch Buffy recently, 20 years after the first episode was aired, got to say I am very impressed.

However, in this case, despite the huge technical disadvantages, Buffy still stands out as a serious and entertaining show, one of the best of its kind. The screen-play are well written, characters well developed, dialogues are actually interesting and thought provoking, plus great acting all around.

The same thing can be said for Batman, Superman and Spider-Man. Except, there is one important difference; Buffy is teenage girl.

A hundred plus years, and there's only one thing I've ever been sure of: you ... Here, look at me. I'm not asking you for anything. When I say \"I love you\", it's not because I want you, or because I can't have you. It has nothing to do with me. I love what you are. What you do, how you try. I've seen your kindness and your strength. I've seen the best and the worst of you. And I understand, with perfect clarity, exactly what you are. You're a hell of a woman. You're the One, Buffy.\" <br/><br/>If you have written Buffy off to be a load of feminist crap with a ludicrous title, well, you'd only be right. Minus the crap part. The show also offers violent, dramatic and well choreographed fight sequences, witty dialogue and popular cultural references, some diverse and beloved character, subtext (both subtle and obvious) and well- thought out story arches with a BIG finale.

What you need to know...", "content": "People who've seen this series don't need to be told whether it's good or not, so this review is solely for the uninitiated, i.e. someone trying to decide whether to invest the time in a seven season series. Here's what to consider.<br/><br/>This was rated, when originally aired, as TV-14 programming, but it is far from your typical YA drivel. It covered a full spectrum of emotional, violent, and sexual content, over its seven season arc. Ignoring the sex, and just considering the human (non-\"creature\") body count, I'm amazed at what the showrunners were able to get aired over the course of the series. Bottom line, there's a lot of \"intense\" content throughout the series, and it gets far more graphic in the latter seasons.<br/><br/>Any fantasy, supernatural, or SciFi series fails or succeeds on its \"believability\". I don't mean the plots, but instead, whether the characters project believability. If it \"works\", it will stem from a combination of well scripted episodes, but far more important, a cast that buys into, and fully \"sells\" (110%), their characters. BtVS had all of that in spades. Whether it is their witty banter, a plethora of deeply emotional scenes, or the larger story arcs of the seasons, and/or the overall series, as a whole, these characters are \"all in\", in terms of their commitment to the stories being told, within their \"fantastical universe\".<br/><br/>Throughout the series, there are always multiple (concurrent) story arcs in play. Some, especially toward the end, are even multi-seasonal. Certainly, simply because it is episodic, there is a \"monster (or problem) of the week\" feel, all through the series, but those stories are generally unique and interesting, and many of those play into the larger (and more important) story arcs.<br/><br/>In the first three seasons, the characters are in high school, and many of the plots revolve around that setting (but always with the fantasy-based twist), while the final four seasons move out into the adult world. We basically get to watch these characters grow up throughout the full series arc, and as alluded to earlier, the plots become increasingly more \"raw/intense\" as the series moves forward.<br/><br/>The most important thing is that, even from the first season, it is easy to become vested in the core suite of characters. And, when season two takes what seems to be a somewhat stable set of core characters, and turns their situation \"on its head\", you realize that you cannot count on anything being \"stable\", and consequently, can't really predict what might happen in subsequent episodes (which, obviously, is a \"good thing\", from a story-telling perspective).<br/><br/>Some of the later (especially season 5 and 6) story arcs are heart-wrenching, and easily some of the best \"TV drama\" that has ever been aired. Some of the episodes are also some of the creepiest that have ever been aired. The series is a constant mix of many different storytelling genres, which just happen to exist in the (fantasy-based) \"Buffyverse\". Unlike some series that fizzled out near their end (or simply got canceled), this series really reached its peak in its final three seasons, just continuously \"upping the ante\", until its epic finale. I own the series, and (roughly) every two or three years, I drag out the discs, and re-binge the whole thing, because of \"Buffy withdrawal\". It's always feels good to (yet again) watch it all play out, over the characters' seven year arc.<br/><br/>BtVS is \"not perfect\". There are some episodes that are (IMHO) duds (\"Beer\" comes to mind), and there is at least one story arc that I thought had a bit too much silliness, but \"as a whole\", it is easily one of the best TV series, and runs you through the full emotional gamut.<br/><br/>Bottom line, assuming that you \"accept\" a fantasy/SciFi premise in the first place (as you would with a \"Star Trek\", a \"Fringe\", or any similar series), then BtVS is truly a great series (for people of any age... and I'm \"North of 60\", as I write this), and I believe, well worth your time investment.<br/><br/>One major caution: The first two episodes of season 5 are a major \"WTF moment\". During its original airing, some viewers (literally) stopped watching the series after seeing those episodes, and also wrote online rants about their disappointment with what happens (avoid reading the episode synopses to avoid spoilers). Those episodes definitely DO leave you asking \"WTF\", but I would simply say that you MUST have faith, and \"trust your tour guide\" (i.e. the screenwriters), and settle in for the season 5 \"ride\", which, as I alluded to above, is an emotional roller coaster, with an \"unexpected\" season finale that sets up a similarly emotional season 6.<br/><br/>One final note, depending on where you obtain media, and/or from where you stream it, seasons 4-7 may or may not be wide-screen. The latter seasons were shot on 35mm, whereas the first three were shot on 16mm. Even though the entire series aired in the old (narrow) 1:1.33 (original NTSC TV) aspect ratio, and even though Joss Whedon argues that the whole series should be seen that way, I respectfully disagree. I always relish getting to Season 4, where (with my UK DVD versions) the whole series opens up, and fills up the full 16x9 (modern) wide screen. Scenes, and \"people\", that would have been partially \"cropped\" (or shifted) in the narrow format, are simply seen \"in full\".<br/><br/>So, hopefully some of the above is useful, if you are considering the series. It is definitely a unique experience.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "35 out of 38 found this helpful.", "date": "16 June 2018"}, {"title": " If the apocalypse comes, beep me.", "content": "I started watching Buffy when it was almost finished.

Despite the wacky premise of a highschool-girl hunting vampires, i had great fun watching it. I liked the characters. Buffy, the titular character herself was a lot more fleshed out than i expected, and by the end of the first season, i had a feeling that i kinda related to her. How many times can a man in his mid-twenties say that he relates to a highschool girl that kills vampires? The secondary characters were even better, they were relatable, they were funny and you could really feel with them. The dialogue and jokes were brilliant, i laughed out loud quite some times. When the story got tragic, most memorable in the episode \"the body\", i couldn't help but cry a little with the protagonists, something that happens to me very rarely in movies or series. I even feel kinda sad just writing about it right now. Other episodes like \"Hush\" got really scary, something i deemed impossible in a series mainly for teenagers. Of course, some episodes are not as good as others, but the self-awareness, the tongue-in-cheek humour, the characters and sheer creativity of many of the episodes makes easily up for it.

The show tells the story of a young high school student that is destined to be a destroyer of demons, vampires and just about any other monster that you can think of. Buffy Summers is a high school student who when faced with insurmountable odds comes out on top every time.

I believe that Buffy has something for everyone.<br/><br/>Season 1- Great opening season. The Scooby gang form an unbreakable bond from the moment you witness them on screen together. Xander and Giles are great and the character of Willow is absolutely adorable.The episode when every student's nightmares came true is a particular favorite of mine.

The main cast meet together to solve mysteries and, obviously, vanquish the undead--this earns them the reputation of being Buffy and her Scoobie Gang.<br/><br/>What makes the character Buffy prominent is that she is the exact opposite of the hero these type of television programs and movies popularized previous to this show. Being a slayer gives a girl increased speed, dexterity, stamina, strength, and acuity / alertness of nearby vampires. For the show to explore this unlikely avenue is what gives it the distinction of being completely different from anything before it. Although some might not be willing to suspend disbelief to see Buffy as a heroine, she stands for progressiveness in everyone. Buffy's story has a huge arch that many can relate to, from chosen one to leader.<br/><br/>The show itself is timeless, although some of the early episodes coincide with the advent of the internet and at times you will be watching and yell at the screen \"Use your bleeping cell phone!\" (cell phones weren't used mainstream by teens until after 2000). This show was slightly ahead of its time in some regards, where you may think some plot lines were lifted from something like The Matrix in episodes that were actually released a good year before it hit theaters.<br/><br/>The stories are quite good, and what I enjoyed most about this show is that the writers actually throw a lot of curve balls at you when you might decide what the outcome will likely be.

The only time when it feels dated is when it utilises CGI beyond \"dusting\" vamps, and possibly with some of the larger costumed monsters. Outside of those exceptions, this show hinges on a solid cast and excellent story telling. The characters are so diverse and shine in their own right despite the title being \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\". Over the course of the 7 seasons, each character is tested and has their own sub-plot, which generates an incredible development. Some stories will make you laugh, others will make you cry. Regardless, you truly develop a connection with each character and this is something that I feel is lacking in many TV shows today. The other obvious feature is the cast is very female-heavy. However, unlike some of the recent attempts (Ghostbusters...), it doesn't do it for the sake of it. The female cast is strong without trying to be feminist and that is a prominent reason as to why this show was so successful.<br/><br/>What I also loved about this show is the sheer variety of the episodes. Some were very serious and dedicated to the plot. However, the next episode could have a completely different stand-alone premise that could be hilarious, cringey or even scary. It was great, and even the \"worst\" episodes (by their IMDb ratings anyway) were entertaining to me. I appreciated the variety and found it made it even easier to binge watch.<br/><br/>Taken together, this TV show is one for the ages.

The Mayor, Richard Wilkins, is absolutely brilliant as a humorous villain that harbors rogue slayer Faith who is sexy, charming and rebellious for all the wrong reasons that the audience, especially the male viewers, cannot resist. It's a real beauty especially in the final battle of the season with some killer CGI considering we're still in the 90's on low-budget television and worlds away from the latest blockbuster to hit the theaters. <br/><br/>Season 4 is really all about change for me and it works effortlessly on improving Buffy's character and her relationships with those around her as they are challenges through distance, loneliness, new fears and a new boyfriend (Thanks to this change we get the near-equally astonishing spin off \"Angel\"). Personally, I don't find the 'Adam' villain too compelling but this season works as one that sees characters grow in preparation of a daring move that only four years on the air would allow that comes early season 5.<br/><br/>That change is season 5 is the inclusion of a new character, Buffy's sister Dawn who audiences are led to believe has been in the show since season one. The new kid on the block isn't so new to the characters who act as if nothing's changed even though three months earlier Buffy was an only child and now has a fourteen year old sibling. The puzzle unfolds as a Hell God in the form of the lovable Glorificous, or Glory as she is more commonly known, looks to find the key to a dimensional portal that will basically get her home to her hell dimension whilst destroying Buffy's world in the process. Dawn turns out to be this key, planted in Buffy's life by monks but the real story here is that of sacrifice for a loved one and how far we will go to as humans to save the ones we treasure. In an unforeseen move, Buffy dies at the end of this season - the final shot revealing a tombstone acting as an obituary for the chosen one that is no more.<br/><br/>Season 6 returns with attitude and a new feel as Buffy's friends led by Willow, an increasingly powerful witch, raise her from the grave. It's not without its consequences though as the group struggles to reform once finding out they actually pulled Buffy from a 'happy place' similar to 'Heaven'. This contrasts their belief that Buffy was trapped in a hell dimension after her death. A musical episode reveals this all through song (one of my favorite hours of television ever), and from that point the series moves into a very dark place culminating in Buffy secretly having sex with enemy Spike on a regular basis (and being almost raped by him), Willow nearly destroying the world after losing control of her witch powers and Anya becoming a 'vengeance demon' once again after Xander left her at the wedding alter. This season is truly about maturing each character in order to push their characters beyond expectations and really cement the idea that high school is long gone, innocence and happiness are now much harder to maintain and in the real world, the line between good and evil is often blurred.<br/><br/>In Season 7, Spike has a soul and the end is near. It's a truly remarkable wrap-up season as you really get a full-circle feel from start to finish. The series ends on a tremendous note with Sunnydale destroyed and an era of Buffy's life not over, but complete. Finally, Buffy is not unique but one of many as, with help from Willow, she was able to empower thousands of young potential slayers to be just like her, as powerful as her, and fight the good fight as an army of triumphant good. <br/><br/>In closing, I give this a 10/10 because while it can be faulted, I cannot deny its impact on me as a person, it's brilliance as an original idea that paved the way for many shows and films to follow, and its inspirational characters and story-telling that continue to amaze me every time I watch it which I have done and will continue to do over and over again.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "15 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "16 April 2011"}, {"title": " Hooked!", "content": "All I can say is I was hooked from the get go.

But that was about it. I think I was just a little too young at the time to really grasp just how massive and important the show was, and how much it appealed to audiences of all ages. But as I grew older, I found myself gradually becoming more and more interested in the series, though I never quite had the time to finally hunker down and watch it from start to finish, outside of having seen most of the first three seasons while I was in college.<br/><br/>However, like many others this year during the current global pandemic, I opted to use my spare time while I was furloughed from work to catch up on movies and series that I've been meaning to watch. And \"Buffy\" was right at the top of my list. Over the course of four months, I gradually watched through the series in its entirety for the first time, along with its popular spin-off \"Angel.\"<br/><br/>And how was it? It was as outstanding as I ever could have hoped it would be! While it may be a bit dated at times, and while some seasons are stronger than others, I was shocked by just how well it held up, how relevant many of its themes still are, and just how darned entertaining the show is. This is one iconic series that still manages to thrill and enthrall even decades later!<br/><br/>Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Buffy Summers, who is seemingly just your ordinary teenage girl, worried about things like boys and homework. Except she's not just your ordinary girl-- she is \"the Slayer,\" a chosen one gifted with superhuman strength and agility, who is destined to do battle with vampires, demons and the forces of darkness! And together with her best friends Xander (Nicholas Brendon) and Willow (Alyson Hannigan), along with her \"Watcher\" Giles (Anthony Stewart Head), she must face non-stop adventure as her little town of Sunnydale is invaded by creatures and monsters over and over again.<br/><br/>While his credibility and star-power has faded over the last few years due to a slew of admittedly icky personal controversies, creator Joss Whedon and his crew of writers and directors crafted a wonderful and addictive series in \"Buffy.\" Deftly mixing creepiness with campiness, and drama with comedy, the show is a unique blend that is deeply satisfying to watch. Especially once you get passed the bumpy, lower-budget first season and into the much more refined remainder of the show. The series tackles timeless themes that many people face as they grow and age, and does it with a refreshing sense of wit and style. And it's just plain darned fun to watch thanks to the endlessly likable characters and sharp humor. Whedon is well-known for his stylized dialogue and for injecting clever gags into his works, and it's just splendid here. The show is absolutely hilarious, which helps even out the darker moments.<br/><br/>The cast is absolutely fantastic. Gellar makes for a compelling lead in Buffy, and it's a lot of fun to see how the character evolves over the seven seasons as she grows and changes. Gellar really knocks it out of the park-- there's a reason she's still beloved in this role. Brendon and Hannigan are absolutely phenomenal in their roles as Buffy's friends and allies in the war against darkness, and they add a lot of heart and humor to the show. Heck, at times they even overshadow Buffy- especially Hannigan. Anthony Stewart Head adds a sense of class to the proceedings and is a great deal of fun as Buffy's long-suffering teacher and advisor Giles. And a revolving door of supporting players add quite a bit to the series. Particularly notable are an excellent David Boreanez, a brilliant James Marsters, an adorable Emma Caulfield, a very likable Amber Benson, a hilarious Seth Green and a very solid Michelle Trachtenberg as various allies of our heroes who come and sometimes go over the seasons.<br/><br/>I also have to mention the general production of the series. While the effects are dated, and there is a definite sense of the early seasons being \"super 90's,\" the show is typically very well put together. The cinematography is quite excellent for its time, with later seasons still holding up quite well. The music is awesomely moody and sets the tone exceptionally well. And the production and creature design is usually top notch stuff.<br/><br/>Now before I wrap this up, I feel I should address one other thing. There seems to be almost a mandatory and prerequisite need to discuss the various seasons in these sorts of reviews. Because everyone has their opinions over what the \"best\" and \"worst\" seasons are. And I have to admit... I do have my own opinions. But the most important thing I have to say is, I don't think there are really any \"bad\" seasons of \"Buffy.\" Sure, some seasons are stronger than others, but I really enjoyed all seven for the most part, and see them all as vitally important pieces of the puzzle. So I wouldn't recommend skipping any of them, or stopping at a certain point. It's all worth seeing.<br/><br/>\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" is a magnificent series that still stands tall decades after its initial release. Its themes are still relevant, its characters are still likable, and it's still a blast and a half to watch. And it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10!

If the producers of this show are going to make The Equalizer a woman, that's okay of course, but they must understand that when it comes to iconic characters in original films, especially successful characters such as The Equalizer, these characters have already made their mark.

However, the initial trailer promised a bit more than the overall project delivered. Was hoping the series would be strictly a psychological thriller, based on the frailty of the mind and the fracture of relationship/bonds when put under tremendous stress. <br/><br/>To me the supernatural elements did not add any real tension. Mostly because the creature's motives and the rules in which it could attack were never thoroughly explained. I know at the basic level, the creature attacks those who infringe upon nature (its dominion) and all that. But, it did not feel like the main antagonist or threat to the men's survival. The battles against the natural elements, the growing madness/sickness amongst the men, and the dismantling of the power system were just more interesting and tension driving.<br/><br/>Perhaps, if the monster's origins or relationship to the land/natives were explained a bit more. Or (since the creature is a spirit of some sort) was shown to be more calculating in its actions, it might have been a more compelling aspect to the story. But, as is, the creature gains no understanding or sympathy from the audience. The whole \"humans meddling with nature/status quo reaps disastrous results\" falls flat. That point only works if the audience can see the situation from both sides. \nWe mostly get to see the crew's version, their constant suffering, and without any real realization as to why they are put through said suffering. So, nature just seems to be the villain/bully.\nEven the natives seem to live in fear of the creature, so the point that man can learn a different way seems mute, as well. The creature is just something that must be avoided or sated.\nSo, what I think might be the lesson or point, at least in regards to the mystical elements, becomes a bit muddled.<br/><br/>Streamlining the story, focusing the plots solely on the obstacles of survival (mentally, physically, and through moral dilemmas) would have made this series simply spectacular.

Coupled with a backdrop of corporate America, it seemed like a show right up my alley. I had absolutely no idea that the show would exceed my expectations by a large mile.<br/><br/>Not since The Sopranos have I seen an interplay of character dynamics this good, especially the toxic traits of those characters. Every little interaction is important, and affects another character on some or the other level significantly. Succession makes sure that behind the gaudy, showy nature of the Roy family, the ugliness of their existence is visible to you, even in the most subtle ways. The show both revels in and critiques the world it bases itself in. And I don't remember a character-driven drama being this thrilling. Hostile takeovers are usually not exciting to people uninterested in the financial world, but this show makes sure you understand the stakes involved. Like, Breaking Bad-level of tense.<br/><br/>Of course, much of this is possible because of the phenomenal cast. I want Jeremy Strong to win an Emmy this year so badly. Kendall Roy is one of the most brilliant (and surprisingly sympathetic) characters I've seen, a mixture of Christopher Moltisanti and Jesse Pinkman, with a slice of your average venture capitalist. I just hope it doesn't typecast him as a Wall Street-type, although I love him in The Big Short too. I want him to win more than Brian Cox, who scares the living daylights out of me as Logan Roy when he merely enters a room. Then there's Sarah Snook as the prideful Shiv, an excellent, pitch-perfect arc like no other. And my man Kieran Culkin as the foul-mouthed-but-concerned Roman, another truly surprising sympathetic turn. And of course, when I talk about Roman, I will talk about Gerri, a role that actress J Smith Cameron absolutely kills, and should have received an Emmy nomination for. And this paragraph is incomplete without my love for Matthew McFadyen and Nicholas Braun in the most hilariously paired people that are Tom and (cousin) Greg since Chris and Paulie Walnuts.<br/><br/>Succession doesn't mince words (or chicken hahahaha). Nothing on the script feels wasted. And the insults are ingenious. As long as Jesse Armstrong remains showrunner, this show will surprise us in the most insane of ways. The research shows (the writers' room is apparently asked to read the Financial Times everyday), and it adds to the authenticity of the show, one which I appreciate. I would also be stupid not to talk about the best original opening theme I have ever heard in any TV show. Nicholas Britell has made a masterful score which does not sound excessive at all. Much like in Mr Robot, the score amplifies the mood.<br/><br/>If you're watching Succession, don't be thrown off by the first 2 episodes of the show (I actually like them). Give it time, because by the 6th episode you'll probably fall off your bed. And come season 2 (which I consider one of the greatest executions of anything in television history because it's flawless), you'll drop your jaw every 25-30 minutes of screentime, which is basically every halftime moment of an episode.<br/><br/>Succession deserves every honor coming its way. HBO has landed another absolute winner in its roster, one that will likely age extremely well with a season or two and be compared to the other Golden Age dramas of this generation. Yes, by that, I mean shows like Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Leftovers, and maybe, just maybe, The Wire and The Sopranos. Good call on ditching Westworld for marketing this, HBO. This is arguably going to be my favorite deconstruction of capitalism right now.<br/><br/>I can't wait for season 3 at all. I'm just going to rewatch season 2 till then. All the white kids fight for a kiss from daddy, and that might not sell the show a lot.

The Valley of Fear has hardly ever been dramatised for the same reason. <br/><br/>The second is that this is Conan Doyle's first attempt and he introduced significant character changes to both Holmes and Watson in the short stories. Holmes, in A Study in Scarlet, is rather more deranged, more like Cumberbatch's Holmes than Brett's, much more an aggressive, painful thorn in the side of the police rather than the unseen assistant of later stories.<br/><br/>So people who haven't read the book or have only seen Holmes on screen need to give this a bit of time. 21C technology aside, it's actually quite a faithful adaptation, even though they ditched the back story and gave the murderer another, more credible motive. <br/><br/>Knowledge of the original isn't at all necessary, but it does change the viewpoint. While some were congratulating themselves on beating Holmes to the punch in spotting the profession of the murderer, readers of the original were being conned into believing that his next victim was going to be the American he was driving (the victims in the original are all American). In the original, the word 'Rache' appears at the crime scene, also in an empty house in Lauriston Gardens, written in blood. The police jump to the conclusion that the victim was trying to write the word 'Rachel'. Holmes knows that 'Rache' is German for revenge. Moffat turns it neatly and humorously around. In the original it's a red herring, in the new version, it's a vital clue. These riffs on the original abound and are almost always imaginative and amusing and often more than that. Mycroft as Sherlock's Big Brother, for example.<br/><br/>Moffat and Gatiss treat the characters with all the loving respect that an author could wish for and serve up an adaptation which re-imagines everything that Conan Doyle put into his plots and yet delivers something very close to to their original purpose and effect. Holmes and Watson are products of their time, as they should be, but they are recognisably the descendants and inheritors of the originals.

Benedict Cumberbatch (what a name!) brings a dark edginess to Holmes that gives the whole piece a delightful 'gothic' feel, while Martin Freeman - if the first episode is anything to go by - will make a perfect foil as Watson. Casting is so important and this combination feels just right.<br/><br/>I'll always have a soft spot for Basil Rathbone's Holmes, and, on the small screen at least, I can't see anyone displacing Jeremy Brett as the definitive 'Victorian' sleuth. But maybe, just maybe, the writers have created a Sherlock for the modern age who will stand the test of time and join a handful of other portrayals in the Pantheon of the greats.<br/><br/>Moffat's pedigree as a comedy writer has added a new layer to the Holmes' scenario, and though there were several in-jokes in the first episode that only Holmes' aficionados would appreciate, there was enough general humour to lighten what might otherwise have been a dark canvas.<br/><br/>Of course, I shouldn't have had any doubts. Steven Moffat is, after all, the man who rescued Dr Who from the self-indulgent, soap-opera obsessed, poorly scripted, moribund years of Russell T Davies and turned it back into a fun-packed joy to watch.

Brilliant indeed!", "content": "When someone pointed me to Sherlock- a new series on BBC I was, to say the least, a bit skeptical. On top of that, I was told that this Sherlock lived in London in 2010 and was fond of texting on his Blackberry and hosted a website? Color me confused! But I gave it a looksie \u2013after all how bad could it be- Holmes is Holmes. On screen appears a lanky young fellow in a trench coat, getting high on nicotine patches who I am supposed to believe is Sherlock Holmes? This was, as far from my favorite pipe smoking, deer hunting cap wearing image of Holmes, as it could be. I rolled my eyes-this is going to be cheesy. But then in one swift sequence \" the lanky young Holmes\" in his first meeting with John Watson describes him, his profession , his relationship with his brother and his brother's marital status-all by one look at his cell phone (that's right his cell phone). BANG! I was hooked. This is Sherlock Holmes through and through.<br/><br/>And that in essence is why Sherlock is so, so good. Holmes is not about the Victorian costumes and the environment in which the mysteries unfold. It's about the characters and the events that make the stories the defining mystery novels of so many generations. And Steven Moffat &amp; Mark Gatiss' take on Conan Doyle's master detective captures the essence of Sherlock Holmes magnificently. The stories are essentially the same (the first episode-A Study in Pink is a take on A Study in Scarlet-the first Holmes novel) but given a contemporary twist. This contemporary take (which I thought was going to be cheesy initially) is what shows the duo's exemplary creativity. The modern outlook does not take away anything from the essence of Sherlock Holmes- it adds to it. The three 90 minute episodes breeze past you at a breath taking speed- challenging your intelligence and making you yearn for more. The episodes have distinctly dark and brutal settings but are also filled with moments of wry humor that make the experience completely satisfying. The concept of using images and visual pointers in the scenes were Holmes makes his superb deductions is excellent and helps the viewer see and think with the ace detective.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Benedict Cumberbatch is not the kind of guy who would strike you as Sherlock Holmes when you meet him in a street, but man, does he own the show! Oozing charisma, Cumberbatch plays the Holmes character to a tee-arrogant, self centered, brilliant genius. There is an air of superiority about Holmes that makes him pity the vacant minds that don't see and understand the things which seem so obvious to him and Cumberbatch brings that out beautifully. Martin Freeman as John Watson on the other hand plays a perfect foil to Cumberbatch's eccentric genius-the everyday man. Looking for meaning and purpose after returning from the War in Iraq, Watson gets swept into Holmes' mad cap world of brilliance and chaos. Freeman's earnest and subtle performance complements Cumberbatch's Holmes beautifully.<br/><br/>Sherlock though, is not about acting performances. It's about bringing the experience of the world of Sherlock Holmes to the world we live in. Moffat and Gattis recreate the world of the Victorian detective in a completely new setting and do it superbly.

Think again. The more things change...", "content": "As a die-hard fan of the source material, I have tracked down and went through nearly every radio, television, film, and comic book interpretation of Sherlock Holmes - which run a mean gamut regarding quality, as you probably already know - and so I approached this incarnation skeptical but sanguine. Doubtful it would match the eminent Jeremy Brett series in quality, but hopeful it might preserve Conan's tone - something I think that series did well and the Downey Jr. movie did not.<br/><br/>To my surprise, and delight, this show just so happens to be the bomb-diggity. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Ever notice how lots of Agatha Christie fans complain when screenwriters change Poirot and Marple stories? I'm not one of them. I like new and different interpretations of those stories because otherwise, in the case of literary characters brought on screen, what's the point? What's the point if we film and re-film the same story, the same story which we've already read once, twice, maybe three times? Especially in many cases, what's the point when it's been done so perfectly before? In the case of Sherlock Holmes, The Hound of the Baskervilles has been filmed at least 24 times according to Wikipedia. So another iteration won't thrill me. However, one that takes liberties with the source material, i.e. bringing the characters into the 21st century, I'm all for it. Surprise me. That's what I say.<br/><br/>And there are two things I really love about this series. 1) For longtime fans there are many, many \"Easter eggs\" to discover in each episode. And, best of all, 2) My boyfriend loves this series. And I can't pay him to watch a Jeremy Brett episode. He did enjoy the Downey Jr. movie (as did I, I just prefer a less swashbuckling Holmes - one reason among many that I didn't love the film), but he's never excited to watch Sherlock anything. This series is different. He loves it. For any Sherlock fan that would like to get their significant others on the band wagon, this is a great gateway. (And my boyfriend's actually a very good barometer for high-quality mainstream television shows. Usually, if something's firing on all cylinders, he knows it. More risky fare - he's off-put.)<br/><br/>And, you may rightly ask, why should I give a crap what my boyfriend likes? Good question. I happen to be of the mind that TV and film can accomplish what my favorite art form - literature - cannot. The TV and film experience can be enjoyed by a group. Sure, book clubs discuss books, but with TV and film you and whomever you want to hang out with, experience story at the exact same time, in real time, and you can easily observe each other's initial, unguarded reactions. Plain and simple, it's fun to enjoy the mediums with others - to laugh together, to be scared, sad, thrilled, etc. It enhances the experience. I think literature's strength is the opposite. For me, the best thing about settling into a good book is that I'm alone. Just me and the test, together making up a story.<br/><br/>Well, if anybody has read this far, I apologize for the rant.

That was half an hour before he figured it out (and even that is being generous with him, considering Sherlock didn't actually figure out who did it in the end, the guy literally showed up in his doorstep and confessed).

Episode 02 \u2013 Sherlock risks getting himself killed (various styles) in order to fall back into John's good graces. Archvillain is only a plot device. Episode 03 \u2013 There is a Holmes sister!! A madwoman in the attic!!! (And an incendiary to boost, Jane Eyre rolls eyeballs)<br/><br/>And granted, tongue-in-cheek is hard to keep up when there's so much personal drama all around you. The game is not on, life's become much too bitter for that. Perhaps that's why Sherlock's stoned most of the time. <br/><br/>The characters are there, the camaraderie is there, but the clever deductions and the suspense are not. No mystery. The greatest enigma about Culverton, for me, was \u2013 how come a British billionaire must have these rotten teeth? From the onset, Sherlock knew he was a bad guy (who would not know, I mean, with those TEETH??) No deductive process necessary. Everything is a bit too heavy in self-referencing. To me, Mary's death was completely pointless and needless, even though she did die in Doyle's original material. But there she wasn't really a key character, was she? A mother of a toddler jumps in front of a bullet to save her husband's best friend?? Even if said mother is a highly trained agent whose superpower instincts just kicked in that second, credibility is heavily strained here. <br/><br/>Most of all, Moriarty is video recording telepathically controlled by a prisoner?? (That's the closes I came to understanding it.) After all that cliffhanger stuff at the end of season three, (brilliant footage and after-credits!) - Sherlock was brought back because Moriarty is back but then he isn't? Continuity gods, where are you?? <br/><br/>Like most fans, I'd been waiting for a LONG time. I think we deserved more. There must be better sources of inspiration in the Doyle canon. Conclusion: c'mon BBC, you owe us the fifth season to make up for this weak stuff.

The reason this show is so ground breaking is the fact that it has used split screen cameras, and a real time format to create the element of a quality made show.<br/><br/>The show follows the worst days of likable, down-to-earth hero Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) and each episode chronicles every hour of the day, and is shot in real-time. What makes this show so unique are the character relationships, the shows writing and the attention to detail.Whether the shows themes are about kidnappings, bomb threats, personal vendettas, assassinations, or terrorist attacks the themes are handled in such a compelling way that the viewer is hooked at every jump and turn.<br/><br/>The viewers really learn to care about Jack as we learn more about his life and his past. Kiefer Sutherland was perfect for the role as Jack Bauer, so much that many people describe him as \"born for the role\". Dennis Haysbert does a superb acting job as Sen David Palmer and the show has an excellent group of characters who make the support team of the show and these include Carols Bernard as Tony and Elisha Cuthbert as Kim Bauer. A big bonus of the show is that 24 is constantly surprising viewers in unexpected moments, and you never know what to expect on the show. Anything can and does happen.<br/><br/>The scripts on this show are top class and they deserve a mention in their own right. The attention to detail as I mentioned earlier is prominent with the real time aspect of the show. There are very rarely any mistakes with the time aspect of the show, and this is a strength of the show. The show always uses multiple split screen camera shots and this is innovative work because it helps to make the show seem realistic and also in real time. You will also see most of the camera focused on Jacks point of view and this is to make the show from a humans point of view and it helps to bring the viewer more involved in the show.<br/><br/>The story may change; new characters may arrive and leave but one thing always stays the same; the underlying story of the show is about one mans fight to do what is right. If there is a bad aspect to this show it may be that some of the action sequences are a bit too predictable, but this is rare and should not detach from the viewers viewing pleasure of the show.

The second 8, yeah ok I'm still watching every Monday @ 8:30. Twists and turns seem to be happening with more &amp; more regularity, but I'm still clued up to the plot, haven't lost track. Last 8 hours I'm thinking \"What the hells going on?!?!\". No, I haven't become disoriented and confused, I'm just wondering when did this show go from being reasonably believable to becoming logically incomprehensible?!?!<br/><br/>I trace it back to the episode where the car rolls down the hill and explodes and Jacks wife, thinking her daughter has just died, collapses in shock then wakes up and spends the next few episodes in trauma-induced amnesia. From this point on the show is trying to constantly top itself from episode to episode with \"most unbelievable twist\". Up until then, perfect. Between the hours of 12am &amp; 10am it's got a sharply executed plot that could frighteningly ring true, all the characters (good and bad) are believable. It also gives the viewers enough time to get their bearings, to take in the consequences of what's unfolding before them. The betrayals, the red herrings.<br/><br/>After 10am it lapses dramatically. The show seems to become too smart for it's own good. It piles one twist on top of another without giving any time to work out how it all fits together. [WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER] I wasn't at all surprised that it turned out to be the head female agent (I forget her name) who was the traitor. One could see it coming a mile away. Not because the clues were apparent, just because there was no other real character to logically pin it on. Then having done that, having made that decision, I was left thinking of all the previous episodes and wondering \"How?!?!\", it didn't make sense.<br/><br/>The reason I was gripped by this show was first and foremost because it was intelligent and believable. Secondly because of the (cutting edge for U.S tv) narrative structure and direction. This all fails once the 2nd half becomes nothing more than a popcorn flick. If it had started out that way or maintained the initial equilibrium it kicked itself off with, I would've enjoyed it more. The change from one to the other is what ruined it for me.

When part of the thrill is seeing how the creative team behind this concept can successfully juggle all the story \"balls\" they're keeping in the air each week, how can this show possibly survive, when it's competing against such Top Ten 'gems' as TEMPTATION ISLAND 2, SURVIVOR and FEAR FACTOR?<br/><br/>The split screen work has been compared to that of De Palma's in his heyday, but I think it actually hearkens back to what Richard Fleischer did with THE BOSTON STRANGLER. The splintered pictures are even more effective than the digital readout in conveying that everywhere, at any time, the clock is running out for somebody, and the suspense of seeing how things will turn out is the greatest pleasure of each episode. But because you have to THINK about the story lines and keep each one in mind along with its relation to the others, may be why I fear it will not last into the end of the next television season. Spoiler Alert The core story is this: Federal agent Jack Bauer (a very excellent Kiefer Sutherland, used well for a change) has 24 hours to thwart an assassination attempt that will be made on the life of Senator David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert, a refugee from the cancelled NOW AND AGAIN, another show too smart and creative for its own good). Palmer is the first Black man who stands a chance of getting THISCLOSE to the White House, and a lot of people don't want to see that happen. The Tom Clancy-ish kicker is that the terrorist group responsible for staging the hit, has a mole inside the agency that Jack works for. To prevent the assassination attempt from being successful, Bauer has to find out who it is.<br/><br/>Not easy when you realize this is \"government intelligence\" that Jack is dealing with. Even more difficult for him, since he blew the whistle on some corrupt fellow agents, and now at least half of the people he works with consider him lower than dog poop on the bottom of their shoes. From this main story, all the other plot threads are spun, and they range from gripping to bathetically soap-operatic:<br/><br/>*In the midst of all of this, Jack has been struggling to rebuild his relationship with his estranged family, wife Terri (Leslie Hope) and daughter Kim (Elisha Cuthbert). Just as it looks like they might be making some progress, Kim sneaks out and goes partying with a friend, not realizing that the \"party dudes\" they're with are actually part of the Palmer conspiracy, and the plans they have for the girls, (Terri in particular) are dark indeed. This story splits off into yet TWO other plot threads, as the girls, realizing their situation, try to escape their captors, while Terri Bauer scours the city looking for Kim, aided by the father of Kim's friend (Richard Burgi from UPN's THE SENTINEL.)<br/><br/>*Jack's search for the agency mole is further complicated by his strained relationship with co-worker and ex-lover Nina Myers (Sarah Clarke) and his OTHER co-worker and Nina's current lover, Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard). Everybody has an agenda that may have nothing to do with the Palmer crisis, making it even more difficult for Jack to find out who the terrorist cell has on the inside. Add to the escalating and shifting evidence and alliances the possibility that one of Jack's high-ranking bosses, George Mason (Xander Berkeley) might be dirty as well.<br/><br/>*Meanwhile, David Palmer's got some considerable issues of his own to sort out, with staying alive both physically and politically at the top of the list. A late night call sends him and his crisis team into overdrive, as he attempts to ride herd on a rumor that may destroy his chance at the Presidency more effectively than a bullet to the heart. A reporter is threatening to print a story about Palmer's son, (Vicellous Shannon), who may have murdered the man responsible for raping his sister a few years ago. Mounting evidence may even prove that the story is true, and if it is, how can Palmer reconcile his ethics and the urge to protect his family with the need to win?<br/><br/>*Meanwhile, Ira Gaines (Michael Massee), the mastermind behind the terrorist cell is not finding all going as smoothly as planned. Skilled expert Mandy (Mia Kirshner) finds herself in more hot water than she's ever had to deal with, when her lesbian lover and partner decides to renege on a crucial piece of information needed by Gaines to advance their plans in exchange for more money. (This situation is swiftly resolved, and it's not pretty.) Then the two slackers hired by Gaines nearly botch Kim's kidnapping, and Gaines also has to resolve this issue in classically drastic fashion. The way things are going, the 'no-honor-among-thieves' rule could very possibly implode the cell before their hired gun ever gets Palmer in his sights...<br/><br/>And so it goes. Somehow writers/creators Robert Cochran and Joel Surnow have managed to take the best and the pulpiest conventions of tales of espionage and intrigue, and integrate them into a show that alternates between maddeningly slow and unbearably gripping. But whatever flaws it may have, it does have the advantage of making you THINK and PAY ATTENTION at all times, even when nothing seems to be happening.<br/><br/>And when you're comparing that to a show where the most pressing issue is whether Muffy will go to bed with Steve and betray her fianc\u00e9e Josh, I fear that soon enough, 24 may become yet another classic case of great TV that becomes cult TV; a sad reflection of our times, and what now passes for entertainment.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "43 out of 60 found this helpful.", "date": "15 December 2001"}, {"title": " 24 is the best drama television has ever seen", "content": "This is the most creative, intelligent, well-written, unpredictable, and suspenseful program that I have ever seen, and this is coming from a man who watches a lot of television.<br/><br/>Throughout its four seasons, 24 provides a cliff hanger at the end of most episodes to keep you attached and has provided some of the most unpredictable twists that I have ever seen, including the ultimate shocker at the end of the first season (which I won't go into because somebody may read this before watching the first season). <br/><br/>As far as acting goes, there isn't a weak-link on the show.

Here are seven of the most irritating.<br/><br/>1) When minor characters are introduced, you wonder when they'll be killed or written out. One notable example is the anthrax scare in either Season Two or Three. The kid who is supposedly carrying the virus and his family take up a lot of screen time while it advances the main plot, but then they are written out and never mentioned again. In the end you don't really care about any minor role, and when minor characters are filling up a significant proportion of the screen time you have a problem.<br/><br/>2) It becomes tiresome to see the incompetence of the CTU team. If they're not having endless trouble with double agents of one kind or another, they're bickering and being insubordinate like children. Even in Season Six they have this problem. Milo and the bald man with the British accent, being broken up from fighting by Chloe. Completely unprofessional especially for a supposed national agency. It's surprising they can get anything done.<br/><br/>3) It seems that too often when Jack Bauer breaks with procedure people go on as normal. Rarely is it mentioned that his unorthodox methods of working could jeopardise everything; the team just goes with it. And it's also very convenient that Jack always knows the president and/or some of the cabinet on informal terms, so they'll give him some leeway.<br/><br/>4) Occasionally I get the feeling that the series is some form of propaganda. The villains always seem to be Serbian, or Iraqi, or from other Middle Eastern territories. Even in Season Six where Bauer starts working with someone of this origin, it is not before we are filled in that he was once a terrorist himself. Also in that season, the character Ahmed is saved by an American man only to betray him later, by taking him and his family hostage. To me this seems to promote the idea that your Middle Eastern neighbours can't be trusted and always feel they are victims of inequality, which is completely unacceptable.<br/><br/>5) The implausibility of everything I can often stomach. But sometimes they just take it too far and the suspension of disbelief is stretched and snapped. I'll use Season Six as an example as it's fresh in my mind. Episode Two is awful. The part where the lawyer deletes personnel files from a computer within a large organisation. Are we to assume that the place has no backup server, or no hard copies kept safe somewhere else in the building? Also from that episode there is a man who attempts to suicide bomb a subway train. And how does he decide to do this? By sitting on the last seat of the final carriage of that train. For maximum collateral damage it would make sense to sit in the middle carriage! Then it turns out he was only sitting there so Jack Bauer could save the day by kicking him through the door, out of the train.<br/><br/>6) The use of set pieces can be annoying. It can appear that when the plot gets too mundane or slow-moving the problem can be solved by throwing in an explosion, collision or death of some kind: that seems to be a de rigueur standard for the show. It helps the audience forget that the plot was snail's pace beforehand.<br/><br/>7) What's going on with the villains? They get captured and then they escape. They often seem incredibly stupid, and without contingency plans of any kind. There are times they could be captured before they commit some atrocity, or destroy some seemingly vital piece of evidence, but this doesn't happen. This leads me to think, from time to time, that the villains are stupid and the CTU team progressively more so.<br/><br/>Those are the negatives that annoy me the most, and probably annoy quite a few other casual viewers. What the show does have in it's favour is an iconic, modern Jame Bond-style hero. A slick and always suspense laden veneer with a heavy overtone of drama (sometimes melodrama, of course). Occasionally the show clicks and the implausibility seems natural like the implausibility of life etc, and the audience is kept guessing and also given a satisfying conclusion, with not too many silly subplots.<br/><br/>I've given the show a low rating because it too often misses the target, like a lot of the bad guys. But when it hits it can hit hard, being thought-provoking and stimulating like all the best art.

The writer's didn't overlook the shows characters and have special places for each one.<br/><br/>For those like me that love the concept of time travel and paradoxes, this show is like a stimulant to the brain and tickles your mind. It's mental munchies and also serves as mental foreplay.<br/><br/>Season 2 finally scratches that itch at the roof of your mouth that for so long, your tongue couldn't quite reach.<br/><br/>This season proves that the writer's know exactly what their doing. The way this show deals with the \"time-travel paradox\" is utterly flawless. I realize how hard it is to get it right and not have so many plot holes and terrible plot devices and that's why I appreciate this show so much.<br/><br/>Dark is on another level than anything I've ever seen before!<br/><br/>This series is a masterpiece, there's no doubt about it.

The narrative is mind-bending and utterly complex, but you could see how well it has been planned and how much time has been put into the production and creation of this show.\nThere are various reasons that make this show a fantastic series that is bound to mess with your mind, for sure. Now, science fiction is not everyone's cup of tea, and that is understandable, but trust me Dark really takes it up a notch. And if my words still hasn't convinced you to watch it yet, I hope the following few points can.<br/><br/>1. The Characters and Their Arcs<br/><br/>Dark has a whole lot of characters, I won't lie. And for someone who dislikes too many characters, this might pose as a bit of a challenge, but it is all worth it. None of the characters are purely saints, and that is the best part of this show. There is no good and evil, but rather a realistic fact that good and evil resides in everyone. We are all the heroes and also villains in the story, one way or the other. It is compelling to see how as viewers, you are confronted with your own initial prejudices and views about the characters, and how they change along with the progress of the show. It will make you so conflicted till the point that you're not sure who is wrong and who is right, and you'll empathise with them all, for sure. This is how the characters are crafted in the show, and it makes it very difficult to choose favourites.<br/><br/>2. The Plotline and The Writing<br/><br/>Trying to explain Dark's plotline will be like trying to understand whether the chicken came first or the egg. It is one of the most intricately written stories, but so well laid out and perfectly planned that it will never cease to surprise you at any point. The writers have planned everything out, and they do not miss a single detail. Easter eggs are laid out throughout the show and the whole plotline it just too clever. So clever, it will blow your mind every time.<br/><br/>Dark is a show full of thrill, suspense, and mystery, laden with hints of the supernatural and family drama. At no point will you feel bored or underwhelmed, that is a given guarantee. The beauty of this show is that the suspense and mystery keeps you hooked right until you've finished the show, and even then, you will be craving for more; questioning, scratching your head. The twists and turns are superb and very intricately placed in the storyline. They are dramatic but not stupid. Nothing is wasted on space, story or with dialogues. In Dark, know that every single visual, every single dialogue, everything has a role to play.<br/><br/>The storylines are connected, and no episode will leave you without questions in your mind. You will definitely want more, and when you think you've figured out the plot, the show writers will pull out another secret, another stunt that will leave you speechless for sure. It is amazing, and I cannot tell you how many times my jaw had hung open while watching this show.<br/><br/>3. Family Dynamics and Drama<br/><br/>It would be wrong to leave out the drama because it surely plays a pivotal role in this show. As I've already said how exceptionally well the character arcs are, same is with the family drama too. The show brings together the individual lives of four families whose paths - futures, present, and past - intricately cross with one another, connected in a whole big loop (and by connected, I mean really connected). Questions about sacrifices and betrayal and love all come into focus as the show progresses; who's hiding what, and who's related to who. How far will you go to save your family, to save the ones you love? It is a question that repeats itself over and over, playing out as an elaborate bigger theme.<br/><br/>Each family has their own humanly possible problems to deal with. Starting from loss and grief to battling one's sexuality and past, it deals with all the aspects in a coherent way. At its core, Dark is largely about familial relationships that span generations, about tragedies, and betrayals that shape them, about the love and hurt, ultimately bringing everything and everyone together in a very complex web. If you thought understanding the family dynamics and drama in Once Upon a Time and Game of Thrones was difficult, wait until you watch Dark.<br/><br/>4. Time Travel, But With Logic<br/><br/>One of the setbacks of this show could have easily been its time travelling storyline because, let's face it, it is super hard to create a reasonable time travel story. Often than not, shows dealing with this theme has the risk of losing the logical explanation and then witness everything going haywire. But Dark surely takes this theme at its best and delivers to us a complicated show that you'll eventually understand. To put it lightly, time travel also exists in the show as a metaphor of confronting your own self, past and future, and in the way paving the way for growth (and maybe destruction too). It doesn't actually mess up with its varying range of timelines, and keeps a note of all the complexities, all the timelines, knitting everything together in a clean circle. At times, it may get difficult to understand and seem to get haphazard and it surely will be confusing, but things play out well. It is all well at the end.<br/><br/>5. The Various Philosophical Themes<br/><br/>In the midst of family drama and time travelling, Dark also has in store a whole array of philosophies to boggle your mind and keep you questioning your own beliefs, your sanity long after the show is over. Largely dealing with the question of time and human origin, the show tends to treat time in the same vicinity as that of God. To create a world without time enslaving us humans is one of the central running theme of this show, and something that it follows quite religiously. Using fantasy, it takes on a very different angle or storytelling in the television era, questioning the meaning of faith and family, blood and time. It takes into questions about fate, destiny and choices. Can you change your destiny? Can you be truly free from the clutches of time? Can you change your future? Are we really ever free of time?<br/><br/>6. A Visual Delight<br/><br/>Apart from the brilliant lead of casts and the super confusing yet fantastic plotline, Dark is also blessed with pleasing visuals which is a definite 10/10. The creepy forest setting provides an excellent view to the storyline, adding a sense of fear and dread in the viewers. The caves too provide an atmospheric essence to the story, a pioneer of time travel that connects everything. The settings are eerie and mostly unsettling, and seem to be always announcing an impending doom. It can be agreed that the cinematography really adds a whole boost to the whole series, adding exclusively to the suspenseful storyline. It complements the show really well, and becomes one of the reasons why this show is extremely amazing to watch.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "103 out of 108 found this helpful.", "date": "9 August 2020"}, {"title": " Best TV Show I've Ever Seen", "content": "The most well thought out storyline of any show.

I started watching THM back in 2003 when it first aired. I was about thirteen years old at the time. I grew up on this show, it became a part of me. Throughout middle school, high school, and into my college years, I knew that every Monday night at 9PM I could sit down, relax, and watch one of my favorite TV shows. Whether a new or old episode, I always laughed at THM. I can honestly say of all the shows I've watched in my life this would be in my top three favorites.<br/><br/>In the later seasons however, for those that have been living under a rock the show's main star Charlie Sheen began to slip. He started having marital, drug, and drinking issues. It started cut into his time with the show, and soon episodes would be cut including an entire season down the drain. It made me very sad to see Charlie Sheen go downhill because I really respected him and admired his work on THM. I don't support or condone what he did, but what I am more upset at is the backlash from CBS, primarily Chuck Lorre. It was announced in summer 2011 that Aston Kutcher would replace Charlie Sheen in a new role on the show. I had no idea how they were going to do this but I accepted for what it was for a while. I did not like the sound of this, but more importantly, I GAVE ASTON KUTCHER A CHANCE. I am a fan of his previous work in movies and film and I was curious to see what he could bring to the table. Also I was looking forward to getting more new episodes of THM rather than episodes skipped because of Sheen's bad behavior. <br/><br/>The day came. September 19, 2011. Nearly 30 million peopled tuned in to watch Aston Kutcher as Waldon Schmidt fill the shoes of the now dead Charlie Harper. The first episode in my opinion completely bombed. There was absolutely no chemistry between Aston Kutcher and Jon Cryer. But I kept my mouth shut. I continued to watch, week after week, until I just couldn't take it anymore. Let me just say this. The new format of Two and a Half Men is the definition of complete and utter s**t. The writing is horrible now. Kutcher has no chemistry with any of the cast. His British girlfriend that stuck around the whole season is very annoying. Alan is now an annoying, pathetic loser that doesn't make sense on the show anymore. And Jake? That adorable, witty kid from the past seasons? Turned into a complete loser, pothead. Maybe he was already heading that direction but that's beyond the point.<br/><br/>This show is ruined and I point the finger at Chuck Lorre and CBS. Yes, Charlie Sheen had problems, but why couldn't he get help? A long time ago he came out of rehab like a perfectly normal person. This is just people picking on someone with serious health problems. Instead of getting him help and postponing the show on his behalf, what do they do? They fire him and completely ruin the show. If they really disliked his behavior I believe they should have just indefinitely ended the show. They could have always brought it back some how down the road but now it's ruined. My whole problem with everything is that this whole matter is a huge insult to every fan like me who has tuned in for the past nine years. Aston Kutcher is a fine actor but he just doesn't work on this show. The writing sucks, the story sucks, and it's time to let it go. When I want to watch THM, I will go to the reruns. If you are new to the show maybe you can get used to the new format but for me, it will never be the same again.

The main storyline unfolds around a boy named Otis. His mom is a sexual therapist, which makes sex and everything connected with it even harder for him to talk about. Ironically, Otis, who has very little experience and feels tremendously awkward when it comes to sex and relationship, is surprisingly good at giving advice on those subjects to others. Therefore, this edgy cool girl Maeve, who is, as most would say, way out of Otis' league recognizes his \"talent\" and encourages him to start a sex clinic inside school. And so that the story starts.<br/><br/>Compared to other teen series and films found on Netflix, Sex Education may be the most substance-rich, but it lack innovative concepts and novel themes to be called a round work. So you get presented many important discussion that deal with homosexuality, family problems to far-reaching critical issues such as abortion. However, I found dealing with these conflicts often very clumsy and superficial. In many places I had wanted more depth and a more intensive handling of the individual topics. Instead, the discussions were kept to a minimum and barely picked up by the characters and packed into meaningful dialogues.<br/><br/>Another point of criticism was the often stereotypical portrayal of many protagonists and the entire social environment shown. So it seems almost a trend to be that just standing in the corner inconspicuous boy may someday have the girl of his dreams. I do not doubt that there are such social structures or at least similar ones in every school and in almost every life of a 16 or 17-year-olds. But the creators of the series could have trusted more and to be able to present a story without the obvious presence of such clich\u00e9s. There are some clich\u00e9s, but it has no special effect on the whole. Even at its lamest, cliche moments, this quirky show remains quaintly entertaining. In many series or films for similar target groups, puberty, first love and first sex are often portrayed romantically and therefore often appear unrealistic. Sex education, however, shows a blunt and sincere approach and may perhaps convince one or the other viewers of this uniqueness.<br/><br/>I believe it's important to see this series. It opens a subject about sexual developments of teenagers that should not be ignored. It also shows how everybody has their problems and nobody is perfect, and that there is an explanation to everything. We can see the fact that everything happens for a reason, that everything has a start somewhere and that if we as a community help to find that start, we can also help one to get rid of their issues, feel full as a person and happy with who they are.<br/><br/>In terms of acting performance, Sex Education painted a picture similar to own. The individual performances were in some cases quite authentic and convincing. However, some protagonists were so over-cliched in my eyes that the performance of the actors had to suffer as well. So you may praise some protagonists for their performance, others were not particularly prominent and therefore not very credible.<br/><br/>Although most of the time the viewer will know what the stories are all about, \"Sex Education\" is the first pleasant surprise of the production year. With consistent and clever ideas, playful performers and a lot of charm, this coming-of-age comedy with adult audiences should be a reliable \"binge watching\" candidate for many. \"Sex Education\" was certainly not a bad series and could also take some positive points with its open-hearted nature. 8/10", "rating": 8, "helpful": "205 out of 309 found this helpful.", "date": "20 January 2019"}, {"title": " Brilliant!", "content": "Just finished Season Two of Sex Education.

But as the episodes progressed, the acting improved, the storylines and plots became better and more engaging each episode, and the characters became more lovable. Black people don't tend to see themselves represented in TV shows in such a relatable way. Chances are, if you aren't a black person, or don't hang around any, you may not get some of the jokes, or really relate to all the hilarious situations. But if you really pay attention, and come to it with open eyes, this show will really be great for you. In this show, I see amazing, educated, hilarious, and attractive black characters shown. Episodes touch on hilarious incidents and adventures, but also touch on racism, especially within one woman shown in a later episode who thinks \"diversity is trending\", but doesn't actually care or understand the black community. And seeing as there are many people like that out there, I found it amazing, how well they showed a character like that, and showed the audience how stupid it was. Other episodes highlight gender equality, and school dress code protests. Others highlight black history, and incredible ancestors. While most of the episodes are generally light with subtle hints of the racism in our society, but funny things people, (especially black people) can relate to, (when you see black people running, you better start running too)...the final episode of Part 1 was definitely harder, but an important one, because it shone light on police brutality. Some of the kids we've grown to love, two 12 year olds and a 10 year old are arrested by a cop in front of their own house, after mowing lawns for honest money. The kids are shaken by it, wondering why the police were treating them like the bad guys. It also showed how easily the police get off, the one that had harassed the kids being suspended for only 2 days. It hurt to watch, but was also a startling reminder of a reality for young black kids and adults who have to face this. The system is like a dystopia. Shortly after, the parents are pulled over for no reason, showing another way black people are targeted, but can't do anything, because the people in power have the guns. So this TV show really touched me, especially towards the later episodes. Because after it touched and black family magic, it also touched on obstacles that black people have to face. So 10/10 for this tv show, for making me laugh, making me angry, and making me cry.\nAnd for those of you who quit at the first episode...keep watching-It only gets better.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "25 out of 35 found this helpful.", "date": "11 July 2019"}, {"title": " Retrograde wannabe comedy.", "content": "I thought I'd give Family Reunion a try because I like Tia Mowry and Loretta Devine but I found myself not just bored but genuinely annoyed. I don't mind the suspense of disbelief regarding an NFL tight end and his family moving in with his parents, it's that this whole show seems stuck in a bygone era of both sitcoms and society. Supposedly, the family moves to Georgia so the kids can be kids and learn family values and to show us that, the 'new age modern' parents are suddenly okay with the grandmother beating them with a belt. (Admittedly, it doesn't actually happen but it doesn't not happen because they come to the conclusion that hitting kids is wrong but because the kid has something on the grandmother). The show attempts to promote diversity but the children who had apparently grown up free are suddenly forced to be church-going, verse-learning Christians. And there's virtually no 'reverse learning', the conservative grandparents never learn anything from their younger relatives because it is assumed that the city, modern, liberal young parents and their kids are just inherently wrong but not just wrong, their ways are downright evil and hell worthy. To that, let's add forced corniness, stiff acting from some of the actors and boring plotlines. The kids (except for Jade) are forgettable, Richard Roundtree is only a guest, and Tia Mowry is not given as much cam time as she deserves.

As the Goldberg family story recants life in the 1980's for the three Goldberg children, Adam (Sean Giambrone), older brother Barry (Troy Gentile) who is the biggest Philadelphia Flyer fan ever and leader of his own pack of bro's, and last but not least his oldest sister Erica (Hayley Orrantia) who in season 5, is just entering university and living in a school dorm to get as far away from her smothering mother Beverly (Wendi McLendon-Covey) as she can. Between mom Beverly with her over the top fashion faux pas colorful sweaters emblazoned with her embroidered initials (remember Laverne and Shirley's 1970's sweaters?) and son Barry who is oh so loud and proud. Let's just say the Goldbergs are all extroverts and leave it at that. Rounding out the eclectic Goldberg family is dad Murray (Jeff Garlin) who owns and manages a furniture store, and all he wants to do when he comes home from work is to be left alone, sit in his favorite reclining chair in his boxer shorts and watch TV. Last but not least is the wise old grandfather who Adam continually runs to for the best (?) advice is his grandpa Albert 'Pops' Solomon (George Segal). <br/><br/>The great cast does not end there either. There are far too many supporting characters that come in and out of the Goldberg family lives to mention here who are integral to the shows continuing success. Suffice to say that each of the six (6) Goldberg family members interact with a great ensemble cast and their stories bring back memories of some great 80's songs and vintage television shows, classic 80's films (since young Adam Goldberg fancies himself as a young Steven Spielberg) and of course some key 1980's events and recently introduced technologies such as the Video Cassette Recorder (VCR's) and the first compact (yeah right) mobile 8 pound cell phones. <br/><br/>I especially like the closing scenes in many of the weekly episodes when one of the Goldberg family members explains that even though this episode may have ruffled some feathers, and could have been handled more eloquently, the Goldberg family always sticks close to one another and everything will always come out peachy keen and leave their audience wanting more of the Goldbergs and their unique story telling of life with the Goldbergs in the 1980's.<br/><br/>It is a great show and that is why it is entering into its fifth season now.

Saves so silly I blush when I watch it... but at the same time absolutely entertaining! I get that it is well nigh impossible to create believable fire rescues in a TV series so I'd rather blush and watch than stop altogether. I suspend my disbelief.\nChicago Med though. OMG. Unprofessional doctors, always in a huff over a parent (I am going to report this parent to the DHSS!), a relative, a loved one or whatever, the doctors are ready to throw their scorn and belittlement over the population of Chicago. High standards indeed. And from the beginning Will Halstead has been the petulant overlord of that \"I am damned if I am going to learn from any one of my mistakes! Never!\"- attitude. How many times now has he gone against everyone and done something utterly outrageous? The actor is unknown to me so I don't know how chosen his facial expressions for the Halstead figure are, but I am getting so triggered by the petulant \"mouth half open\" by this time in the series I can't continue watching it. That expression is like some helpful-Chucky or a Baby Born doll waiting someone to stick a pretend milkbottle into the half open mouth. How did they create Jay's brother as this unlearning asinine man who always meets his co-workers with a mumpish face?\nAnd then there's Choi, Natalie, April and April's stupid brother....everyone of them more knowledgeable than their colleagues when the whim takes them. Everyone of them ready to throw loyalty to profession, colleagues, patients and workplace in the wind so that they might - yet again - be allowed to do the stupidest option available.

No . . . maybe it's just hate.", "content": "I once loved Chicago Med. It's first season was actually pretty good. (The only episode I really disliked from the show's first season was #1.10 \"Clarity.\" This was due to the fact that one of the storylines were eerily similar to one from Code Black, which was produced and aired long before said Chicago Med episode had, but . . . I digress.) What attracted me to this show was its decent storylines that more than made up for moments of less-than good acting. I would even argue that the series' second season was even stronger, with episodes like \"Graveyard Shift,\" \"Cold Front,\" and \"Love Hurts.\" Now that the third season is far into is its run, I only grow more and more annoyed and bothered with this show. Why? I have a few reasons. Allow me to explain.<br/><br/>The characters have seem to take a turn for the worst. What has happened to Sarah? What has happened to Daniel? They were my two favorite characters and they both have become so unrecognizable. The Daniel I loved was endearing and almost had this happy-go-lucky attitude about him. I could see how this could have changed in the wake of what has happened to him (i.e., shocking event in #2.23 \"Love Hurts\"), but, as I said . . . he has grown to be almost unrecognizable. The same could be said for Sarah. Using pepper spray on a patient? Seriously? She would never. Not the Sarah I knew. I could understand how she might have felt uncomfortable, but there was much else to do. <br/><br/>Also, what about Robin? UGH! I am beyond tired of her! I hope she is gone for good. I am not the only one, either. My mother is strongly irritated by her. I could tolerate her story in season two, but it also felt extremely sudden. (This could have been due to the showrunners signing her on for a last-minute extended guest appearance, but it seriously needed more development.)<br/><br/>While I go off on a tangent on irritable characters, I should also probably mention how much Ava Bekker annoys me. Her character is nearly unbearable. Watch and you will see why.<br/><br/>The other issue that I have grown to seriously dislike about this show is that every new episode includes a different ethical dilemma, most of which are so over-dramatic and sometimes painfully unrealistic. It is growing rather weary. You can see what I mean in just about every episode synopsis. I will elaborate:<br/><br/>1) Will and Natalie are trapped by legal ethics when an unfaithful husband refuses to tell his wife about his inconclusive Zika test.\n2) Financial concerns from the board cause tension between Chief Goodwin and her staff and Goodwin is faced with some difficult choices.\n3) Dr. Charles feels pressure when Dr. Choi and Dr. Manning criticize his medical decision regarding an ill newborn baby.\n4) After discovering that a patient's family might have been abusive, Dr. Choi and April contemplate calling child services. Dr. Manning and Dr. Halstead struggle to see eye to eye in guiding a family who is dealing with their premature baby.<br/><br/>So many ridiculous scenarios. What happened to just some good storytelling? I miss that! So far, the only good thing to come out of season three is that Natalie and Will finally got together.<br/><br/>Through seasons one and two, I gave this show a 7.9/10 rating, which, in my book, is really good. Now that we are almost finished with season three, I have come to downgrade my rating considerably. A 4.0/10 is as good as it will get from me at this point. <br/><br/>This show has time to fix itself, and I really hope it does. If not, I am out and so are a few of my friends.

However, Chicago Med is executing it very poorly. <br/><br/>Rather than exploring them naturally as the show progresses, each episode now features a new ethical dilemma, to the point that they're interfering with time needed for character development and overarching plot line advancement. In one episode, for example, the staff divulge detailed medical information about a patient to another patient. This clearly is a severe HIPAA violation, which wasn't addressed. The only reason this was done was to increase the perceived drama regarding this ethical dilemma in an absurd way.

While I understand that this is a TV show and will therefore have a level of inaccuracy, there are a couple problems that people should be aware of. The number of times a nurse has said \"Yes doctor\" on this show is so disturbing. I have never said \"Yes doctor\" in my life! Sixty years ago, maybe this was the norm. Nurses stood up for doctors then too. Those days are long over. Times have changed, but unfortunately stereotypes have not! Nurses aren't glorified secretaries as they seem to be on this show. Nurses don't just answer phone calls, usher family members out of the room, and hand physicians charts. There are secretaries to \"page the OR.\" 99 percent of medications, blood products, and IV fluids given in real life are given by nurses, not residents or physicians. Those include life saving medications such as epinephrine during CPR and clot busting medications like TPA given during an acute stroke. In addition, nurses make recommendations for lab work, treatments, and medications to physicians on a daily basis and physicians ask nurses for their opinions, especially in the critical care settings, like the emergency department.<br/><br/>Since there is generally a death on every show, I would like to go over the overall responsibilities of different health care providers during codes. The physician's/medical staff's role in CPR is to run the code (with or without the primary nurse), intubate (insert a breathing tube), decide on the medications to be given, insert chest tubes (if indicated), and insert central/arterial lines. The nurse gives the medications, administers blood, products/IV fluids, defibrillates (shocks) and paces the patient, inserts IVs, draws blood, assists with intubation and line placement, inserts urinary catheters, inserts nasogastric or orogastric tubes, and performs chest compressions. Techs (CNAs - Certified Nursing Assistants) who work in the ER primarily perform chest compressions, insert IVs, draw blood, and grab stuff for people during codes. Some techs can insert urinary catheters and nasogastric tubes as well. Respiratory therapists are there to assist with intubation and draw ABGs (Arterial Blood Gas - blood drawn by puncturing an artery). Some hospitals allow respiratory therapists to intubate. At some hospitals nurses can draw ABGs. In my ED, physicians are generally the one intubating and nurses in the ER do not generally draw ABGs. Once the code is over, the physician, frequently with the primary nurse, will go talk to the family about how the patient is doing. If the code is going on for a while and it looks like the patient won't make it, we will invite the family back while still coding the patient. This is to give the family a chance to see that we are doing everything possible for the patient and to give them once last chance to see their loved one before they are called (dead).<br/><br/>The other inaccuracy I would like to point out is that Sarah Reese is a 4th year med student and therefore cannot be referred to as a Doctor on the show or in cast descriptions on the website. In real life, Sarah would be introduced as \"Sarah Reese, a 4th year medical student at XYZ University.\"", "rating": 5, "helpful": "33 out of 61 found this helpful.", "date": "16 January 2016"}]}, "/title/tt1844923/": {"title": "Friday Night Dinner", "reviews": [{"title": " Creatively written and well acted", "content": "This is a really good example of a situation comedy where relatively small and seemingly trivial things can be focused on and expanded into hilarious situations.

The vast majority of the scenes are purely dialogue and character-driven, and every couple of episodes something will actually happen, or two of the characters will meet - but you shouldn't be waiting or expecting during the other scenes for something to happen, it's just a little reward that works all the better BECAUSE of those scenes. It all worked well for me as the last thing I watched before I slept, as you can just listen for the most part, or have it on in the background while doing something else. Keep this in mind, if you want constant action or plot development then watch something else.<br/><br/>I was endeared to the show mainly because of the cast; the character pairings all work and have their moments, with the characters developing or expanding on previous conversations throughout. Season 2 takes great measures to revitalize the situations, especially with Jason Mantzoukas' character, who might have failed without the presence of Jesse Plemons, but actually prospers in an entertaining season-long storyline with Cristin Milioti.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "9 out of 12 found this helpful.", "date": "28 December 2018"}, {"title": " In Love", "content": "I mean the cast.

My original opinion stands, although I have some additional perspective on it. For whatever reason, we all found something offensive about either Jaina Lee Ortiz's acting or her character or some combination of both. We all felt that if that character was removed, the story line about her dad promoting her to lieutenant dropped, along with the unrealistic captain competition, the show might have a better chance of survival. Her story lines, her character and her acting (weak) is what's pulling the show down. Of course, in all fairness, the story line comes from the writers.

The relationship formed between the two leads is unquestionably one of the best and is, so far, most endearing. It is impossible to not like them.<br/><br/>I'll start with Nathan Fillion(of \"Firefly\" fame). Nathan plays Richard 'Rick' Castle. His charm and wit and spot-on comedic delivery make him alone the reason to tune in each week. Move over David Boreanaz 'cause Nathan has got you beat in the plucky-comedic-male-sidekick-to-tough-and-serious-female-cop role. Nathan comes off as the friend we all want and treasure. Having followed Nathan's career rather closely I am glad to see him in this role. It fits his nature and you can tell he knows it too just by watching him. It's in his postures and mannerisms and facial expressions. I believe he said in an interview that he is \"72%\" this character and that sounds about right. He is comfortable in this role. Similar to how he was comfortable when playing Malcom Reynolds in \"Firefly\"(which, by the way, is the greatest show of all time...period).<br/><br/>Then there is Stana Katic, who plays Detective Kate Beckett, and God is she gorgeous and enticing. No wonder Nathan's character can't get enough of her. Stana manages to instill in the portrayal of her character enough grit and fortitude to be mysterious and alluring, while retaining a good amount of the audiences confidence in her ability to be a bad-ass. On the other side, though, she is beautiful and her lightly-flirtatious nature does not detract from the other part of her character but rather enriches it making her feel real rather than just a clich\u00e9 tough female cop(because TV is full of them right now).<br/><br/>What it comes down to, ladies and gentlemen, is chemistry and these two have it. They are a joy to watch even when they are not in scenes together and that is what will keep viewers tuning in each week. This show has great promise.<br/><br/>Before I go I will note that it was nice to see real authors on the show(I will not reveal who). It adds another layer to Castle's character and makes for an amusing poker scene.

Nathan and Stana have great chemistry, with him providing a ton of comedy as the crime fiction author to her straight laced cop. Castle is an engaging hero with a surprising amount of support from the characters around him, especially with his daughter and his mother. <br/><br/>I find the premise has tons of promise as the series progresses, both with the types of plots that can come from Castle's novels and with his romantic interests. The idea that a series of murders can be copied into real life seems a bit trite, but the execution was far better than I expected. The fact that Castle can keep up with Detective Beckett as far as crime scene analysis and motives is smart, but also a great source of comedy. Beckett's apparent infatuation with Castle's book series not only suggest that she's a potential love interest, but hints at a lot of character subtlety that has yet to come. <br/><br/>If crime drama crosses with romantic comedy sounds at all for you, then you should definitely watch and support Castle.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "197 out of 228 found this helpful.", "date": "10 March 2009"}, {"title": " A writer's show.", "content": "I wish IMDb had a decimal system because this show isn't an 8.

Half way through everything is wrapped up a little too neatly etcetera), it was still an enjoyable romp.<br/><br/>Kate Beckett is a beautiful, hard nosed cop that should be working for a private law firm and Nick Castle is an arrogant, but devoted author and father.<br/><br/>Stana Katic (awesome name) is beautiful, but not so much that you wonder why she is a cop and not some goddess on an Italian beach like so many actresses tend to be. She plays her part very well, and the scene she has with Fillon when he, as Castle is peeling away her layers is amazing. She barely gives anything away until the very last moment, but with her facial expressions you know it's coming making her character all the more wonderful.<br/><br/>Nathan Fillion is wonderful as the successful, charismatic, and egocentric Pop mystery writer who seems to be not a drunk (unlike Hank Moody, played wonderfully by David Duchovney in Californication) and is a loving, attentive father apparently who also has an intriguing backstory with his publisher/ex-wife which I hope is a back story they continue to develop throughout the series.<br/><br/>This really was a fun series. I know new shows have a very short lifespan, but this is one I hope has a decent shelf life.

Now if we're fair and judge this show on it's writing and acting rather than on our excitement that Nathan Fillion is back then we must conclude... that the show is still pretty good. I have been impressed with the story lines up to this point and while the short description of the \"who-dun-it\" may sound like scenarios we've heard before, these writers aren't satisfied with a \"Law and Order\" ending. They've already thrown out the triple and quadruple switchbacks with the uncovering of the culprits. And all the while allowing Nathan Fillion to fill the screen with his smarmy charm and allowing him to cavort with an attractive, albeit, hard-boiled female cop.<br/><br/>The great part about this show is that they haven't really set up Fillion as a Sherlock Holmes. He is playing a seemingly educated street-wise poetic guy, but he isn't the one with all the answers. For every conclusion he draws, the female lead makes just as many and may refine Fillion's, which is wise on the writers' part because his character works because of the inherent flaws that come with being a writer rather than a detective.<br/><br/>It's a clever show that's a must-see if you're a Fillion-atic and a pretty good hour even if you're not.", "rating": null, "helpful": "144 out of 169 found this helpful.", "date": "24 March 2009"}, {"title": " Creative, Witty, and Nathan Fillion", "content": "I just finished watching the first showing and I am very pleased.

And in these seasons, he starts to fall in love with beckett. <br/><br/>Kate beckett however i feel is a weak character in these two seasons, but i personally think Stana makes the best of it.<br/><br/>The episodes are in general ok. Not really that many great ones in there, but not really any bad ones either i think. My top episodes in these seasons would be.\n\"flowers for your grave\"\n\" A death in the family\"\n\"tick, tick, tick\"\n\"boom\"<br/><br/>Season 3-4\nIn these seasons, castle i in love with Beckett, his crime solving ablities plays a lesser role except for the very first episode which is also one of my favorites in the entire show, his wild theories i getting to much some times though. <br/><br/>Now these seasons is where kate beckett (stana katic) really shows what she is made off. Most of that is shown in season 4, at the beginning after she got shot. Thats my favorite time of this chacter.<br/><br/>Some of my favorite episodes in these seasons, are also some of my favorites in the entire show.\nhere are some of them\n\"nikki heat\"\n\"a deadly affair\"\n\"rise\"\n\"kill shot\"<br/><br/>Season 5-6\nAt this point Castle and Beckett are in a relationship, and this had to happen with the way their love for eachother grew throughout season 1-4. And seasons 5-6 are much about their relationship, and some of the problems that might happen in any relationship.<br/><br/>Overall i think season 5 is my favorite one, alot of great episodes in that. Season 6 is where i think the shows starts to decline. But in my mind still is exceptional, but still not as good as 1-5.\nSome of my favorite episodes:\n\"after the storm\"\n\"murder he wrote\"\n\"probably cause\"\n\"still\"\n\"target + hunt\"\n\"valkyrie\"<br/><br/>Season 7-8 (my advice, dont watch season 8)\nHere comes the sad part about this show, and in my mind the biggest downside.\nThe whole story arc about castle missing their wedding, and then he comes back and cant remember the last ccouple of months. Personally i would have loved if the story about becketts mom ended with braken going to jail. They took it one step to far for me.\nAgian here they have relationship problems, but after season 7s intial problems, (castle being missed and so on) you think to your self, there is nothing they cant handle or fight together. then in season 8 they basically break up, because kate is scared of castle getting killed by \"krakens boss\"\nohh btw Castle is badass in season 7.<br/><br/>Season 7 is still in my opinion mostly good, except for the part castle cant remember anything. Season 8 had 1 or 2 good episodes, but mostly they ruined alot with that one. The series finale was BAD.\nNow i dont know what the plan was, from what i can gather the plan was to make a season 9 with everyone still in it, but the cliffhanger would be beckett getting shot instead of both of them. But then they decided without even talking to \"stana katic\" to exclude her from season 9, they then decided to cancel the show and alter the ending.\nIf they alternative to this ending was, a season 9 in which kate beckett dies. Then i will gladly take this ending.<br/><br/>Some of the best episodes are:\n\"the time of our lifes\"\n\"\"once upon a time in the west\"\n\"castle Pi\"\n\"resurrection\"\n\"Reckoning\"\n\"hollanders woods\"\n\"the last seduction\" (wanted one episode from 8 on here)<br/><br/>Conclusion:\nI know alot of people are not gonna read half of this. But i felt the need to write it.\nseasons 1-6 was a 15/10 for me.

Well done ABC!!", "rating": 9, "helpful": "116 out of 140 found this helpful.", "date": "15 March 2009"}, {"title": " Fillion is \"King\" Of This CASTLE...", "content": "Oh, yeah, we've seen this one before....Irresistible-force-meets-immovable object. Opposites attract. Oil and water. Fire and ice...you know the drill. The problem is that when you have a pairing that mixes snappy patter and grudgingly mutual admiration with just a touch of sexual tension, the recipe is only going to be as good as the charisma of the two leads involved, whether it's a sitcom, dramedy or police procedural. <br/><br/>CASTLE wants to be a mix of all three, and fortunately one of the most valuable weapons in its arsenal is the rakish charm of its featured lead actor, former FIREFLY star Nathan Fillion. I can count the number of actors on one hand who can pull off the \"charming rascal\" vibe in a way that never gets old, and Nathan can do those guys in his sleep. (And probably has.)<br/><br/>But he also knows how to modulate them as the occasion warrants, and where in his former role as Captain Mal Reynolds he could definitely play the bad-ass card when needed, here as womanizing bad-boy, party animal and bestselling novelist Rick Castle, he's a whole lot less serious. Bored with the cop character who has been his bread-and-butter for a string of chart-busting crime thrillers, Rick has decided in his latest tome to blow his hero's brains out, thus making a continuance of the series a little difficult to say the least. It wouldn't be a problem if the laid-back Lothario weren't suddenly faced with a major case of writer's block. But inspiration is coming in the most fortuitous if unlikely of ways. <br/><br/>A serial killer has decided to rehash some of the more gruesome deaths from Castle's earlier novels, and it's up to the very attractive (of course!) and no-nonsense detective Kate Beckett (newcomer Stana Katic) to crack the case...which of course will require the assistance of a certain writer of whose books Detective Beckett is a closet fan. But a fan of smart-alecky guys who like to make very unsubtle passes at her? Not so much. Let the games and one-upmanship begin!<br/><br/>At first blush, you could easily accuse CASTLE of trying too hard, especially since matched with the seasoned experience of Fillion, the jury was out on Katic's ability to keep up with him in the first few episodes (at least it was for me.) And to enhance its credibility, the pilot even threw in some heavy hitters in guest cameos - James Patterson, no stranger himself to the crime fiction genre, and Stephen J. Cannell, who used to crank out pilots for series just like CASTLE over breakfast. <br/><br/>But creator Andrew Marlowe left nothing to chance with this one, knowing full well that no matter how great a character is, he's nothing without a good backstory and some fascinating support players. Here these come in the form of Rick Castle's teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn), whom of course is the real 'adult' in their relationship - probably her way of rebelling against her lovable father who nevertheless lives the lifestyle of a guy half his age, and their temporary roommate who also happens to be his mother, former stage and screen star Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan in a turn that makes Shirley MacLaine in POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE look like a dowdy matron). Once you meet Martha, suddenly Rick's personality makes perfect sense. <br/><br/>As with any new series, this one will take some time to really settle into the groove it needs to capture a wider audience, but with the growing ease of the push-and-pull relationship between Fillion and Katic's characters, it could very well become the next \"MOONLIGHTING\" or \"REMINGTON STEELE\"...which wouldn't be a bad thing. Crime procedurals have been missing that fun element of late, and CASTLE could very well bring it back, without having to resort to a less-successful springboard of surrealism to build from (sorry, LIFE ON MARS).", "rating": 8, "helpful": "131 out of 167 found this helpful.", "date": "26 March 2009"}, {"title": " Miss It!", "content": "Castle is still one of my favorite police procedural shows today and God knows there are plenty to choose from.

This show is very different from most other crime shows. It doesn't try to capture the grit of real-life police work, instead it has it's own quirky style that still manages to keep everything believable. Another thing that I thought was interesting is that it was almost Holmesian in that instead of relying completely on forensics to solve cases,it uses good old-fashioned logic like Numbers and Criminal Minds without those protracted scenes of people holding test tubes and analyzing them with a machine that you never knew they had before that episode and you'll never see again. As the character's try to follow their ways through the sometimes complex,always suspenseful plots, you try to follow their thought process, and you can sometimes be surprised about who actually did it.<br/><br/>I also have to give them points for originality. True, this style of drama had become clich\u00e9 long before Law and Order came out, but a woman drowned in a bathtub of motor oil? A guy sporting fangs found dead in a graveyard with a stake through his heart? Some of these plots keep you constantly interested. The stories can e extremely complex (Fool Me Once, Always Buy Retail, Love Me Dead) but you never get lost, you always understand everything.<br/><br/>But the actors,they bring this show to life. I'm afraid I have never seen Nathan Fillion, but whatever he's done, he is PERFECT as Castle. Witty, sometimes childish, but capable of being extremely tender. He may be the playboy on the outside, but you can see the man beneath. His family consists of Martha Rogers, an aging drama queen who nevertheless has much wisdom as she's had martinis. And then there's Alexis, the young daughter who has some truly tender moments with Castle. She is very wise for her age, and she sometimes have to keep Castle in check when he gets crazy. She is capable, independent, and prudent. I'd love for her to be my daughter.<br/><br/>Then there's the police that Castle works with, and his muse Detective Kate Beckett. Stana Katic should get more notice, she really is an excellent actress. Perfectly able to be the tough female cop without being to clich\u00e9, she is sharp-tongued, quick-witted, and an excellent detective. The repartees between her and Castle can make you do everything from inwardly chuckle to rolling on the floor laughing. It reminds you of those old screwball comedies in their clever dialogs. Beckett is helped by Ryan and Esposito, the tag team who are always there for a fun time, and Lanie Parish, the forensic expert in the group who is a good friend to Beckett and another clever character. Then there's the Captain Montgomery, he is not seen often, but he is a very good fatherly figure to Beckett. All the cast members are excellent in their roles and avoid the one-sidedness you so often see on television.<br/><br/>The script is excellent. There is no sob-story melodrama, no contrived situations, no oh-my-god-I-have-seen-this-way-too-many-times feeling to it. And the dialog is razor sharp and never drags. And the character back stories are developed and strong, and not put there just as a feeble attempt at character depth. Once something is started,it's followed through,like Beckett's mom and Castle's writing. You feel it, you are really drawn into it, you can't get enough of it. If only shows had this sharpness to it, but alas not.<br/><br/>Don't forget to read Heat Wave, \"written by Richard Castle\", if you can't get enough of the show, read the book.

Aren't they out of ideas yet?'.Well I might be right about Naruto and Bleach but when it comes to One Piece I couldn't be more wrong.One piece is so good, so enjoyable and it never ends which is something everyone who is watching it wants.<br/><br/>Talk about long introduction huh?Anyways onto the actual review now.It will be divided into 4 sectors: story,characters,art and sound,enjoyment.<br/><br/>STORY: Now the story at first might seem very simple and straightforward,a young boy Monkey D. Luffy(17 years old)setting out on sea on a great journey to become the Pirate King and find One Piece the biggest and greatest treasure in the OP world that was left in 'that' place by the former Pirate King,Gol D. Roger.Before Roger was executed publicly by the marines-world government he told everyone that if they wanted OP they had to look for it and that it was all left in 'that' place and that ignited the great age of pirates.The series is divided into arcs,each featuring its very own story and setting,each island,each place the straw hat pirates(Luffy and his crew)visit is a whole different adventure with new people to meet and new circumstances.And that's one of the best things of OP,you never get bored.You are fascinated by the huge and diverse OP world and you just can't let go of it.Everything is interesting and everything is fun,Luffy and his crew never chose the easy path but they strive for adventure and excitement and they almost pass their feelings to us the viewers.Thats something very rare especially in anime and OP handles that expertly.Once you have seen enough episodes you will realize that the main characters of the series,especially Luffy,don't really care about their destination,hell most of the times they don't even know where they are going at all.All that matters is that they are going somewhere interesting where they will learn new things,get stronger,meet new people and face powerful foes.Another thing worth mentioning is that the series has very few fillers(episodes that did not exist in the original story-source material-manga) unlike some other mainstream anime series(Naruto,Bleach anyone?).Also the fillers are actually not that bad,sure they are not good but many of them are OK.And thats a huge plus for an anime series.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS:This is where OP really shines.Each character is presented with great detail,they are all quite unique.Everyone has their own backstory explained thoroughly and we get to see why they are who they are,why each one of them has their very own ambitions and dreams.Due to their different experiences they have very different personalities and through good character development we see how they interact with each other and how they get closer to each other.We see how they become comrades and everyone is looking for each other,they become something very close to a family.That's the kind of bonds they make.Furthermore we not only see the history and personality of the straw hats but many others too like members of the marines.We see why they make the kind of choices they make.Nobody is entirely evil and nobody is purely good.Everyone has a good reason behind what they are doing and they strongly believe in their own cause,in their own justice and in their own dreams. <br/><br/>ART AND SOUND:One Piece also excels in this sector with beautiful and vivid animation.The sceneries look alive and all different from each other with their very own characteristics.The characters are illustrated masterfully and each character looks a lot different from each other(that's a huge plus in anime).The sound department also did a great job especially with the voice actors,I'm always talking about the original Japanese(don't you dare see the English dub),who fit really well into their respective characters.The music,for me at least,is very catchy and actually really well made.However that depends on personal taste,if you are not really into this kind of karaoke-Japanese style of music you might not like it.Nevertheless OP really has some of the greatest music themes I have heard in an anime.<br/><br/>OVERALL ENJOYMENT:One Piece is one of the most,if not the most enjoyable and diverse anime series you can find.It really excels in pretty much every field there is.It is the only anime series,or any series,I have seen with that many episodes and yet manages to stay that good(and believe me,have I seen a lot).I recommend OP to anyone with enough time and hunger for adventure.If you have not decided whether to watch it or not just watch 10 episodes and see for yourself if you want continue or not(oh you will want to continue).Trust me and you won't regret it,just like I did.<br/><br/>And yep that's the end of it fellas.If you enjoyed my review and found it useful please upvote so others can see it.", "rating": null, "helpful": "320 out of 334 found this helpful.", "date": "4 September 2013"}, {"title": " Straw Hat Pirates, I Wanna Be Your Nakama..!", "content": "Let me start by saying, I don't understand Japanese and I'm a huge fan of Naruto, Shippuuden and Bleach (of course, all original Japanese versions).

The first episodes introduce him and some characters and make a lovely start that is entertaining and makes one want more. On his way Luffy meets a lot of very interesting characters who become his crew members and friends - each of them with an intense and captivating background story. Every character in this series - be it friend or foe - is either adorable, tragic, despicable or interesting at the least... no boring characters anywhere. Later on in the series, important events and story twists are often visualized or supported by huge appearances in the fabulous and unreal environments that our crew travels. This is perfectly done and helps the already epic feel of the story. I have seen 150 episodes, four movies and two specials so far and there were moments that made me cry, laugh, think and re-watch some episodes (especially 85-90) at least 30 times.

People sometimes say about a movie or series that it is \"not a life changer, but entertaining\". That is definitely not the case here! I know it sounds nerdy, but this series has broadened my horizon in many ways and I recommend anyone to take the admittedly long time to get into this epic adventure. The best way to do so will be to watch the fan-subs which are as close to the original as a non Japanese will get (explanations of puns and traditions).

It has hilarious, roll on the floor from laughing humor and so much action it makes you wonder if the crew ever gets tired.<br/><br/>But in its core, One Piece is about something else: it's about nakama. Nakama, a Japanese term generally referring to comrades, receives a completely new feeling in One Piece. Stand by your nakama, believe in them no matter what happens, no matter what anyone does or says about them. Help them in any situation, even if it means putting your own life on the line. With you nakama, you can do anything. And it is this extreme sense of comradry that makes you fall in love with the characters and wish you could be a part of the strange little group.<br/><br/>It also teaches how humans are allowed to have flaws; in fact, all people do: seemingly perfect Swordsman and first mate Roronoa Zoro has no sense of direction whatsoever and can easily get himself lost on any one way street, navigator Nami is absolutely crazy for money, cook Sanji loses his mind once he sees a lady.. and the list goes on and on.

As he ventures on his quest he makes many allies with\nnever ending bonds and stumbles across enemies, kicking their ass for good and more importantly his crewmates who swore their loyalty to him as their captain and work hard to make their dreams come true.\nThe crew starts their journey in the grand line, the toughest seas that are feared by everyone which only Gol d.

The Grand line is described as hell and as a nightmare for every pirate which the crew rocks in as the \"Strawhat Pirates\" named after their captain's hat.\nOne piece has the best adventures, high action, drama and comedy that you can ask for.

With beautiful seas, islands and breath taking stunts, nerve wracking epic battles, loads of laughter, great openings and ending tracks and addictive OST's you will never want to miss this out anymore. I am sure you will be loving the crew while they progress towards their goal.\nFinally One Piece is a best source for inspiration and motivation, the theme of \"never give up on your dreams no matter what the cost is\" gets the good expression here. Every character of one piece whether it be protagonists or antagonists have their own believes, sense of justice and vision of the world for which they fight for putting them on high stakes. If you want to change your approach or view towards the world then you must watch one piece. It can be undoubtedly crowned as Best of the best shounen series.

Because it is an awesome, well written and drawn Manga/Anime. Oda, the creator of One piece, is really one of my favorite people in all the world; I have nothing but respect to that man. <br/><br/>This anime is about a guy named Luffy who wants to become the Pirate King. He wants to follow the steps of Gol D. Roger, the only man who became the Pirate King, and he wants to discover Gol D. Roger's treasure (ONE PIECE) which is supposed to be the best of the best.

It has references of many things, like General Culture, actors, singers, famous people you know nowadays, and classic movies and books. Every story, every character, every island, every thing in One piece has a background. Oda wants to show everything little by little, his preparing you from the very start for the climax of its last episodes. Sometimes you will think some stories and characters are not necessary, but these stories drop you little clues about something that is going to happen. They get you thinking and talking about many crazy theories. You get to see the progress in Luffy's crew, and you cannot do anything but love them. You get to see really evil villains, yet you will also love them. I am not afraid to say that I have cry like a little baby with this anime.<br/><br/>I am fan of many other anime, like Dragon Ball, Bleach, Naruto, Death Note, Code Geass, Darker than black, Evangelion, Hellsing, Monster, and so on, yet I will tell you my favorite is this one. I give One piece a 10/10, not only because I personally love it. Also because I think One piece should be recognized. For its artwork, for its originality. Even though it has some things from Dragon Ball, and from other Mangas, it doesn't exist a pirate story like this one. It always has something to offer.

Starting off with facts of it being the highest selling manga and being in the Guinness book of world records, also having an extremely dedicated fan base which no community can ever have. It's simply the greatest story ever conveyed and portrayed in a comical form. As I've seen many movies and TV shows(which includes American TV Shows, Indian cinema.) Read thousands of books, no story has ever enlightened and amazed me as One Piece did, I personally feel it to be on par with Mahabharata, Ramayana &amp; Shakespeare's works. 732 episodes, 819 chapters still looks fresher than ever, without being monotonous, not only it entertains you, it scars you for life. A show so strong, that it changes your life. A show so good you can never stop watching. It's more addictive than any drug in this world. Coming to the characters, Monkey D Luffy, even people say he is typical Shonen material, he is the greatest protagonist a story can possibly have. He goes from dumb &amp; funny to badass &amp; idealistic. He's like a brother I never had. Roronoa Zoro, a lad so influential with his quotations, you start following his mannerisms in real life.

I don't want to spoil anything for you, get amazed by the characters by yourself, I'm sure Oda will never disappoint you.<br/><br/>Coming to the story, as I've already mentioned, it is the 8th wonder of world. What amazes me the most is, Oda is so legendary that he depicts real life events from this world through his manga. He's also a conspiracy theorist.

Mainly cause it nice to see animation that aren't afraid of leaving the kiddy realm and that they can be taken seriously (a fact most of the older generation down here just won't accept). Of course its also nice to see a story that caters to both sides and is always worth coming back to, case in point say hello to One Piece. May look childish but it is the most complex story I've ever had the joy of encountering...at least in graphic novel form when it retains their original shape. Sadly once again political correctness reared it ugly head down here when it came time to see the animated version. You know what that means anime lovers, KID...FRIENDLY...DUB!<br/><br/>Premise: The story follows the massive adventure of Monkey D. Luffy (Luffy for short) as he seeks the titled treasure to become the king of pirates, even though he cursed from eating a Devil Fruit that gives him rubber powers but prohibits him from swimming forever. Soon gaining a crew with their own unique quirks and goals and sailing the dangerous yet wondrous Grand Line in their quest.<br/><br/>So far the U.S is still in it starting chapters of this series (as of this writing) but One Piece has shown an very interesting take at storytelling, what may seem obvious to the viewer and the characters could actually have another deeper meaning to really stun you when it revealed and its these little twists that keep you coming back for more of the story. Of course the main characters are a charming lot too with their faults and strengths. And as overused as it is in cartoons, a bond of a very tight friendship that help them threw their battles.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, talk about a bunch of creative rumbles. Be it against other devil fruit users, major weapons, martial arts, sword play or against the elements themselves. Luffy and his crew take on all comers and the viewers are definitely in for a show once everything hits the fans.<br/><br/>Animation wise, its not bad. Some of the attacks lose a bit of their impacts from the comic but it still very cool to see everything unfolding with movement and color. The downside to this is the dreaded DBZ syndrome where a couple of episodes are dedicated to the back and forth struggle of the fights. Still if you're a fan of the series, you might stay for the long run.<br/><br/>Alas a company called 4Kids has picked this up on the United States behalf and if the name is any indication, its going to be edited the crap out of. Now, unlike most anime viewers, I have nothing against dubs. Yes they may not match the quality of the originals but they do try their best. But with 4Kids its another story. I know they can't show blood, obscene gestures, and the like and thats fine with me. But seriously do they have to, HAVE TO, edit silly little tibits like guns the way they do (they turn them into water guns and hammer gizmos for crying out loud, surly they can do better then that. Calling them blasters or boomsticks would've at least been a little better.) <br/><br/>Much worse however is the changes to the story lines, what so bad about the word death and any reference to it. Kids learn about it eventually, heck DBZ didn't even try to ignore it. So what the point of covering it up by having characters \"in a coma\" or \"been taken away\"? I mean they don't have to show the death, but don't act like it didn't happen, thats insulting the series material. And for quality sake, I wish they stop adding ad-libs to scenes that don't need them. <br/><br/>Voice wise, its somewhat decent. Let get the good out of the way and say that Zoro (or Zolo though I don't care which name hes called), Nami, and at least most of the villains sound their roles. But Luffy, ugh way too young for a TEENAGER and screechy. Ussop, well it kinda fits him but it needs to be a little more solidified to suit the character. And Sanji? If it didn't sound like a pillow was stuck down his throat it would've been all right.<br/><br/>Music is also not bad though I am curious what the original track sounds like and I will commend 4Kids for the intro (yes I\u0085LIKED\u0085IT). Very catchy after a couple of viewings though of course it doesn't hold a candle to the original material. Kinda wish they used the 2nd opening with English lyrics but good job on the intro nonetheless.<br/><br/>Still though 4Kids does stay a bit faithful to the manga and retain some of the scenes and dialogue which am happy about, but if they really wanna please the fans their gonna have to step it up on the content level and stop with what they think the animation needs besides lack of the offensive (blood, gore, and cursing).<br/><br/>Overall I love the story, characters, situations and the grand scale of the adventure of the series in general. But am going to have to hang my head down on the dub which barely does the series justice. Still if you don't care much for how good a dub is done or have never heard of the series then the One Piece dub may be worth viewing (though for the latter, I recommend reading the manga for a better experience.).

After reading on the internet that the dub is heavily edited and nothing like the original. I grew interest on how good it is. I read the first volume of the Manga series. And liked how the story was going.<br/><br/>Wasn't until January 2007, when I finally start to check out the Anime. Only I viewed the episodes that are subtitled, uncut, and uncensored. And I grew to love it. The animation is very well done, it's funny, it's action packed, and it's dramatic sometimes. I don't even consider it a kid's cartoon, when it's more aimed to teenagers. But with an interesting cast of characters, and over a hundred secondary/miscellaneous characters. One Piece is indeed a great Anime next to Case Closed, Naurto, &amp; other ongoing series.<br/><br/>The reason why it's very underrated was because of 4Kids being the first company to distribute the anime. Which they edited and censored a lot. And many flaws in the dubbing. Such as voices that don't suit the characters' personalities. Too many pirate accents and catch-phrases that get old instantly. All the violence, blood, alchol, drugs, and nudity were altered and removed. All the weapons were altered to look harmless. 4Kids spent more time edditting than spending time on the scripts. Plus a lot of filler and small episodes were removed. And most of them were too important to take out in the series. <br/><br/>The good thing is 4kids no longer owns rights to One Piece. I knew they would drop it, because they did a poor job in introducing the series to English speaking countries.<br/><br/>With over 300 episodes, I can tell that One Piece is really big in Japan.

My description sounds dull, because it is really hard to explain even one percent of the complexity of this show. It is about dreams, about promises, about the value of life and about so many things that every new arc becomes a new life experience. Of course, the quantity of episodes may scare people, but after some few arcs, it makes the viewer feel every single message transmitted through the story. The storyline is really surprising, and every new episode can change what you thought to be certain. The details are not spared by the author, and are commonly used in further episodes. This attention to small things make the story progress in a beautiful and quick way.

You first read that name and wonder what's it about a bathing suit, a place, your not sure. You then open the pages or watch the first seconds of the anime and learn that the story is really about a world of pirates and that One Piece is actually a treasure that once belonged to Gold Roger (later you learn his real name is Gol D. Roger and that he is connected to something call the Will of D. good stuff) who was considered the Pirate King, the dream of all pirates to be. HE was executed 20 years before the story began and before he died told the world that his treasure was waiting for whoever could find it at the end of the Grand Line. You then come to the story of Monkey D. Luffy (wink wink maybe there is a connection between the two). Luffy is a naive, happy, curious teenager with a body of rubber which he got from eating a devil fruit ( a powerful fruit which gives the eater amazing powers but robs their ability to even swim, drowning them if they even try to swim, you find out there are hundreds out there and each with different abilities) Luffy dreams of being the pirate king and to be better than his mentor Red Hair Shanks one of the most powerful pirates on the sea. Luffy on his adventures meets new and exciting people and his crew gets larger along the way first his first mate and swordsman Roronoa Zoro, the sniper Ussop, the cook Sanji, the navigator and thief Nami, the doctor Tony Tony Chopper, the archaeologist Nico Robin, the shipwright Franky, and the musician Brook. One thing that sets this crew apart from all other pirate crews is not only is there crew much smaller then the others but also that each has their own special dream and are the best at their specific job. As you read the story you find out that each crew member has their own strengths and weaknesses but that they also wouldn't be around if each crew member wasn't their to help, making each person invaluable to the crew. Also you find out that unlike what many people believe Luffy is not your typical pirate he doesn't go from port to port robbing and pillaging the innocent people he actually has helped many people with problems with other pirates and can't see a friend hurt. Whats also interesting is while their are good and bad pirates the World Government which are the leaders of the world, which who are suppose to help the people are also bad and good and that the leaders have a dark secret that you begin to learn about much later. All in all the story is so well done not one arc is wasted, not one character is wasted, even minor characters get their story told and you learn of their dreams. Eiichiro Oda brings so much emotion to this story. You will cry I promise you even the toughest of guys will cry in some arcs. You will laugh there is no doubt about it the crew is just to crazy for you not to laugh. You will cheer for the crew and hiss at the bad guys. There is nothing more I can say about One Piece it is an experience that will touch you and make you rethink mangas.

Believe me, you will want to discuss each episode afterward to figure out some of the nuances of what happened.<br/><br/>The main Mad Man is the confident womanizer Don Draper, who is head of the Creative department at a mid-sized ad agency in 1960s Madison Avenue. I admit, at first I kind of hated him, but as the viewer learns more about him and his past, I learned to - not love him exactly - but like him and want to watch him endlessly. He is a complicated character who can be a very good man, but also a very bad man.<br/><br/>Don Draper is joined by a rich cast of supporting characters, many of whom deserve a show of their own: The ambitious young Campbell who is utterly sleazy most of the time, but has occasional moments of growth and even cuteness.Peggy Olson starts out as Draper's secretary, but her growth into a strong, confident woman mirrors what is happening for Woman in the 60's.

These are often graced by the likes of Breaking Bad, Deadwood, The Wire, The Sopranos, and, of course, Mad Men. Even though these shows may be indeed great, you may be familiar with a weird avoidance mechanism that usually kicks in: we may regard those landmark pieces of TV not very exciting, especially if they are a few years old - not unlike \"must-read\" literary classics that nobody ever reads - and thus we relegate them to the bottom of our watchlists, while we consume the latest, more exciting, and often less fulfilling offers.<br/><br/>Then, when you finally make the effort to watch that landmark series and realize it is every bit as good as everyone said it was, you flagellate yourself thinking why you held back for so long.<br/><br/>This Great-TV-Show-Avoidance-Mechanism happened to me in regards to Mad Men. A show about advertising and corporate people did not seem very exciting to me, and I wasn't really a fan of anyone in the cast (save Elizabeth Olson). Having in the past started to watch best-of-all-time TV shows just to drop them along the way - I'm looking at you, The Sopranos - I kept it on the back burner for a very long time. Now, after consuming all of Mad Men in a relatively short amount of time, I think it is the most consistently good TV show I have ever watched.<br/><br/>Out of the 92 episodes in the entire series on IMDb, I have rated only two a 7. All the rest got a rating of either 8 or 9 (I don't believe in perfection, so 9 is as high as I go). The key word here, alongside consistency, is even-handedness. Even though there are standout episodes, usually popping out unpredictably within seasons, rather than near the end like most other shows, Mad Men's episodes are so well balanced in terms of drama, character development and plot advancement that you feel you are witnessing interesting lives go by - extremely well costumed, photographed, written and acted lives, but fictional nonetheless.\nCompared to most other shows, there is a refreshing under-reliance on plot twists and melodramatic acting scenes, which now seem to me like the bluntest tools in the writer's bag of tricks to keep viewers tuning in every week. Perhaps Mad Men's greatest achievement is just that: through the power of character and acting alone, it manages to capture the viewers' interest while dispensing with more traditional tricks of storytelling. Of course, other facets of the production, such as the attention to period detail, costume design and cinematography are really good too. But what stands out and keeps us watching is the near-perfect marriage between solid writing, first, and solid acting, second - acting here defined in terms of how perfectly the actors inhabit their roles, not the showy, larger-than-life, award-stealing acting scenes you find in Oscar bait films. And I tell you from experience, the binge pull of the series makes it nearly impossible to watch a single episode in a sitting. I have only been able to pull that off once, with the final episode.<br/><br/>The way the plot is handled is simply masterful. For instance, if a character goes on a quest to achieve something, and we spend some time witnessing the build-up to it, it is not guaranteed they will (ever) succeed, or that at least a lesson will be learned at the end of the day. Things may end up just like they are - a lot like real life. The backdrop of US history unfolding is neither overpowering, i.e., stealing attention from the characters or events at hand, or just a side note mentioned without consequence. These historically-inspired scenes excel in revealing interesting takes on people's attitudes (secretaries crying over Marilyn Monroe's death, for instance) while providing startling contrasts to our times.\nAnother striking feature of the show I'd like to mention is that, now and again, there are a few scenes with unimportant characters - like a child doing something they ought not to do, feeling guilty, and trying to hide it afterwards - that seem to be there mostly to make us feel, \"yes, I have felt this before, this is familiar to me\". Those \"snippets of reality,\" as I call them, serve no narrative purpose whatsoever and don't even advance our understanding of the characters, but they do a great deal to establish the mood and reinforce our connection to the characters, even if indirectly. By including these moments in small amounts and in the right moment, the writers are still able to keep everything on track while disregarding the common writing advice that every scene should either advance the plot or deepen character development (or better yet, both at the same time). By the way, I have rarely seen such \"extraneous\" scenes elsewhere, and when they do appear, they are due mostly to an editor or writer's incompetence rather than to the command of their craft.<br/><br/>On top of all that, the show is also a wonderfully honest piece of television. It does not promise or deliver anything more than what you see on screen. After a couple of seasons, you are likely to be able to predict to a high degree of accuracy how it is all going to end - Mad Men operates within such a well thought out \"narrative system\", with clearly defined bounds, that you know exactly what NOT to expect. The way the series finale begins and ends makes you feel like you are watching just another episode and, miraculously, still manages to satisfy.<br/><br/>In closing, I should note that Mad Men does not provide the blockbuster-y thrills of, say, Game Thrones before it became a catastrophic failure, Westworld in its first season, or Breaking Bad during the Gus Fring phase. Above all, it shows that it is entirely possible to make great, often magnificent, television without any sort of sensationalized acting, clich\u00e9d dialogue or narrative acrobatics. I have already completely forgotten Game of Thrones and don't plan on rewatching any time soon.

The show is set in 1960, following a decade of post-WWII recovery which, with the help of rampant consumerism, transformed America from an industrial society into a \"leisure society\". One of the most rewarding things about the show is how we get to witness the many cracks which had already begun to form in the manicured facade of the '50s, slowly making way for America's rebellion against the manufactured \"good life\", and resulting in the social &amp; political upheaval of the 1960s and 1970s.<br/><br/>We get to have intimate glimpses into the various components of this process--money, power, politics, sex, race, gender roles-- in a way that makes us feel as if we're actually there in the room with the characters.

It is worth close study, not just for learning how to create a  well-structured show but also how to write one that is truly original  and potentially groundbreaking.  Story world, or arena, is one of the key structural elements in any TV  drama (see the TV Drama Class for how to create this element, as well  as the other essential structural elements of a successful show). It is  where the story takes place and it usually exists within some specific  arena that not only delineates a recognizable unit but also has a set  of rules, activities and values that defines the characters.  One of the strengths of Mad Men is its story world. Instead of the  usual arena of cops, lawyers, or doctors, Mad Men takes us into a  Manhattan advertising agency in 1960. Besides being totally unique in  TV, this story world is extremely detailed. And the detailing isn't  simply a matter of the set design, which is fabulous. It is written  into every episode. The writers weave all manner of cultural icons of  the late 50s-early 60s, including TV shows, ads, and fashion.  This has two great advantages. One is the pleasure of recognition. If  you were a kid at that time, as I was, the show is a virtual time  machine. And even if you weren't, the authenticity and texture immerse  you in the world and make you feel that \"You are there!\" The other  great advantage is that this past world tricks the audience into  believing that this is how it really was back then. The first thing we  notice when we see all of these details is how much the world has  changed. Everybody smoked back then. The men were in charge and the  women were all secretaries and housewives. That sets up the kicker. By  first thinking how much we've changed, we then realize, with even more  impact, all the ways we haven't. This story, set in 1960, is really  about today, or more exactly, the ways that human nature only puts on a  new skin and the same fundamental challenges of creating a meaningful  life must be faced by each of us, every moment of every day.  Another structural element that immediately jumps out at you if you  want to create a TV show or write for one is the desire line. In Mad  Men the desire that structures each episode is fairly nebulous, and  that's probably going to cut into the show's popularity (I hope I'm  wrong on this one). Desire is the main reason almost all TV shows are  set in the cop, lawyer, and doctor arenas. These jobs give their shows  a simple and repeatable desire line that tracks the episode every week.  Catch the criminal. Win the case. Save the life. But of course this is  extremely limiting. Most people don't spend their daily lives solving  crimes, prosecuting bad guys, and saving lives.  So while the desire line on this show may be more nebulous, it is far  closer to what most Americans do in their daily lives. These Mad Men  are in the business of selling, which, as Arthur Miller pointed out  long ago, is the archetypal American action. But they aren't selling a  particular product. They're selling desire, some image of the good life  that, because it is a fabricated ideal, is always just out of reach.  Writer Matthew Weiner's brilliant conception for this show is to  connect the selling of desire to America to the personal and work lives  of the ad men themselves. The ad men want the image of the good life in  America that they are selling to be true, even if they intellectually  make fun of the poor suckers out there who buy it. Main character Don  Draper is handsome and talented, with a beautiful wife and two cute  little kids. But he has some secrets he's keeping \u0096 like a mistress in  the city \u0096 and he feels a terrible void he has no idea how to shake.  Draper is a master at manipulating desire and creating facades, so when  he tries to live the promise for real, the \"good life\" falls apart in  his hands.  We are in Far from Heaven and American Beauty territory here. And the  second episode even had Draper give his own version of the  Existentialist credo of Sartre and Camus that was seeping into pop  culture during the late 50s (how's that for a sweet detail on a TV  show?). We'll have to see whether Mad Men can extend beyond a few  episodes without imploding. Besides the lack of a clean desire line,  the subject of hollow suburban existence will make it extremely  difficult for the writers to develop the show over the long term  without beating a spiritually dead horse. In the meantime, I'm going to  sit back and enjoy some great dramatic writing, and nowadays TV is the  only place you'll find it.", "rating": null, "helpful": "127 out of 164 found this helpful.", "date": "8 January 2010"}, {"title": " This show rocks", "content": "I also am utterly bemused to see so many negative comments on this show.

Imagine how a TV show (hologram show?) will look back at the sad folks of 2007 45 years from now. We tune out, blame others, scan the internet for porn, buy $5 coffee, and still can't fix the health care system. Apart from the amusement of looking into a 47 year-old mirror, the show gives us tremendous writing, acting, set decoration and drama. Let me re-emphasize my favorite part of the show-- set decoration. Kudos all around at the insistence of having the look of every scene strike me as true and accurate to the nth degree. I have watched each of the first episodes three times each. I love it!<br/><br/>(PS to those idiots chatting endlessly about electric typewriters and such: That's the smarminess I'm talking about.

Mad Men is one of the most original, refreshingly dark and complex shows I've ever seen on TV. Despite its potential for soap opera story lines, it consistently transcends expectations and explores fascinating characters and a radically changing social environment in a beautifully shot, artfully designed and, above all, excellently acted manner. After watching virtually no TV recently (less than three hours per week), my wife and I have been hooked all week, catching up on every episode - although we have yet to see the first, which a technical glitch in our On Demand service is holding tantalizingly out of reach. I loved Todd Haynes' Far From Heaven, and this is like a generously extended - and in some respects even more fascinating - adjunct to that. Madison Avenue is the perfect prism through which to view the early 1960s, and Mad Men, with its post-noir, Nixon/JFK/beatnik/martini melange, is a hugely enjoyable, finely measured cocktail that leaves just the right taste in the mouth.", "rating": null, "helpful": "90 out of 149 found this helpful.", "date": "8 September 2007"}, {"title": " Political correctness was not yet in style...", "content": "Women were objects, the steno pool was a sexist source of jokes, and the ad men were (they thought) at the top of their game.

As noted in previous comments (correcting other comments), this show takes place in 1960, and not the 50s. I find the criticism of this show funny--it's a television show, folks. I don't think it's meant to be 100% accurate. If it were, it would be pretty humdrum, imo.<br/><br/>A poster said he/she thought all the smoking and drinking was a bit much and contrived. However, I think it's fairly accurate. I'm in advertising NOW, and we always have vodka in the freezer...a couple of the men in the office open a bottle of scotch in the afternoons. Although the drinking on the clock isn't AS pronounced today as it was in 1960, I do believe Mad Men accurately depicts agency behavior during that time. My art director mentioned to me that the 70s in advertising were very similar; smoking and drinking in the office, on the clock.<br/><br/>I think Mad Men is genius. First of all, it's sexy; the colors, the lighting, the costumes, the dialogue...it's hot, hot, hot! It is also inspiring! The first episode's \"It's Toasted\" epiphany gave me goosebumps; ad dorks like me all know that \"ah ha!\" moment...we strive for it. We live for it.<br/><br/>So regardless of whether or not the typewriters are period or how despicable the women on the show are treated by the men (btw, there is still a lot of that going on in the work place, and for some reason, I think advertising alums are prone to it--I've encountered a couple creative and client meetings in which I was ashamed of the words coming out of the male mouths), this show is a good one that I plan to continue watching. I'm thrilled to find a show that, although it's not an accurate depiction of real \"Mad\" men and women, shows how inspiring good BIG ideas can be and that (as noted in another comment) good advertising is still created the old fashioned way...with creative and rational thinking and not computers.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "159 out of 283 found this helpful.", "date": "5 August 2007"}, {"title": " best tv show ever!", "content": "If i were stranded on a desert island and had to choose 1 tv show, Mad Men would be it. great writing, directing, acting, set design &amp; props, wardrobe/makeup/hair, etc. it's sheer perfection.<br/><br/>Matthew Weiner's attention to detail takes the show to a whole other level. above and beyond tv.<br/><br/>i'm sad it's gone. but there are 7 incredible seasons to watch again and again.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "10 out of 13 found this helpful.", "date": "16 July 2020"}, {"title": " The 60's . . .", "content": "Ten Stars.<br/><br/>When this show first aired I couldn't watch it.

Some cheesy stuff, some wow stuff, some well acted scenes. A few roll your eyes moments, but that keeps in part with the way the original was. <br/><br/>Pros: The script writing. The acting. The actors aren't Hollywood good-looking. But they are a good match with the scripts. Subtle little moments of humour, that you have to see visually and/or hear. Something ha ha will be thrown in there when you least expect it. The building of the characters. You find out little bits here and there and already starting to get a better understanding of how a character is the way he or she is. <br/><br/>Cons: The filming of a fight sequence, taking on the bad guys was terrible. That's not a spoiler. You'd fully expect to see one, seeing as it was in a huge amount of TV commercials. It sucks because you can see the distance between them, when they are at blows with each other. The editing is a shambles, it's so crappy in the action sequences. Could be much better. Hire more qualified people, it's worth it. <br/><br/>The believability of some legal situations are a bit dodgy. That detracts, and makes it a little hard to buy into it. But then again it is not a documentary. It's a TV show that's there to entertain you. Watch yourself a reality show like Cops if you're going to harp on it. <br/><br/>Summarily. My take: I like it because it's fresh. The camaraderie reminds me (a little) of: some Starsky and Hutch, a dash of 21 Jump Street, and yes the feel of the original Hawaii Five-O is there.

Etc.<br/><br/>The one show that ticks every box and is generally the best in every aspect, in my opinion, is Seinfeld.<br/><br/>It started airing in 1989, 2 years prior to my existance. I didn't start watching it until my late teens. I'm working class European, and I've never been to a comedy club or had an answering machine for my home phone. I don't care for baseball and I don't get many of the celebrity references in the show. I've never spent more than 100 dollars on a jacket and I've never been fired from a job. Even though many things they talk about and reference to are dated or from a different culture, I can relate to it and it's all funny.<br/><br/>They have the best characters of any show and the acting is phenomenal. Many people have a problem with Jerry's acting but I don't. It's not bad at all and it serves a purpose. The rest of the actors may carry the show but Jerry is the little centre that makes the rest work. He makes them all tick. He has a great report with the other characters and is simply just right.

The writing is very clever and it almost never slows down or lose it's edge. The show keeps its quality and ingenuity for 9 seasons and don't really run into any problems until they have to find a way to finish the show. Because let's face it, it's a never-ending show about nothing and everything.

Seinfeld paved the way for modern sitcoms, and it actually predicted the death of the laugh track.<br/><br/>The first time I started watching Seinfeld, I was 13.

I was dead wrong!<br/><br/>I started to caught Seinfeld reruns on the Sony Channel, I had heard a lot of great things about this show on the internet, whenever I googled Friends, Seinfeld would get recommend on my title suggestions. The first thing I noticed when watching Seinfeld, was how different it was from your average American sitcom. Whereas a lot of jokes from sitcoms like Friends and TBBT are just punchlines, Seinfeld actually had an intelligent dialogue and it was more \"dynamic\" than other sitcoms. I don't know exactly how to put it into words, but have you ever noticed how your average sitcom tends to be rather slow paced? Well, Seinfeld is very fast paced and a lot of things happen in a single episode, this was definitely not something I was expecting from a traditional American sitcom.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, Seinfeld differentiates itself from other laugh track sitcoms. as it doesn't feel like the show was supposed to have a laugh track. I think Seinfeld predicted how the laugh track format would become a thing of the past. Whenever watching single camera sitcoms like The Office, Arrested Development or It's Always sunny in Philadelphia, you can totally tell the influence Seinfeld has had on these shows. There's a very popular sitcom here in Brazil, called \"A Grande Fam\u00edlia\", arguably the most famous Brazilian show ever, and you can tell how the writers of the show were clearly influenced by Seinfeld.

Teresa Palmer unfortunately, although she does her best with her stilted dialogue simply isn't believable as an internationally acclaimed academic. The problem with being introduced as the youngest person ever to obtain tenure at Yale, is that you need to act and speak with a level of intelligence and authority that makes this real. Palmer just doesn't have the delivery or the gravitas required, as demonstrated in one of her earliest scenes when she delivers a lecture which sounds like it was written by a teenager who forgot to do their homework and dashed something off 10 minutes before class.<br/><br/>The main problem however, is that the opening episode simply tries to do too much too quickly. This would have worked so well as a slow burner, where the characters slowly reveal themselves over the first few hours of the show and we learn about their struggles with the identities they hold.

Already at its second season, I had heard a lot of good from the show, but never bothered to see what it was all about. I was exhausted, relaxing on the couch after a good workout and a cooling shower, flipping channels, something I rarely ever do, when my attention was grabbed by the intensity of the scene that was been played out before me. Something to do with Eriq Lasalle's character (Dr. Benton) and his mom or sister, I vaguely remember. Then the emergency room complications, the tension. Blood. Hospital. This must be that doctors show, ER, I thought. Let me see what this fuss is all about, I said to myself, intended to watch at least the end of that show\u0085 But it was already too late!! I was already hooked. The next week, I found myself driving back faster from my basketball practice to make sure to catch the show again.<br/><br/>Seven years later, I'm still watching (or taping) it every week. Why? Because it's the best drama show on TV, hands down, no contest. I thought at first I was biased because I studied physiology and am pretty versed in the technical jargon and medical realities they face on the show. I have a great interest in medicine and even considered a career in that path at one point in my life. However, the more I watched the show, the more I realized that it's not about the physical traumas, but about the human traumas. The admittedly romanticized, but no less relevant, reality of a profession that deals with life and death day after day, night after night. This is what makes it compelling. This is what makes it of greater scope and deeper emotions.<br/><br/>An ER doctor never gets enough sleep, never gets to go home. Is facing critical situations one after the other. Must make life-altering decisions daily. And yes, also has to cope with his personal life. Relationships, achievements and short-comings.<br/><br/>The setting aside, ER is a show that can boast about serious talent in the writing, directing, acting, casting, cinematography, editing, sound and even the pretty realistic make-up-F/X departments. And I'm talking about top-notch rendition, year after year. Just look at the list of Emmy and Golden Globe nominations over the years. What should also be kept in mind is the genuine appreciation by the public, as demonstrated for example by the People's Choice Award for Favorite Television Dramatic Series for eight years straight.<br/><br/>Created by writing mogul Michael Crichton, this show has passed a host of extremely talented actors that went on to 'bigger and better things', while still keeping the quality and the excitement of interesting and captivating stories told by equally apt newcomers. The style of the show is unique. The humour is witty and often sarcastic (see the purposely unlikable, sharp-tongued Paul Crane's Dr. Robert Romano). The tension is handled impeccably. The death of main characters truly riveting, sad and heartfelt (no question some of the best shows). The personal stories of the nurses and doctors and their work interactions with each other is worthy of a soap opera, but handled with a honest hard look at the twists and turn of life and personal interplay. The directing is smart, thorough. The long continuous takes (with great cinematography work) enables us to feel right in the action and switch from a tense situation to the other. What can you ask more of a TV show?<br/><br/>I enjoy ER and give my hats off to everyone involved with the show. Back in 1994, they re-invented the TV drama genre, upping the level of writing, acting and directing. This challenged the competition at the time and started giving us altogether better drama shows (for the most part). In its ninth season, ER is still the best; it hasn't lost any steam yet. Yes, there has been a lot of changes (actors-characters), but the essence (writers, directors, producers) of what makes the show great is still there and still strong.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, the daily stress and life-affecting decisions at County General Hospital coupled with the hectic work environment is a place I want to vicariously live in every week.

As much as I loved \"Scrubs\", that show was built around a few core characters, and once their stories were played out, that was pretty much be the end of that show. \"Cheers\" basically had a double length of life due to the fact it was actually two shows instead of one - the first 5 seasons with Diane and the last 6 seasons with Rebecca as the female lead. \"ER\" is different. It has a large cast of constantly revolving characters, and the story lines will always be there as long as there is controversy in medicine to merge with the personal drama. Early in ER's history, things were different. George Clooney's character, Doug Ross, was really the star of the show, although they did spread the stories around so that there was quite a bit of focus on the other characters too. This was a successful formula, but once Clooney became a star and a heartthrob he quickly tired of television and longed for the big screen. Thus, starting in season four, he is absent more and more as he goes off to make action films and the show began to look like it was going to suffer from \"Welcome Back Kotter\" syndrome, where John Travolta's success on the silver screen killed that show. After Clooney actually did formally exit stage left, the show changed the formula to its current one of spreading the action around with nobody in particular having the spotlight. I guess my point with all of this is, this is how ER managed to go on a total of 15 seasons, with even one extremely unlikeable character being written in as interesting, even if that one character in particular came to an end worthy of Wiley Coyote.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "12 out of 13 found this helpful.", "date": "24 July 2015"}, {"title": " Top notch weeknight television series", "content": "This show has been a remarkable, long-lasting hospital drama.

She went into labor in the parking lot, and ended up back in the ER, eventually dying after a horribly bloody delivery (Bradley Whitford from \"West Wing\" played the husband). I will never forget that episode as long as I live. That was truly one of the finest, and most heart-wrenching television episodes I had ever seen. The nightmare just wouldn't seem to end. Anthony Edwards was just remarkable. I felt emotionally drawn and worn-out after watching it. That just doesn't happen with television anymore.<br/><br/>This show can still be compelling, and it doesn't shy away from sensitive subjects.

For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.<br/><br/>The central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.<br/><br/>Standout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.<br/><br/>The show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts.

Unfortunately in recent years, ER has declined in quality due to the departure of key characters, poor story lines and dull ideas, of which accounted for the decrease in viewing figures. The current crop of characters Neela, Luka, Abby, Pratt, Taggart and Barnett don't hold a candle to the experienced old rear guard of Greene, Carter, Benton, Lewis, Hathaway and Ross. They, in particular, were the original, and arguably the best set of characters the show has had.<br/><br/>The earlier seasons of ER were great- those times were witty, exciting and a joy to behold for us viewers. Such a shame however that when the old characters had left- or in the case of Mark Greene passed away- the writers of this drama were unable to fill that void with their newer, replacement characters, as well as good story lines and as such, the programme has suffered as a result. <br/><br/>There were a few story lines I didn't agree with; likewise for example, Mark Greene and Elizabeth Corday getting married together as a couple. I always had an inkling for Mark and Susan, of whom I felt had a lot more in common with each other and considering the history they had together as close friends and work colleagues they had a bond and chemistry that was like a match made in heaven. Also, a lot of ER fans preferred Mark to be with Susan, compared to those who liked Mark and Elizabeth. And so its such a shame that we never got to see Mark and Susan as a couple. There were also tragic and memorable story lines which are worth mentioning also that touched viewers hearts- Mark's brain tumour and his evitable death, Benton's son being mentally handicapped, Weaver coming to terms with her sexuality and coming out as a lesbian to her friends, work colleagues and family, and the consummation of Luka and Abbey and Ross and Carol's relationships. <br/><br/>The main problem with the ER though were the main characters of the earlier seasons who were on the show for a few series, and then suddenly they are written off. It doesn't matter how many new ideas, characters you introduce to the show because it is the original ideas, characters and realism of the show, of which worked so well in the first place that should be further developed. I wouldn't say that ER has jumped the shark, but it is certainly no longer the same show as it was back in 1994. ER is currently in its 14th season and whilst it is somewhat of an impressive feat, many of the original cast have gone and yet it can be argued that in reference to the current season the show has gradually become boring and stale, the longer it has gone on. <br/><br/>As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end- and ER perhaps is no exception. Perhaps now it is the time to lay this ghost to rest. As much as it is arguably the best and most successful medical drama in TV history, ER during the last few years has spiralled downhill; the writing isn't as good as it was and it has lost a lot of its spark, which made it the no#1 hit US drama around. Still, as mentioned earlier, it is still the best medical/hospital drama to ever grace our screens. As not even the classic St Elsewhere and Chicago Hope comes close to matching, rivalling or surpassing ER's accomplishments. <br/><br/>Besides, this show will live long in TV history that's for sure and quite rightly so.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "20 out of 26 found this helpful.", "date": "12 October 2007"}, {"title": " Still the best medical drama EVER!!!", "content": "I first started watching when I was 14, it was 2002 and season 8.

But people tend to forget that in the 90's ER was actually more popular then Seinfeld. It was the #1 prime time show on television for 3 of it's first seasons and became a major impact on NBC's Must See Thursday line-up. The cast of relatively new-comers were Anthony Edwards (Mark Greene), George Clooney (Doug Ross), Julianna Marguiles (Carol Hathaway), Eriq La Salle (Peter Benton), Sherry Stringfield (Susan Lewis) and Noah Wyle (John Carter) and soon they all became household names. The show focused on the lives of Doctors and One Nurse (Hathaway) working at County General Hospital in Chicago in an Emergency Room. The show was very unique and unlike anything on television at the time because of the rapid fast paced action that it showed as Doctors dealt with medical trauma's. Along with those fast paced trauma situations, the show also dealt with issues such as rape, pregnancy, death and drugs. The show became even more entertaining when Laura Innes (Kerry Weaver) was added to the cast in the Second Season. Even though Sherry Stringfield finally left the show in the Third Season the show was still just as good as ever. However the show finally outlasted it's prime in the 5th season when George Clooney (The Superstar of the Cast) left to a career in movies. Even despite Clooney's loss the show still rebounded with strong additions from Goran Visnjic (Luka Kovac) and Maura Tierney (Abby Lockhart) and a bigger role for Paul McCrane (Rocket \"Robert Romano). By the end of the 6th season Julianna Marguiles finally left the show. However despite her loss, the show still carried on successfully onto the 8th season. By the end of the 8th season ER lost two of it's prime time players \"Eriq La Salle\" and \"Anthony Edwards\", however the loss of Edwards was a major blow to the series since he was the main character and main billing of the series for the first 8 seasons. After Edwards left, Noah Wyle tried to pick up the billing as lead but still the show wasn't the same and by the 11th season the show lost its indigenous spark. Now ER is pretty much a shallow grave of what it used to be with new cast additions trying to establish themselves. Though I won't take those last few seasons in account...

The show's most charismatic and engaging actors, tired of playing these characters, left one after another. The writers are tired of writing for these people, instead opting to dispatch them in violent, if cruel, ways. The show itself is even tired of its own genera, now dipping from high tension medical procedure series to a dreary melodramatic soap opera. <br/><br/>'ER' debuted to a lot of criticisms for a lack of originality, but compared to 'Chicago Hope' and the other medical shows being churned out at the time (a time I look back on fondly now in the face of the reality series fad) it was the best of the bunch. It was lighter, more exciting and more fun with dashes of well place humor sprinkled in the mix for flavor. It also had a great ensemble with a lot of electrified chemistry amongst them. In the face of the show's monstrous ratings critics (back when they had a spine) wouldn't back down, claiming that it could never keep up it at it's current pace. It took a few years, but that turned out to be true. 'ER' is hobbling around on crutches. <br/><br/>Of all the original cast who's left, the award for the best exit going to Eriq La Salle with an ending that recalls what was so engaging about the Benton/Carter relationship so many years ago. If the show had any dignity it would have wrapped itself up in the 2002 season with the death of Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards, by any account the star of the series). It would have been perfect: His daughter floats a balloon up into the sky in his honor and a show that is about saving people's lives comes to a close with it's lead passing on to the next (as the symbolism would indicate). But, no. The show couldn't even make that a season finale, instead turning around and passing the torch to John Carter (Noah Wyle), who has becoming increasingly less likable, and effectively making 'ER' a revolving door institution. In the last few years it's become a dumping ground for talent from other great cancelled NBC shows. Watch as Linda Cardellini and Maura Tierney and their once promising careers go utterly wasted. <br/><br/>'ER' is one, in a long line, of shows that I have had to write about with a preface that they were once good and have now, in their old age, become creatively dead. I put the blame squarely on the heads of the networks, which are to cowardly to let go of these shows and at the same time won't promote new shows that could have taken their place. The result is a TV wasteland: where these old warhorses (that people watch out of habit most of the time) have overstayed their welcome and the multitude of fresh, inventive new series have come and gone (and they are always out there) because the networks won't support them. Fox and NBC are the worst offenders. And it's mostly an issue of condescension toward it's viewers. They think people are to lazy or stupid to watch something new so they don't support anything new. <br/><br/>'ER' could rank up there with 'The Simpsons' as a poster child for a once-good-now-dead series. The slide began as creator Michael Crichton eased out of a prominent creative role and John Well ('Third Watch') and Christopher Chulack got their run of the ER, turning it into hack work in every department. It, like all of these shows now, is a shadow of it's former self. And in 'ER's' case it's a darker shadow. It brings in hot young stars which, more and more, just seem like fodder for the scriptwriters to kill off in mean-spirited, out-and-out tacky ways desperately designed to shock. I can't remember the last time a 'jump the shark' moment made itself known so clearly as when Romano's (a great Paul McCrane) arm was ripped off by a helicopter propeller in nauseating detail. <br/><br/>I used to admire the way this show took something that was very technical and procedural that few in the audience had any clue what was going on and made it the subject of nerve-wracking suspense. Apparently, the current crop in the rotation of this institution don't have the directorial skill to pull this off anymore. Much of the action takes place when we follow the docs to their cramped ER-doctor-salaried apartments. Who are they sleeping with? Who is weighing them down now? How will they ever deal with x family crisis with x celebrity guest star as a relative? That's the new order of the day. This might be an interesting thing if the show hadn't made all the characters as mean, obnoxious, and unrelatable as it could. In the past few years big names as Bob Newhart and Sally Field have graced the show in performances NBC hyped to the hills. <br/><br/>When the characters are at work the show is so unconfident in it's medical drama that it feels it has to find absurd ways of keeping it 'interesting' to Joe Schmo in Flyover Country who they think can't follow the jargon. Now the docs of County General contend with external disasters - small pox outbreaks, flash floods, African trips, drug addictions, runaway tanks, falling helicopters and serial killers in their midst. Ridiculous.<br/><br/>\"Better than ever\" my eye. With that slogan it sounds like NBC has squinted it's eyes shut and are trying to convince themselves just as much as the producers are trying to convince NBC that this is still a 'procedural show' and not a soap opera with multi-episode arcs that needs to be yanked off the air. The blind leading the blind. If I were Jeff Zucker I would have trashed this show, put 'Boomtown' in that spot and let the chips fall where they may. <br/><br/>Still, to date, the show's best episodes remain in the first few seasons. 'Hell and High Water' (starring Clooney) and 'Love's Labor Lost' (starring Edwards) are masterpieces of television.

It's actually a fairly easy distinction to make, the show can be very easily divided into two segments, the great television part (which lasts from Fall 1994 to Spring 2002) and the crappy television part (which lasts from Fall 2002 to Winter 2009). <br/><br/>When \"ER\" first started, it was without a doubt the best drama of television, with the best cast on television. The first season cast of Anthony Edwards as Dr. Mark Greene, George Clooney as Dr. Doug Ross, Sherry Stringfield as Dr. Susan Lewis, Noah Wyle as John Carter, Julianna Margulies as Nurse Carol Hathaway, and Eriq La Salle as Dr. Peter Benton, was irreplaceable. Each actor brought such a special character to the table, each was fully developed, and each was given equal weight in the story lines (although most would agree that Mark Greene is the closest to a main character the show ever had). <br/><br/>During the 1994-1995 season, \"ER\" didn't have a single bad episode, and proved itself to be a force to be reckoned with. Just take a look at \"Love's Labor Lost,\" still one of the most famous and heartbreaking episodes ever filmed. It's an absolutely astounding piece of TV, exciting from beginning to end, painfully sad by the time the credits roll, and acted to perfection by every single person involved. \"ER\" remained an incredibly show for years and years. Indeed, it seemed to do the impossible by managing to remain strong even as cast members began to disappear. Sherry Stringfield was the first one, leaving late in 1996, and she opened the door for all the next cast members to exit the hospital, Maria Bello in 1998, George Clooney in 1999, Gloria Reuben in 1999, Kellie Martin and Julianna Margulies in 2000. Still, the show kept on rolling. Taking a quick look through the episode list of these early seasons and you'll see some of the most classic episodes of television ever filmed, \"Hell and High Water,\" \"Fevers of Unknown Origin,\" \"Take These Broken Wings,\" \"Union Station,\" \"The Long Way Around, \"Ambush,\" \"Family Practice,\" \"The Good Fight,\" \"Be Still My Heart,\" \"All in the Family,\" \"Mayday,\" the list goes on. <br/><br/>Around 1999, major cast changes started to take place. We waved goodbye to Gloria Reuben and George Clooney and said hello to Paul McCrane (in a devilishly biting, often quite funny performance as Dr. Robert Romano), Michael Michele (as Benton love interest Dr. Cleo Finch), Goran Visnjic (as Dr. Luka Kovac,\" Erik Palladino (underused as Dr. David Malucci), Ming-Na, returning from a guest spot in Season 1, as Dr. Jing-Mei Chen, and finally Maura Tierney as Nurse Abby Lockhart. The show remained strong with these newcomers along with veterans Anthony Edwards, Noah Wyle, and Eriq La Sall, and seasons 7 and 8 retained that strong quality we'd come to expect. But then, something changed.<br/><br/>That something was the death of Dr. Mark Greene. To this day, \"On The Beach\" remains the most profoundly moving, poetic, sad, and beautiful episode of television I have ever seen. I don't think I have ever cried as much as when Dr. Green passed on, but it was done in such a beautiful fashion, it just felt right. And it should have been the final episode. The writer's had the perfect chance to end the series at Greene's funeral, with Hathaway and Ross lying flowers on his grave and saying goodbye, but no, they didn't do that. In fact, they didn't even make his death the season finale, they made it the penultimate episode of the season, preferring instead to cap off the eighth season with a lame 'crisis' episode involving the lockdown of the ER.<br/><br/>Things did not get crappy immediately. In fact, Season 9 is alright, it's just no 1-8. But things quickly started going haywire, and the departure of Noah Wyle and Sherry Stringfield in 2005 was the final nail in the coffin. Without anyone to be the rock of the show, things started to get very stupid. When John Stamos came parading through the doors in 2006, I knew any chance of the series returning to its stature in the Clooney/Edwards years was long gone, and the 13th and 14th seasons have been some of the worst television ever aired, an embarrassing attempt to rip on the far inferior \"Grey's Anatomy.\" One pines for the romantic tension and longing of George Clooney and Julianna Margulies while they watch the attempted 'chemistry' of John Stamos and Linda Cardellini, who do nothing but bone in abandoned operating rooms to the tune of same pop song. Meanwhile, the departure's in the beginning of the 15th season of Goran Visnjic, Mekhi Phifer, and Maura Tierney officially means that the oldest cast member is Parminder Nagra, cast member since season 9. That's right, NOBODY from the first eight seasons is currently on the show, and the magic that they brought with them vanished long ago. Since the year 2000, has there been a character as fully rounded and perfectly brought to life as Nurse Carol Hathaway? One might say Maura Tierney, but I doubt anybody would argue with my declaration that watching Abby Lockhart's life ravel completely out of control during the 2007-2008 season was not fun at all. If anything, it was a symbolic representation of what has happened to one of the best shows ever to air on television. Now it is nothing but a sad reminder of what once way, where untalented actors breathe zero life into boring characters. \"ER\" is finally ending in February of 2009, but take my advice and pretend it ended in 2002, when 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' accompanied Dr. Mark Greene while he drew his final breaths.

I'm not sure about this.\" That's because I have found reboots and remakes overwhelmingly are greatly inferior to the originals. But when I found that key people from the original series (like series creator Lee David Zlotoff and executive producer Henry Winkler) were returning, a little hope sprung in me. <br/><br/>Well, I watched the pilot episode. I admit it wasn't without merit; the action and stuntwork was fairly well done. But for the most part, I was very disappointed with what I watched. I could make a list of a number of things of what I didn't like about what I saw, but I'll stick with the two biggest beefs I had:<br/><br/>(1) In the original series, MacGyver was a very likable guy. He was smart, but he always remained humble with his abilities to make gizmos and get out of tight situations. However, in this remake, MacGyver is a real turn-off for the most part. His annoying narration and his brash attitude in almost every situation makes him an irritating braggart. There is precious little warmth and humanity in this guy. I don't really blame the actor playing this new MacGyver for this - he is playing MacGyver as dictated by the script and the direction, and when he's given a quieter moment he does come off in an okay fashion. But as I said, the direction and writing for the most part do him no favors.<br/><br/>(2) In the original series, when MacGyver got to work making a homemade gizmo or thinking out of a bad situation, the show took the time for him to go step by step with this. This technique built some compelling mystery, making viewers think while this was going on, \"What is MacGyver pulling off?\" Then when MacGyver pulled it off, it was a satisfying payoff. In this reboot, however, MacGyver pulls off his gizmos and escapes from bad situations in just a few seconds! No suspense, no mystery, no interest.<br/><br/>Look, I understand that a good reboot (if there is such a thing) will put its own spin on things. But at the same time, you should not destroy the core of the concept that made the original popular in the first place.

Yes, the original MacGyver has voice overs, short voice overs explaining either why he was doing something or where he was to set the stage. It seems over half of the episode is voice over though.<br/><br/>Also the updating it of him being a 'ladies' man so destroys the whole personality of him. He was a ladies man in the original and has girls falling over him not because he was smoking hot and buff (as he is in this) but rather because he was a genuinely good guy. He was an intelligent, modest individual that felt anything could be overcome if one just put some thought into it, and dealt with people with genuine fore thought instead of acting like a bull in a chine closet (see the original's 'Trumbo's World' episode for a perfect example).

It's her support of Deeks that reluctantly made us wait and see with him. It's her knowledge of Callen and her willingness to go after his enemies that carried us through procedural plot. Anyone sent to take her place is seen as our enemy and we long to see them eliminated. We wait for the little sounds bits from this diminutive character squirreling them away like precious nuts. Actually the two information analysts add to Hetty's character in a remarkable way. I was a little shocked when they added Nell as I thought Eric did a fine job without her but Hetty really made the addition work.<br/><br/>A funny thing happened along our journey with Hetty\u0085Callen and Hanna won us over. Normally with chemistry we're worried more between a woman and a man but it's also important between partners, or rather actors portraying partners. Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J have chemistry. It was a great starting point because until we got to know more about this duo it's really all we had to go on. As we watched we found their characters balanced each other out nicely as well.<br/><br/>Callen is really the central character, before or after Hetty, depending how you look at it, whoever you love more. He doesn't know much about who he or his parents are, what his first name is beyond G or why people tend to try to kill him. O'Donnell plays the chameleon well even though he never really changes. I thinks this is so because it's about embodying the type of man you would imagine a chameleon would be rather than actively being a quick-change artist. His character arc was incorporated from the beginning, and you can tell, as it is worked very fluidly into the regular cases. I believe this is key to the popularity of the show as anything that shakes up the typical procedural format is looked upon favorably by television audiences.<br/><br/>Hanna is a straight shooter, a perfect foil for the silent Callen, and a strong, moral character in his own right. You can believe his background as a former U.S. Navy SEAL and yet delight in the fact his story arcs tend to be about doing the right thing. It adds a lot of depth that it's his ability to speak an Arabic dialect and his affiliation as a Muslim that leads him to these story lines. By taking this character another direction, having him have a rather typical background, as compared to Callen, we can explore how his skills take him places you wouldn't expect. O'Donnell and LL Cool J take turns as to whose story arc will take precedent and I really like the unexpectedness of this. You as a viewer aren't always sure where the story will take you as far as the personal stories are concerned.<br/><br/>At first, Kensi Blye was just the token female for me. She was hot, badass and skillful with guns\u0085what's not to like? It wasn't until one of her fellow secondary characters was killed that she really came into her own. Her development really kept you watching during the first couple years of the show as you could see her character come into her personality. I especially enjoyed her recent character arc while she dealt with her father's past and his death, working on her trust issues. Many times it's not until you are much older that you really see your parents for what they were/are. In my opinion it was smart to link her to the Hawaii Five-O crossover as of all the characters we knew the least about her and it immediately added depth to her character. Especially as Terry O'Quinn was the connection point, as her father being a friend of his makes total sense. Daniela Ruah does Kensi justice in all the right places.<br/><br/>I have to admit I hated Marty Deeks, though I wasn't sad to see the back of Nate Getz either. Eric Christian Olsen gradually won me over as his partnership with Kensi developed in tandem to the flourishing of her character. Deeks' personality is such that he's a great foil for the distrustful Kensi, he can wear her down and teach her intimacy. Do I want Deeks and Kensi to get together\u0085no, to be honest. As soon as they do I feel like it's the death keel of the show. They like each other, they even love each other as partners do, but as of now I like that they are motivated for each others' well being and otherwise keeping it on a professional level. Now Deeks is simply part of 'Kensi and Deeks the partnership' and I no longer wish for his sudden irreversible death.<br/><br/>The producers and writers are making good choices for this show as far as killing off characters, eliminating dead weight and developing the areas of back story and character that we love or have come to love. The one flaw of the show rears it's ugly head quite often when I'm watching this show\u0085it's a procedural with all the procedural faults. Yes, NCIS: LA has the characters to back the story up. The audience enjoys watching them no matter the current difficulties, whether it's just a threat to national security or literally saving the world. It's also repetitive and non-threatening\u0085since when has Hetty, Callen, Hanna, Kensi or Deeks not come through?

However, after settling down and focusing on the episodes, mainly the one where Dom gets kidnapped, I felt like they've hit their stride.

I can relate to these characters because they remind me of my brothers, my former roommates \u2013 they have believable interactions and they have characteristics that make me want to care about them. Even Abby (who is a bit over the top as far as dress code in a work place) is someone you would trust. The other characters are believable as military/law enforcement \u2013 by their dress and behavior. NCIS story lines have a mystery about them, a plot, and we see a lot of problem solving, evidence gathering and Ducky explanations during the show.<br/><br/>I know that NCIS: LA is trying to be its own show, but seriously, then please do not associate it with NCIS! Because all it is, as others have said, is just a Hollywood macho man police show. LL and Chris are like walking ads for Abercrombie and Fitch, nothing more. There is no investigation, and other than a few vague references - no military connection. There is no strong main character (like Gibbs). Hetty will *never* be that, and in fact her motherly clucking around is annoying, and I will never be convinced she was ever some secret agent with an incredibly mysterious past. LL and Chris seem to be sharing the lead role, but neither one of them really do much, but well\u0085what do they do?<br/><br/>The profiler/psychologist guy is simply irritating. He tries too hard to be a psychological know-it-all, to show off his Doctorate, even though he points out things that are common sense. Then there are the two others \u2013 the young agent Dom, who is a total wuss and looks ready to cry at any minute. He fails to 'predict' that a suspect was going to get killed \u2013 blames himself, gets all balled up about it internally, then psych-man runs to his emotional rescue \u2013 but then its OK, because by the days end young agent is all better now. Sorry, unbelievable story line. Then there is the girl who was brought in because she was hot \u2013 she adds nothing more - why else would the team spend more time prepping her boobs before she posed as a super hacker\u0085instead of actually telling her what she would say/do as a hacker?<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the unrealistic office and the gigantic overused touch screen they use \u2013 we get it, they are hip, and techno-savvy and in LA.

In Twilight, the story surrounds Edward and Bella's relationship; In Teen Wolf, I think the story is more about Scott's transformation into being a werewolf and the challenges it brings him. Yes, Allison (his love interest) is a part of those challenges, but the story does NOT revolve around their relationship. <br/><br/>This show has a TON of potential, and I could definitely see them going above and beyond what they are doing now.

I haven't watched the film factually, I only actually managed to seek out the trailer, and it looked pretty cheesy to me anyway so I couldn't care less about it or if the series followed its plot and characteristics bit for bit.<br/><br/>MTV's Teen Wolf surely has a darker, suspenseful and edgier premise, and being an avid horror fan, is the reason why I really dig this show. One recurring factor about this show is that it has a great, well-balanced amount of horror, suspense and comedy. It maintains an fun thrill ride and by every commercial and by every end of an episode, there is always an event building up. A lot of potential is definitely going for the series.<br/><br/>This show is about a teenage social outcast at Beacon Hills High School, and a lacrosse player at the school that spends more time on the bench than playing. One night, he is bitten in the middle of the woods by a werewolf while in search of a dead body he hears about. After discovering his unwanted inner werewolf, and the remarkable abilities he gains from it that help his normal life out, he is forced to balance two lives (hiding the werewolf one) and protect those meaningful to him.<br/><br/>Tyler Posey plays the aforementioned character known as Scott McCall and does a pretty good job acting the role. He has quite the charm in his on-screen presence and has nice chemistry with Crystal Reed, who plays his high school dream girl, Allison Argent. Dylan O'Brien is his genuine best friend on the show playing Stiles Stilinski, and by far, he signed up for a very colorful character that contributes so heavily. Stiles is practically the comic relief guy, who is there to help Scott keep himself collected from harming people during periods of werewolf rage. He's nerdy and suffers from ADD, but that doesn't stop him from being witty, intelligent and sarcastic which leads to some hilarious moments that Dylan executes splendidly. His lines and delivery are certainly top notch. With certainty, Stiles is my favorite character in the show.<br/><br/>Tyler Hoechlin is Derek Hale, a survivor of a fire that took out his family, is a mysterious werewolf in town seeking out his sister, Laura and allies and mentors Scott to help him master and control his werewolf abilities. A decent character so far in the show, the role is acted fairly. You also got Holland Roden as Lydia Martin, the mean-girl type and Jackson Whittemore, the lacrosse team captain played by Colton Haynes, both roles of which are being played pretty good.<br/><br/>Speaking from a post-teen perspective, Teen Wolf is a superb supernatural teenage series right now on cable television. I have to compliment Jeff Davis on this project as well as Russell Mulcahy, who added the horror element. It brings me back to the days of enjoying shows like Big Wolf on Campus, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. My only pet peeve is how there is only 12 episodes in the first season, I mean in my opinion, seasons should have at least 20 or more episodes.<br/><br/>Anyway, 8/10 from me for one of my new favorite TV shows.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "120 out of 153 found this helpful.", "date": "8 July 2011"}, {"title": " What Twilight is ashamed to be, FUN!", "content": "When I started watching the first episode, I didn't expect anything, cause I didn't know the actors nor what the story was going to be.

So don't attempt to compare them. I'm not, just simply giving my opinion. Teen Wolf is a really suspense filled show dealing with a creature that has been told about in legend and folklore for centuries-the werewolf.

There are a lot of very great little montages, or parts where there is a lot of quick editing. The show's intro alone is unique enough to make people excited for the episode. So the editing is really on point inthe first 3 seasons, but in the 4th season it slows the hell down, and there is an abundance of really long takes, that are really impressive. Some locations in and of themselves are beautiful, and the CG is mostly well done, although it is not a prominent thing in the series, it's just a tool they use to make long takes easier to pull off, and it's pretty seamless, with the exception of a scene from 402 Payment Required.<br/><br/>The whole show and the world of it is full of details. The title of every episode is very closely tied to the story and the fact that they are hackers in the show itself. There are actual websites from the world of the show, reddit pages from 2015 (the year the show is in), and so on.<br/><br/>The descriptions for each episode on Amazon Prime are really funny too.<br/><br/>The story and the motivations of characters always change and the show is many things at once, but it's always about the main protagonists's internal, personal emotional journey, it's the central focus of the show. He is a really likable character.<br/><br/>Mental illness, hacking, and economics are all pretty accurately and realistically predicted in the show, that make the world all the more interesting.<br/><br/>The overall plot is just there so that the characters always have something to do, but the characters are the important and interesting part. All the characters are either lonely, depressed, anxious, or lost, and the show explores them very deeply. All of them are different so it makes for very fascinating scenes.<br/><br/>I don't want to say too much, but watch the first few episodes. If you like Elliot and who he is, than continue with it, and always watch it like it's his show, because it is. It is about him.<br/><br/>Another advice: Watch Season 2 in a short period of time.

Season 3 was at the time of broadcasting my favourite season of television with consistently brilliant instalments every week, including but not limited to Kill Process, Runtime Error, Shutdown and Don't Delete Me. The bold steps taken by season 3 marked a point of no return where they had to go hard or go home with their final season and after a 2 year wait we got what I believe to be the greatest season of television in the history of the media and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Every episode of season 4 is an absolute masterpiece in all respective departments. Mac Quayle delivers another incredible expansion to the score which is one of the staples of Mr Robot and is almost single handedly responsible for its gripping atmosphere, Sam Esmail brings his A game firing on all cylinders in directing and writing giving us shocking and satisfying answers to the questions that need answering and wonderfully frustrating ambiguity to the ones that didn't and the cast are all award worthy, from Rami Malek to Christian Slater, Carly Chaikin to BD Wong, even Joey Bada$$ and Elliot Villar! they all deserve the highest possible praise for their work on this show that they have helped bring to life.

I will probably come back to do a follow-up review once the show is finally over because I'm sure this won't do Mr. Robot justice while the main story is still yet to be fully unveiled.<br/><br/>From the performances, the ever-so-slowly unraveling global conspiracy in the story/plot, the characters, the directing, the writing, the cinematography, the set design, costume design, editing, and lighting (and something else I'm sure I must be forgetting), everything is top-notch for me.<br/><br/>What seems to turn people off of this show is how it radically changes in its second season, and even partially through its first season. I guess I can understand this, Mr. Robot isn't a show for everyone. But I appreciate this because I personally felt that Mr. Robot came into its own when it started to get super abstract and philosophical and character-focused later in season 2. That's where I feel like it really became \"Mr. Robot\" to me. No matter what, the plot moves nowhere before the characters are thoroughly explored. Those are the priorities of the show. The complex conspiracy in the main plot is often cast aside for character study and emotional development because the characters are the most important part of the story. This makes it so that once the full truth behind the conspiracy is ready to be revealed, it'll feel so much more rewarding getting to experience it with all of the characters that have had plenty of time to be thoroughly emotionally explored. Because, in the end, why care about the people in the world of the show if that aspect is being cut short for less impactful story arcs and reveals?<br/><br/>Overall, I'm so happy I discovered this show and there is absolutely nothing like it. It is the most one-of-a-kind serial drama series ever made, truly, and undoubtedly the best television drama of the 2010s in my eyes.

But at least it is not boring. It also seems real. And they use command tool for hacking, not one of those super spy CIA graphical interface that you just have to press \"HACK\" and you are hacker .. oh how I hate those.

In other words, it's very different from other shows. This isn't a show about a villainous main character that people mistake as an antihero. This is a show about control: what people do to gain it, what it does to the world, and how it's really nothing more than a concept that we obsess over. Mr. Robot is the story of its time, and I'm not saying that because it's an incredibly made show. It's more relevant to the country we live in than anything else on television, and perhaps more than any show in history. Think of every critically acclaimed show from the U.S., and ask yourself: were they specifically relevant to what was happening in our country at the time? This show is... and it is terrifyingly accurate. Besides being commendable for its accuracy, Mr. Robot truly rewards its viewers for paying attention to detail, much like The Wire did. Subplots are hinted in one season and left alone until they come back with a vengeance in a later season, and if you remember the hint then you're even more excited by the payoff. There are incredible symbols and motifs throughout every episode, like Elliot's beta fish \"Qwerty\", the ominous knocking at his apartment door, Price's references to WWI, Elliot's use of computer language to explain his mental state and the crises he faces, and many more. The characters have their own unique motivations for the things they do, and they never make those obvious plot-device mistakes that characters make on so many other shows to get the conflict rolling. Ralphthemoviemaker does a great job explaining why the camerawork is so amazing on his youtube video about Mr. Robot, so I won't bother repeating him, but definitely check it out for yourself. My personal favorite aspect of this show is the villains... they are outstanding. Fernando, Ray, Irving, whiterose, and the rest of the people who try to manipulate the protagonists, they all have a unique perspective of the world and a unique past that warps their moral guidelines.

He's so fantastically flawed, beautifully destructive, sane and insane.

At the risk of failing to appeal to the modern television viewer who has become accustomed to shows lacking true substance, it will most certainly captivate a core audience of viewers who feel alienated by the typical programming of the modern day. The narrative touches on topics like social and digital revolution through the thoughts of the protagonist as he narrates the episode. The status quo of modern social behavior, consumerism, and corporate greed prevailing by virtue of the complacency amongst the proletariat is a core issue that both the show and protagonist address with great disdain. It ironically begs the question that if our complacency with the quality of consumer items\u2013\u2013such as substandard television programming\u2013\u2013is so entrenched in our society, when we are finally greeted with an oasis of the kind of talented artistic expression that this show offers devoid of being dumbed-down or hollowed out in effort to appeal to a wider audience, will we be able to transcend our usual tastes, or will the level of real, thought-provoking narratives lead a disinterest among the typical armchair audience and eventually the show's demise? <br/><br/>Much like other successful programs such as \"The Big Bang Theory\" and \"House\", that received a large following despite some very technical aspects of the dialogue that tend go over-the-head of the majority of their viewers, Mr. Robot followed suit and still holds true to it's core audience by fact-checking its more technical content and preserving its validity. <br/><br/>Most films or programs with a hacker or computer science theme tend to overplay the \"coolness\" of what is shown when it comes something as dry as computer code by representing the digital world as it it were a fantasy, in lieu of the more accurate yet bland, plain-text unix coding on a computer screen. I was surprised and also relieved to see the actual computer science portions of the episode be accurate representations of a real-life scenario down the very character. As with other successful programs with story lines derived from complex subject matter (like medicine or theoretical physics), the amount of technical dialogue is not so much that it will bore the majority of the audience who will not understand it, but just enough that it will captivate and perhaps even educate them slightly as they are offered a glimpse into a fascinating world whose power and influence they wouldn't otherwise comprehend. <br/><br/>My hope is that USA\u2013\u2013the network on which the show will air\u2013\u2013will recognize that they have struck gold, and not run scared if viewership starts off slow. Most shows of this caliber do not take off will a large audience, but rather begin to amass a strong cult following and later become a huge hit. <br/><br/>We saw this kind of skepticism among network executives with Breaking Bad. Much like the idea of a school teacher cooking meth to pay his medical bills, a computer nerd with a social disorder and possible schizophrenia working for a network security firm by day and playing social hacktivist by night is not something that immediately screams \"blockbuster\". <br/><br/>It's my hope that the timing of this show will prove to be its greatest strength in light of recent events in the hacking and cybersecurity world involving Anonymous, Edward Snowden, Julian Assange, Ross Ulbricht, and Aaron Swartz. Viewers are educated now more than ever when it comes to hacking and the impact that individuals can make on society through their \"hacktivist\" work.<br/><br/>The protagonist of Mr. Robot is similar in many ways to these individuals, and the plausibility of his disposition is validated by their individual plights. Where they have fallen short of their ultimate goals and failed to elude capture, the audience will root for their new favorite anti-hero since Walter White to incite a social revolution through his hacktivist work.

It was a catastrophe, quite literally an act of utter barbarity.\nOr in other words: A very poorly-written piece of generic action sci-fi.<br/><br/>Right from the start, the series falls flat on its face.\nInstead of \"boldly going where no one has gone before\" and exploring strange new worlds and charting the unknown, Season One of \"Picard\" is essentially about how the artificial intelligences we create could overcome us. Well, that's very interesting and original, RIGHT?\nAs for the rest of the plot:\nEverything's pretty much nonsense, there are loads of things that don't make sense or remain unexplained and there's a significant amount of continuity errors. The writing feels like someone collected drafts from the trashcan in the writer's room and turned them into one big, serialized mess.\nThe show also has the strange habit of randomly introducing unnecessary subplots &amp; concepts just to forget about them later.<br/><br/>The characters: Unnatural, clich\u00e9d, one-dimensional, antagonistic, always depressed and over-emotional - That's how I would describe them.\nI mean what character traits other than that do they even have? Jurati vomits all the time, Rios is a poor-man's Han Solo, Elnor just exists, Raffi is a arrogant drug-addict who lives in a trailer (in a time where poverty was solved centuries ago and drug addiction is easily curable), Seven of Nine's now an angsty lesbian alcoholic murderer, Picard went from being a intelligent, deeply moral &amp; passionate leader to a childish, impulsive &amp; confused fool, and then there's Narek &amp; his mustache-twirling villain sister and believe me, they have a rather strange relationship going on...<br/><br/>Even the way the show depicts the Federation is completely off: A bleak, problematic and merciless place. There's classism, money made a comeback, everyone drinks real alcohol (what happened to synthehol?) &amp; smokes, people swear and use 21st century contemporary language and no one's happy.\nIt seems like the entire Federation society has turned into a dystopia - the exact opposite of Star Trek. Funny, isn't it?<br/><br/>Picard suffers from the same deseases that plagued Discovery: Too much emphasis on spectacle, action &amp; plot twists, rushed concepts &amp; plotlines which are sometimes \"borrowed\" from different movies, series and games (in this case especially Mass Effect 3), cringeworthy dialogue and unnecessarily gruesome violence &amp; gore.\nThis is exactly the type of entertainment that appeals to the audience CBS tries to target: Empty-minded people with attention spans of goldfishes.\nWhat a great way to honor Roddenberry.<br/><br/>And seriously, what kind of uncreative &amp; talentless people worked on this show? Shutterstock footage, copy &amp; pasting of an entire fleet of starships, heavy usage of Discovery's design language...\nThis show is excellent at being lazy and unoriginal.<br/><br/>I find it laughable that there are fans who blindly defend this load of crap. Since its first episode, ST:P has done nothing but constantly contradicting &amp; ignoring what made Star Trek, well... Star Trek.\nThe problem is that both ST:P &amp; ST:D try to emulate Deep Space Nine's darkness and more \"realistic\" tone without even attempting to understand why it worked for that series. DS9 never contradicted the franchise's positive view of the future, it only challenged and explored it further.\nAnd despite all the \"grittiness\" DS9 had, it was, like all iterations of Star Trek up to that point, quite optimistic and hopeful.<br/><br/>Reddit user KingofMadCows wrote a very insightful comment on that subject:<br/><br/>\"Discovery and Picard have the darkness of DS9 but not the depth.\nThey want to exist in the more complex and gritty world of DS9 but they still resolved problems as easily as TNG, without doing any of the extra work of DS9.\"<br/><br/>But I guess this is no longer Star Trek.

By the 2nd episode, it started to become obvious that this was never going to be as good as the Star Trek shows and movies between 1966-2005.<br/><br/>Firstly, the writing was all over the place, and the story was, for the most part, superficial to non-existent. So many sub-plots were never followed up with or clarified, and questions were left unanswered. Writers magic was used in so many cases where a more dedicated person would have thought things out sensibly. For example, the 'imagination tool'. Also, the situation surrounding the federation's fall were not on par with what the Star Trek universe lore had set up already, and the only way it could have fallen that way was if people from today took over the future and ran it with today's knowledge. Some of the decisions they made were completely ridiculous, and made it seem like somehow the Star Trek universe lost most of its intelligence since Voyager returned from the Delta Quadrant. It was just a complete mess.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting was unconvincing. They were just going through the movements of an unbelievable story. They obviously didn't believe it and are clearly rooted in today's world instead of Star Trek's. I didn't care for any of the characters, and found most of them to be unlikable. Even Picard was a shell of his once interesting self, not the strong leader he once was. The actor who played Data was the best of the bunch when he played Data, but was also unlikable when he played human roles.<br/><br/>Thirdly, excessive swearing was difficult to take serious after Star Trek set 40 years of good storytelling, showing a future that had evolved from excessive swearing, or didn't use it at all, and opted to be diplomatic and intellectuals instead. In Picard we had juvenile foul-mouthing in most every episode. In fact, it ruined the whole series and completely took me out of it right from episode 2 when it was first used.<br/><br/>Fourthly, the show-runners were laying heavily on the nostalgia card, betting on name dropping, and character pop-ups from former series. This alone was the first indication to me that they knew they didn't have a story. By the end of the season it turned out nostalgia was the only real card they had to play. It felt like they were patronizing fans and insulting their intelligence with this, and even that turned into a waste since it didn't help a trash-heap story at all.<br/><br/>Lastly, it was obvious they were doing their best to hold back political correctness as much as they could (probably from backlash in Discovery), but it still kept creeping in. They let it ruin much of the Star Trek lore, and now it's clear they're ready to come out with it in full force for season 2, which is poised to be another aimless season that they'll make up on the fly, or possibly plagiarize.<br/><br/>This isn't Star Trek.<br/><br/>Star Trek is about a future to strive for, and to aspire to be like - better than ourselves today. But every movie and show since the finale of the Enterprise show in 2005 has completely ignored this, and Picard is no different. We are presented with a darker future, one that is not inspiring, or even worth striving for. It's now the opposite, and makes me want to fight any future like that from arriving.<br/><br/>I gave it 10 episodes, and after the disappointment wore off and after gathering my thoughts over the last 2 months, I've decided I will not watch another episode of this. Even though Picard is not as bad as Discovery, it's the second worse Star Trek series created, and the second Star Trek series that doesn't interest me at all.<br/><br/>What i wanted was a thought-provoking and intellectually stimulating show, depicting a future worth striving for, wanting to visit.

Instead we got a show that further attacks the heart and soul of the franchise. Rather unfortunate, honestly.<br/><br/>Picard is a show that, rather than reviving Star Trek and breathing fresh air into an old idea, takes it further down the path of dystopian science fiction, focusing on tired subject matter and cheap action to drive it forward rather than focusing on providing good story telling, interesting characters, and deep exploration of the world around them.<br/><br/>STP is a very flawed show that had all the potential in the world, but didn't apparently have the talent and vision behind the scenes to make it work. The tone is all over the place. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. And the plot is pretty much recycled from any of the many other shows about secret organizations and terrorism that have been made in the last couple decades. They had a whole universe to explore, an endless number of good choices that could have been made, and they chose to focused on interpersonal drama, terrorism, and secret plots. So very boring and unoriginal.<br/><br/>The camera work can get pretty bad, too, as can the acting and dialogue. Half the time it feels like they are trying to force a response from the audience that the scene isn't naturally providing. I simple conversation with overly dramatic music, for example. Or a scene with odd camera work that doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>Picard has its redeeming moments, don't get me wrong, but they seem few and far between. Mostly it's a pretty juvenile show. Patrick Stewart often feels out of place in this off-kilter version of the Star Trek universe they have created, and unnecessary to the story. Certain scenes they have chosen to include are downright cringe worthy, in fact.<br/><br/>Of all the directions they could have taken the franchise this seems like one of the worst, and it is unfortunate. I can watch the older shows time and again, yet found myself struggling to get through this show even once. It is just so unoriginal. So many other shows have explored these subjects and told this story, and done it better.

Perhaps the studios felt that they couldn't compete with The Expanse, and so they decided to turn the story into a Star Trek franchise much like they did with Star Trek Tardigrades, I mean...

I hope 'Downton Abbey' has a similar decency about it.\" - Julian Fellowes <br/><br/>\"Downton Abbey's\" written by Julian Fellowes, a Tory peer, Baron, monarchist and husband-to-royalty, so right away you know it has a clear agenda. Restorative nostalgia to the max, and released to coincide with a fresh round of British austerity measures, the television series sees a family of early 20th century aristocrats living in a palatial estate and tended to by a sprightly band of servants. Sounds interesting? <br/><br/>Forget Renoir's \"The Rules of the Game\", Altman's \"Gosford Park\", and the past 500 years of human history and social theory. No. In \"Downton Abbey\", the class system exists for the benefits of those at the bottom, and proves as bothersome to those unfortunate few at the top as it does those lower down the social hierarchy.<br/><br/>Fellowes serves up the platonic ideal of an English aristocrat. Good, selfless and caring, our Lords and Ladys bend over backwards to serve their servants, graciously offering them jobs, assistance, compassion, awards and so forth. They are benign despots, all-powerful, their authority final, but more sage and caring than any elected politician could ever be. The rich, in other words, are socially responsible father figures. They are invested in their households, in their communities, and provide a far reaching social benefit; without the rich to mercifully protect them, the poor would be forced out into the cold to fend for themselves. Indeed, Fellowes frequently has his rich folk sacrifice their bodies, their status and their wealth for the servant class (joining war efforts, taking on limping servants etc). The message - rife with false binaries - isn't only that servants should be content with their roles, but that one, regardless of class, cannot and should not avoid servitude. Even the rich are servants to their fellowman.<br/><br/>Significantly, the series' villains are all either homosexuals, socialists or members of the servant class. In the second series, villains become figures of new wealth; modern capitalists who don't respect the supposedly loving, symbiotic relationships of late aristocracy. As the series focuses on an individual household rather than systems, the nobility and selflessness of Fellowes' aristocrats justify the system in which they spin. It's a very classically conservative notion of history (in actuality, servants couldn't look at, let alone speak to their masters), a proudly hierarchical world in which all social conflicts and tensions are resolved without any restructuring of class relations. Stratification is posited as being natural, optimal and only the deviant or repellent are incapable of adapting or finding accommodation within it. No talk, of course, of where our Earls and Lords acquired their wealth, land enclosures, the lives of the impoverished outside the mansions or how the system's social relations hinge on an in-build bondage ingrained within \"economics\" (ie money) itself. Elsewhere the series brings up occasional Big Issues (war, feminism, Ireland etc), but only to engage in the smug, back-patting afforded by hindsight. This is a benign, liberal aristocracy, for an age of \"caring\" capitalists.<br/><br/>All \"Abbey's\" arguments in favour for the class system were once put forth by George Fitzhugh, an American social theorist who published racial and slavery based sociological theories in the antebellum era. Fitzhugh essentially argued that Negro slaves needed \"strong white daddies to look after them\". That slavery \"protects the Negro\", \"ensured that blacks would be economically secure and morally civilised\" and that the evils of modern capitalism, which was gradually replacing slavery, would expose poor blacks to persecution and suffering. The new rich, Fitzhugh argued, were promoting a form of competition which would harm blacks. Afterall, the slave belongs to its owner, and owners take care of their capital, take care of what they own, provide them with food and shelter, unlike those pesky capitalists who merely rent labour. Fitzhugh even went so far as to defend slavery because \"capitalists are anti Negro racists, whilst slavery is not racist\".<br/><br/>Fellowes is doing the same. Or rather, the arguments are always the same, no matter the social reconfiguration taking place. Hence, slavery is good because slave owners take care of their slaves, aristocracy is good because the aristocracy takes care of their servants, and capitalism is good because employees take care of their labourers. What each argument does, regardless of historical time period, is posit the lower classes as dependent on power without questioning how and why this power is structured, created and propagated in the first place.<br/><br/>In the early 1980s, Immanuel Wallerstein, a renowned social scientist, outlined 12 characteristics which he believed were \"unique\" to modern world systems. His aim was to show that modern capitalism, in the affluent 80s, was a kind of \"step up\" from both the aristocracy of \"Downton's\" era and the feudalism of the distant past. By 1989, though, Wallerstein had completely reversed his position. All the presumably unique characteristics of the \"modern world system\" were also true of the medieval and ancient world systems. He could find no substantial distinctions that would satisfy his categorisations. The point isn't only that there were no clean transition from feudalism to aristocracy to capitalism as such, but that power proves capable of propagating itself.<br/><br/>But why would a series which glorifies the class system, posits class hierarchies as inherently benevolent and idealises master/servant bonds, be suddenly so very popular? Why would a series about inherited privilege, ineluctable servitude, be popular in an era of Occupy, Austerity, Bank Bailouts and massive corporate tax dodging? Perhaps because \"Downton\" presents a Utopian version of the past for the purposes of painting, and thereby bolstering, a contemporary system capable of weathering any upheaval or shock. Or perhaps it's simply a severe form of Stockholm Syndrome.<br/><br/>4/10 - See \"Remains of the Day\", \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and \"Never Let Me Go\".

DISCONNECTION<br/><br/>The series manages to show two physically close environments as if they were on different planets. This underlines the disparities between social milieus in early 20th century Britain.<br/><br/><ul><li>Servants frequently go from the basement to the ground floor, however we never see them arriving there or leaving. This disconnection is first spatial: they sometimes start climbing the stairs, yet the camera never follows thoroughly (there are travelling shots following characters, but they always happen on the same storey). It is also temporal: we suddenly see servants on the ground floor without a link to previous action in the basement. Granted, there is a technical reason for that: all action on the ground floor and above was shot on site (Highclere Castle, UK), while action in the basement was shot in Ealing studios, since the castle's basement was not suited for period settings. Nonetheless, it would have been easy to film the servants going up the stairs in the studio and then edit their arrival on the ground floor (or conversely), which the series never does.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Likewise, we see servants in above floors (aristocrats' bedrooms and servants quarters), yet never witness them arriving there. We do see them in the side staircase, but never going from there to the different levels: it is as if these stairs were separate quarters disconnected from the rest of the castle. Stairs could represent the possible link between servants and aristocrats (below versus above), but are denied their symbolic connection since they seem to lead nowhere. Here the reason cannot be technical as for the above topic, since the stairs are effectively located in the castle.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lighting on the ground floor and the aristocrats' bedrooms is generally bright, while in the basement and the servants' quarters it is always dim. Naturally, this can be explained by the windows sizes, however the contrast is pushed to the extreme: on cloudy days, the aristocrats' levels could be grim which rarely happens, while on sunny days the servants' levels could be bright which never occurs. Moreover, in the aristocrats' levels, colours are generally warm (yellow, red, white), while in the servants' levels they are usually cold (grey, brown, blue).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Camera movements in the aristocrats' levels are fluid, poised, lengthy, while in the servants' levels they are brisker, faster, shorter. In the basement, the camera is frequently hand-held, highlighting the intensity of the work performed. Also, there sometimes is a character or an object in the foreground while action occurs in the background: we seem to bump into elements. The use of long lenses (foreground is blurred, background is sharp) increases this sensation of confinement. By contrast, in the aristocrats' levels, image is generally sharp.</li></ul><br/><br/>2. SIMILARITIES<br/><br/>Despite the symbolic gap between them, aristocrats and servants sometimes experience similar events. The message seems to be: regardless of social differences, we are all humans, with joys, grieves, qualities, flaws and secrets. Here are just a few examples (I will refer to characters either by their first or last name, depending on what is most common in the series).<br/><br/><ul><li>Servants are all decent, with two notable exceptions, who are real \"villains\": O'Brien and Thomas. Aristocrats are all decent, with two notable exceptions, who are real b**ches: Edith and Mary (although Mary reveals herself as more complex towards the end of Season 1).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Servants cannot marry because of their function: Mrs Hughes turns down her lover; Carson is a long-time bachelor; the love between Anna and Bates remains chaste. The Crawley daughters cannot marry: Mary turns down pretenders including Matthew, who then turns her down; Edith is turned down by Anthony Strallon; Sybil is still young.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>William loves Daisy, who loves Thomas who prefers men. Edith loves Matthew, who loves Mary who does not love anybody. Both settings progressively evolve, however they occupy most of Season 1.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bates has a complex and shameful past: war, alcohol, thievery, jail. Mary has sexual relations before marriage, which was scandalous at the time, especially for an aristocrat; and it provoked the death of her lover Kemal Pamuk. All these terrible secrets will progressively be revealed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Various lesser intrigues between the aristocrats are echoed with the servants, and conversely. For instance: Thomas sends a letter to compromise Bates; Edith sends a letter to compromise her sister Mary. Gossip is widespread between the two milieus and within each.</li></ul><br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>On both above topics, \"The Rules of the Game\" (Renoir, 1939) greatly influenced the series as well as \"Gosford Park\" (Altman, 2001), written by Julian Fellowes himself. Yet \"Downton Abbey\" manages to create a specific atmosphere, distinct from these two movies.<br/><br/>If I had to rate Season 1 compared to a cinema feature, I would probably give it 7/10: despite all its qualities, it does have some downsides. Characters are Manichean. It triggers easy emotions. Some events are far-fetched (e.g. the feud between Mary and Edith, Kemal's heart attack). It mostly shows early 20th century as good old times and aristocracy as a benevolent power. The worst villains are all non-aristocrats: O'Brien, Thomas, Carson's ex-stage partner, the drunken mob at the suffragette rally.<br/><br/>However, most of these drawbacks can be explained by the series format, which generally requires simplification to maintain attention on the long term. Hence as a series it probably rates 9/10 for all the qualities briefly described at the beginning of this review.

One was \"Brideshead Revisited\" based on Evelyn Waugh's novel and the other was \"Jewel in the Crown\" \u2013 the dramatisation of Paul Scott's extraordinary \"Raj Quartet\". Both these series were masterpieces and if you watch them today you will find they have stood well the test of time. The drama tradition of Granada, of some of the other commercial companies and, of course, of the BBC is strong and is something of a jewel in the crown of British television. It is also an important source of revenue, not least in the United States, where posh British TV has a small but well-heeled following. This brings me to \"Downton Abbey\", superficially in the great tradition and with obvious links also to the very successful and ground-breaking \"Forsyte Saga\" and \"Upstairs Downstairs\" of the 1960s and 1970s. Downton is set in the second and third decades of the twentieth century and we have moved from Edwardian complacency and excesses through the horrors of the Great War to the early 1920s. As with \"Upstairs Downstairs\" we see life, and to an extent history, through the eyes of the aristocracy and simultaneously from the perspective of those in the Servants' Hall.<br/><br/>Over the 16 episodes that have so far been transmitted, spanning the years 1912-1920, the stories are reminiscent of a Soap like \"Eastenders\" or \"Coronation Street\" in that there are episode ending cliff-hangers and improbably extreme story developments. Every historic event from the sinking of the Titanic through women's suffrage, the Irish independence movement, the Battle of the Somme, the post-war Flu epidemic and many others is a trigger for something to happen in the plot. In addition we have adultery, murder, homosexuality, alcoholism, illness and recovery or death, the black market, inter-class affairs and marriage, and most of the seven deadly sins in sharp relief. The stories are often signalled rather obviously and it is an amusing parlour game to predict what will happen next - as with any soap. Taken as a whole the story is totally preposterous and the \"issues\" are not handled with any subtlety at all \u2013 there is none of the restraint of a Galsworthy, a Waugh or a Scott.<br/><br/>The starting point for Downton Abbey was in the creative mind of the writer Julian Fellowes and its main inspiration was clearly that author's film script for \"Gosford Park\" - which won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 2002. But whereas this film lasts a couple of hours and was tightly directed by Robert Altman Downton goes on for 20 \u2013 and running! The characters are largely pastiches of real people. Maggie Smith, for example, is wonderful as the Dowager a figure straight out of Pantomime - Dame Maggie overtly seeks hisses from the stalls. Fine actors like Hugh Bonneville, Penelope Wilton and Dan Stevens struggle with a script that is always close to parody and sometimes spills over into farce. Indeed at times there is a slight sense that they know what they are being asked to say, or the absurd plot twist in which they are expected to participate, has moved into lampoon territory and that Mel Brooks or the Directors of \"Airplane\" or \"Something about Mary\" are in charge.<br/><br/>The great strength of Brideshead Revisited, Jewel in the Crown and the Forsyte Saga is that the stories had passed the tough test of being seen as credible in the original novel format. They were great books before they became great television. The original screenplay of \"Downton Abbey\" has had none of the checks and balances that apply to the written word. And because the medium is only to be visual, and in a number of time-limited episodes, it is presumed that there is a need to provide colourful action rather than attempt any true characterisation. We are supposed to like the Earl of Grantham because he is a benevolent toff \u2013 fragile but caring with a true sense of noblesse oblige. But compare his character, which is utterly superficially sketched, with the way that Evelyn Waugh gradually introduces Lord Marchmain in Brideshead - we feel we know the Marquess long before we meet him. The same superficiality applies to Downton's \"below stairs\" characters most of whom are stereotypes we have met frequently before.<br/><br/>The visual impact of \"Downton Abbey\" is strong and in this area the production values are high. The sets, both in the studio and on location, are beautifully designed and the costumes and other artifacts are good and look authentic. There is a strange paradox here which I suspect has led some to assume that because it looks good then it is good - perhaps ignoring the often wooden acting and sloppy direction. Downton's viewing figures are good and this is no doubt reflected directly in the income received from advertisers and the revenue from the sale of overseas rights and DVDs etc. - it is evidently a profitable venture. So a legitimate response to those critics who deplore the triviality of the series would be to never mind the quality and weigh the receipts.<br/><br/>There is nothing really wrong with \"Downton Abbey\" if you see it for what it is \u2013 a Soap of fleeting interest with can pass the time on an autumnal evening. However Downton does take itself quite seriously at times and some of the acting is so pompously self-important that it can only be seen as light comedy, which it isn't meant to be, or over-written moralising trash - which at times it comes dangerously close to being.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "50 out of 93 found this helpful.", "date": "28 December 2011"}, {"title": " I think", "content": "I have fallen in love with lady Violet Crawley.

Julian Fellowes is in fine form here as the writer, taking on a story about 1912 England and the microcosm of Downton Abbey, a mansion and grounds run by the elegant Robert Crawley, Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville), his mother Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Dame Maggie Smith at her best), and Cora Crawley Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern0 - the moneyed American whom Robert married in order to retain the Abbey and their daughters, Ladies Mary (Michelle Dockery), Edith (Laura Carmichael) and Sybil (Jessica Brown Findlay). Much of the story revolves around the problem of inheritance (entailment) as the heirs apparent to the Abbey are victims of the Titanic disaster that opens the story. The Abbey must be passed on to a monied heir and the hunt is on. <br/><br/>As with other Masterpiece Theater pieces this story examines the 'upstairs/downstairs' bifurcation of the Abbey and the cast of characters 'below' is as fine as the gentrified owners: Mr Carson (Jim Carter) is the head voice, followed by Mrs. Hughes (Phyllis Logan), the cook Mrs. Patmore (Lesley Nicol), the footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) who just happens to have had an affair with the visiting Duke who could have been the new heir, and the new valet John Bates (Brendan Coyle) - a man the staff doesn't tolerate because of his use of a cane due to a war injury, etc etc etc. They are all fascinating people with their own set of prejudices not unlike those of their masters. <br/><br/>The story progresses along the lines of finding a new heir for the Abbey, a problem that involves everyone in the household, and it is this strange playing out of English class distinction that makes the series so engrossing. Another classic form the Masterpiece Theater. <br/><br/>Grady Harp", "rating": 10, "helpful": "25 out of 43 found this helpful.", "date": "10 January 2011"}, {"title": " The difference between clich\u00e9 and classic is in details...", "content": "...and this show is the perfect example. I managed to watch both seasons in just 2 days. It was like reading a good book, I just couldn't put down my laptop :) I am doing the second round right now, taking it slower and enjoying it minute by minute.<br/><br/>I have to start by pointing out that the writing is not perfect. The plot is not exactly new, you may have seen or read something similar a thousand times before. The lack of originality in writing is usually a deal-breaker for me but in this case, I must say that I am astonished by how much I like this particular show. I believe there are several factors responsible for that.<br/><br/>Firstly, there's the acting. The characters in the show may seem kind of black &amp; white at first but as the story continues and plot unravels, you realise there's more than meets the eye to everyone involved. The actors are doing superb job peeling of the layers and showing the viewer what's hidden underneath. Also, I feel it's very simple to connect with the characters, there are those you instantly like and root for and those you're almost allergic to but even they may surprise you and make you question your point of view.<br/><br/>Second element that puts this show on the top is its visual side. The costumes are highly detailed and altogether breathtaking. I don't remember when was the last time I was so inspired, the fashion of the era was so beautiful and the show displays it in all its glory. I also enjoy the environment of Downton. The show was shot in a real location and it's not just another piece of studio work that makes you claustrophobic. You get the sense of real space in every scene, every shot, which is so rare these days with most of movies and TV shows using computer technology all the time.<br/><br/>The last thing I feel I have to mention is the music. The scoring in Downton Abbey is very delicate and yet very powerful. It perfectly underlines the story.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I cannot say there's no place for criticism and improvement in Downton Abbey but despite its insufficiencies it's still one of the best shows on television these days because it stays true to certain standards that we might have forgotten lately and I am truly thankful for such a beautiful reminder...", "rating": 9, "helpful": "13 out of 20 found this helpful.", "date": "21 September 2012"}]}, "/title/tt1196946/": {"title": "The Mentalist", "reviews": [{"title": " Unique, great plots, humor, action, great characters", "content": "One of the best shows I've ever seen, this series has it all: countless surprising plot twists, humor, long satisfying story arcs, well-drawn characters who change and grow, murders, action, revenge, pathos, more humor, quotable &amp; memorable dialog, suspense, multiple romantic story lines... everything.

These are two of the greatest actors I've ever watched. I wish they won more awards and received greater recognition.<br/><br/>With the character development in the series, the writers were on point. Jane and Lisbon are mature characters; credible, solid, exceptionally developed in all aspects. Because of the subtlety of the writing and nuanced performances, their arc over the 7 seasons is just sublime.<br/><br/>Humour and darkness are perfectly balanced and refined in both the writing and performances.

While both shows take a similar premise, they're so different in many ways. This show does have a man with the ability to spot minute details, but he does so much more, he plays mind games with people, reads their emotions and sets elaborate traps to catch them. Many compare him to Shawn Spencer of Psych, but I would rather compare him to Sherlock Holmes, except more tortured. The pilot obviously takes on a more serious approach than Psych and the dynamics of the show go from cute and funny to deeply disturbing in seconds.<br/><br/>It takes your one crime per episode procedural drama with a gifted detective and takes it one step further. Patrick Jane is more self effacing, gets into trouble and is a known fraud. But he isn't mean or intentionally rubs people the wrong way like House(also based on Holmes) or Spencer. He is very soothing, warm, instills trust and seems to get along with people pretty well, from the guy who did it to his team. At the same time, he does like to flex his intellect and power over people and loves to play games to get answers (and yet, so charming when he does so). So it's kind of disarming when you begin to see there are some serious issues with this character, he doesn't sleep, doesn't believe in life after death (and is happy that way), and is actually anti-social with the group. There are further reasons as to his psychosis that won't be discussed. Behind those warm baby blues, warm smile and calming presence, there is a man being crushed to death by very weighty issues.<br/><br/>Patrick Jane is a fantastic character, he's obviously brilliant, but a little distant and isn't fond of working with others. As a former faux psychic he seems pretty ready to disable believers. And of course, Simon Baker is a brilliant actor and is the reason I tuned in (I admit I too feared this was a Psych ripoff) and he brings so much depth to this character. When he plays his mind games he always brings a sense of \"I know more than you and there is nothing you can do about it.\" type of amusement and when Red John or death apparates in conversation you see a distant look in his eyes that conveys more than what he actually saying (the psychiatry appointment in the pilot was incredible). He really plays off the layers of Patrick Jane well, pulling some back and when we get a true glimpse, the layers fall back in place. And credit goes to the set-up of Red John as his \"nemesis\" through a copy cat. He and Jane have a very tense meet up awaiting them, but I can wait for that just to experience the chase and the unraveling history between these two.<br/><br/>Another credit would go to the incredible Robin Tunney (of The Craft and Empire Records) who was reason number two for watching the pilot. She has had very little to work with in the first two episodes (but her role grew from 1 to 2 so I have faith), but she plays the hard nosed detective with a little more prudishness and distance than I would have expected. How much she knows about Jane and how far they go back is a mystery to me and their dynamic is interesting. She doesn't fall into stereotype and has retained a beguiling sense of mystery. I also appreciate the lack of clich\u00e9d moments \"fraught with sexual tension\" between Lisbon and Jane.<br/><br/>And I'd also like to credit Tim Kang- a lovely surprise and I enjoyed his character who really doesn't give a crap about hurting people's feelings or stepping on toes, he just wants to solve the case. Love it and kudos.<br/><br/>My only complaint would be explained in the two above paragraphs briefly. I love Cho and Lisbon and hope to get see more of the team (Van Pelt and Rigsby are really cute as well), but I understand this is called \"The Mentalist\" and there is still time to slowly introduce Jane's history with the team and more in depth coverage of these characters. I've only seen two episodes and I think what I anticipate will come into fruition. <br/><br/>Overall, this show is well written, well acted, and beautifully shot. I for one have set up a season recording on my DVR and cannot wait for the next episode, yes you can consider me a fan and I hope you head over to CBS.com and give this show a chance.

First of all if you're in dilemma of deciding whether should watch it or not then put your doubts aside and give it a go, you will not regret it . This is one of the best show I have ever seen.\nThe story is very well written and it's surpassed only by the acting of the cast involved. Simon Baker's performance in The Mentalist is nothing short of spectacular, he brought the character of Patrick Jane to life. A well balanced protagonist that is smart, sexy and have a good sense of humour, plus Patrick's background story is so emotionally strong that you can't help yourself to connect with it in a deeper way.\nThe chemistry between Simon Baker and Robin Tunney's character is portrayed so well by these two, and their amazing friendship off-screen is reflected on the show in a wonderful way. Jane and Lisbon's relationship is truly one of the most beautiful relationships ever written for TV. But, it's not just them you feel attached to. You'll get fascinated by the tricks of a Mentalist. He is witty, sarcastic, arrogant at times, manipulative and extremely intelligent with an extraordinary IQ and memory. He is gonna trap you into his wide skills of observation, manipulation, cold reading, mind bending tricks &amp; ideas. The way he solves the cases is magnificent to watch and so so intriguing. I can ever go as far as to say that his intelligent surpasses that of Sherlock Holmes. This guy can literally get inside the minds of the smartest &amp; the toughest criminals and manipulate them to do things his way. He can get inside Joker's head and make him commit suicide, yes you heard it right. Such is the mind of a brilliant man, Patrick Jane, the main protagonist. You're gonna love him every single moment of the show.\nWon't give you any spoilers or anything but a great show needs a great antagonist, &amp; it can't get any better than Red John. From the suspense regarding his true identity, to the mind games between him and Patrick, all of it is presented so well to keep you intrigued for the entire course of show. And even after Red John this show is a delight to watch.\nAnd I dare say that I have finally found a show with the PERFECT ENDING. A show can not get a better closure than this . The only thing sad about the ending was the fact in itself that the show was ending. Now it's hard for me to imagine a day without watching The Mentalist. It's gonna stay with the watcher forever.\nThank you Bruno Heller for giving us this masterpiece.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "33 out of 34 found this helpful.", "date": "17 October 2019"}, {"title": " Great show with a lot of potential", "content": "The lead character Patrick Jane (Simon Baker) aka the 'Mentalist' plays a 'psychic' consultant for a serious crime unit headed by Lisbon (played Robin Tunney, \"Prison Break\") along with the rest of the cast, Cho (Tim Kang \"Rambo\"), Van Pelt (Amanda Righetti, \"OC\") and Rigby (Owain Yeoman \"Nine\"). But Patrick is no psychic, he relies upon acute observation and a penchant for playing mind games with the 'suspects' (and other members of the unit)to solve the case.<br/><br/>The character of Patrick is full of intrigue; he's sexy, funny, smooth but at the same time is tormented by a dark secret of his own doing. The dynamic between him and the rest of the unit is one of great 'hooks' of this show. The conventional law abiding enforcement officers are often at odds with Patrick's eccentric and often risqu\u00e9 way of going about solving crimes. The show plays up to this. The humour and tension between the characters do not appear to be contrived. And of course its always Patrick that comes out on top.<br/><br/>Unlike other crime TV series such as CSI, that depend on sophisticated, often over-the top 'scientific' methodology (CGI effects) to appeal to audiences, the Mentalist brings us back to the good old 'detective's hunch' style of crime-busting. It is a breathe of fresh air in a genre saturated with technical jargon and outlandish plot.<br/><br/>The way each case is solved is complex, yet very believable, and the magic comes from the sense of wonder at Patrick's mind tricks.<br/><br/>The show however still follows much of the conventional approach to to the crime genre, with the clich\u00e9 of red-herrings, incompetent officers and a detective on a personal mission, but the charisma of Simon Baker as the lead detective Patrick Jane pulls the show together.<br/><br/>Another drawback is the seemingly lack of character depth in the minor cast members. Lisbon, Cho, Rigby and Van Pelt all play second fiddle to Patrick and look like sidekicks rather than team members. But the show is slowly providing space for their development.<br/><br/>The show is named after the lead protagonist, and he promptly delivers. He is charming yet gritty, nonchalant yet brilliant, careless yet vulnerable. He's warm and cold at the same time, full of contradictions and full of flaws. Simon Baker portrays these subtle shades of Patrick's personality with an ease, and has made this so accessible to the audience.<br/><br/>The Mentalist is one of those tortured anti-heroes the strikes a cord with the audience and we can not wait to unravel Patrick's full story.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "178 out of 204 found this helpful.", "date": "14 November 2008"}, {"title": " Definitely not a Copycat", "content": "I honestly say that the first I heard of this show I thought the premise was too simple and too recurrent.

The show revolves around Patrick Jane, a mentalist (someone with a highly developed sense of observation who can give the illusion that they have psi abilities) with a haunted past, who uses his unique skills to help the California Bureau of Investigation solve crimes.<br/><br/>A show of this genre is obviously going to attract comparisons to other shows like 'Medium' (which is ridiculous because Jane is steadfast in his view that he is not psychic and there are no such thing as psychics) or 'Psych'. In the case of the latter, admittedly, there are similarities to be had but 'Psych' is very much drama-lite comedy whereas this show can be dark and is a serious take on having an adviser with such abilities working with law enforcement.<br/><br/>Simon Baker does an excellent job depicting Patrick Jane as a man who, on the surface, is genial, charismatic and arrogant but hides his dark emotional problems that we catch glimpses of as the show progresses. Jane, for all his relaxed persona, is a man who cannot come to terms with his tragic past and is an insomniac with anti-social tendencies and a cynical view of the world around him. He is a truly fascinating character and it will be interesting to see how he continues to develop. The rest of the cast do well but for now their characters take second place to Jane. Female lead character Teresa Lisbon is the leader of the CBI team that Jane liaisons with and is starting to stand up as a character in her own right as well as someone who is beginning to understand the secrets of Jane. However, everyone else still need time to be develop, which is understandable for a show only in its infancy.<br/><br/>In all, 'The Mentalist' continues to excel and seeks to be yet another success from America (so, CBS, please don't cancel it!).

Should Stephen Culp and Zeljko Ivanek (who appears later) really be playing any more villains? Please...let's get some people in here whose very presences don't give the surprises away!<br/><br/>Aside from that, it's a great introduction to the super-observant Patrick Jane (THE GUARDIAN'S Simon Baker), a 'consultant' to the police's Special Crimes division who once made his name as one of those \"John Edward\"-type TV psychics. But that was before he managed, in his arrogance, to get the attention of a serial murderer known only as \"Red John\", whose grisly crime-scene trademark is a smiley face painted on the wall in his victims' blood. When Jane calls John out on national television...well, if you guessed that one of those smiley faces ended up at Jane's house where his wife and daughter were, you get the prize!<br/><br/>I never watched THE GUARDIAN, though I am familiar with Simon Baker from other things and I do like him. Plus he has great chemistry with Robin Tunney, who plays investigator Teresa Lisbon. And it's nice to see Owain Yeoman from the unfairly canceled THE NINE (and most recently from TERMINATOR as the \"first\" incarnation of Cromartie) in another series - one that will hopefully last for more than a single season!<br/><br/>THE MENTALIST does come across as a blend of PSYCH-meets-COLUMBO, but with a more conventionally handsome lead than Peter Falk, and much better writing than PSYCH. Now that we know what drives the clever and tormented Mr. Jane, I hope we're treated in between other cases to his ongoing dust-up with the elusive \"Red John.\"", "rating": 8, "helpful": "32 out of 41 found this helpful.", "date": "27 September 2008"}, {"title": " Simon Baker at his best.", "content": "I really enjoyed the pilot episode of this fast-paced show. The acting is very good; actually the lead actor, Simon Baker, is great. He is mesmerizing whenever he's in a scene. The premise is that Patrick Jane (Baker) is a former fake psychic whose family was murdered by a serial killer, Red Jack. Partically as atonement for having pretended to have psychic abilities, Jane is now on the side of the good guys. He is often called upon to help police solve crimes, not with any psychic abilities, but with his unusual and highly attuned powers of observation. The serial killer,Red Jack, is still on the loose several years later. In the pilot, another Red-Jack-like murder has just taken place. Only Jane realizes that the killer is a copycat and not the real Red Jack. Through his uncanny abilities and keen sense of observation and reading people, Jane is able to identify the real killer. The show has a great supporting cast and is smartly directed and shot. But the real pull and the big star is Simon Baker. He is simply great as the mentalist. He shows just the right amount of angst and humanity that has you pulling for him and feeling the pain and sorrow of his family's death, even though it occurred 5 years ago. He carries this show on his very capable shoulders.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "56 out of 76 found this helpful.", "date": "23 September 2008"}]}, "/title/tt6483832/": {"title": "The Resident", "reviews": [{"title": " Different than every other hospital drama", "content": "Sure, most other hospital dramas touch on the broken American healthcare system but The Resident is the first one to make is the focus.

So here is my short, messy and jumbled, but NUANCED review. This show is pretty great so far! It's not a masterpiece 10/10 and it's certainly not a 1/10. The first episode takes us through the life of the main character and just begins to introduce the supporting characters. The cinematography, writing, acting and pacing are all fantastic. It is a sad, depressing, shocking, and disturbing show. It's not for everyone. But it grabbed my attention immediately and held it through the whole episode. There were parts where I almost teared up, and one part where I literally had my jaw hanging open! (And not because of any of the nudity, drug use, or violence that many people have been clutching their pearls over.) My biggest criticism would be that there are two characters who aren't fleshed out at ALL so far. They're flat, one dimensional and not likeable. In fact, one of them is absolutely terrible with 0 redeeming qualities. However, since this is only the first episode and i assume the show will flesh all the characters out throughout the rest of the 8 episode run, it's kind of unfair to criticize on this point too much. Thankfully, I do care about all the other characters for the most part. The show also happens to have one of the few, and most realistic on screen depictions of OCD and mental illness/disorders I've seen in my life. I say this as someone with OCD, though not the same type and perhaps not as severe as is depicted.<br/><br/>\nAnyway, the first episode overall is a great pilot. It starts strong, keeps you intrigued, and ends with a little twist. I am definitely going to tune in in the weeks to come.<br/><br/>\nSIDE NOTE: one of the biggest criticisms I've been hearing of the show so far is that it's \"not realistic.\" \"Teens don't do THIS many drugs.\" \"Teens don't have THIS much sex, or party THIS hard.\" Etc. In response I'd say this: speak for your damn self. As a teen, my experience certainly wasn't like this at all. But just because my experience wasn't like this and your experience may not have been like this, doesn't mean it wasn't like this for anyone else. The creator, Sam Levinson has stated he took inspiration for Euphoria from his struggles with addiction as a teen. Many teens struggle with drugs, violence, sex, partying, social pressures, social media, bullying etc.... and most teens will find at least some stuff in the show relatable. For me, it was the OCD depiction. Also, even if it's not realistic to you, who cares?

Drugs are bad? Some teens have sex? The internet is as much or more a dark, seedy place than it is a source of enlightenment?

Her current range falls a bit short in trying to convince the audience she is a hard core addict, and I just have trouble buying it.<br/><br/>The rest of the performances are good, but not great. I can't say I've been blown away by anyone, but the performances themselves are fine.<br/><br/>The problem is the characters themselves. Almost none of them are likable, including the main characters. It's hard to sympathize and connect to characters you either don't like or don't care about. And here in lies the problem - I just don't care about the characters I should and I really hate the characters I can't stand. So, where is the investment then?<br/><br/>On the plus side, the cinematography is really good and sometimes even feels fresh and creative.<br/><br/>Overall though, despite all the hype, there's nothing groundbreaking happening here.

That was the age in which TV was shaped to inspire the shows on TV today. I've learned many things this week and one thing is that all incredible art pieces, they dont age they hold up with time. For e.g. I just started ER and I'm addicted and it holds up too and that was 1994! <br/><br/>When desperate housewives came out, TV was different then. It wasnt as censored as it is today and you can feel the difference or I can at least.

She sleeps with teens, and worms her way in and out of situations both good and bad, but she has her funny moments. Longoria is predictably slutty temptress, with minor qualities to redeem, so far.

Since not every show that's a hit in America exports well to the UK (\"Friends\" gathered plenty of them over here, and \"CSI: Insert Subtitle Here\" has consistently been a key player for what used to be called Channel 5; on the other hand, \"Murphy Brown\" landed on stony soil when it was shown on BBC2, and don't get UK fans started on how \"The West Wing\" fares here), that's a good question. Fortunately, there is an answer. In fact, several...<br/><br/>1. Germaine Greer, Janet Street-Porter, the editor of \"Cosmopolitan\" (UK edition) and the TV critics of \"The Times\" and \"The Mirror\" have all pooh-poohed it. Since I respect their opinions in the same way I admire Britney Spears purely for her music, this is pretty much a glowing recommendation.<br/><br/>2. Never discount prior experience; just as many critics noted David Chase's work on \"The Rockford Files\" when \"The Sopranos\" started here (and never once gave due credit for that beloved '70s show to Stephen J. Cannell and the late Roy Huggins, but that's another story), so creator Marc Cherry's years on \"The Golden Girls\" (another show that did well here) may have counted. And though I admit I've never liked her, the goodwill Teri Hatcher built up among viewers of both sexes from playing Lois Lane for four years cannot be overlooked.<br/><br/>3. It strikes a major blow on behalf of those of us who don't give a rodent's rump about reality TV.<br/><br/>4. It fills the \"Melrose Place\"/\"Knots Landing\"/primetime soap-sized hole that's been gaping for a while now, even down to having former cast members of same, and does it without wildly OTT acting (making it closer to \"Knots Landing\" in terms of temperament).<br/><br/>5. The series wisely makes at least one of its main characters (Felicity Huffman's Lynette) seem like someone you could actually imagine meeting (key rule of TV: never make everyone too implausible OR too plausible - if everyone really wanted reality no one would have a TV. Or fiction books...).<br/><br/>6. It's both emotional and funny; and it may take a while to wrap up its plot lines, but if the alternative is a whole load of wad-shooting, I'll be patient.<br/><br/>7. The acting. Hatcher may have top-billing and a Golden Globe (and don't bet against her adding an Emmy in September), but five minutes watching Marcia Cross or the aforementioned Miss Huffman will tell you who the real stars are, acting-wise (the ex-Kimberly should have won the GG, not the ex-Mrs. Superman).<br/><br/>8. The eye-candy; never mind \"Which desperate housewife are you?\" think \"Which desperate housewife do you want to sleep with?\" Teri still has plenty of devotees and Nicollette Sheridan remains as hot as she was on \"Knots Landing\" (even if it's not real, it's spectacular) but it's Eva Longoria who really regularly leads viewers into temptation.

But I do try. Really dangerously funny stuff. I predict a popular backlash against this show, and have in fact seen some evidence of it already, simply because so many people are crazy about this show and cannot say enough good things about it. People are tiring of hearing that. But have patience, and don't try to read between the lines of fan praise. It is worth a watch. If only once. Three episodes in, there hasn't been a dud yet. These people will make a mint on First Season DVDs, and deserve to. The sharpest, wittiest, most wildly unpredictable writing now being done. --Makes other \"well written\" shows, like the CSIs, look as drab as Dragnet.<br/><br/>The bar has just been raised for those making series television. Most TV writers and producers will have to ignore the influence, though, because they won't be able to touch it.<br/><br/>Ten stars, times ten. ------------------- <br/><br/>The above review was written close to the beginning of the series. As we get as deep into the second season as we were in the first season where I wrote the above review, a revisit of the series is needed.<br/><br/>Brie is decidedly less funny over time. Maybe more satisfying in a mean way, but less ha ha funny. They have stopped writing those screamingly funny scenes for her, that hinged on what was essentially a neat freak, prim and retentive personality disorder. Remember the burrito sliding off the nightstand at a strategic moment? The tossing of the specimen on Rex at the golf course? The comment on Rex's crying at a dinner party? These scenes, built around Brie, comprised the best moments of the first season, and gone they are, apparently for good, from the second season. This is part of the shows overall shift toward making the luckless, loveless, hard-scrabbling housewives (who overall have a blend of great luck and foul luck, just like real life) \"empowered\" and impervious. It's inevitable that, with that agenda, the writers are not going to have as much funny stuff for any of the characters to do.<br/><br/>Perhaps as writing chores are handed around-- or more retentively screened by the cast or the powers that be at ABC-- the writers are beginning to write some of the cast \"out of character.\" For example, Gabrielle cracks snide at some rough looking characters at a prison marriage counseling session, when 1) last season her character would have pulled a funny face, maybe insulted their wardrobe, like the essentially clueless and rapacious Barbie doll she is, and gone on or 2) in real life, they'd have mopped the floor with her. She is too prissy, and anorexic-looking for that matter, to deliver some of the tough-girl lines they are handing her. Sorry, but this much is obvious. They are writing Gabrielle and Brie out of character this season.<br/><br/>Other than these flaws -- which are major, in my opinion -- the series still has its moments. But the humor is starting to take precedence behind the conflict and mysteries. We draw closer to the non ironic melodrama world of Dynasty and Melrose Place than we were in the first season. Once, you could have said there was no show with quite the attitude and ambiance of Desperate Housewives first season. Now, you can say that again. The show we knew is slipping away into mundane sameness, and its unpredictability is becoming too patented and predictable.

It is also cause for a lot gloating for everyone, like myself, who said back when the networks weren't listening (putting all their eggs in fad reality series and ultimately collapsing because of it) that the way to make a long-lasting hit was through scripted TV. Vindication came when wives and mothers across the country made this quirky live-action cartoon a monster hit - ABC only won back it's audience with, yes, a scripted show and it now appears to mark the beginning of the end of the gluttonous \"reality\" show nightmare. With it all bringing hype that \"Housewives\" probably doesn't deserve, but criticism it doesn't either. Don't take it too seriously and you will have a blast.<br/><br/>One of the nasty realities of network TV is that the networks are insist your show appeal to an entire family of demographics. That desire to be everything to everybody is usually a deathblow to any vision-less series, but creator Marc Cherry (\"The Golden Girls\", still popular) pulls it off striking just the right cords with every oscillating tone in \"Housewives\". The show is like a holographic picture that becomes something else when you shift it in the light. It is equal parts a serious soap opera, soap opera parody (perfect soap names like Mike Delfino and Dr. Rex Van De Kamp crack me up every time), a comedy and a murder mystery, a sympathy card to the pressures of raising a family and a satirical jab at suburbia and women who can always find something to gossip and complain about. Undeniably, these tonal shifts make for more than a few imbalances and awkward mixes between the campy and the serious. It isn't quite clear if the show itself knows what it is. If you asked, I'm sure Cherry wouldn't care what our reaction was as long as there was one.<br/><br/>Cherry does this all with just enough skimpy clothing to please the network, a narration (by Strong) that speaks a lot over the images but really says nothing and a gang-busters intro scored by Danny Elfman that brings down the house and sets these schizophrenic tones perfectly. What you wouldn't know at first glance is that \"Houswives\" writes both sides in the battle of the sexes with equal thought, intelligence and culpability. Any perceived male-bashing gets swept under the rug as every character on the show is fleshed out to 3 dimensions wonderfully. There aren't any caricatures here, but real people put up to a fun house mirror. The show's willingness to cut the cord and kill them off (\"24\"-lite), is bold and truly shocking. When the season's murder mystery is wrapped up, it won't knock you down, but it does appear to have been meticulously planned from the beginning. All the T's are crossed and I's dotted.<br/><br/>The ladies really make it work though. Huffman's story lines are always the sharpest and most grounded (an episode where she leaves her kids on the side of the road is extremely gratifying). Newcomer Langoria starts out weak in a meaty and controversial double-standard exploring story that boldly asks us to root for her not to get caught sleeping with the gardener (Jesse Metcalf). Both evolve to a point where an ensuing cat-and-mouse game with Carlos becomes the most fun dynamic. Conversly, Nicollette Sheriden's overblown appearance as street hussy Edie Britt gives her nary a page of dialog an episode and young Andrea Bowen plays Susan's daughter as if she is a higher-up's daughter who never had a day of acting class in her life.<br/><br/>But special attention must be paid to Marcia Cross who approaches a level of understated brilliance as tightly-wound, tough-as-nails, misplaced 50s housewife Bree Van De Kamp. Bree is a classic character and Cross nails all of her complexities so peerlessly she about brings a tear to the eye. Cross is not just Emmy-worthy (deserving every award Teri Hatcher won instead), but belongs in the hallowed hall of TV fame for this work. \"Housewives\" is worth a watch for her alone.<br/><br/>\"Desperate Housewives\" may be a big hit for ABC, but don't be fooled - this isn't the type of show that usually is a hit. It is too quirky, too wacky and too open to interpretation. Just when you think it has fallen off the wagon and into stupidity it reclaims face with good performances, nasty surprise twists and dead-on writing.<br/><br/>\"Desperate Housewives\" is a first-rate guilty pleasure. Sharp, trashy, funny, socially conscious and a little twisted behind it's shallow exterior. Only Cherry's fertile comic mind knows what the future holds for the ladies of Wysteria Lane and where this large-scale, genre-bending domestic comedy goes. Even better, \"Desperate Housewives\" is a blast of cold air blown across the TV landscape knocking over the piles of reality show garbage. It is the most richly entertaining piece of shallow, mass-pleasing TV in quite a while.<br/><br/>* * * / 4", "rating": null, "helpful": "40 out of 62 found this helpful.", "date": "4 June 2005"}, {"title": " Classic", "content": "It never gets old.

In 1994 (or 1996, if you follow the chronology of the series) the United States Air force has come into possession of the gate and recruits radical Egyptologist Dr. Daniel Jackson (then played by James Spader) to translate the runes found alongside it and activate the gate.<br/><br/>Sure enough, Jackson opens the gate and a reconnaissance team led by the stoic Colonel Jack O'Neil (a dour-faced Kurt Russell) is assigned to survey the world on the other side, later to be known as Abydos. Jackson too, is sent along with the goal of reopening the gate on the other side. Once on the other side though, the team come across a civilisation being ruled over by the mythical god Ra and come to discover the truth behind both the Abydonians and the Ancient Egyptians -  that thousands of years ago a dying alien parasite came to Earth and took a host in the form of a primitive human boy (Jaye Davidson). Using his advanced technology, the alien - now in human form - masqueraded as the god Ra, conquering the planet and using the Stargate to transport thousands of humans to Abydos to mine the minerals needed to sustain his technology.<br/><br/>Needless to say, O'Neil and Jackson see to it that the Abydonians are shown the truth about their god and rebel against him. Jackson stays behind on Abydos with his new wife Sha'uri (later changed to Share) and O'Neil's team returns to Earth.<br/><br/>The series picks up one year later, when the now dormant Stargate is reactivated unexpectedly and a hostile alien force seemingly under the leadership of Ra launches an attack on the base, taking a hostage in the process. In response, the base's new CO, General George Hammond (the superb Don S. Davis) calls on the now-retired Jack O'Neill (who, as well an extra 'L' in his name, has also become the much-lighter Richard Dean Anderson) to lead his team back to Abydos and determine the nature of this new threat. Back on Abydos however, Daniel Jackson (now played to perfection by Michael Shanks) shows O'Neill and scientist Captain (later Major) Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) that the Stargate can evidently open doorways to more planets than simply Abydos and that whoever attacked Earth did not originate from Abydos.<br/><br/>The situation becomes more critical though, when the same force attacks Abydos and both Share and her brother Ska'ra are taken. Jackson immediately returns to Earth, where the President authorises the creation of nine teams to uncover what lies through the Stargate on each different world - O'Neill's team (including Jackson and Carter) being designated SG-1.<br/><br/>Following the Stargate address seen during the attack on Abydos, SG-1 travel to a planet known as Chulak where they discover the true origin of the enemy force - another alien masquerading as a god, this time as the god Apophis. The situation worsens when both Share and Ska'ra are revealed to have become hosts to the aliens, known as the Goa'uld. Imprisoned on Chulak, SG-1 must rely on Apophis' head guard when he turns traitor and agrees to help the team escape. The alien, Teal'c (the impeccable Christopher Judge), leads the team to the Stargate, all the while fighting a bloody battle in an attempt to recover Share and Ska'ra.<br/><br/>After the rather breakneck pilot, season 1 of SG-1 falls into a rather repetitive pattern pretty quickly - the team shows up at a planet looking for advanced technology to fight the Goa'uld, stumbles across a problem with either the locals or said technology and spends the rest of the episode solving that problem. Although the episodes aren't really that lacklustre, they do serve to remind you that the Star Trek franchise has existed for years on pretty much the same recurring `planet of the week' plot. It's not until the season's final three episodes that the show shows even any sign of promise.<br/><br/>The season closing trilogy however, rejuvenate the series back to the strong form it displayed in the pilot, when Apophis finally launches his ships against Earth and SG-1 alone must prevent the planet's destruction. Although the story is concluded in the second season premiere, the main plotline picks up tremendously from there. By two-thirds of the way through it's sophomore season Apophis is gone and the scope of the show is revealed - there was never only two aliens to fight, there are in fight a large group - all masquerading as gods - known as the System Lords.<br/><br/>The show from then on deals largely with defending Earth against these enemies, although at the midway point in season three Apophis returns as the series' biggest foe and takes much of the play until the season four/five two-parter. It is in Apophis' aftermath that a new foe is revealed : Anubis. Once a powerful and sadistic Goa'uld System Lord, Anubis was banished when even the other Goa'ulds objected to his activates.<br/><br/>Mastering the technology of the Stargate builders (known as the Ancients), Anubis takes the tension to a whole new level when - by the close of season seven - he shows up in orbit of Earth with an armada waiting to destroy the planet.<br/><br/>The beauty of the series is simple : it never slumps unrecoverably. In every instance of a slightly dull episode, the following episode will undoubtedly show itself to be one of the best pieces of television you'll ever see. On a story-arc level alone, the series beats genre shows like Deep Space Nine and The X-Files hands-down almost simply because the arc stays consistent, there are no ludicrous changes of pace, no unexplained leaps that need to be taken and no confusion over the eventual direction of the story.<br/><br/>The evolution of the show is also a high point. By season six, technology recovered in the preceding seasons have been mastered and put into practical use. Characters show bonds that grow with time, even enemies become fleshed out and changed allegiances (for the first time I can remember on television) are actually plausible.<br/><br/>The two biggest selling points of SG-1 are it's writing and it's performances. In Anderson, the show has a leading man that fits every bill perfectly. The character - although admittedly a big leap from Russell's performance - grows incredibly to the point where every nuance is golden. In the confines of the Stargate universe, O'Neill has basically two roles - comedian and action hero, both of which are superbly portrayed. Shanks begins the series by essentially playing Spader playing Jackson and then evolving the character to the point that you forget Spader ever filled the role in the first place. Tapping - although irritating as hell in the initial episodes - eventually becomes intensely loveable, mainly serving as both the frustrated emotional core of the team and the brains of the outfit - coming up with a plan for every alien threat that comes their way. Judge is also spot-on, taking the kind of stoicism earmarked by Michael Dorn for all those years  and graduating it to a level of pure awe. Teal'c is a character that in the hands of an other actor could have been a disaster, but with Judge you actually find yourself revelling in the character's highs and lows as much as he himself does. Obviously the character fills the role of the team's muscle, but his level of comic relief is superb - not just on a level of writing, but also on a level of deadpan and delivery.<br/><br/>This show launches it's first real spin off in July (US) and September (UK) in Stargate : Atlantis, and with a proposed movie on the horizon the future is looking rosy.

It explains a lot of the stuff that the movie neglected to mention. Such as, how was the Stargate activated without a human computer? Where did the Goa'uld (Ra's race) come from? How many are there? <br/><br/>The first episode has a retired Jack O'Neill (spelled with 2 Ls) recalled to active duty by General George Hammond due to an attack by the shut down Stargate from Apophis, a powerful Goa'uld who killed four men and kidnapped one woman. We meet Samantha Carter, a brilliant scientist who claims that she should have gone through the Stargate the first time, and is determined to go through now. We find out that Daniel got married on Abydos, and that there are hundreds of Gate addresses that they can dial. Then Daniel's wife gets captured by Apophis and becomes his new queen. <br/><br/>It continues in the second episode where General Hammond announces the formation of the SGC which includes nine teams, in which Jack's team will be SG-1 which consists of Jack, Samantha and Daniel. They go to Chulak, a Goa'uld homeworld to rescue Daniel's wife and another one captured at Abydos named Ska'ra. They get captured, and just as Apophis gives the order to kill them and many other prisoners, a Jaffa named Teal'c, First Prime of Apophis, saves them and goes to Earth with them, where he is made part of SG-1. <br/><br/>That was only the beginning of the adventure. In the course of the show they have gone to the past and future, gotten transported to alternate realities, swapped bodies, grown old, met alien races which include a rebel alliance of Goa'uld called the Tok'ra, in which Samantha's Dad becomes a member, the Asgard, a cute little race in which we see Thor most often (he's Jack's buddy),and avoid global disaster by the skin of their teeth countless times.<br/><br/>The show was recently canceled, but lasted ten seasons. In season nine, a new enemy called the Ori came in flaunting brand new powers, new dangers and bringing to light new mysteries surrounding the Stargate and its creators, the Ancients. Season nine and ten also saw the introduction to two new characters, Ben Browder as Cameron Mitchell, the new leader of SG-1 and Claudia Black as Vala MalDoran, a female human from another world who brings a new sense of fun to the team. <br/><br/>Very well-produced, interesting characters, fantastic Special effects and a subtle love interest between Samantha and Jack, this one has it all.

Both stand out in my mind because unlike early STAR TREK series, there is a consistent evolution of plots and characters. If you look at the original STAR TREK and STAR TREK:TNG, they were fine shows, but there was no overall theme or plot that connected all the episodes. In many ways, you could usually watch the shows totally out of sequence with no difficulty understanding what is occurring. This was less the case with DEEP SPACE 9 (with its giant battles that took up all of the final season) and the other TREK shows, as there was more of a larger story that unified them. This coherence seems to have developed as a concept with BABYLON 5 and saw this to an even greater extent with SG-1. The bottom line is that in many ways this series was like watching a family or a long novel slowly take form. Sure, there were a few \"throwaway\" episodes that were not connected to the rest, but these were very few and far between and were also usually pretty funny.<br/><br/>And speaking of funny, I loved that SG-1 kept the mood light from time to time and wasn't so dreadfully serious. In this way, I actually enjoyed it more than BABYLON 5. Jack O'Neill was a great character with his sarcasm and love of Homer Simpson--it's really too bad he slowly faded from the series in later seasons.<br/><br/>To truly appreciate SG-1, you should watch it from the beginning and see how intricately the plots work. This coherence gives the show exceptional staying power.

The idea behind the series; being able to travel to any limit of planets, and what you might find on those planets is beyond endless for possibilities.

You can't just watch this show from anywhere, you need to start from the beginning for it to make sense.<br/><br/>The cast in this show and their characters were very well chosen, they play off of each other beautifully, adding lots of humor to each episode, but not too much to make it goofy.

Unlike most science fiction shows, this happens in our own time, with an Earth very recognizable to the viewer. It's not the future, it's not another galaxy. It's Earth, the way we know it. The only difference in the beginning is the Stargate, a portal to other worlds all across the galaxy. And through it, we are introduced to societies not so different from our own at various points in time. From the legend of King Arthur, to the pyramids of Egypt and Greek mythology, the cultures of our planet are revealed to be quite literally out of this world.<br/><br/>The show started out exploring this in great depth, covering all sorts of ancient cultures. It added a scientific twist to it all, and even explained why all these people were spread across the galaxy. About halfway through its life, the series shifted to a more story-driven, typical sci-fi show centering around saving the world and fighting aliens. And it pulls off both versions quite well.<br/><br/>Another MAJOR turning point came in Season 9 (airing as of this writing), when the main character played by Richard Dean Anderson was written off the show (at his own request). Many of the major plot lines were finally sewed up and ended to facilitate the new leading man, Ben Browder. Not being a fan of Farscape, I was originally skeptical, but he has proved himself more than worthy to fill Anderson's shoes. Still, you can't replace MacGuyver. You will be missed, Jack O'Neill.<br/><br/>The characters are ever evolving, bonding and getting deeper as the show goes along. Samantha Carter has had some of the most interesting developments, with her father becoming a major envoy with an alien race, and her brother setting her up with a boyfriend--a move so controversial, fans sent mail asking for the guy to die.<br/><br/>Teal'c, the usually grim-faced yet somehow always optimistic alien of the team, also tends to surprise in his plot lines, with family and friends scattered around the galaxy and popping in the most unexpected places. Daniel Jackson, the linguist, archaeologist and humanitarian of the bunch has probably evolved more than the other characters, casting off his once shy and unsure demeanor for a more confident, aggressive (but no less caring) persona.<br/><br/>Jack O'Neill always remained essentially the same guy. And that's why we loved him. Sarcastic, brave, and never willing to leave a man or woman behind, he was the quintessential sci-fi leader figure. Ben Browder has filled the shoes admirably, though I still maintain that Jack is simply irreplaceable (like Scotty from Star Trek; bite me, Laforge).<br/><br/>The visual effects never disappoint and although the \"save the world just in the nick of time\" premise seems to be used more and more as the show goes on, it inexplicably seems compelling all the time. We've seen Earth evolve from a simple exploratory entity to a major power in the galaxy. We've seen empires rise and fall. And most importantly, no matter how strange and exotic the situation might be, there's always an underlying sense of science. From bending space to Hyperspace, the show does its best to tell us what's going on and how it works. The backbone of any sci-fi show is to make the fiction sound believably scientific.<br/><br/>I love Stargate SG-1. It's my favorite show, currently. I hope it stays on for years to come, but at least we'll always know it has beaten the X-Files as longest running sci-fi show on TV.

The TV series actually downplayed the vast wealth and extravagant spending of these drug lords (buying and owning soccer teams and dozens of homes around the world) and focused more on the effort required to maintain their control of their respective drug distribution empires.<br/><br/>I liked the series for the way they avoided and minimalized the extreme violence and executions of many innocent victims such as in the many bombings and focused mainly on Pablo Escobar for the first two seasons, then switched over to Gilberto Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela, along with his brother Miguel Rodr\u00edguez Orejuela for season 3.<br/><br/>The involvement of U.S. drug enforcement agents (DEA) and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) allowed the North American audience to listen to their conversations without having to completely rely on the otherwise prominent English sub titles whenever the Colombians were talking to one another. The English sub titles required the audience not to take their eyes off of their TV screen or you may miss some significant dialogue and story line.<br/><br/>I rated this crime/drama series an entertaining 9 out of 10 IMDB rating as it remained true to most of the historical facts although I am sure some of the intense so called \"close calls\" between the drug lords and the DEA agents were embellished for dramatic purposes.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "6 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "17 May 2020"}, {"title": " Netflix Has Yet Another Triumph", "content": "At one point in Episode 7 the new president of Colombia says to a group of US officials trying to have him accept more aid to hunt Escobar, \"660 tons of cocaine were consumed in the United States last year. Perhaps if your resources were focused at home we'd all be better off.\"<br/><br/>Can I get an Amen? He hits the bullseye. <br/><br/>Netflix gives us yet another reason to stay out of the cine multiplex with this slightly fictionalized but excellent new series. It takes most of the pertinent action right out of the history from this sad era of Colombian (and American) history. Filmed entirely on location in Colombia and with a good 50% of the dialogue in Spanish this series aims to be as real as possible. The story also colors way outside the lines of the Manichean version of the Drug War most Americans have swallowed hook, line, and sinker since Uncle Ronnie started feeding it to us back in his presidency.<br/><br/>In the role of Pablo Escobar is Wagner Moura who actually had to learn Spanish to play the part. I wish that he would send his Spanish teacher over here to teach me because he speaks it very well. I'm sure native Colombians can tell that he's not one of them but I can't. Besides that he is a dead ringer (pardon the expression) for Pablo.<br/><br/>Unflinchingly brutal and set at a desperate pace this is one of the best crime dramas I've seen in a long time. This series reminds me of the two great novels of Don Winslow which chronicle the Mexican cartels, The Power of the Dog and The Cartel. The structure is almost like a documentary in concept with a voice-over by one of the principal DEA agents on the scene. I am only a few episodes into this and already hoping for another season\u2014a very high compliment.<br/><br/>This series is vastly superior to the Benicio del Toro Escobar film which was pretty awful. Movies can't hold a candle to the best series. There is no way to tell this story in a 90 minute movie. Great job, Netflix!<br/><br/>Season 2<br/><br/>Is it just me or was Season 2 almost completely in Spanish? Granted, the Spanish they speak was difficult for me to understand at times but I just wonder how most of the American public feels about seeing a series in which they are almost entirely dependent on reading subtitles. I think Americans are getting more and more sophisticated in their tastes and any series in which Pablo Escobar speaks English would just be phony and stupid. <br/><br/>I thought the directors relied too much on music montage scenes that just took up a lot of time without adding much to the story. It just seems like an unoriginal clich\u00e9. The show worked best when they followed the real historic events of the story and when they delved into pure fiction it was much less compelling.<br/><br/>There was way too much of his wife and kids in the second season. I get it; Pablo was a family guy. That doesn't mean you need to have scene after scene of him playing with his kids or talking to his half-wit wife. Why should we care about the family of a monster who blew up airliners and placed horrifically powerful bombs on crowded city streets? We don't. Los Pepes should have killed them all, including his mother. There were much bigger things in the picture that could have been discussed. <br/><br/>I loved the CIA guy and his role in the story. He was creepy as well as totally believable for his part. <br/><br/>In the end you have to realize that the United States' effort in Colombia amounted to doodly squat. All we really did was to fan a drug war that took the lives of perhaps thousands of people, either guilty of some infraction or completely innocent. The two DEA agents seemed barely competent to do their jobs, whatever their jobs were. At least they alluded to this in the final scene. \"The king is dead; long live the kings!\"<br/><br/>S3 <br/><br/>Almost binged it and I have to say this Season 3 is the best of the three by far. It's more layered and has better characters. Seasons 1 &amp; 2 had Pablo and I really like the actor but this I never liked the gringo DEA guy much. This story is more complicated as well. I also think they make good use of their time. I love the fact that it's only 10 episodes and we can expect some sort of resolution (I hope so) at the end.<br/><br/>Each episode is skillfully crafted to contain a single story and then leave you practically begging for the next installment. Overall this storyline is a lot more interesting than the two previous season involving Pablo Escobar. Who needs Pablo?<br/><br/>The violence is chilling to the core because it is handed out sparingly, at least at first. How many people have died so that Americans can use cocaine? Half a million people? More? A lot more?", "rating": 10, "helpful": "75 out of 135 found this helpful.", "date": "29 August 2015"}, {"title": " a great documentary of the era of magic and realism", "content": "Some thoughts after watching two Narcos seasons. This TV series is great not just because it illustrates to us the most significant era of drug traffickers, as a documentary; the narration of the whole story also shows respect to Magical realism style, which also originated from Colombia. Things could happen to shock you in every second, far beyond normality and your expectation, but in the context, they seem to make perfect sense as for that time, in that place, with those people who were born in a world where nothing is expectable.\nFor me, the \"realism\" attracts my deep thinking all the time while I watch the series. Pablo Escobar is definitely one of the focused character, and he is surely vicious, ambitious and cruel and one would not describe him as a \"normal guy\". But quite a lot of scenes showed me a different part of such an evil criminal that contradicts with his apparent impression, especially when we see how he values loyalty, how much he loves his wife and children, how he would try all possible or impossible to protect and insure his family members' wellbeing. In these moments, his image seems a bit different and, seems a bit hard to say, he shows his good, sweet and normal side as being a human.\nThis kind of dramatic effect is emphasized in S01E09, when Pablo had to stayed in his father's house to temporarily avoid police chasing. This episode leaves me the deepest impression and I would like to talk more about it. When old Escobar accidently got blood on Pablo's shirt and ironically commented: Funny that you don't like blood. Here I saw one of the greatest acting in the series, when the toughly maintained, fragile father and son relationship finally broke down at the moment, or as it already did many years ago when their interest and value distinct from each other's. Pablo surely desired to be a great man, he thought and wished his outstanding power and wealth would make his father proud of him, for they are no longer the poor and insignificant mud that can be stepped on by the superior, for tomorrow's food and cloth is no longer a concern. But at the end of the day, his father is ashamed, disappointed, regretful; more than any fathers in the world and Pablo learned this truth finally. When I watched season 2, Pablo's failing is gradual, with his drug kingdom teared down piece by piece; but it is also in a flash, when something that you would not expect to matter at all for someone ruthless like this, finally breaks his fortress and ambition. Very dramatic and like a magic, all is gone like wind, all is left is a tired, aged bulky guy who found his great deeds meaningless and his ambition, vanished. I also see how he might start with a small ambition, gaining a bit more respect and money, until greediness and power overtakes him, which is followed by supreme victory, and equally significant burst of his dream in the bubble. But Pablo's death will never mark the end of all these, \"dreamers\" would keep sprouting one after the other on this land, watered by the constant rain and inequality on this land.\nIn some way the story coincides with the cycle of Buendia's family under Macondo's pen, constant repetition of one's fate despite the struggle and fight, as it is determined, the reality.\nIf you ask me to define magic, I would just say, it is something that surprise you. Agent Steve describe it as a disappearance magic when Pe\u00f1a was asked to return to USA. The same for me when Colonel Martinez, someone I really like, was dead and gone all of a sudden, without any time or signal for you to get ready. I once thought he is an important role and won't die easily and the show just hit me for being na\u00efve. Yep, the war is fair in this way, everyone is made of fresh and blood and no one is more significant than the others, when it's time for you to die, you will.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "8 out of 11 found this helpful.", "date": "11 January 2020"}, {"title": " One of the best series ever!", "content": "10/10 for acting, filming, sticking to the true facts.

The Bijou the swamps, and the Parishes are always fun for those of us who only go there to party, and with the success of True Detective this year this show was a forgone conclusion. Now the cast is extremely robust, packed tight with real acting heavy weights, Everyone loves Scott Bakula, and Lucas Black the kid from Sling Blade has never had a bad performance, though he has never been anyone beyond the Alabama boy that he is.

I'll admit my opinion is biased by the 11 years I spent in the military, which gives me certain expectations about organizations like NCIS or Army CID, where they work, and the people - civilian and military - that work there. I have two major problems with both NCIS NO and NCIS LA. First, there is no sense of \"place\" in NCIS NO or NCIS LA. NCIS HQ in Virginia is a well defined brick building, and Gibb's house is Gibb's house. The NCIS (Virginia) office space is a well-defined \"bull pen\" with dividers, and team members have assigned space in a realistic office setting. There is an elevator between lower levels of the building (Abby's lab and Duckie's domain,) Gibb's team space, and the Director's office. There is a video teleconference room, an interrogation room, and other realistic looking work spaces. I almost believe I could show people around the building - BUT in both NCIS LA and NO - there is no clearly defined team work space that looks like anything I've ever seen in a military organization - people wander about giant lofts or industrial sets with no evident connection to their work - to include the Navy O-6 (Captain) commanding USN operations in the city! Does Pride offer breakfast to his team in his office (an industrial loft) or his residence (also an industrial loft?)I just can't suspend that much disbelief. Is there a kitchen in the office or does he hold team meetings at home? Quien sabe? They might as well be on the Good Ship Lollipop. The second problem is, Gibbs as Special Agent in Charge has set the bar VERY high. From the very first episode, the guy exuded \"command presence,\" as does Rocky Carroll as Director Vance. Nobody on either NCIS LA or NO has that quality - and if it's not demonstrated at the onset of a command relationship, it's unlikely to emerge later. Again, I just can't suspend enough disbelief to take either of the spin-offs seriously - but I LOVE the old original NCIS (with a few minor reservations.) Aside from these issues, the NCIS N.O.production values are excellent - but the plot twists in the opening episode created another challenging level of disbelief based on improbable coincidences among the victim, the NCIS team, and the perpetrator.

Which is a crying shame, because for any one who loves good action shows, Banshee is a must watch. There's a reason, despite being on a premium channel not many people watch, that Banshee has lasted this long. And that reason is sheer awesome badassery. <br/><br/>First off, being a premium show (and a Cinemax one at that), Banshee is chock full of gratuitous nudity and sex (which, not to sound dirty, is of pretty high quality). And there is typically at least one crazy violent scene per episode. So if neither of those are your cup of tea, maybe you should skip this show. But if you like or don't mind either of those things, you'll find amazing gun-battles, even more amazing hand-to-hand fight scenes, and some cool, gritty characters.<br/><br/>The plot is a tough pill to swallow early on in the first season--a hotshot thief just happens to get the opportunity to masquerade as a small town sheriff in Amish country--and you pretty much have to resign yourself to the fact that nearly every female character on the show will sleep with the protagonist at one point or another at the point of bordering on the absurd. But after the first few episodes and the benefit of suspension of disbelief, the show becomes incredibly addictive, and you end up really caring about these characters. Stand outs include the mysterious protagonist; Kai, the Amish crime boss; the criminally underused deputies who both aid and are suspicious of the protagonist; and Job, our hero's cross- dressing confidant. <br/><br/>What makes Banshee stand out are the little things--the subtle changes to the opening credits in each episode. The epilogue scenes of each episode. The incredibly well-choreographed hand- to-hand fight scenes. The foreshadowing of developments to come. <br/><br/>If you're a fan of shows like Justified, and True Blood, and Sons of Anarchy, then you'll love Banshee. Cinemax is well worth the subscription just to watch this show (plus you get other awesome shows like Strike Back and The Knick, but that's beyond the scope of this interview).

The actors do their job, some are even oustanding, like Antony Starr, Ivana Milicevic, Ulrich Thomsen and Hoon Lee. Each of them presented intruiguing yet different and distinctive characters. They deal with their own past and present in their own rights and they are always true to themselves. The story feels fluent and coherent, it never felt like they tried to stretch the story for another season. The action secenes were, while incredibly graphic, great and some were even nearly on the level of both Raid 1 and 2.<br/><br/>I recommend this show to everyone who likes good, brutal and honest action, decisive villains and interesting side characters.

Instead of trying to look like Family Guy, The Simpsons or King of the Hill, this show stands out as looking completely different. It is gritty and looks like something that would have been on MTV in the mid 80s or early 90s. That makes me like it even more. I am writing a kids book and seeing stuff like this makes me feel good. Not everything has to look so polished. Another thing I like is the dark humor. It is the kind of thing that if you stop paying attention for just a minute, you won't get something later. I actually laughed out loud at this time after time. Which is rare these days. Something else I like about this show is the people doing the voices. Especially H. Jon Benjamin. The story I saw was really funny and memorable. All these things make me really excited about the next episode.<br/><br/>I must say though, I have a bad feeling Fox is going to boot this show. It just does not fit in with there other shows. Everything on Sunday nights looks the same. This seems like it would fit better on Adult Swim or Comedy Central.

Maybe I was a bit skeptical because the last years no cartoon or animation series has impressed me much. Brickleberry for example never made me laugh and I didn't like any of the characters.<br/><br/>When it comes to that, TV is riddled with the McFarlane cartoons and even though I still like family guy (not love), its all becoming a tad repetitive.<br/><br/>So I gave Bob's Burgers a chance. I had to get used to the style and wasn't convinced a Burgershop could deliver anything fun, but after a few ep's I am pleasantly surprised. The pace is really good, dialogs are fast and you have to take notice of all or you will miss a joke or clever pun. The cartoon-style works, it gives a bit of 80's nostalgia and it just looks funny - seeing Louise go nuts wearing those ears is just a funny sight.<br/><br/>The characters all work for me, I noticed a lot dislike Gene but I can see him fit in.

In turn, their kids, really do love and respect their parents. And, perhaps most bizarrely to modern television, the kids love and respect each other and work, go to school with, and play with each other, as well. And, it's a secular, non-patriarchal family (it appears to be egalitarian).<br/><br/>They manage all of that, and still manage to be hilarious, season after season. Fantastic character-writing. Fantastic story-telling. They are skipping the guns and violence, the prevalent name-calling, the shaming and fighting that you can see in any other family-oriented, or kid-oriented shows.<br/><br/>I love Linda's love-of-life. So many good things (paragraphs) could be said about her. Oddly, I love that she's voiced by a man. I love her sister, too!<br/><br/>I love Bob's steadfastness against changing his restaurant's core value: Quality Ingredients, and his fear of failure. He's so lovable and terribly vulnerable, (and he can SING!); he's a far cry from \"Archer.\" Kudos to the writers and the voice actor to separate the two (But bravo for the mashup \"Archer\" episode that has Archer working at the restaurant... \"Better break-out the purple stuff...\").<br/><br/>I love Tina's crazy introduction into puberty. Her moaning (and head bang or faint) for the whole scene, or on key words whenever she is depressed it makes me laugh every single time. Her daydreams are spot-on for hormone-poisoning, as we used to call it. I love that she's the oldest, but gets steered by the sharp-as-a-tack youngest child, Louise.<br/><br/>I love Gene's complete lack of shame and his total joy when wears any female clothes, even though I believe he's heterosexual.

The whole family is so accepting of Marshmallow, and that's lovely. It should be like that everywhere.<br/><br/>I love Louise because she is the baby of the family, and somehow, she became the instigator, the troublemaker, the pusher, and the rabble-rouser, but still she is not evil or despicable, by any means. She's not a pathological liar or cheat, or hateful or mean at all. She's clever and happy and looks out for her siblings. Or, gets them to work for her.

Jon Benjamin who has previously worked with Bouchard on Home Movie's (as Coach McGuirk) is an excellent choice for Bob. The Sunday night slot is in dire need for new comedy that isn't the Simpson's or Seth MacFarlane and Bob's Burger seem to fill that void.In the first episode The Health inspector drops by with several complaints about Bob's Restaurant, the youngest daughter Louise seems to be starting the most trouble for the Re'Re'Re opening of the restaurant by changing Bob's special New Bacon-Ings- Comes with bacon to The Child Molester Comes with candy. That's just a bit of what happens in the first episode and i don't want to reveal anything else and ruin it for the people who haven't had a chance to see it yet, in conclusion Bob's Burgers is an excellent show, funny, witty, not always in your face comedy, crude and entertaining. Some people may say that Bob's Burger shouldn't be with the Sunday line up which includes The Simpson's, Family Guy and The Cleveland Show, but in my opinion, The Simpson's isn't as good as before, Family Guy has been hit or miss this season (mostly miss), The Cleveland show is just a time filler.

Watching Season 6 was a chore and Season 7 was an ordeal.", "content": "(Updated after Season 7)<br/><br/>The story of your average early-30s female yuppie who gets sent to prison for 15 months for a crime she committed 10 years earlier. Season 1 Episode 1 shows her checking into the prison, and the rest is what goes on inside, plus the effects of her incarceration on her friends and family.<br/><br/>Initially I thought it was going to a female version of Oz, but it is far better than that. Multi-dimensional: funny, sensitive and sometimes dark. There is heaps of depth to the characters. Clever use of pre-prison flashbacks to show what motivates characters in certain situations, and how they got to be in jail. Very sensitively done, it often shows how their personalities were shaped.<br/><br/>This also serves to show that you can't simply judge people by their current actions - everyone has heaps of baggage.<br/><br/>Superb performances from a spot-on cast.<br/><br/>So different to what I expected, and very pleasantly so.<br/><br/>Season 4 continues the good work and was the usual mix of powerful drama and biting comedy. Maybe a bit darker and deeper than previous seasons due to covering issues of insanity, depression, guard brutality and prisoners' lives once they get out of prison. Some characters who didn't get much focus in previous seasons get more of the limelight, while others get less. One of the casualties is Pennsatucky / Doggett (Taryn Manning), which is a shame as she is one of my favourites - multi-layered and funny. On the plus side, Lolly (Lori Petty) gets much more screen time and she is great: funny and sad, all at the same time.<br/><br/>The last two episodes of Season 4 are incredibly powerful and moving.<br/><br/>Season 5 picks up where S4 left off and shows that the writers had certainly not run out of ideas. At a point when most series start to feel jaded, Orange is the New Black was as strong and fresh as ever.<br/><br/>However, Season 5 does mark a turning point, as the show moves from being predominantly character-based to more plot-based. This is a negative thing, as it was the characters and their stories that make the show so engaging.<br/><br/>Season 6 is where the novelty starts to wear off and the writing starts to show signs of weakness. The setting and situation were new: the Max side of the prison, complete with the more limited freedom it presents, plus grittier, more dangerous characters. This made for some interesting possibilities and the writers used these fairly well.<br/><br/>However, the character engagement, usually OITNB's strongest feature, is now largely missing. Tasha Jefferson is the only character whose story is worth following, and this gets drawn out to the nth degree. Piper Chapman, being irritating (though I think this was more due to Taylor Schilling's performance than anything else), was never worth supporting and this season is no exception. She does, however, provide the most emotional moment of the season.<br/><br/>The lack of engagement in the season is largely due to some previously-likeable/interesting characters being made into irritating characters. The over-the-topness of Red and Lorna's dialogue and general drama constantly made me tune out whenever they appeared.<br/><br/>There are a host of new characters but none are worth supporting. Their introduction also dilutes the impact of the characters and stories you do care about.<br/><br/>Overall Season 6 was watchable but it did feel like a chore at times.<br/><br/>The downward trajectory continues in the final season, Season 7. By now it is all plot-based and the engagement levels are close to zero. The plots themselves feel like retreads of old ones: there's very little new under the sun. The transformation of previously-likeable characters into irritating characters continues. Lorna is particularly annoying.<br/><br/>There was quite a bit of potential though: several of the ex-inmates are now on the outside, so you get to see how the US deals with ex-cons. This was reasonably interesting, as you see how badly ex-cons are treated by the system and how the odds are stacked in favour of them going back to jail. Unfortunately, the central character in this is Piper, and she's irritating, as always.<br/><br/>The other area that had potential was the sub-plot involving deportees and ICE, as this shows how the US treats illegal immigrants (short answer: not very well). Unfortunately, the writers ruin this by massively overegging the pudding: extreme cases, out-of-the-blue soapbox speeches and political finger-pointing. Rather than address the issues with sensitivity and subtlety, they're rammed down your throat. So preachy.<br/><br/>Season 7 was quite an ordeal to get through. I only put myself through it to see the series through to the end. Even then the writers don't make it easy: 13 episodes with a 1.5-hour final episode! In total that's about 14 hours of my life wasted.<br/><br/>Season ratings:\nSeasons 1-4: 10/10\nSeason 5: 9/10\nSeason 6: 5/10\nSeason 7: 3/10", "rating": 8, "helpful": "28 out of 39 found this helpful.", "date": "5 August 2019"}, {"title": " What Happened to This Show?", "content": "I was a fan of this show when it started and into the second season.

So I decided to watch one episode just to see what all the hype was about. I started watching the pilot episode of season exactly 1 a week ago and I have watched nothing else but Orange is the New Black. I have literally been binge watching ever since.<br/><br/>Let me just start by saying, I found the first two seasons, compelling, and I was fascinated from beginning to end of each episode completely drawn into the story. The character development was so fantastic. The setting felt realistic and the story was gritty. You didn't know what was going to happen next but you knew it was going to be high drama. Guaranteed. I felt for the main character and I cared about what happened to her. I was on the edge of my seat and couldn't wait to see what happens in the next episode.<br/><br/>Then season three started and I felt like somebody let the air out of my sails. It was like the whole series shifted from the great drama that it was to a mid day soap opera. What started out as probably one of the greatest series ever to grace the small screen, turned into a boring, weekly, snoozefest. <br/><br/>For one I hate the direction that the writers have suddenly taken the series in particularly with the main character Piper chapman. She started out as likable and I felt for her and what her life had become. However she has quickly turned into someone who I not only no longer like but I no longer give a damn about what happens to her. In fact they could write her out of the series entirely and I would be fine with it. <br/><br/>I don't blame that on her but moreso on the writers. Seasons 1 and 2 was really emmy worthy material. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend a watch. However im 5 episodes into season 3 and Im doing everything I can to stay interested in whats going on. To me its apparent that the writers have run out of ideas and are just phoning it in and riding their success from the previous two seasons. So for me season 3 ruined what started out as a great series!! P.S.

What great character development. Jenji Kohan got it right this time. Kohan's other project, \"Weeds\", started out a really good show for the first two seasons, then just started to feel forced and ridiculous- you also kept losing empathy for the protagonist. The protagonist on this show has much more promise, and all of the characters are mysterious but round in their development. The flashbacks provide a much broader understanding of their history and what drives them, similar to \"Lost\", which mostly proved effective. <br/><br/>There is a lot of humor provided in Kohan's new series, but the humor is more based in reality, as opposed to the unbelievable goofiness that eventually ensued on \"Weeds\". I applaud Schilling and Mulgrew for their amazing work on this show, and Jason Biggs provides the adequate amount of comic relief just when it's needed most. The only criticism of the show would be Laura Prepon. Like in everything she does, she falls completely flat and doesn't add any real tension to the show, which is the only point of her character- that was a complete miscast. Aside from that, this is a close to perfect dramedy.<br/><br/>Netflix is really starting to step it up and give the big paid cable networks a run for the their money.

Meanwhile, How to Get Away With Murder has become my favorite show on television, and here's why: Even in a golden age of television, network TV has been lacking original content in the last few years. There are too many procedural dramas and too many superhero shows, so therefore I am glad to have a show like HTGAWM. Yes, it is partly a legal drama, but it is definitely so much more than than. IMO it is primarily a mystery and a thriller at the same time because every season starts with an intriguing flash-forward, showing us a very dramatic event that takes place in their mid-season finale. However, when most shows have flash-forwards they only feature one in the premiere and practically have no build-up to it, HTGAWM does the opposite, it features a flash-forward in every one of the first 8 episodes of a season and plays with our mind. By the time you have watched the mid-season finale itself, your mind will be blown. But why am I telling you this? Because I am trying to underline that this show has the most brilliant and shocking twists you could even imagine, and they have about 100 of those. They are executed with such brilliance and complexity that you will never get bored or annoyed by them. What is probably even better than the brilliant twists, however, is the masterful acting. Viola Davis nails every single scene she is, she portrays this deeply flawed character beautifully with so much depth. I cannot praise her enough, she deserves every single award that exists. That is not to say that the supporting cast is any less mesmerizing, they all bring their A-game consistently. They all deserve recognition. And one last thing: character development!!!! So so brilliant! The characters that you meet in the pilot change a lot as time passes and they all become very three-dimensional! Just go ahead and watch this show.

I sympathize. I'm a lawyer, and have worked in criminal defence (once upon a time), and I, too, generally have a really hard time watching any legal dramas whatsoever. Television takes egregious liberties with the justice system, and shows that portray the practice of law are difficult to watch when they are wildly inaccurate, and it is frustrating to witness protagonists do things that you know are illegal or unethical. As annoying as this is, the tendency is understandable\u2014even criminal law is only so compelling in real life. The assumption is that most viewers do not have legal training, and that nobody\u2014lawyers included\u2014will watch a show where competent, ethical practitioners stay at the office late looking up cases on Quicklaw, fiddling with binding machines, and trying not to smudge pad thai sauce on their prelim transcripts.<br/><br/>This show, however, is so ridiculous that it actually rose to the level of suspension of disbelief required for me, at least, to still enjoy it. It is basically a soap opera. Trying to subject it to human logic is a pointless exercise that will inevitably leave you discombobulated, shouting at the sky about injustice or whatever people do once they've discovered their whole life is a lie. <br/><br/>For instance, I would be hard pressed to conceive of a more profound conflict of interest than that contained in the season 1 episode 10 court scene if someone bet me $100 and a case of beer (I won't describe it in the interests of no spoilers--the blame-shifting thing). And that is just the tip of the iceberg. Every other thing that every character does in this show would get you summarily disbarred, fired, or charged with something. <br/><br/>At the end of the day however, that is not the point. This show seems to know exactly how over-the-top it is. But rather than trying to scale back the insanity in the name of realism, it revels in knocking it right into twelfth gear. Left and right, people are lying to each other or the court, sleeping around and committing felonies\u2014sometimes at the same time\u2014because why not? The degree of accuracy is so low that the mercury drops out the bottom of the thermometer and creates a rift in the space-time continuum. It fails so hard it wins. It is the Hearts equivalent of shooting the moon. <br/><br/>So get some popcorn and get comfy.

'cos, like, you would *totally* have time to do that ... and, naturally, she lectures publicly, in precise detail, on the actual cases she'll be defending THE NEXT DAY ... and because she's so brilliant and mean, she pits her students against each other to come up with the best possible defence for the case she's running tomorrow - and she'll use theirs if its better .. what? come on, I bet that really happens!<br/><br/>And of course, in this liberated and uncensored era, we see all the modern hi-jinks that glamorous yuppie students and their teachers get up to in order to .. ahem ... \"get ahead\" in the law game ... like the cute male student who turns out to be gay, who manages to get vital info about the case by going to the gay bar frequented by the gay nerds from the IT Department of the company where the defendant worked ... he chats up the bookish (i.e. wears glasses) but cute gay Asian-American IT nerd, who of course looks shiftily at his feet as he admits that he's been instructed by the firm's legal dep't not to discuss the case. It (almost) goes without saying that IT Nerd's steely resolve melts instantly when Sexy Gay Law Student uses his secret weapon - he turns his attentions away from him for a moment and makes eyes at another guy ... seconds later, after the obligatory \"Don't tell anyone I told you\" disclaimer, they're ripping each other's shirts off and slamming onto the bed, while IT Nerd sings like a canary ...<br/><br/>... later we meet the equally sexy female student who \"impresses\" Prof. Cranky-Pants by telling her how she used false pretences to illegally obtain totally inadmissible evidence about a witness' medical condition ... instant Credit, of course!<br/><br/>... later, in the obligatory \"feet of clay\" interlude, we follow Model-cute African- American Underdog Student (actually played by an English kid who was in Harry Potter) as he drops over to Prof. Cranky-Pants' (totally unlocked) office, late at night, to ask a sticky legal question - as you do ... but something's amiss ... we hear some grunting sounds - so of course he barges into the inner office where - naturally - he stumbles onto Prof. Cranky-Pants giving a head-job to an enormous, heavily-muscled, shirtless black man ... what? I'm sure that happens at Harvard Law School all the time!<br/><br/>We decided to press \"stop\" at the point where the students meet the defendant ... but she doesn't come to the large, comfortable, well-equipped lecture hall - oh no ... that would be too easy, and not \"legal\" enough. No, the ENTIRE CLASS has to meet her in Prof. Cranky-Pants' sumptuous, wood-panelled, book-lined office, and they cram in there, in a not-at-all-stagey-and-awkward manner, lined up the staircase, and everything ... taking notes, on notepads - as you do in 2014 - nodding sagely, or looking at each other quizzically and shaking their heads, while cute, tearful, blonde Ms Defendant gives her sob-wracked account of the case.<br/><br/>I know TV is just a business, but it never ceases to amaze me how so many people are willing to be involved with such sloppily-conceived, clich\u00e9-infested, badly written, poorly acted CRAP, and how network execs seem endlessly willing to give huge amounts of money to keep producing crud like this ... and it's doubly galling when one considers the many well-written, well-acted, well-produced and brilliantly original programming, like 'Firefly', 'The Fades' and 'Outcasts', that get cancelled after one series.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "142 out of 289 found this helpful.", "date": "22 February 2015"}, {"title": " Murder did not look any more tempting", "content": "I don't understand all the bad reviews surrounding this show.

What these reviewers seem to believe is that the show is either a guide to life that must teach morals directly, or that it is apparently not a tongue-in- cheek comedy using stereotypes to make social commentary in a humorous way. It is not a how-to guide on being a woman in today's world, and since it isn't a children's show, I don't see why anyone would be concerned that the characters are not all traditionally moral, conservative individuals. I, personally, prefer characters that make mistakes, grow, learn, and change, and have diverse viewpoints. This show has that, and for what it's worth, the main protagonist is neither 'slutty' nor wildly amoral and evil, but is instead rather 'normal' and sympathetic.<br/><br/>I would say that the show is witty, humorous, and at times thought- provoking. The characters are, in fact, more complex than the stereotypes they portray, and anything seemingly sexist or ageist is done deliberately and self-deprecatingly. Yes, it IS unrealistic that a woman over 40 would have to pretend to be in her 20s to get a job. That's the point. Would anyone really go into watching a show with the premise that a 40 year old divorc\u00e9e is successfully passing as a 25 year old college grad in order to get a job and expect realism?<br/><br/>The show takes little kernels of reality and makes them more absurd, extreme, and unrealistic in order to present a charming, funny show that still provides some insight into social perceptions.<br/><br/>Also note that I managed to watch and enjoy the entire season without feeling the need to sleep around, lie pathologically, or mock anyone over the age of 40.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "132 out of 160 found this helpful.", "date": "25 July 2015"}, {"title": " It is a refreshing, fun, and real.

The whole overarching concept about Bajor, the wormhole aliens, Cisco's origins and destiny, the tension between different races and characters, and (perhaps most of all) the _continuity_ once the Dominion War begins (in many ways the last four seasons are more like one collossal 75-hour movie than a series of discreet episodes).<br/><br/>If there is a fault to DS9 it is probably that it took some time to hit its straps.

It edges out Star Trek's original series just barely as my favorite in the franchise. I am not going to state that it's the best Star Trek series, because it definitely will not appeal to everybody, but it is my favorite.<br/><br/>DS9 deviates from the Trek franchise formula in an important way - it is based on one location - a Cardassian-built space station near the planet Bejor. So even the architecture of the main set is alien - not another sterile militaristic star ship inhabited by a primarily white European crew - but a true Babel. Bejor has just been liberated from 60 years of occupation by an expansionist militaristic race - the Cardassians. Both Bejorans and Cardassians will play important roles throughout DS9. Since the station does not move much during the show's seven year run, DS9 has a much stronger sense of place than the other ST series, and is able to develop story arc and character continuity much more powerfully than the others.<br/><br/>All of the major characters and most of the frequent returning characters have their own interwoven story arcs - most of which span the entire series. Ben Sisko (Avery Brooks), the station's commander, is a somewhat disgruntled Star Fleet officer who has several personal vendettas which have almost driven him from Star Fleet. He is also a single parent and a genius. In the very first episode, Sisko's arc begins and it is clear that his story will be the frame within which the entire series is organized - though the reasons for this will no become entirely clear until near the end. Also memorable are the gruff, shape-shifting Chief Constable Odo(Rene Auberjunois) who does not know what he is and where he came from; Kira (Nana Visitor) Sisko's aggressive and intense Bajoran second officer; Garak (Andy Robinson) a Cardassian Tailor and - possibly - spy, who is easily the most well-developed, well-acted and interesting recurring guest star Star Trek has ever had; Jadzia Dax (Terry Farrell) - the beautiful Trill science officer whose consciousness is enhanced by the memories and personality of a 600 year old symbiotic slug who lives in her stomach and has inhabited dozens of previous hosts; Julian Bashir (Alex Siddig) - the station's young, brilliant, adventurous and naive doctor; and Quark (Armin Shimmerman), the greedy, conniving, but entirely lovable Ferengi casino owner.<br/><br/>The characters, cast, and serialized stories make DS9 stand apart from the franchise as the most powerfully plotted, intensely dramatic and politically charged Star Trek ever. The show is, however, not for those with limited attention spans and a disdain for complexity. While it isn't exactly hard to follow, the dialog is often dense and DS9 - more than any other Trek show - uses non-verbal communication very well. Brooks, Visitor and Robinson - all of whom are masters at this - are particularly non-verbal and make a big impression from the first few episodes.<br/><br/>Throughout the series, there are constant underlying political intrigues and surprisingly little filler. Almost every story connects with the main story arc (Sisko's and Bejor's) in one way or another, and no time is wasted with aimless experimentation by the writing team (a problem Voyager and Enterprise both suffered from).<br/><br/>The production is consistently theatrical in scope. The special effects are still - even today - above average for television, and even the new BSG doesn't approach the scope and coherence of the plot.<br/><br/>Highly recommended for bright people looking for something more than typical TV drama normally delivers.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "113 out of 136 found this helpful.", "date": "19 January 2008"}, {"title": " Greatest series of all time", "content": "Before DeepSpace 9 I could say that I was not much of an ST fan.

Avery Brooks made a good Commander and the talented Nana Visitor did a good job playing Kira.

I had always found the idea of Star Trek very appealing and enjoyed a few movies and original episodes now and then. At that time, I had never really got into The Next Generation which my family and friends seemed to love, but I figured I would at least give this new show a try. As I eventually sat there with my little brother and watched the two-hour pilot, little did I know that this would change my life for the next seven years, as I would have to plan my weekends so that I could catch every new episodes on Saturday nights like football fans' semi-sacred Sunday afternoons.<br/><br/>So why did I fall in love with the show? Why indeed do we fall in love? Well, there is always a part of the answer linked to resonance; something that stirs something strong and positive within you. The show is a whole package of powerful television and one of the best gifts I ever bough myself was the complete seven seasons in DVD. Now, besides the intangible, the 'magic' that comes from many elements like the beautiful mind that arises from firing neurons, here is why this television series is not only a great science-fiction experience, but ranks among the best television series of all time in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>A) The Characters<br/><br/>At the base of it all, the show's strength is with its interesting, conflicted and complex characters. Both the writers and actors bring life to characters that will invade your living room and your head, maybe your heart. The relationships they create on the busy space station are sure to keep you thinking, laughing or crying with them. They are very endearing and perfectly heroic and flawed. You get to know each and every one of them in a deep real-life-like layered way. You also get to see them progress and stay the same, throughout the journey.<br/><br/>Beyond the friendship-like familiarity that will awaken in you the characters of Odo, Quark, Jadzia, Worf, Ezri, Kira, Julian, Miles and the Siskos, the guest characters are developed in an astonishingly similar depth. Again the writers and actors pull their heart out to create the most memorable recurring characters that feel as much part of the show as the regulars. Garak, Dukat, Rom, Nog, Leeta, Vic, Martok, Gowron, Wynn and Weyoun\u2014 to name a few\u2014are as complex as alien DNA. It is like having a basketball team with superstars on the bench to support the starting five when needed.<br/><br/>B) The Story<br/><br/>Set on a space station \u2014and the major critic and setback for most Trekkers that prefer an exploring ship a la Enterprise\u2014the story is far from static. In fact, with the Star Trek fashion of exploring current human questions and themes in this futuristic backdrop, DS9 will explore everything from religion, war, death, slavery, genetic engineering, homosexuality (first homosexual kiss on TV!), geniuses, heroes, rebels, politics, commerce, racism, multiple personalities, memories, continuity, resurrection, time, peace, love, parenthood, marriage, espionage, mass murders, prison, biological warfare, terrorism, to the military and martyrdom. All that and more is explored in a thoughtful, meaningful way and kudos to the show for not only exploring them, but for remaining in the interesting gray area. There is nothing black and white. Everything (and I mean everything) is questionable and an opportunity for thoughts and discussion.<br/><br/>The story is a balancing act between mundane nuances of life and epic goals, dreams and actions. If it is not a problem with Sisko's son at the space station school, it is the discovery of a new technology, the casual friendship of Miles and Julian, the encounter with a new race that may threaten the existence of the half the galaxy, Odo's existential crisis or the possible assassination of a prominent political or religious figure. All this is so well woven together and each has its importance in the smaller and grandeur scheme of things to make this fabricated Universe feel complete and utterly real and engaging.<br/><br/>C) The People<br/><br/>The writers, directors, cast and crew were without a doubt dedicated to make this thing work and it shows in the most obvious and subtle ways throughout the series. Actors will take the director chair on occasion to direct their colleagues or sit down with the writing team to discuss character development. Special effects, sets, costumes and make-up artists make crucial contributions to make the alien-filled universe seem believable. The passion that exists behind and in front of the camera is palpable and welcomed. You really feel that the whole production team has a common dream in bringing this labor of love to the viewer week after week. The consistent quality of the show over years (170+ episodes) from \"Emissary\" to \"What You Leave Behind\" is a testament to this desire to give more to the audience and create something to be proud of.

It makes it more interesting for the watcher, almost like reading a novel. Most people, especially non-Trek fans, who had watched the series from its conception or joined when the story arc began about 4 years ago will know what I mean when I say this is an untraditional type of Star Trek.

Having a plot that develops throughout rather than just stand-alone stories like many of the Next Generation episodes helps it a lot. The Religion v Science aspects are an interesting addition to a science-fiction show. Ideas created in TNG are carried forward and developed, such as the Trills, while in TNG they simply move their personality to a new body in this the idea is taken further and the personalities are merged, making the race much more interesting. One of the great aspects of the show is the relationships between the characters. O'Brian and Julian seem like genuine friends, Odo and Quark and their rivalry, and the on going feud of Sisko and Gul Dukat, the two commanders of the Station. The series created some genuinely good characters. Sisko, the Federation Officer torn between duty and destiny. Garak, the traitor with decidedly dark past, and Gul Dukat, a truly great villain.

Could he be a spy for them?). Well, more or less\u0085 the latter will continue to pester them, since there's now a treaty, and they retain some territories. The Provisional Government is a barely cohesive whole and doesn't have much support. Kira(Visitor, speaks her mind even when it'll get her in trouble) is the liaison between them and the Federation, who remain to support the rebuilding effort. The discovery of a nearby wormhole, the only stable known, complicates matters. It will enable travel back and forth between \"our\", quadrant, Alpha, and Gamma, which, until now, was so far away it made little sense to even consider going there. The orbiting station of Deep Space Nine will be a trading post and dock, dealing also with the plentiful traffic, all of which represents a potential help, or threat\u0085 to the safety of the war-torn lands. And a few seasons in, also once \"the voice\" of this has been found, tensions increase and what was a great show becomes an excellent one.<br/><br/>Characters are the core, as with all good Star Trek. Credible, three-dimensional, well-acted(even when they have their body \"taken over\", etc.), passionate, every last one. Main and even some peripheral, the focus is evenly divided. The show likes and understands them all, and that is contagious. We don't meet as many new species or groups, but this means less one-offs, and most you meet, you will see again, learning more(without the mystery ever being lost) about them, seeing them(heck, everyone in this) in different situations: with or without power, at their peak or their lowest end, and running the gamut of emotions. The status quo will be shaken up... and these changes take time, not happening overnight. I should note that this review is co-written by my ex-fianc\u00e9e. She has watched these more than I and helped me ensure that I covered every aspect here.<br/><br/>Things are run by Benjamin Sisko(Brooks, wounded badass, not brooding, pragmatic but not jaded, charming). His kid Jake(Lofton, a real teen, unlike Wesley) and he maintain a natural father/son relationship. The latter's friend Nog(Eisenberg, dedicated), a Ferengi(capitalist, \"let the buyer beware\"), the two from different cultures, and the question is raised, are they a good or a bad influence on each other. His uncle Quark(Shimerman, giving us uncomfortable reminders of our past), who runs the bar/casino and attracts business, and his contacts can get off-the-record stuff done. He has a real give-and-take, banter-driven thing going on with Constable Odo(Auberjonois, using his T1000 powers for sting operations), the lonely, \"non-human who gives us perspective on what we are like\"(like Data or Spock) of this. I imagine he was based on those with Asperger's, and from personal experience, can say they do it extremely well.<br/><br/>Officer of not techno-babble but actual science is Dax(Farrell, with the Dax symbiont in her giving the weight of many lives and their memories). Chief of Engineering Miles O'Brien(Meaney, an everyman) and his wife Keiko(Chao, a botanist), who have a Homer/Marge marriage\u0085 he may not always know how to make her happy, but he does love her and his efforts show that. And finally, Doctor Bashir(Siddig, young, arrogant, eager to prove. He has studied, not experienced). Prominent guests include Jeffrey Combs, who is always enjoyable to watch. Always present at the bar is Morn(Shepherd, a big, cute guy, who doesn't speak and hardly moves, we know about him from what others say about or to him, such as in response to an off-screen exchange. He has a ton of personality, and it's consistent, with the use of mostly just his eyes and gestures, reminiscent of Kevin Peter Hall, R.I.P., who performed The Predator, among others), a tribute to and anagram of Norm, of Cheers.<br/><br/>This favors tense episodes with a climax and then a short wrap-up over an in-depth explanation. Like other sci-fi, it works on multiple levels, such as 'just wanting to enjoy the story' and 'thinking about/debating/analyzing', repeated viewings will allow you to think about the layers. It seems to have learned lessons from The Next Generation, it's so tightly written and executed. The theme of religion explored, almost every single idea explored in the show has, and is fair to, both sides. The Prophets(or to others, aliens) offer spiritual guidance, \"helping people to accept situations, and to grow\" without forcing rules upon people(though the people come up with some. They see everything, without time or context, but they show you only glimpses of your future, often something truly important to you.<br/><br/>This features amazing production design, with tremendous attention to detail and credibility. It meticulously ties up anything resembling loose ends and plot threads. This is even more relevant now, 20 years later. It is the first Star Trek with a regular straight-up comic relief character, and it can be a tad annoying, and doesn't always fit with the otherwise mature content. They do stories, scenes and concepts that you've seen before, but they do them so well that you don't mind, and at times you'll even be happy to see their take on it. Politics, philosophical ideas and compelling SF concepts are explored, but that happens in other ST, as well... so here, there's the added dimension of inner conflict in the core group. Half of them have different backgrounds, goals and points of view than others, and this comes across. The tension is felt.<br/><br/>There is disturbing content and some bloody violence in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys fiction\u0085 this has the closest to real people and the most universal stories of the franchise(you should have a basic understanding of the tech, since there is so much else going on here, it's too much to pick up), and if you watch only one series, it should definitely be this one. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpful": "33 out of 45 found this helpful.", "date": "14 July 2014"}, {"title": " Wow the purists hate well Ive learned", "content": "Why is the fact that this show revolves ( no pun intended) on a space station so unsettling to the heavy Trekkies.

The human characters are Avery Brooks as Lt. Commander then Captain Ben Sisko, his son Jake played by Cirroc Lofton, station doctor Bashir played by Alexander Siddig and coming over from the Enterprise and The Next Generation was station engineer Myles O'Brien still played by Colm Meaney. <br/><br/>The rest of the characters were not Terrans as SyFy folks like to call earth people. Major Kira was Bajoran, a planet right near the Deep Space Nine station and Sisko's number 2. Odo, Rene Auberjonois was a shape shifter and at first we're told that he's the only one of his kind. He and the Ferengi Quark had a running rivalry. Quark was Armin Shimerman and he was like Dr. Smith from Lost In Space, a man with a scheme for all occasions who provided the local entertainment such as it was on Deep Space Nine. Later Michael Dorn who was Worf on The Next Generation and a Klingon joined the Deep Space Nine Staff. And Andrew Robinson was one sly and craft Cardassian tailor who came late to the show, but had more layers to his character than an onion.<br/><br/>The politics of the galaxy that we learned on The Next Generation was refined and honed to a fine edge on Deep Space Nine. Star Trek always had a great advantage in that it brought a guaranteed built-in audience for each succeeding show. It reached its height during Deep Space Nine. The franchise is still a moneymaker for Paramount.<br/><br/>What I liked best about the show is that action, background, and character were all kept in balance by the writers. No one of these elements overwhelmed the other in an episode. The continuity between episodes was some of the best ever on a television series.<br/><br/>In the outer reaches of our galaxy several centuries later intelligent life forms were able to work and get along. Of course with some races the bridge builders don't get along and that forms the inherent conflicts within the show.<br/><br/>Given the ending of Deep Space Nine and what is the fate of Captain Sisko, no one has thought to do a feature film for the series or integrate it into a new The Next Generation feature.

I was sick of the wooden, 2d characters in the original and tng that were just in awe of the captain, sick of Picard's let's talk when people are shooting at me, sick of the lack of action and the human centered crews.I got everything I wanted in DS9.<br/><br/>First, the characters. They are all well written, developed, and wonderfully dark. Everyone either has a secret or does something wrong, nobody is perfect. And the children aren't annoying, Nog or Jake never made me want to bust the TV the way Wesley did. Of course, the captain was important, and Avery Brooks does a good job, even if he over-acts, much in the way Shatner did. My personal favorite: Garak, the Obsidian Order Cardassian, exiled on the station, full of secrets, hidden talents and charm. His lines are always good, sometimes brilliant, and funny when they have to. Let's not forget the villain, Dukat, by far the best villain on Star Trek.<br/><br/>Next, the setting. To me, a starship exploring was a way to get a good series without having to develop characters.You don't change characters, you just change scenery. LAzy. A STATION will force you too get creative to advance a show and keep people watching.<br/><br/>The aliens have a bigger role in this. TNG didn't feature so many aliens, it was very human centered. Troi was basically human, and Data wanted to be. But ds9has truly memorable characters, from Garak and Dukat to Quark and Odo, to the Jem'hadars Ikat'ika and Remata'Klan and Weyoun the Vorta. And there is no message humans are special, frankly, they are not the smartest, fastest or strongest in the galaxy, and they have a dark side to them :\"let me tell you about hew-moons...\". And Worf is in DS9 the meanest person in the Alpha Quadrant, not the voice of a more aggressive stance in TNG.<br/><br/>Finally, this is a show with real action. Space battles, a huge war, explosions, people die, star ships are ripped to shreds, and the Defiant, the meanest ship in the galaxy. OK, sounds like Babylon 5, and I guess it is, but that is what makes it great. No shame in emulating a great show.<br/><br/>In essence, it i the only Star Trek to work without Roddenberry because it is nothing like Roddenberry. I think he would have frowned at this idea, because he had a vision of a happy-go-lucky show, squeaky clean characters and the like. Nothing wrong with that, but he made it work, and honest to God Enterprise seasons 1 and2 and that train wreck Voyager proved that it wouldn't work. DS9 was different and brilliant, better because it finally had the guts to change the perspective on a great universe. It kept the franchise alive, allowed voyager to exist,enterprise and two Tng films to be made.

How could anything exciting happen unless trouble found them?\" But I was soooo wrong. I fell in love with the characters from the first season alone. The main plot at first was that star fleet had occupied a Cardassian space station (Terok Nor) after the Cardassians had forcefully occupied the peaceful planet of Bajor. Then the crew of Terok Nor, better known as, Deep Space Nine, discovered the first stable wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant where terrible things lied. <br/><br/>Then the second season was even better, the characters developed faster and smoother than those in TNG and other ST series. The show included so many great, real-life themes, like sexism, racism, genocide, and many others. Then the season ended with a huge bang. Introducing the Dominion as a huge and fearful enemy. <br/><br/>Then throughout the next seasons everything you've ever wanted to happened, would happen. Drama, romance, action, horror, and everything else. Even the birth of the Maquis. The realism of this series was also another factor to love it.

The truth is, it's not, and you have to take the show for what it truly is.  Larry David, in his great comedic brilliance, is not trying to glorify himself with this show, you can tell that just from watching one episode.  Instead, he is really utilizing a caricature of a rich, whipped, neurotic yuppie to skewer the image of life at the top.  His character (even though he is essentially playing himself), bumbles, complains, talks himself into painful situations, and is ultimately served devilishly funny comeuppance from episode to episode.  This self-deprecating humor wouldn't work for anybody else, but for a guy like Larry David, this material works perfectly, because he seems so easy to laugh at (and I have a feeling this is hardly accidental, which is why his comedy is truly brilliant.)  I really have to marvel at the idea of anyone NOT being able to laugh at this show. It's the greatest comedic take on life and the human condition that has ever been captured on film.  All other television comedies of this era pale in comparison.  \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is possibly the salvation of true comedy TV, in an age when good television comedies are few and far between.", "rating": null, "helpful": "383 out of 425 found this helpful.", "date": "6 October 2002"}, {"title": " He's a victim of circumstance.", "content": "Larry David, king of awkward moments and co-creator of the hit television series Seinfeld, has come back to television at full force. His hit series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, is a further extension of his life. Seinfeld has ended, his co-creator name has earned him about $200 million and growing, and his life is just getting excited. On these thirty minute trips, we follow Larry through moments with his wife Cheryl and manager Jeff. Circumstance continues to happen and Larry somehow always happens to be in the middle.<br/><br/>To say this is exactly like Seinfeld would be like saying chocolate tastes exactly like vanilla. These two shows are night and day, while others will compare the actions of Larry to that of Jerry, there one crucial element that divides them. Larry's show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, seems a bit more realistic. Seinfeld was a great show, don't get me wrong \u0085 possibly one of the best live-action series ever, but there was always that question of reality with Seinfeld. Where did Kramer get his money? How was George never put in jail? And so forth. With Larry's new show, he explores those possibilities. We know he is wealthy, he is playing himself and that is why he is able to not work. I would go so far as to say this first season is a dark representation of Seinfeld. Imagine if Seinfeld was released on HBO, how different of a show it would have been. Well, now Larry has that platform to really explore all opportunities \u0085 and he does with his hilarious show.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of awkward silences and coincidences with surprising results you will love this show. I am not sure if die-hard Seinfeld fans will love this program, but I sure did and I have seen every episode of Seinfeld at least twenty times. I will have to warn you, this is yet another show about nothing that just works. I just finished watching my favorite episode with the 'elevator courtesy' and his infamous fight with Richard Lewis (who plays his best friend).<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very funny show that I hope remains true to itself and consistent throughout the seasons.

Sounds pretty boring, and even snotty right? Its not at all. Like the rest of us, I loved Seinfeld, and still love the reruns. But I gotta say, this show is better. It's the same basic premise, which I guess is to turn a standup monologue into a situation comedy. In other words, instead of having a guy on stage telling jokes about the amusing and annoying happenstances of every day life, you create a format comedy, and use these anecdotes to weave together a plot. What made Seinfeld memorable was the clever way in which everything all in the end tied up in a nice little package. If you notice, that's a common laugh getter for stand-ups, to inject a joke they made earlier in their set and put it into practical anecdotal demonstration. You are right if you are thinking this is complete hogwash and hyper-analyzation of something not meant to be studied as such, but there it is. Having said all of that, I think CYE is the logical next step for fans of the Seinfeld show. It's the advanced course if you will of the more remedial network show. The freedom of HBO allows for obviously more adult material and language, but also for pure artistic expression. A lot of what goes on is definitely not palatable to the mainstream, and I could honestly see people hating it. Not me. I think its a rare chance to see genius, unfettered and uncensored. Yes Larry David was George Costanza or vice versa, but through this series, you also see he was Kramer, Elaine and Jerry.

As I'm English, the usual classics like \"Friends\" and \"Seinfield\" don't tend to match out against things like \"The Office\" and \"Peep Show\". Now, it's probably because I'm British that I've developed these comedy tastes, but I am in no way against the sort of stuff the USA turn out. \"Scrubs\", \"Home Improvement\" and \"South Park\" are some of my favourite shows of all time, all funny in their own ways. Recently I invested in series one of a very different show, something that I thought I'd buy after seeing a few clips on a TV special. \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is the king of sitcoms - and here's why.<br/><br/>The idea is simple. Larry David (writer and co-creator of Seinfield) plays himself as he goes from place-to-place on life's adventures with a great supporting cast, including his wife Cheryl and best friend Jeff. As he goes, realistic situations develop, and here lies the comedy; Larry says and does the exact opposite to what a normal person would do - in essence, he says what you'd be thinking instead of pretending to be humble, polite or well-mannered. Of course, Larry can be humble, polite and well-mannered, but only to those who treat him the same way.<br/><br/>First off, the tagline \"deep down you know you're him\" is totally spot-on. The character of Larry is (secretly) somebody you know you are, it's just Larry tends to voice his opinion, state what's true and stand up for himself when things aren't his fault. Isn't this somebody we all wish we could be? I sure do, but it's Larry's lack of feelings for anybody but himself that sets him apart. Sure, he's a nice guy too - I'd be pals with him, and even more so for speaking his mind.<br/><br/>Of course, the comedy develops from a variety of other areas too. Our poor protagonist is normally punished in some way for speaking his mind, as it seems you can't get through life by simply saying what's right. Take the first episode for instance, Larry jokingly refers to his wife as \"Hitler\" whilst on the phone to his friend Jeff - little did he know, he was on speaker phone and Jeff's parents have heard. They're outraged, and why? ...they've got a cousin who was a gay holocaust survivor. Geesh! That's just one example however, and as the series develops, the plots and little stories tend to get better and better. The characters are very, very well done - and you have to remember, a lot of the show is improvised from a simple script outline. The actors were auditioned with Larry David himself and it shows that he's put time and effort into getting the show perfect - it really does.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is as realistic as \"The Office\", and in the same way, a very similar show. Where \"The Office\" used cringe-comedy to get us laughing, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" gets us laughing at what we know is true. It's a look at a character who we can love and adore, and yet still distance ourselves from because deep down, we know we're him... we just don't want to admit it.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "34 out of 42 found this helpful.", "date": "16 January 2006"}, {"title": " Arrest your eagerness!", "content": "There are few men working on television today that rival the wit, the insight, or the genius of Larry David.

The thing about Larry David and his humor is that anybody, from any culture or background, could understand at least what the main point of the episode is, and understand what the humor is conveying. It doesn't necessarily cater to the American, upper middle class, L.A./N.Y. crowd, which is what we see of most onscreen. It's just so easy to watch, and so intuitive it requires little effort to fully immerse into an episode. The character Larry lives the fancy life of a successful wealthy old guy, but he doesn't behave like one, which shatters the boundaries of social class and even culture. He sees everything from his own personal point of view, and will contest anything and everything he deems unfair, whether christian or jewish, black or white, rich or poor, handicapped or able-bodied, male or female.<br/><br/>Now, that premise alone of the ever-critical New York Jew with little regard for sensitivities is indeed funny, but wouldn't fill out 10 full seasons in any substantial enough way. Larry David merely sets the tone of the show, but doesn't flesh it out. The magic in the series happens with the writing, and particularly the interconnected structure of each episode. We'll be shown something at the start of each story, we'll then be shown a couple more seemingly innocuous and independent events, but our attention is focused so much on the present disasters we're shown we'll forget about those earlier occurrences, which somehow come back to connect with the other subplots, with each episode being a climactic converging of all those brewing catastrophes. And it's not just each individual episode that works that way, but the full season. And there's always a subtle yet unconventional moral at the end, some kind of ironic twist of fate.<br/><br/>Never at any point does the series look like it's out of breath, as Larry David continues with his perfect 100% record from Seinfeld to this latest CYE season 10.

This is a real time-saver, because I know right away that these are people whom I needn't bother with.<br/><br/>More often, I'm inclined to meet people who tell me that CYE is the only comedy on TV that makes them laugh out-loud... or that they make plans to either be home on Sunday night or to tape it. These are \"my people\" -- kindred spirits.<br/><br/>To those of you who don't get it, Go back to your sitcoms with the enhanced laugh track that tells you what's supposed to be funny. (Or better yet, you can rent \"Dude, Where's My Car?\" again.) Those of us who think this is the most innovative sitcom to come down the pike in recent memory are happy to have this show all to ourselves.<br/><br/>Thank you Larry and cast and crew for giving me an excuse to fire up the old Trinitron once a week.", "rating": null, "helpful": "140 out of 260 found this helpful.", "date": "27 December 2000"}, {"title": " Love this show", "content": "Parents watched it when UK was a kid and I enjoy it alot.... spark up a blunt and laugh the whole hour haha great!
