In January 1987, the first television episode of Colin Dexter's intelligent series of novels was broadcast.  Inspector Morse was perfect - the beautiful scenery of Oxford, the classic red Jaguar, the classical music and a superb, and at times moving, central performance by the man his co-star Kevin Whately would later describe, after his untimely death in 2002, as Britain's finest screen actor.  <br/><br/>Until it finished in 2000, Inspector Morse captivated large audiences, intrigued by its complex plots, the towering performance of John Thaw and its amazing roll call of quality guest actors.  The series oozed class from every pore, and will always be the greatest jewel in the magnificent career of the late John Thaw.  I really cannot find enough words to explain just how good I think Thaw was in so many of his television and film roles, but Morse was the character in which he proved to television viewers that he was not only versatile but had a rare depth.<br/><br/>The early episodes are certainly my favourites, as they were adapting the existing stories.  Later, as they ran out of Dexter's stories, they began writing stories to keep the popular series going.  But throughout, we learn more and more about the mysterious, emotionally repressed and rather sad Inspector.  Without doubt, this is the greatest modern murder mystery franchise, and the series so many have tried, and failed, to emulate since.", "rating": null, "helpful": "98 out of 103 found this helpful.", "date": "27 July 2004"}, {"title": " A Real Treasure", "content": "Well, where can one begin.  Inspector Morse is remarkable in every way.  The characterisation of Morse and Lewis is wonderful.  By the end of the series we know so much about Morse.  It kind of brings a bonding between the character of Morse and the viewer.  The show gives an English cultural feel to the programs which is also reflected by the character of Morse. <br/><br/>\nI also like the way in which Morse CAN get it wrong.  It makes him human. This element is wonderfully executed as it deceives the viewer into following the track of Morse and then slaps you back in the face much to the viewers shock.  This adds a fabulous twist and an element of surprise which is hard to find in many detective programs.<br/><br/>There are not many detective programs that carry symbols to represent themselves either.  The Jaguar, the pub, the opera, classical music and crosswords.  All these objects made the program.  I mean, if I saw a red Jaguar parked in town, the first thing that would come to my head would be Morse.<br/><br/>I also believe that John Thaw and Kevin Whatley should be given so much credit for the way in which they have brought these characters to life. They came across so convincingly and played so well off of each other.

Colin Dexter's novels for me are a bit like Shakespeare's plays - better to see them played out in a dramatic fashion than try to wade through all the details on the pages. Dexter obviously likes words, so naturally his famous detective will be a lover of crosswords and puzzles. A cultured, educated man who none the less loves fast cars (his trademark red Jaguar is as well-known an icon as Magnum's red Ferrari), whisky, women (although he doesn't seem very lucky with them), and of course, a good pint of REAL beer. <br/><br/>While a bit too old to do something along the lines of Regan in \"The Sweeney\", Thaw still brought enormous energy and presence to the Morse role.<br/><br/>His \"sidekick\", Sgt Lewis, is the perfect counterpart to Morse's sometimes-overly-intellectual approach to policing. In the books, Lewis comes off as rather thick, and at times a bit servile, and Morse seems to treat him accordingly; Kevin Whatley transformed Lewis into more of a sort of \"everyman's genius\", someone with whom Morse could actually collaborate. \"Promised Land\", in which the pair travel to Australia, is one of the better ones for seeing how the two relate to each other. The series sometimes amused the real-life police of the Thames Valley, for it raised Oxford's murder rate to ridiculously high levels. Some of the earlier shows moved at the pace of the books... a little sluggish, which when combined with odd camera angles - e.g. through distorting glass objects - sometimes made the viewer feel drowsy. Always a mistake to nod off, though. Morse is usually so overconfident in his suspicions that the real killer goes uncaught, and where Morse goes, murder almost certainly follows.<br/><br/>My favorite episode? \"Masonic Mysteries\", a real spine-tingler where a man Morse put away years ago comes back to haunt him, and lands the detective in jail for murder. Ian McDiarmid (Star Wars' Emperor) is simply... spooky. <br/><br/>A fantastic series.

Based around the Oxford-based characters created by Colin Dexter (some films are based on the novels; some on plot ideas by Dexter; and others, original scripts), the ITV series starring John Thaw and Kevin Whately has endured 33 high-quality episodes, each of which is approximately 104 minutes in length, and made with the same high standards usually reserved for a film with a theatrical release, ultimately resulting in a very arduous-yet-rewarding filming process. The premise of the series, to paraphrase John Thaw, is observing how two disparate men - one of which is a cerebral, Jaguar-driving, beer-drinking, crossword-solving, music-loving, well-educated, pedantic, arrogant, bachelor (Chief Inspector \"Endeavour\" Morse); the other of which is a northern, subservient, down-to-earth, prudish, humble and publicly-educated, family man (Sergeant \"Robbie\" Lewis) - proceed through an intricate whodunit and come to the conclusion which they inevitably reach. There is a noticeable father-son relationship between Morse &amp; Lewis; and perhaps more of a brother-brother relationship between Morse &amp; Strange, the Chief Superintendent. Aptly described as \"a good detective but a poor policeman,\" Morse's modus operandi is very unconventional and parallels the way in which he solves his daily crossword puzzle (sometimes resulting in him getting things \"arse about face\"). His partnership with Lewis, however much as Morse would probably deny it, is vital to the investigation, just as Watson's was to Holmes; a lot of times mere innocent remarks from Lewis will lead Morse to deduce essential pieces of a puzzle, thereby solving the crime. Although Morse's melancholy is a rarely changing factor, Thaw is able to convey the gambit of emotions without having to resort to overacting. Their Christian names are rarely broadcast throughout the series; Morse tends to refer to Sgt. Lewis as just \"Lewis,\" whereas Sgt. Lewis is inclined to address Morse as \"Sir.\" The team who commissioned the Inspector Morse series seem to have elected not to use the same filming/writing crew on more that one episode, resulting in direction and writing styles which differ immensely from one another at different stages in the series. Contributing a lot to the show are the classically-trained backgrounds of many of the guest stars and the talent of the writers and directors, many of whom have gone on to have tremendously successful careers. Another important element of the show's success is the, at times hauntingly beautiful, strikingly apposite music composed by Barrington Pheloung. The characters evolve throughout the series, almost to the point where Lewis metamorphoses into an obtuse version of Morse. In Hitchcockian-style, Colin Dexter makes a cameo appearance in nearly every Inspector Morse film. The deterioration of Morse's health from a nasty combination of both drink and diabetes, and his apathy toward its maintenance were his ultimate downfall; indeed the re\"morse\"ful day occurred in the final episode (same name, same poem, same pun) wherein Morse succumbed to a heart attack, fittingly on the lawn of an Oxford college. Although it is hard for one to simultaneously predict the future and judge in a contemporary environment, it appears that the series has all the requisites to be regarded as \"timeless.\"", "rating": 10, "helpful": "56 out of 63 found this helpful.", "date": "17 October 2001"}, {"title": " Overview of the Inspector Morse Series'", "content": "Inspector Morse, which was produced by ITV , is one of the consistently highest quality TV series' ever produced in the UK.

No other British police drama series even comes close<br/><br/>The cast included many fine British Actors including regular James Grout as Chief Superintendent Strange - Morse's boss, Patricia Hodge , Anna Massey, Richard Griffiths and many, many others.<br/><br/>The programmes are two hours long when shown in the UK but this includes commercial breaks. They are being continually repeated on ITV and ITV2 and are immensly popular. They are based on the books by Colin Dexter who has appeared in every single episode as an uncredited extra.<br/><br/>\nUnfortunately, no more episodes will be filmed as Morse was killed off in the last episode which was based on the book by Dexter where Morse dies. One big mystery which flows through the series' is Morse's Christian name . When asked, he always says 'Just call me Morse'. The identity of his very unusual name is finally revealed in one of the very last episodes.<br/><br/>The programmes were mostly based around the city of Oxford and many of them involved Oxford University where Morse himself was a student.<br/><br/>The music in the programmes is of particularly high quality , having been composed by Barrington Phelong. Several soundtrack CD's are available and have sold in high numbers. The main theme which tends to vary slightly from programme to programme features a haunting musical play on morse code.Inspector Morse is particularly keen on opera and a fair bit of it features in the programmes.<br/><br/>The length of two hours for each self-contained story gives plenty of time for the plots to unfold in a leisurely but very gripping way. Phelong's excellent music and the supurb filming build the tension in the stories wonderfully. One story was filmed mostly on location in Italy and another in Australia but these are exceptions to the usual Oxford locations.<br/><br/>Although the great British TV actor, John Thaw as Morse, is the star of the show ,the role of Kevin Whateley - another fine actor ,as Sgt. Lewis should not be overlooked . His solid working class 'steady' British copper provides the perfect foil for the celebral middle class Morse who is very much a culture snob .

The intellect of the author is spelled out in the character, and though the books aren't autobiographical in plot,they seem to be in terms of the characterization of the central figure. Mr. Dexter uses his scholarship and his intellect in life in much the way Morse does--his wry comments on Oxford and its denizens during our visit seemed akin to Morse's views of them.

John Thaw and the producers/writers who worked with him made this a timeless series in the only way possible: make the lead character charismatic and intriguing (and extraordinarily well acted). It is virtually impossible for a series to last beyond several episodes based only on plots (I know, many will argue with this, but I stand my ground). The series has to be character driven to maintain its brilliance, episode after episode--in this case 33 episodes. That is not to say that the plots are unimportant, but only that they are clearly secondary to Morse and his relationships with those around him--especially his sergeant and his superior. But most important are his relationship with life and his values and the way he chooses to live his life; these are especially enthralling for a t.v. series (or movie or play or novel for that matter).

Thaw is much at home playing the cantankerous, cultured, clever, and egocentric Police Inspector who enjoys a drink, while Whately does well as his obedient sidekick.

And what was the reason that the highly acclaimed and known city of Oxford got this reputation? Because of a grumpy old detective by the name of Inspector Morse. This highly cultural, intelligent detective that fancied a good beer and classical music over anything else in life. Brilliantly casted by John Thaw, one of Britains best actors of all time, shows just what British Television is all about. Quality, through and through. The people behind the casting of this series has done a terrific job, the human interaction between the characters in this series is nothing short of brilliant. The relationship between Morse (John Thaw) and Lewis (Kevin Whately) is a relationship that one wonders how works. They seem to be from different planets, but yet they manage to interact in such a way that they always ends up sorting the beans. Morse, a man that always carries around large bills always leaves Lewis to pay the bar bill because the bartender has no change for twenties, and that always patronizes Lewis in such a way that you pity him. But in spite of this slightly awkward relationship, you do feel the compassion that is between the two. Even though they are highly different, they work so well together. Piecing together the pieces of the puzzle like the whole puzzle was nothing but a story book telling them exactly what happened. Morse being a loner, living on his own embracing what he loves the most, classic music he in many ways comes of as socially inapt seems and odd match to the family man Lewis. But as you watch this series, you come to understand that it could not have been in any other way. They are a perfect match, which makes the series move along so perfectly as it does. The way the series illustrates just how great detective work is done, and what personal sacrifices the ones doing such work has to endure just leaves you in awe. If you want good quality television, Inspectore Morse is a first choice by far. Many people get intimidated by the run time that a standard Inspector Morse episode has.

Having watched half-a-dozen episodes it is time a few preliminary observations.<br/><br/>The series was given top production values. Each episode was treated as a near-cinema quality stand-alone TV movie. They were all shot on film, with a lot of location shooting and multiple camera set-ups for each scene. The shows are also a role call of top-notch British actors (including several that later became much better known). Leading the way are John Thaw and Kevin Whately, who are both excellent. The first season only had three episodes. I see this increased to four episodes for several subsequent seasons before settling down to just one show a season. Morse certainly wanted to be taken seriously as a prestige production.<br/><br/>Personally, I am still waiting to be impressed.<br/><br/>For one thing, I am having trouble with the overall tone of the stories. Stylistically, they are located at the gritty, 'police procedural' end of the 'whodunit' spectrum, but this is belied by Morse's complete disregard for any procedure, or even the law itself. Moreover, the convoluted and sometimes implausible plots, often strewn with corpses, place it right in the middle of Agatha Christie territory. In 'Service of all the Dead' we are asked to believe that the Vicar, the church warden, his wife and the church organist, all conspired to kill the vicar's brother and that one of them turned out to be a psychopath intent on killing all his co-conspirators: that is a big 'ask'.<br/><br/>I am finding this clash between the general approach and the actual subject matter a bit uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Nor am I convinced by the character of Morse himself. This grumpy snob is disillusioned and world-weary, but for no obvious reason. He trails from pub to pub, constantly soaking up alcohol and jumping into his car with no fear of ever being breathalysed. It is implied that he has a real problem with drink, verging on alcoholism (one character actually says: \"aren't you the policemen that drinks?\") but we never actually see him drunk or hung-over. In several of these early stories he becomes romantically involved with one of the people in the case without regard to how this could compromise the investigation or any legal proceedings that might follow. He is also meant to be more fallible than the classic detectives were: he is often wrong in his reading of the situation. However, this fallibility seems ladled on to the stories rather than being integral to them. Morse jumps to conclusions on minimal evidence and is constantly blurting out his unfounded suspicions, making the Police liable for legal action. In one episode he actually arrests the wrong man.<br/><br/>The stories themselves are told in an arch, elliptical and somewhat pretentious way that makes them more difficult to follow than is strictly necessary. For example, in The Silent World of Nicholas Quinn the crucial final revelation fell flat and left me puzzled, so I had to go back to re-view the initial scene (which was interspersed with credits) in order to fully make sense of it. The stories tend to jump from one cryptic interrogation to another without rhyme of reason. For example, a character reveals something important which demands an immediate follow-up, but instead Morse abruptly terminates the interrogation and moves randomly on to something else.<br/><br/>This choppiness carries over into the way individual scenes are written and staged. They are often broken into tiny slivers, dispersed over different locations. Morse and Lewis start a discussion in a pub. We then cut to an exterior of the car park where Morse asks Lewis a question. He then walks away as Lewis shouts his answer at his retreating back. Morse then gets into his car, winds down the window and delivers his comeback. This sort of fragmented structure is typical of the whole series and seems to be a deliberate house style, imposed on all the different writers and directors that worked on the series.<br/><br/>The stories themselves obviously vary in quality, but none has yet really grabbed and baffled me and the eventual resolution of the mysteries has generally left me underwhelmed. They are as convoluted as the artificial puzzles of the Golden Age of crime writing, but not as clever or intriguing as, for example, the best of the Christies. I am reluctant to judge Colin Dexter on the basis of TV adaptations of his work, but I seriously doubt that he is in the same class as one of the modern 'greats' like Ruth Rendell.<br/><br/>These are only my first impressions, based on a handful of early episodes, and they may yet change as the series evolves over the years and I become more accustomed to its distinctive style and tone. If this happens, I will happily acknowledge it in a subscript to this review.<br/><br/>However, at this stage, Inspector Morse seems to me to be a classic example of the triumph of style over content.<br/><br/>PS: One footnote to that last assessment is that the sumptuous look of the series is undermined by a poor DVD transcription, which gives the cinematography an unpleasant, grainy look.<br/><br/>PPS: I did get used to it, and I don't regret watching all the episodes.

The morse character himself is unlike any other detective on TV too. He is antisocial and likable at the same time, he cares but is very irritating to those he must work with.

While it had extremely cheesy and bad acting and horrible writing, it was a fun show for the kids and the pre-teens. I remember always dying of laughter when I watched this show when I was a kid on Saturday mornings. Screech to me was like Marlon Brando in The Godfather, I thought the whole cast was brilliant. Now I still watch this show as a grown up, I really can't help it, it's like a car accident, you know you shouldn't look, but you can't help it. I know the writing was very bad and the situations are beyond unrealistic, but I think the reason I love this show still is because of it's innocence.<br/><br/>The show had a good influence on kids, it sounds crazy, but it did deal with a lot of issues that most kids have to deal with school. While I admit that they acted like Jesse was on heroine when she was simply taking caffeine pills, it still tried it's best to show you to be a true original. The story is simple, just 6 teenagers going through their daily lives in Bayside High School. They deal with the daily pressures: homework, tests, love, drugs, popularity, and friendship. Together they deal with these pressures along with the help of their loving principal, Mr. Belding.<br/><br/>Each character was lovable in their own way. Zack who was the smooth talker and ruled Bayside who could get any girl he wanted. Slater who was the high school jock and Zack's best friend. Screech, Zack's other best friend, who was the geek of the high school. Kelly who is the hottie cheerleader of Bayside and Zack's love interest. Lisa who is the fashion icon of the group and is Screech's long time crush. And Jesse, the study addict goodie two-shoe's and is also the vice president of the student council.<br/><br/>While each the group isn't what normally clicked in high school, it still was a lot of fun to watch them because of how opposite they were. It was always so charming to see them work together, who wouldn't have wanted friends like them? True, the situations in the show are extremely unbelievable, the acting isn't up to par, and it's cheesy messages, this was always a pleasure to watch. You have to admit that sometimes it does bring a few laughs. I'm not afraid to admit it, I still enjoy watching this show and I think you will too, just have fun and admit it, there's something memorizing about it.

Many people think this show is about High School but it isn't, it's about people.

While for some reason the main characters here are like the most popular people in school you might or might not relate with that but you could at times relate with what's going on in their lives. Which is why this show is good. Sure it might be silly but then again it's a comedy and high school was pretty fun and silly at times.<br/><br/>Like Zack would say: I like school. It's just too bad classes get in the way. <br/><br/>Now a little side note: This show was awesome but this is like the only good show NBC has had in it's Saturday Morning line up.

And it was reality TV before \"The Real World\" or \"Survivor.\" It took a realistic look at high school. It showed that in every high school, whether it be near the beaches of Malibu or near the cornfields of Nebraska, there were only six kids that mattered. The same kid who was class president was also head cheerleader, valedictorian, choir member, star athlete on the track and volleyball teams, school mascot, etc. and nobody else in the school did a thing! And of course, students like Zack Morris would get away with prank after prank after prank, even committing a felony in some cases, but still not be expelled and even find time to be best buds with the principal! This is the high school that I knew, and SBTB brought it to life. To glorious life with glorious writing. Ah yes! The writing! Some of the finest scribes of our time took their turns at SBTB.

I was five when it hit the air, and probably started watching it regularly in syndication not long after that. I've seen every episode numerous times.

The writing was VERY cheesy, and very far-reaching in many aspects. The acting (especially in the early seasons) was pretty sub-par. Though, it did get better in later seasons, as the actors and actresses grew in to their roles more. And well, probably honed their acting skills better. But even for a children's show, it was pretty painful at many times.<br/><br/>What SBTB had no shortage of were those \"cringe worthy\" moments. You know, the moments when you just feel BAD for the actors for having to take part in it. Or for that matter, yourself for having watched it. It bears repeating, the writing on this show was pretty bad. I honestly feel that many family/children's shows nowadays do a much better job with realism and writing. They're funnier, and adults can actively enjoy them as much as their kids. Few people outside of it's key demographic AND era would ever have gotten in to SBTB.<br/><br/>It wasn't ALL bad. Perhaps it's the nostalgia speaking. But some of the episodes had decent plots, and it had it's comedic moments. It's not the worst show out there by far. It doesn't however, stand the test of time. This is a niche show that only those with an appreciation for late 1980's/early 1990's styles and cheese could appreciate. Think of it like those drug PSA's from the same time frame. Many were just HORRIBLE, but you love to watch them because they're 1) Hilariously bad 2) Nostalgic 3) Both. I occasionally like to watch a SBTB rerun when I catch one. It was part of my youth, and it had it's moments. However, I wouldn't expect a young one nowadays to like it all all. And I understand that completely. I think they have better options on Nickelodeon and Disney Channel.<br/><br/>Now, the College Years I think was a much better show.

I, on the other hand, have seen every Saved by the Bell episode (note: not the lame New Class or College Years) at least several times over and it all began back in the wonderful year of 1992.<br/><br/>I had just started junior high that year and naturally after a long week of school, Saturday finally came. I would usually sleep until 11 and wake up in time for American Gladiators, but one Saturday morning I inadvertently woke up at 10 and caught a show and that show was Saved by the Bell. I was instantaneously hooked to that show and watched every episode up to the special graduation ceremony NBC aired on prime time T.V. In fact, in a junior high poll conducted that year about what students at my school defined as the most monumental moment in their lives. Yes, it was when Zach and the gang graduated high school.<br/><br/>The question that should be asked is why was I hooked and still hooked to Saved by the Bell. The story lines were never original and the jokes were never funny. (Example: When Jessie reveals her middle name to be Myrtle and Zach quips and says Myrtle is his turtle's name. ). And that kind of cornball joke was just the tip of the iceberg in a show that was inundated with not-funny jokes.

I've never really cared for the program; even as a child I could not quite understand the public's love of it. Watching the show as a kid, I was under the impression that the six main characters \"ran\" Bayside High School, with the faculty wrapped around their fingers. I never found the material to be that funny and I would raise an eyebrow at some of the plots' lack of realism. Returning to this show as an adult, I am no less baffled.<br/><br/>Please do not misunderstand, as I am all for nineties nostalgia. I grew up in that era. It only strikes me as odd that this program has survived into syndication along with its unsuccessful spin-off, while other worthy programs, such as 'Life With Louie,' 'California Dreams,' or 'Wonder Years' seem to have fallen by the wayside, occasionally revived but ultimately forgotten. I don't associate 'Saved By the Bell' with the good days of the nineties, as many others apparently do.<br/><br/>All I can really see is a show that appears to have been hurriedly put together without much thought with substandard performances by mediocre actors. Jokes delivered are often dead-pan and one-liners too often seem uncreative or not natural enough in their delivery. Compare the cast of SBTB's stilted performing with the almost flawless comedic work presented in the first two seasons of Nickelodeon's 'All That.' I don't doubt for a second that Josh Server, Kel Mitchell, and Lori Beth Demburg could wipe the television screen with Mark Paul Gosslar, Dustin Diamond, or Mario Lopez any day of the TV schedule's week, with the exact same material. OT, 'All That' is what I think of when I think of \"nineties nostalgia,\" not 'Saved By the Bell.'<br/><br/>But, its not just the actors or the dialogue... the whole show seems so removed from real life that it is hard to accept it as quality entertainment. I understand that television sitcoms need not be too concerned with being \"realistic\" as, say, 'Law and Order,' but how are we supposed to relate to characters who are but stereotypical caricatures of high school clique-members? They are almost always compelled to \"do the right thing,\" without ever questioning their actions. I am all for moralistic episodes, but in real life, when a kid finds a used \"joint\" in their school high school restroom, its no big deal and most likely they'll go on with their lives and stay the heck away from drugs, unlike Zack and Slater, who vow to hunt down the poor soul with the gall to smoke pot in their vicinity. None of the characters are relatable, nor does there seem to ever be a reasonable explanation for their actions.<br/><br/>For a person with severe depression or a person who is suffering great personal loss, 'Saved By the Bell' is a show for you, just like 'Full House' or 'Who's the Boss' is a show for you.

This was the teen soap from my generation that was originally picked up by the Disney Channel and started as 'Good Morning Miss Bliss,' which was set in an Indiana junior high school and followed five friends, their teacher Ms. Bliss (Haley Mills), principal Belding (Dennis Haskins), school administrator (T.K. Carter) and others. With the risk of being canceled, the show was given a face lift by setting the story in a California high school (Bayside High) and reworking some of the cast to become less focused on the teachers and more on the teenage cast, some of whom were also changed (Zach, Screech, and Lisa were part of the original cast). Then, the show was picked up by NBC, where it remained healthy for a number of years, before all of the actors got a little tired and disbanded.<br/><br/>'Saved by the Bell,' looking back on it now (and probably even realizing it as a kid) is an incredibly cheesy show, but it has other elements that gave it tremendous appeal. First, was the cast of teens. Mark Paul Gosselar played underachieving Zach Morris (who was not so underachieving in 'Good Morning Miss Bliss') and was a likely precursor to the headlining character, Parker Lewis, of the 1990 series, 'Parker Lewis Can't Lose' (although both may have been modeled on Ferris Bueler). (I admit that I was absolutely in love with this guy when I was a kid(. Zach's gang of friends also included his love interest, cheerleader Kelly Kapowski (Tiffany Theisen); feminist and brain Jessie Spano (Elizabeth Berkely); fashion minded (and appropriately Californian) Lisa Turtle (Lark Voohries); dimpled jock, Slater (Mario Lopez); and charming doofus, Screech (Dustin Diamond). It was not the first of its kind to have all the friends together in the same classes throughout their high school term, nor is it the first to have the principal follow them throughout that time, as well. When Saved by the Bell did change, it was made to look 100% American teenager, and that's exactly what it was. You could tell this just by watching the credits how generically it was framed.<br/><br/>Each episode followed the trials and tribulations of the six teens, usually involving some scheme cooked up by Zach Morris to get his way. They did have some original devices with the show, particularly moments where, prior to confrontation or much needed second thought, Zach Morris was able to call 'freeze,' and freeze frame everything while he addressed the audience. In a way, Zach Morris' ability to intentionally interact with the audience (one-way interaction, obviously, since we can't respond) also likely served as the precursor to Clarrisa Darling on 'Clarissa Explains it All.' We were living in Zach Morris' world, not just simply watching a bunch of high school students getting into mischief. Albeit the shows were incredibly corny looking back on them, they were still quite funny and often, entertaining, when I watched them as a kid (hey, not everything can maintain its appeal as you get older!).<br/><br/>The show, too, did take opportunity (usually in earlier episodes) to address certain issues such as drug addiction (in an episode where Jessie Spano, the do-it-all girl, gets hooked on something like speed and in a later episode where the gang befriends a young actor who invites them to smoke pot), although, come to think of it, this was the only controversial subject touched upon. The rest of the time was devoted to pure entertainment.<br/><br/>Then, the cast graduated, and they had several spin-offs. One was that of the gang heading to college, minus Elizabeth Berkley, who seemed to just want out of the show while, I imagine, others were waiting for some spotlight after the initial show ended (as did much of the craze). 'Saved By the Bell: The College Years,' to no surprise, however, did not last long. NBC also tried to cash in on the successes of the show by continuing with 'Saved By the Bell: The New Class' which was an undisguised attempt to merely replace all of the original characters with Zach Morris and the gang clones and replay another four years of teen high school mischief. Although this series fared slightly better than the College Years show, (keeping both Screech and Principal Belding in with Screech playing assistant principal) it did go through some cast changes before finally being cancelled. It even served in the same spot as the original show--eleven o'clock on Saturday mornings. Also, the success of Saved by the Bell lead to many unsuccessful attempts at similar shows that aired both on NBC (for quite a few years) and the USA Network. But nothing beats the original.

The bi-play of Allen and Richardson was perfect, which makes you glad her character was re-cast at the last minute.  It would be hard to imagine anyone else with better timing to play his wife.  But unfortunately at about the beginning of the 94-95 season, much of the writing and producing staff changed and the show suffered.  They managed to crank out a decent amount of good episodes the next couple of years, but after that, it plain and simple just didn't make me laugh anymore.  Bland scripts, with none of the earlier punch that the show had, took up the last few years, that mercifully ended in May of 99.  Hard to believe that Allen and Co. lasted almost a whole decade in our living rooms, but for me the loyal viewing ended about midway into the run.  Before the writing went in the standard sitcom direction, the show offered some of the funniest stuff I'd scene.  Allen's silly outlook on life, that included worshipping auto racers and football players, and living and dying with his tools and hot rods, was fodder for a lot of good episodes.  The kids were good in the mix, too, with Thomas being the real star of the 3, a good young actor with terrific delivery.  Bryan, though older, was a subpar performer, with dull line readings the entire run of the show.  And Smith sort of forgotten in the backround as the youngest son, doing neither good or bad with his part.  He was just kind of there, and turned into some kind of goth lover, wearing all black most of the time and dying his hair that same color.  Karn rounded out one of the better comedy teams as Allen's goody-goody assistant on his home improvement cable tv show.  The show itself introduced some unconventional teqniques, like the screen dropping cuts to the next scene, the use of bloopers in the final credits and the often heard but never seen neighbor, Hindman.  As Wilson, he usually offered up some sort of poetic advice which Allen would inadvertently twist and contort that would net an easy laugh.  There were also a pair of gorgeous \"tool girls\" that spiced up Allen's show, Pam Anderson and the stunning Debbe Dunning.  In catching up on the some of the years I missed thru re-runs, it seemed they introduced more of the extended family later on. Richardson's parents and sisters and Allen's brother's, one of which became a regular (O' Leary).  He actually ended up getting seperated from his wife at one point, and seemed to become a full time performer, but then had his role limited to guest shots.  Young Thomas left the show in his own, one year before the final season.  Citing that he wanted to concentrate on college, it was later revealed that he and Allen had a bad off-screen relationship.  Thomas didn't even turn up for the finale.  Tim's poker and tool shop buddies became more widely used on the show, though I could've done without the worthless, brain-dead moocher, Benny.  Everything came to a close as Al was married off to a frumpy millionaire and the family relocated to give Jill a chance at her dream job.  The final moment was a ridiculous shot of the family towing their house across water(!) so they wouldn't have to live without it.

The thing is that from season 2 on, Joey is not only stupid but also disgusting as far as it comes to women. There were several episodes where Playboy bunnies made an appearance and Joey is constantly talking about hot girls and even dismisses dark-haired girls as if they are less than blondes. It's disgusting and offensive. I'm sure the writers did all this to attract more male viewers but it reinforces the persistent notion in our society that a woman is only worthy if she's young, thin and blonde. Or exceptionally smart like Blossom, but Blossom's intelligence is never really explored again after Vinnie becomes her boyfriend. Suddenly, she spends all her time doing things with him, or getting into stupid fights with him. She becomes sarcastic and snarky.

I always liked the Tony story and his marriage to Shelley, although it would be very unlikely that 2 people who accidentally got married would actually fall in love with each other. As for Nick, I liked him in the beginning, he seemed really caring. But as the seasons went on, he turned out to be just an older version of Joey: hooking up with random 'babes' and becoming more and more of a caricature. Such a shame.

A top-tier fiction writer named Stephen Hunter over a long period of years penned a series of books about a character he created, one Bob Lee Swagger, a tall rangy ex-Gunnery Sergeant with a deep southern drawl, probably one of the greatest snipers on the planet, and a true American hero. (Some of the book reviews called Swagger \"the greatest\" American hero in modern fiction.) <br/><br/>2. The character was a surprise smash hit, much like the Bourne character in the popular series of movies was equally a \"surprise\" to his original creator.<br/><br/>3. Hunter was so overpowered by the strong response to Bob Lee that he actually tried to hobble his character through the series of later novels (Bob aged quickly, he was wounded, beaten, crippled, etc.). Hunter even tried to phase Bob Lee out completely and start a brand new series based on Bob Lee's son. None of that worked. His fans to this day still cannot get enough of Bob Lee. He is, and will always be, a wonderful read.<br/><br/>4. Hollywood came knocking but found the character as written did not fit their \"star mould.\" So Hollywood re-imagined the core story (from the first book in the series) with Bob Lee as a much younger, shorter, big city type hero, no accent, and cast Mark Wahlberg in the lead. The movie was a mild commercial success but fans of the original hated it and believed it could have been so much better if the original template had been followed.<br/><br/>5. This new TV series re-imagines the already-reimagined character from the Hollywood version. Now Bob Lee is very young and graceful, already married (not so in the book) and, as portrayed by Ryan Phillipe, something of a pretty boy and a smartass at the same time. Bob Lee's \"friend\" at the FBI, Nick Memphis, has also been re-imagined -- from a man to a woman. In other words, the current story and the characters driving this series are less about the original Stephen Hunter character, and more the kind of thing you would expect from focus groups. Clean. Politically correct. And just a little boring.<br/><br/>To be really clear -- there is nothing inherently wrong with trying to make something better, assuming of course you do not end up making it worse in the process. And that is the problem.<br/><br/>Assuming for example that the hit TV action series BANSHEE is currently the \"gold standard\" for a male-oriented action show, SHOOTER in contrast comes in weak on story, weak on writing, weak on casting, weak on acting, and weak on direction.<br/><br/>Even the music -- a constant drone through the entire first episode meant to convey suspense -- is annoying.<br/><br/>As I said, first reviews are usually one fan trying to hook another.<br/><br/>This is not one of those reviews.<br/><br/>This show might become better with age, like wine. But the omens and portents suggest otherwise.<br/><br/>_______________________________________________________<br/><br/>** REVIEWERS' ADDENDUM 12/28/16 **<br/><br/>Films and indeed film reviewers ultimately have to live in the real world. Revisiting my original review and the other critiques, I can see two opposing points of view forming. A large number of IMDb members (presumably other lifelong Swagger \"fans\") seemed to have agreed with my viewpoint. Another group seems to desperately want to look at the actual product solely on its own, and simply ask whether or not it meets minimum standards of entertainment (even though the plot arc for the whole season is already known if you read the book or saw the movie); and seem especially annoyed that we the viewers keep insisting on more...? If I didn't know better, I would venture that my original POV represents the \"populist\" position, ie, that fans who have supported the author and his character for decades actually DESERVE a production which respects their wants, hopes and aspirations. The other group seems to represent a more \"establishment\" POV saying, hey, the money guys, the guys who do the deals and make the decisions, went ahead with the safest and most politically-correct product, designed to appeal to everyone and yet offend no one, and most likely to appeal to the broadest audience in later syndication. And so maximize revenue. This is the way TV deals are made -- and who are YOU to suggest otherwise? Populists on one side. And the establishment on the other.

The later ones lost me as the author altered Bob Lee from a badaxe sniper to a John Grisham-style hero. His character, his story, his choice...I preferred the earlier Bob Lee.<br/><br/>So, any complaints about the transition from print to video automatically fail because in the book, Bob Lee was a *Vietnam* vet, meaning he'd be in his 60s at best. So, most will agree some things must change in order to keep it relevant to today's viewers. If we can accept that change, we should be able to accept other understandable changes from print.<br/><br/>Now, one point that keeps coming up is the pilot's scene between Bob Lee and the hunters, where he disdains the .223 round. Objectively, yes, it is an error...in the context of the scene it makes perfect sense. Bob Lee is insulting the choice of the hunter, essentially calling him clueless and instilling doubt in order to make his next actions easier. How these armchair warriors can mistake this seriously undermines their reviews. Did they not hear the sneering accusation about a Wal-Mart employee hosing the dentist on the purchase? The hunter is so inexperienced he buys his weapon at Wal-Mart...watch the scene again, and see if you think Bob Lee is being serious about the .223 caliber round.<br/><br/>There are factual inconsistencies...talking about the circumference of the human head which has nothing to do with how much target is available. Most are said in passing, easy to attribute to the flow of colloquial conversation. I'm sure *none* of us has ever used the wrong word a just assumed our listener will understand what we meant.<br/><br/>Now, the series isn't perfect; a big issue for me is Bob Lee's varying skill levels. In one fight, he gets his butt kicked and only survives because the Bad Guy decides getting shot by a bystander is too much of a risk. In another, he dominates several skilled assailants. Now, I don't want him to be Superman, but at least keep the skills in the same general vicinity.<br/><br/>The addition of wife and kid...sure, gives some extra avenues for Dramatic Tension, but for me, detracts from the overall story. Extra scenes devoted to them string the story out, give more minutes of run-time. Other than that, they add little to the story. Not to say they aren't interesting or worth watching, adding another layer, but I don't find them all that compelling.<br/><br/>Nadine Memphis...meh. Don't know why they decided to make her a black female, but it doesn't make huge difference in how the story plays out.<br/><br/>So, all in all, if you're a fan of action and intrigue, this series is worth a watch. You may love it, you may hate it, but it should keep you interested. The acting is solid, the writing is much better than the average, and the pacing is done fairly well.

Even the 2nd top rated review is an entire rant about other reviews!!<br/><br/>After this (big) introduction, I'm going to talk about the ACTUAL SHOW:<br/><br/>I'm a fan of smart stories about spies, conspiracies, victims, smart plots and smart characters.

This is the least you can expect about characters working for intelligence, special ops and FBI, right?<br/><br/>The characters have no big complexity yet: They almost seem like good or bad. The good ones are politically correct, classical \"hero\" character. We could say that bad ones have a bit more complexity, but that's not exploited yet.<br/><br/>Main thing about this show remembers me to Inception. You need to be pretty awake to watch this and notice all the complexity and well developed script. It has a lot of details and you can go back 10 seconds to watch \"that\" again and think \"wow, they really thought about this\".<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying this plot, it's smart and it gives you more than enough each chapter to feel like you didn't waste time with filler plots (more on the contrary!) but leaving enough answers for future development and maintaining the interest.<br/><br/>The plot changes are unexpected, at least for someone like me who lets himself to be drawn by the story and enjoys it without prejudices.<br/><br/>8/10 at least for sure.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "77 out of 117 found this helpful.", "date": "30 November 2016"}, {"title": " on target", "content": "The show is a lot slower than the movie, but this has its bonuses, such as character development, and having a chance to get to know the players better.The cast all did a fine job, and the slight changes from the movie give it a new feel all of its own.I really think they have set a base where the show can go in many different directions, and a more open story line than the movie.

It will be interesting to see if they can maintain the suspense and action for 10 or so episodes. Sure, perhaps nine out of ten is too high a rating, but clearly there were haters out there slating this pilot and giving it two or three stars which is just unfair.

The little girl is excellent as well. Casting is everything. I am still not convinced about the lead of FBI agent (Isaac Johnson) role. New face, but in TV that face needs to convince the audience immediately they are who they are. All to say when his scenes take place, I disconnect just a bit. Same with Ryan Phillippe. I wasn't sold on him, but he plays the role as needed. I think because they play the Bourne movies non-stop, I/we are tired of Mr Everything, the persona of someone who is a rebel (detached from his core unit) but super skilled in every way, able to out think law enforcement at will, a McGyver ability to escape any place at any time.

Still, as a lover of the 80's this show is a must-watch for me. Too bad it's on the more pathetic TNN (WE GOT POP!!) but I tolerate it. Also, Don Johnson's current hit \"Nash Bridges\" is good, too.

This brings back memories.<br/><br/>One of the seminal TV shows of the 80's it is sadly remembered more for it's style, music and fashion content than anything else. Which is unfair as it was also brilliantly acted. Then there is the scream of it's being \"unrealistic\" due to the fact the cops are wearing armani designer lables and driving a ferrari...WHOLY wrong. The characters are supposed to be undercover cops posing as drug dealer playboys. To have them driving a ford and wearing second hand costumes and cop uniforms would be unrealistic as drug dealers tend be very stylish and showing off thier wealth like a peacok. Urgo the Organised Crime Buerau Vice unit have to fit in. Ussually well written (irellevant of if or not it's the first two seasons gritty realism or the remaining three seasons which were more formulaic).<br/><br/>Season One started off with a pilot that is extrememly lame. And indeed while enjoyable the earlier episodes which followed weren't up to much either. But then along with the (shock) death a lead character early in the season and a new theme tune the show found it's foot. Thanks to the American viewing public for sticking by the show in it's developmental stage. Once Season 1 gets going properly it's a rollercoaster ride of spills and thrills which looked flashy and also delivered plot and characters that kept your attention. Best Episdoe: \"Hit List\" (aka: Caulderone's Return Part 1). Worst Episode: \"Give A Little Take A Little\".<br/><br/>Season 2 is more of the same really. Characters are developed more but the plotlines and style remain the same. Best Episode: \"Definitley Miami\". Worst Episode: \"Tale Of The Goat\".<br/><br/>Season 3 Shows an definite change of tact for the show. But it works incredibly well and is IMHO the best of the lot. The actors have grown into their characters by this point and can make them totally convincing and sympathetic. The voilence is as action packed and sizling as ever. And the look on Don Johnson's face when his ferrari Daytona gets destroyed is an amazingly comical moment. Best Episode: Too may to choose from really but Johnson's sanity slipping on a case in \"Shadows In The Dark\" is amazing stuff up there with Pacino and DeNiro in the acting stakes \"Forgive Us Our Debts\" comes a very close second. Worst Episode: \"Viking Bikers From Hell\".<br/><br/>Season 4 is the least of the bunch. The stories try to return to a more realistic style but fail totally in their delivery. There are a few good moments but for the most part the stories get very boring. Also someone had the bright idea to cancel Miami Vice and slip a new show called \"The Adventures Of Sonny Crockett\" on in it's place. In this new show where Crockett and Tubbs were equal partners in the show and the rest of the OCB crew were FAR more than extras who had plenty to bring to the table. in this season we're greeted to a show where Tubbs is reduced to nothing more than a sidekick and the rest of the the OCB are also rans with the exception of some very poor filler episodes. Best Episode: \"Mirror Image\". Worst Episode: Too many to choose from but \"Death And The Lady\" is the lowest of the low with only a memorable guest appearence by Paul Guifoyle (sp?) Better known nowadays as Brass in C.S.I.  playing a seriously weird villian.<br/><br/>Season 5 is my second fave season after Year 3. Everyone is back on a level playing field again as \"The Adventures Of Sonny Crockett\" are canned after one season and Miami Vice returns. Jan Hammer takes his music with him to pastures new but Tim Truman arrives with some amazing and atmospheric work for the season that I personally consider to be the best of the bunch when it comes to the music. The realism is out the window with the producers realising that the previous years \"high drama\" approach had been a complete failure it was time to make sure the final year was a hard hitting full on gunfest. There are OCCASIONAL breaks from this with a couple of comedy episodes \"The Lost Maddonna\" works brilliantly with Micheal Chiles -I THINK that's his name- from The Shield playing a New York art detective in a genuinley amusing episode. However \"Miracle Man\" is dire beyond words and is actually painfull to watch making it the worst MV episode. There is some effective character work in there too and the plots while aiming towards a big finish still come across well. The first episode resumes where Season 4 finished with Crockett suffering amnesia believing he really IS a drug dealer and putting on a brilliant \"villian\" performance. The cliff hanger ending ot the season opener is IMHO the BEST TV cliffhanger ever shown with Crockett (still on planet memory loss) and Tubbs going at it. The story arc is resolved in the seasons best offering \"Redemption In Blood\". The rest of the season focuses on the other members of the OCB and makes it obvious Crockett is burned out with it only being a matter of time before he either quits the Police Force or gets himself killed. Thankfully the show saw sense to finish while it was ahead and while the final story \"Freefall\" does not have a great plot the story OOZES in atmosphere and has a sense of farewell to it that is brilliantly realised in the final scene where Crockett and Tubbs bid each other farewell. Best Episode: \"Redemption In Blood\". Worst Episode: \"Miracle Man\".<br/><br/>Maybe one day people will remember the show for the reasons it deserves more than the style and the music.

The series was filmed on location in Miami,Florida.<br/><br/>This show was one of NBC's Biggest Hits of the mid-1980's and it continued to remained so until the end of the decade. This show was a Friday Night Institution for five years of its run(1984-1989)and it went up against some tough competition including several shows that consisted of \"Dallas\",\"Falcon Crest\",and others not to mention the newsmagazine \"20/20\",which was the prime-time lineup for Friday nights. The pulse and rhythm of a glamorous resort city of Miami,Florida was the juxtaposed against the seamy haunts of the drug underworld in this gritty action series,which made heavy use of rock music backgrounds and music video effects,not to mention some of the most violent content ever conceived for television happened on this show since it was shown later on Friday nights at the 10:00 hour. Sonny Crockett(Don Johnson)was a rough-edged Miami vice detective who lived on a sailboat called \"St. Vitus' Dance\",that was guarded by his dyspeptic pet alligator,Elvis,named after the singer Elvis Presley. Ricardo Tubbs(Philip Micheal-Thomas)was a black ex-New York street cop who had to come South to find the drug dealer who murdered his brother. They were an unlikely but effective team,working undercover on the flashy Gold Coast and down the seedy alleyways that made the city of Miami such a city of contrasts. Often they sped around town in Sonny's black Ferrari-Spider sports car(which was later upgraded to a state-of-the-art Ferrari Testarossa,custom-made just for the show). Lt. Castillo(Edward James-Olmos)was their moody superior,and Gina(Saundra Santiago)and her partner detective Trudy(Olivia Brown)were a hip female undercover team,while the other team consisted of Stan(Michael Talbott)and Larry(John Diehl)became the conventional backup.<br/><br/>The stylish,MTV-influenced series(music by rock composer Jan Hammer)was a smash hit that the show itself was one of the top-ten shows in the Nielsens for the first three seasons of its five year run,and was Emmy nominated twice,and transformed struggling actor Don Johnson into a major sex symbol,and made Philip Micheal-Thomas,who was an unknown actor at the time with several movies to his credit,became the heartthrob of fans.especially the women during the mid-1980's. It was also around the time the show was on the air,the soundtrack to the television series,Miami Vice,composed by Jan Hammer became a huge hit,and it was from the album that the show's theme song went on to win both the AMA(American Music Awards),and the Grammy for best instrumental score. <br/><br/>Getting to the character of Sonny Crockett,played by Don Johnson was an rough looking but cool as a cucumber with his expensive pastel sports jacket worn over a T-shirt,with stubbly beard,no socks,and an angry scowl started a fashion trend for those who were into the macho/grubbly look. Female characters on the show fawned over him-and usually got blown up or shot for their trouble. His partner,Ricardo Tubbs was the opposite,a clean cut individual who was always armed with weapons for any situation that came up and usually sometimes to bail Crockett outta a tight problem with some vicious murderer or ruthless drug lord. As for Crockett himself,he was a divorce widow who estranged wife and son were rarely seen,and later a quickie bride player by singer Sheena Easton appeared in several infrequently segments,occasionally as Caitlin Davies(for that one season during the 1987-1988 season)in the show's third season.<br/><br/>This hip-series attracted many famous celebrities,who were normally seen in TV acting roles to do cameos roles. This show had singers from the 1950's(Little Richard,Chuck Berry),the 1960's(James Brown,Eric Clapton),the 1970's(Patti LaBelle),the 1980's-a lot of music from that decade(Phil Collins,Tina Turner,Journey,Ted Nugent,Neil Young,Peter Gabriel,Gloria Esteban to rap groups like The Fat Boys and others)that really influenced this show.

It quite obvious the best season of Miami Vice is the first season. Season one was the season where Vice really focused all it's episodes in real life situations. Situations which really happen in real life. Vice started with a bang with the excellent pilot episode, and it never looked backed for the next 22 episodes. Season one was everything that made Mimai Vice what it is now. Action, drama, intensity, thrills , music, style, and relationships. One episode that features all this, is Calderone's Return- Part 1 and 2. Two really fantastic episodes. Other great episodes of season 1 are The Great McCarthy, Little Prince, Milk Run, I can go on and on. One truly classic season. <br/><br/>As good as Season 2 was and it was good, it doesn't compare to Season 1. The problem with season 2, is the show focusing on bizarre situations such as voodoo, satanism, and other weird stuff. Season 2 featured three episodes that I consider awful. Whatever Works, Tale of the Goat, and Bushido. Three episodes that season 1 would of never of thought of making. Even though I don't like these episodes, I still consider season 2 a very good season. It just doesn't even come close to the flawless season 1. I do think though that season 2 features the greatest Miami Vice episode of all time which is The Prodigal Son. A well directed, very entertaining Vice episode that features lots of action, drug busts, romance, and totally awesome 80's music. Your not a real Vice fan if you don't like The Prodigal Son.<br/><br/>It's sad to say, out of all five seasons of Vice, only the first two seasons defy what Miami Vice was and are the only two seasons that really kick Miami Vice ass!! Season 3 became more of a darker Vice that took away everything that made the first two seasons such a highly entertaining show. Gone was the pastel background colors, snappy pop tunes, and Crocketts famous look that made him an icon among men and his fast wheeling car. Dark broody colors were replaced in the background, the music was replaced with unknown artists, and Crockett looked more like a banker/rock star, and his beloved Spider Ferrari was replaced with a Testarossa. Which was blown up in the season premiere of season 3 When Irish Eyes are Crying.<br/><br/>Season 3 took out all the fun and excitement of the first two seasons and replaced it with a more darker depressing Miami Vice. The outcome, ratings dropped, and the show was not Miami Vice that everyone fell in love with. I think the problem lies with the shows producer John Nicolla, who left and was replaced by Dick Wolf who probably was never in favor of the pastel energetic Mimai Vice of the first two seasons. So if anyone is to blame of Vice's downfall, it's Dick Wolf. Creator also of the lame Law and Order series. <br/><br/>I have nothing to say about seasons 4 or 5 except that was this really Miami Vice the show that was unlike any other in the history of television.

Prior to Miami Vice, TV was simply a medium of hardly little value, not to mention hardly any budgets, Miami Vice would change all that from the Armani suits to the sports cars, their influence identified with more like movie making than TV, and it's filming angles were spectacular, from Calderon falling head back into the pool after being shot, to Switek finding Larry all alone in the shower after Larry refused to sign over his boxer to the mob!.

Before Miami Vice came along procedurals would usually show cops as overweight, pudgy guys wearing ill-fitting suits (like in Hawaii Five-O, Kojak and Dragnet) or as incorruptible blue centurions in uniform (as in Hill Street Blues or Police Story) who were straight up god fearing boy scouts who did their job and nothing else. Shows about cops tended to be mechanical, with cops going about their daily, almost boring routines when it came to solving things like murders, robbery and such; undercover cops in these shows tended to look like street winos with their ragged clothes and even worse hair.<br/><br/>But when Miami Vice came along it changed everything. Essentially a show that focused on the drug war that engulfed (and still continues) Miami in the 1980's, this show turned the normally plodding police procedural up on its ear. The series centers on tough but sensitive Detective Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) and his suave, streetwise partner Ricardo Tubbs (Phillip Michael Thomas). Gone were the ill-fitting cheap suits that cops of yesteryear wore, Crockett and Tubbs were handsome, hip and wore the best designer suits drug money could buy as well as having high powered speedboats and Ferrari sport cars as their vehicles of choice when it came to nabbing the bad guys. Miami Vice was also one of the first TV shows that had a cool, synthesizer rock score (courtesy of Jan Hammer) and regularly included the latest pulse pounding music by the original artists as part of its score. Vibrant pastel colors replaced the usual boring earth tones of other cop shows to the point where the series was actually responsible for the art deco renaissance of Miami Beach. It was also one of the first TV shows to have a series finale and their guns were always state of the art.<br/><br/>Despite their stylish clothes and fast lifestyle, there was a substance to the characters of Miami Vice that very few mainstream TV shows could match back then- both Crockett and Tubb's relationships with their women and their families, while looking fast and trendy from the outside almost always ended up in tragedy as the series wore on, by the end of the series both men were burned out that the whole show ended up as a microcosm of America's never-ending and ultimately futile War on Drugs; the constant betrayals of their friends and the ubiquitous corruption both within the police force and the courts and politicians ultimately took its toll. As the show finished its five year run, it went from hip and zany to nihilistic and dark; much like the wave of popular opinion as the cheerful Eighties turned into the cynical Nineties.<br/><br/>While never a ratings superstar and despite only lasting five seasons, the influence of Miami Vice lives on in the countless other TV shows that have been shown since then.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "8 out of 11 found this helpful.", "date": "4 September 2011"}, {"title": " Vice is back", "content": "After much thought and years of watching all the seasons, I am gonna go against the grain and say that Season 3 is the best of the 5. I liked the darker atmosphere (in plot, music, lighting, clothing and tone). A favorite of mine is\"Shadow in the Dark\", where Crockett starts to lose it while tracking down a serial killer. Next in line would be season 2, Vice had really found what works from Season one and went with it full throttle. Season one would be third. I don't hate season 4 and 5 as much as everyone else, but it is the season that jumped the shark with Crocketts amnesia...and Tubb's beard, hated that beard. I quite enjoyed the episode \"Death and the Lady\". Another reviewer thought it was the worst ep ever, but I enjoyed the dark tone and the guest actors were top notch, plus they played not one but TWO Depeche Mode songs (my fave band)!!!! Season 5 is the season that I have seen the least. I need to go back and watch that again. I didn't like how Sonny started wearing jeans and a leather jacket, however that is how Don Johnson initially wanted to portray Crockett when he was cast in 84. It was symbolic though of Crocketts deteriorating state of mind. Also, the tone changed drastically with a new composer for the music, Tim Truman. Not bad, just different.<br/><br/>Coming soon is the film version of Miami Vice with Colin Farrell as Crockett and Jamie Foxx as Tubbs. Bad casting. A great choice for Crocket would be Josh Holloway who plays the bad boy on the island in the new show \"Lost\".

It was the hottest and newest thing back then. Yes, those detectives looked somewhat dandy and silly at times, with their designer clothes, but they did look COOL as well.<br/><br/>Miami Vice was special, but I dont wanna argue that it is special enough to be watched by young viewers, who have never seen it before. It is very enjoyable to look back on though for the 40 plus generation. It is not only nostalgia though, because Miami Vice aged rather well. I still get thrilled watching it. That is to say, I get thrilled by SOME episodes. There are many rather average ones among them as well.<br/><br/>What made Miami Vice special, was the use of popular music as a soundtrack. That hadnt been done before. MTV was just new back then and for the first time visuals started to matter for musicians and bands. Miami Vice's style looked like a contineous video clip, with stunning photography and lots of cool poses accompanied by popular eighties artist's music. Artists, the greatest among them, lined up to have their music played on the series.<br/><br/>Everything that later turned into excellence in director Michael Mann's feature movies, can already be found in the Miami Vice tv series: the feeling of isolation during the nights on the streets of American cities has so vividly been captured in many great Michael Mann movies later on. There is something about Michael Mann's style of direction that oozes a spirit of cool and desolation. That spirit made those series so irresistable and thrilling to watch, with the whole family. Yes, everybody watched it, from granny to young kids!<br/><br/>Many Imdb reviewers advice to watch the first seasons. I would recommend that as well, starting with the 90 minutes pilot episode, which is really good.

A great TV show defines it.", "content": "Love it or loathe it, ridicule it, or (like me) be a lifelong fan of \"Miami Vice\"... this is the show which defined the 80s like few other cultural phenomena of its time.<br/><br/>I am currently in the process of, well, binge-watching as they now call it, the five-season complete box set, from beginning to end. And I have to say that \"Vice\", even if you've seen practically every episode, is still always a time capsule of the good old days that is without comparison. Even after the tenth time that you've watched certain episodes, even if you've memorized most of the dialogues, you can't escape the pull of Miami Vice. It draws you in, into the world of 80s cool and chic, with all the clothes, cars, music, and (on- and off screen) high rollers of the day.<br/><br/>The 80s never looked this sleek, this glitzy and fancy before, and certainly never again. Many crime dramas and other types of TV fiction in the 80s deserve a rightful place in the chapter of pop culture that was the decade. From Magnum P.I. to the A Team, or even Dallas, even Dynasty by some measure. But none of them quite had what \"Miami Vice\" so groundbreakingly exploded onto TV screens with when it first aired in 1984. I wasn't even a teenager yet at the time, but I remember from watching the first few episodes (on a black and white 12-inch TV in my bedroom, no less) that this show was just in a class of its own. Even on a dinky black and white screen. Stunning scenery, a style of filming that was just unseen and unheard of on television, and actually, pretty terrific storytelling, although that is often considered a weak point of the show.<br/><br/>What's true enough is that the whole package began to come apart at the seams somewhere midway into season 3. Most TV shows have inevitably, and therefore forgivably used up most of their best story lines after the first few seasons and then gradually just stay in it to milk the franchise that has been created. But Miami Vice, once the greatest thing since color TV, really started taking a nosedive from that point. The gradual departure of the show's original personnel, including most unfortunately Michael Mann, was sorely felt. Initially, the darker, grittier feel of season 3 was not such a bad thing. Even in the absence of all the lightheartedness of seasons one and two, some episodes had quite outstanding story lines and were beautifully shot. And that even though a closed-cabin sports coup\u00e9 like the Ferrari Testarossa never quite felt right as a replacement for a convertible like the Daytona... in tropical southern Florida.<br/><br/>Missing the point that viewers weren't turning away because of the earth tones used in the visuals of season three but by a deteriorating quality of the aforementioned whole package, season four saw a return to pastels, but a departure from everything else that had made the show such a success. Desperately attempting to regain its former splendor, season five wasn't all that bad, but on the bottom line, it was a different show done by different people. The saddest part was perhaps that production values were visibly cut back. From scrimpingly outfitted action scenes to scenes supposedly shot in third world countries but which just screamed Universal Studios back lot, and for which they didn't even, like before, bother sending a camera crew to some two-shed town in rural Florida anymore. A fate which similarly befell shows like Dallas in their latter years, by the way.<br/><br/>Saying that all this was Dick Wolf's fault for running the show into the ground when he took over creative control of Miami Vice would be looking back in anger. What is sad though is that quite likely, Miami Vice would have just had to stick with its self-invented formula from seasons one and two and could have perpetuated that \"package\" well into the 1990s, after all a decade during which hedonism and conspicuous and often illicit wealth only just began to go full throttle. <br/><br/>The bitter irony is that a show which had clothes fashion, as well as music, car, lifestyle an even gun and power boat fashions so deeply ingrained in its own DNA ultimately proved to be a fashion fad in and of itself.<br/><br/>Still, if you ask anybody what they remember most vividly about 80s culture, or what their image of 80s culture is, somewhere between the mention of (literally) brick sized cell phones, hedonistic yuppies, shoulder pads and hair metal, the words \"Miami Vice\" will come up as one of the defining moments of 80s pop culture. And that is something that can never be taken away.

This is a very different Mason. But is it really? They say this version is crude and unsophisticated and definitely not a gentleman. Raymond Burr's performance as Mason was flawless, and we all loved him. That's why we're here, watching and critiquing. Burr gave the character so much depth without us knowing much about his life outside and before the courtroom. Burr's Mason was a serious man who seemed to be in pain. Haunted.<br/><br/>Don't you want to know why he's haunted? Why is justice and the truth everything to him? Was he just born in a suit? Of course not. So how did he become that man? Rhys' Mason swears, he has sex, he lives in the dark sides of life. But no matter how dark these sides may be, they are still, like the original, on the side of justice. He's asked, \"Why are you digging so hard?\" Mason answers, \"Because she's innocent...it's the way I play the game.\" Isn't this the essence of the original Mason? Matthew Rhys' performance is outstanding. For me, he is the younger Mason that we all met in the original. And he's really interesting.<br/><br/>I'm glad HBO and this show's creators asked that question, who was Mason as a younger man? What made him who he is in the original?

At the eleventh hour, it suddenly gained a multi-episode narrative that finished off with a Game of Thrones-esque cliffhanger, and suddenly it became a strange, if not interesting departure from the formulaic sitcom it made itself out to be.<br/><br/>Season 2 picks up right where they left off, and not only kept the narrative, but proved that it also gained a personality somewhere along the way.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love the first season. The plots are endearing, it's easy to binge, it's nice to look at, and the world is interesting. Is it Game of Thrones? No. Do I want it to be Game of Thrones? Absolutely no. When I see Futurama in medieval times, I want it to be Futurama in medieval times.<br/><br/>Futurama and The Simpsons are meant to be \"soup of the day\" shows, and people enjoy that. Some people have enjoyed that for 30 years. It's situational antics and shameless social commentary, and that junk is candy for the eyes and ears of your average viewer, myself included. What makes Disenchantment different from Futurama or the Simpsons (apart from only having 20 episodes so far, and a season-long plot, to boot) however, is the fact that both of those programs don't have a main character that lives to make an important statement.<br/><br/>I love Bean and everything she stands for. She's meant to not only be someone who rocks the proverbial boat (especially given the medieval-fantasy setting of the show), but someone who is pained, confused, complex, strong and often has valid points to make; shes a real person. She's a great character. And while I love how Homer Simpson can have a heart sometimes, I really love how Bean has a heart all of the time. She can be mean and she can make mistakes, but she can also learn, care about things deeply, and throw a punch at someone who wrongs her. I think that's someone that a lot of people secretly wish they could be.<br/><br/>The second season has a lot of heart, made me frustrated a lot, probably ended episodes rather abruptly at times but still managed to be really interesting story-wise, and develops the characters nicely to the point where I want season 3 to premier yesterday.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "79 out of 101 found this helpful.", "date": "20 September 2019"}, {"title": " Stop!", "content": "Stop reviewing a show based on half an episode and acting like u can develop a world in 10 mins!

Technically, the show is first rate, with good animation and art design. The premise and the characters are pretty original, making the show not feel like a clone of any past TV shows. The show is certainly not boring, and is somewhat amusing at times.<br/><br/>However, \"somewhat amusing\" is about as funny as the show gets. The humor of the show lacks significant comic jabs to make it truly laugh-out-loud funny. The show seems to be content to move along with an amiable attitude instead of really trying to be hilarious. There are other problems with the writing as well. The creators of the show seem to be having difficultly moving from a 22 minute episode format to a longer version; you can really feel some blatant padding at times, especially with the first episode of the show. Also, the show is very slow in explaining details of the characters and situation at times. For example, Bean's half-brother is not clearly identified or given a chance to speak until about halfway through the show's first ten episodes.<br/><br/>This is not a bad show, but currently it's not reaching its full potential. It's possible the writers will manage to improve things should the show be renewed. Until then, I would say give the show a chance by watching the first three episodes.

Future seasons could tell an amazing story that will set out in a world that could be quite expansive and deep and thrilling, while remaining funny and interesting. At least that is what they set up for themselves.<br/><br/>The season starts off sort of slow, which personally I like. It introduces us to the characters and gets us familiar with them while providing good entertainment, showing their strengths and weaknesses, adding detail to the part of the world that we are in, and setting up storylines.<br/><br/>I'm personally glad that they stayed in the kingdom for as long as they did, I feel connected to the Kingdom and will feel for whatever happens to it. The main trio is expanded upon marvelously. Especially Elfo and Beane as we see what makes them, them. They have flaws and character quirks, but they have beauty in them. They feel like what characters should feel like. They are neither perfect, nor are they completely useless. Lucy also gets a surprising amount of development. Even the King gets developed as the season comes to an end, which I enjoyed.<br/><br/>Chekhov's Gun is in full effect which I enjoy, as characters are rarely discarded outright making the kingdom feel alive and interconnected.<br/><br/>Overall I would say don't worry about people saying that it starts out slow, this isn't a movie, this is a series that should stay for a long time. This first season brought us into this world and gave us a shovel. It didn't waste ten episodes by running all around and barely scraping over everywhere. We have places to explore, people to meet, and a home to come back to that will be familiar and loved.<br/><br/>In the end the ball is in the Creators' court.

It's hard to find a review that doesn't mention or compare it to his earlier work (And inevitably I will do so too). But people are being unfair, illogical and overestimating the current comedy prowess of the veteran crew around Matt.<br/><br/>It makes no sense to compare Disenchantment to the golden age of the Simpsons, which lies more than 2 full decades in the past now. Nor to compare it to Futurama, which has been off the air for years now and that includes the revival, which was mostly build out of archived leftovers from the initial run hence why the revival was still top notch material.<br/><br/>If you want to compare Disenchantment to something compare it to the last few Simpons seasons. Last one I saw was season 24 and that was already an atrocity so I can only imagine what depths they should have reached by now. Point here is: what was anybody still expecting here? that Matt and co would reinvent themselves after they've been unable to do so for years?<br/><br/>Another major point in why a comparison is approaching disenchantment the wrong way is because it's clearly trying to be something different. There's a serialized narrative, a longer format, some mystery to the plot, a new painting-like art style (for backgrounds) and little segments here and there that seem to have a different purpose than straight up comedy, something that supports the idea that Disenchantment might not be intended or at least envisioned as a purely comedic effort.<br/><br/>And herein lies the fatal flaw that impairs Disenchantment. It plays it way too safe. It doesn't fully embrace the new direction and misses on potential opportunities. disenchantment could have been crafted as a full blown adventure series, with a hefty dose of classic Simpsons comedy injected. There's a rule in comedy: the less grounded in reality your fictional creation is the harder you'll have to try to be funny. It's why series like family guy have to go way over the top while things like veep and curb your enthusiasm can keep it simple and still be funny. The idea is that making your comedy series more real creates potential to have impactful emotions beyond just those derivated from comedy. More grounded comedy series can instill for example fear, tension, sadness, melancholy etc. So in my opinion they should have shifted Disenchantment along the comedic spectrum in the opposite direction from where it is has gone now. Could have been something Avatar:TLA alike but with maturer comedy but now it's just Futurama in middle-earth.<br/><br/>Which leaves us with only the comedic aspect as a potential selling point. And by now you've guessed it: it's simply not funny enough. Like another reviewer stated: Disenchantment seems to be content with being just amiable instead of being genuinely funny. I made it to the sixth episode. By then it came clear that there wasn't much novelty to disenchantment in general, they weren't really committed to the concept of serialization and this sixth episode was particularly unfunny. <br/><br/>I'll give you an example of a joke from one of the first scenes of said episode (though it might not translate very well by just typing it out): The 3 main characters Bean, Luci and Elfo are playing a drunken game of guessing who the other is impersonating. <br/><br/>When it's Elfo's turn he simply says: I'm Elfo.\nLuci reacts: Hmmm, I know this one, (keeps thinking aloud for a few lines), I wanna say Schmelfo?\nElfo replies: No! It's me, Elfo!<br/><br/>........sigh.<br/><br/>This sort of comedy level feels like watching one of those many third-rate short-lived stoner comedies on adult swim nobody's heard of or watches. Or like going to an amateur improv comedy night.

I am glad that Rick &amp; Marty Lagina decided to undertake the ''mystery'' of this island with the kind of equipment to try to accomplish something along with the know-how to operate this equipment however, due to the structure of the island, I honestly don't believe they'll uncover everything they hope to. In my opinion, most of the island is not naturally formed. I do believe there was a small island in the beginning, but that original existing island was built up, out, and around over time to build this pit &amp; truly be able to bury or hide??? I cannot see how the original ''Money Pit'', as it's now known as, could have been built to the depth it is unless the island was structured around it. Along with the depth of the pit, all of the flood water booby traps as well could not have built unless the island was built up by layers. The ''Lagoon'', as it's referred to, is another detail of the island which I cannot see as being natural. The fact that there are so many flood water traps at located at several levels in the pit clearly indicates to me that the island had to be built up in layers. In the episode showing the dye test which located several openings which the dye flowed out of into the surrounding water, in my opinion, clearly indicates that the island had to be ''DESIGNED &amp; structured'' by someone. Yes, I'll agree that it could be possible that if &amp; when the pit might have been dug, these water channels could've been discovered &amp; their effluents or outflow channels &amp; openings might've been enlarged to create these traps however, I honestly believe it would be extremely tricky to successfully dig a hole that deep with all of these ever present openings. With the island being 36ft. above sea level (I'm guessing the top of the pit is a few feet below that) &amp; with theories saying the pit could be 200ft.deep, the water pressure from the ocean would be approx. 72psi (200ft. minus 34ft. equals 166ft. X .433 = + or - 72psi). Even at depths of 90ft. which had previously dug down to, the pressure would be around 23-24psi. With my 20 some years of experience working in the water treatment &amp; distribution field, I know that only 23psi is enough pressure to break open an already present &amp; weak mud/sand opening to an extremely free-flowing channel of water. To me, all of these details seems to make it nearly impossible (anything's possible) for people to have successfully dug a pit so deep into an existing island. When they discovered what appeared to be an obvious man-made opening in the ''lagoon'' was the 1st yet final detail that clinched it for me that the island had to have been built up around the pit. Will anything of any significance ever be found? Besides the occasional coin, bones, more coconut fiber, and timbers, , , ,I don't see how.

Why would anyone go through all that trouble when you could just bury it 6 ft down so you can easily get it later. Or maybe, don't bury it at all. Spend it you idiots!

That is no small feat, for any team, let alone one man. Such dedication and commitment is truly inspiring. And among other things, this show has at least done that man justice, in the form of bringing his life's work to a fair level of public attention. Can you imagine for a moment, what it must feel like, at the age of 90+ years, to have determined people like the Lagina brothers come to the place you have worked on for so many years, and finally have the means to help you really try to further your work, and bring it to the public eye? Just think about that for a second. Dan Blankenship lived there, Oak Island was his life.<br/><br/>Here we are in the age of information and smartphones and 30 second attention spans. I am 31 years old, and it's truly astounding to think that this man has spent more time trying to solve the Oak Island mysteries than I have spent being alive. And the Lagina brothers have very obviously been good friends to him, and numerous others who have worked on the island, and lost friends and family of their own. If you stop whining about the show long enough to look closely when Dan is in an episode, you can see that Rick and Marty go out of their way to bring anything they find directly to his hands so that he can examine it, and be a part of a potentially important discovery. I was raised to respect my elders, and hard work. And I find those scenes to be very touching. Because you can see the emotions on Dan's face, and that's real. Even the History Channel editors cannot take that from him. Even near the end of his life, that man got to witness possibly the most important thing to anyone who's worked that hard for anything could wish for; some people caring enough not just to tell his story and the story of others, but to include him in the process.<br/><br/>The Lagina brothers have done the late Mr. Blankenship a great honor, with their own dedication and hard work, and most of all, the extreme expenses necessary to do what they have done. Millions of dollars spent to try and solve this puzzle. They come off as very kind people, very genuine, and family oriented. Seeing as they have found many ways to include young Alex Lagina in the work along side them. Rick is certainly the more fact and results oriented treasure hunter here. He's always the first one to look at anything they find with all important scrutiny. Found an old crusty spike in the swamp? Ok, good, Rick might say. But it cost a small fortune to get permissions to drain that swamp and excavate it, and bring experts out to search it. Before he gets all excited about a guy with a metal detector suggesting it may have come off a Spanish Galleon, he wants it sent off to experts. He has a real level of calculating intelligence to him. As much as a man can muster under the title of \"treasure hunter.\"<br/><br/>I respect the Lagina brothers for what they have done, truly. Many people would do anything to be able to do the things they have. Especially Dan Blankenship. So, it's a little bothersome to me to read some of the negative things said about the Lagina brothers and their team, and especially about Dan. That's really not fair to them. These people have worked harder, and dreamed about doing the things done on that show, longer than most of us have been alive. Not to mention spent more money on their dreams than many of us will ever possess in our lifetimes. Have some respect. If you can't spend your hard earned money on chasing your dreams, what's the point?<br/><br/>Now, the show. And The History Channel... the ONLY reason I give this show 9/10 stars. Before this summer I didn't have access to cable TV for about six years. I didn't know this show ever existed. I guess you could say I sort of lived under a rock. I did read a book several years ago, titled \"Riptide,\" which was a fictional thriller, based upon the Oak Island treasure. It was a good read, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that a show about the actual island had been airing since 2014. Between Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, I have binge watched every episode in every season, and watched the the first of Season 7 live. Which prompted me to say all this. Because, clearly, when you watch it without having to suffer through commercials, and the BS network that airs the show, it's much more bearable.<br/><br/>It's also WELL worth pointing out how shocking it is to see what The History Channel has been reduced to... I agree with every single negative comment here about the network and the narration and the commercial breaks. It begs the question of whether or not Dan Blankenship ever had watched this show live, because if that were me, I would have been upset. What an affront to this mans work. Last time I focused on the History Channel, they seemed largely interested in airing NON-fictional programs, that certainly had no script or fake drama. Now, I can't find a single show on the network that comes close to that. It's beyond pathetic, beyond words. They should not even be legally allowed to title themselves as a \"History Channel,\" it's disgusting. Not as bad as what we Americans call \"The Learning Channel,\" aka TLC. I won't even get started there, all I can say is Honey Boo Boo... Really, all of television seems to have turned into a lot of garbage over the last decade, having the unique point of view that I do, with that several year gap. The commercials are louder and longer than they used to be, there seems to be no more 10:00pm \"watermark\" for the more adult programs and content. I'm still shocked at some of the things they allow on daytime TV now, and I'm 31! Any kid who gets home from the school bus before their parents do, has access to some serious garbage at all times of day, and people wonder what's wrong with the younger generations, wow... Saying that makes me feel incredibly old, but is it not true? And what the heck is wrong with Cartoons? What a mess...<br/><br/>Anyways, I think I'll drop cable again, and just stick to streaming what interests me. Television has become so much more trash than I ever thought possible. And one of the biggest disappointments to me this year, has been realizing how terrible the History Channel, of all networks, has painted the the story of a really intriguing part of... North American history, with The Curse of Oak Island. So sad. Go ahead and hate them for that all you want, but respect those who have have worked to chase their dreams. That's fair. But maybe they wouldn't have been able to get as much funding for the treasure hunt without getting the story on such a network, I do not know.

I'm often left to wonder if this isn't something a producer dreamed up. Its' not something I recall reading in any of the earlier articles.<br/><br/>Another explanation that is not covered is that the whole thing is a naturally occurring sinkhole, oh and one more, Ancient Aliens, which is surprising since this is the History Channel after all.

Liv(e) Moore, funny zombie pun intended!) being a zombie medical examiner eating brains to solve crimes was catchy, but became repetitive. Not in the sense that each brain eaten provides a different characteristic and allowed a lot of range, but in the sense that every crime is solved. Something random happens that just magically triggers the appropriate zombie-brain vision. And then every suspect just freely confesses their crime. No one ever avails themselves to the justice system by claiming they didn't do it. Are zombie brain visions even admissible in court? I know that is a little too deep for a zombie comedy, but a little variety would be nice. Maybe actual detective work and not a vision solves a crime. That would make Detective Babineaux more of a strong character. Or rather than each episode being a one-off, how about a story arc \"big bad\" that isn't neatly wrapped up in a bow by episode end? Quick change of subject, the entries from commercial breaks, more clever puns. Two thumbs up for those!<br/><br/>Then in a later season we hit a major speed bump in our star becoming a human smuggler called 'Renegade'. Not the most original name, but, eh, no biggie. This is where I have a real problem with the direction the show takes. Zombies are starving. Not enough brains to go around, so what is one to do? Smuggle in more humans and make them zombies! There is so much wrong (of course, just my opinion) with this entire premise. Oh, but the humans are those who are ill and would die without being made into zombie. Where is your heart? you ask. Why, it is somewhere above my (empty) stomach. It's called survival kids. Starving zombies become \"Romero's\" (clever homage to the original Night of the Living Dead type zombies), just rabid eating machines. And, rabid eating machines who break out of New Seattle to find brain food become dead rabid eating machines since zombies are rather WAY outnumbered and quite under geared compared to the human military. The selfish actions of Renegade and the other human smugglers threaten the entire zombie population. And now, in the season 4 finale, they restate the \"mission\": to show that zombies and humans can live together. Please explain to me how turning terminally ill humans into zombies accomplishes that mission? And too many times I asked myself, \"why are they doing that? Doing this LOGICAL thing instead would solve the problem.\" But, a TV show has gotta show I guess. <br/><br/>Even with those complaints, I still liked the show overall. Plus, it doesn't hurt that characters Liv, Peyton, and Dale are babes. And male characters Ravi, Clive, and Major provide female eye-candy.

The first episode was great: Introduction of characters, humorous mannerisms and situations, but also the introduction of a more serious central plot.<br/><br/>The show handles both funny and serious situations well, the dialogue is good and the actors are fantastic in their roles.<br/><br/>However, the writers are sloppy/lazy in resorting to clich\u00e9s to keep the show moving from week to week: First, you have the device where the main character has a secret that she cannot share with anyone, thus leading to all the opportunities one could ask for to create funny or \"dramatic\" situations. Sure, at first one could understand that Liv could be terrified of her condition, and afraid of what might happen should her family, loved ones or public find out about her condition. But that only holds up for a few episodes. It becomes clear after one gets to know Major that you realize she could have explained to him that she'd contracted a condition that was contagious, and that prevented her from having the contact or experiences a full life demanded. Instead, she keeps her secrets and as the series progresses and Major begins to find out that strange things are going on, she continues to hide the truth, even though he's getting into a dangerous situation. And that's only one example.<br/><br/>Another problem is Liv's tendency to take on the personality of people who's brain she eats. This is only true insofar as it serves the plot. For example, as a radio talk show host she becomes an insufferable bitch psychoanalyzing every man she knows, almost to the point of ruining a friendship. However, when she has the opportunity to eliminate a zombie murderer/drug dealer while \"possessed\" by the personality of a sniper, she decides at the crucial moment that she isn't a killer. Sure, she has no alternate plan for stopping the thug from continuing to murder people and sell their brains for profit, but she passes on the chance to end this blight on the human (and zombie) race. As a result, her boyfriend, also a zombie, is murdered.<br/><br/>Basically, the writers use a lack of communication between Liv and others, even when it would make sense, to create tension or humor in the show, and her ability to absorb personalities and see their memories is a deus ex machina that allows crime cases to be easily solved, often leading to humorous scenes as well.<br/><br/>Most people will enjoy watching iZombie, but if you were weaned on \"smart\" shows with Emmy Award-winning writing, I doubt you'll stay with it for long.

Zombiism here is no more serious than being a vegetarian. But this is the work of creators seeking to keep things at the shallow end of the pool (without going into the children's section); perhaps too timid for another VM, or maybe incapable of reproducing their premier work. <br/><br/>At the end of season 2, I thought they were about to decimate all watchability from the show in season 3, but so far they've managed not to explode their internal organs onto the floor.

The series lies in between 'adult' and 'kids' TV genres, creating a strange, funny show for the whole family. Don't let the forgettable 2004 movie scare you off, because the series gets right what the movie got wrong. From what I have seen of the series so far, there is a colorful, but dark sense of humour, some great acting, and well crafted dialogue that make the series worthy of a watch. The longer TV episode format allows for a more complete story, with one book spanning two episodes (instead of the movie cramming in three books). It is a lot more nuanced than the movie for this reason, with extra scenes and dialogue filling in the backstory and adding depth to the characters.

Some reviewers have written that NPH is just revisiting his role as Barney Stinson all over again. That may or may not be true (I'm not going to argue that point), but if that's true - I believe that it was probably because of his role as Barney Stinson that he was chosen to play Count Olaf in the first place, so to revisit some of Barney's personality traits make total sense! I took the liberty to read a little about Count Olaf's character description (based on the books) and it seems like he's spot on! Watching the series I kind of get a \"Harry Potteresque\"-feeling, which I personally like. It's partly dark (given the environment, the plot and the backstory), and yet it's surprisingly light as well, which I personally think is a perfect combination. I don't think I would've enjoyed this series so much without its light touches every now and then. It would quickly get too depressing to watch. I love the costumes and I found myself laughing at the most silly things - silly things that would not have worked if they were portrayed differently. The movie for instance, lacked so much information that it came across as rushed and abruptly interrupted (maybe that's the problem, and not Jim Carrey's performance). The series however, made a lot more sense to me. I preferred Monty in the series for instance, as I feel that I got to know him better there. I was actually sad to see him die in the series - in the movie - not so much. Series's Josephine was hilarious! I love Meryl Streep, but same thing happened here, her part in the movie was so quickly over that I didn't get to know her well enough to care about her either. I am not complaining over their performance's, just explaining why I think this story works better as a series than a movie.<br/><br/>I love the bittersweet tone of the world, like I said, I wouldn't have enjoyed it if it was pure darkness. I got so frustrated over the \"cluelessness\" and neglect of every single adult who wouldn't listen to the the children (mostly Poe who seems to suffer from bad eyesight as well as complete lack of intelligence!)!!! It was however, despite all absurdness and exaggeration, a pretty good interpretation of how most adults act around children in real life. The tragic events surrounding these children are in deed tragic and I read that some reviewers seem to think that the series doesn't do a good job delivering that feeling. I partly agree, but I think that's a positive thing. It's the irony behind it all which makes this series unique and tragic in the first place - the main tragedy is still there - but it's not the center of the story. I personally think it would've been boring if it was. I don't particularly like series (or movies) that focus only on one thing.<br/><br/>Now back to the acting! The kids are perfect in their roles! I hope to see a lot of them in the future as well. I also hope that they don't replace Sunny as so many series do, because that baby is adorable!!!<br/><br/>The story may seem repetitive to some people, but I keep getting the feeling that there's a deeper message within the story as it unravels. Some reviewers seem to be annoyed over the shows' silliness, but I read review's of the books online and it seems that the books do in fact share this trait. It makes sense since they are children's books after all. It doesn't mean that some adults - like me for instance (who are likely still in touch with their inner child) - cannot enjoy it! Because I love it! Had I watched it with my \"grown-up\"-eyes, I might not have liked it so much, as I wouldn't have given it a fair treatment.

The Poe household is invitingly 1950s (the T.V. era where families were flawlessly perfect) to contrast the Baudelaire family literally being in ruin. The Poes, however, are not in such great shape either, since Mr. Poe is ill from working so much. Justice Strauss, a judge with a personal library of legal texts, cannot piece together what is going on right in front of her. She is too distracted by her lack of pride in her work. Even Mr. Snicket, who is researching the Baudelaires, sometimes shifts the conversation to lament his star-crossed love life. The adults, selfish as they may be, all have something important to say. The kids, innocent as they may be, all have something important to say.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "48 out of 79 found this helpful.", "date": "13 January 2017"}, {"title": " The adaptation we deserve", "content": "This show is everything the original movie should've been. The original movie is not bad, but the thing is, it doesn't have exactly the charm the books had. Reading the books after seeing the movie was like sun shining through the clouds after a while, because the writing in the books is so charming and clever and while it's all \"this is a tragic tale\" it's also not at all serious. The movie was like a weird shadow of that. Still great, still so very very unique, but something was definitely missing.<br/><br/>The cast of the movie was brilliant, but somehow this show managed to top that. While Jim Carrey was amazing as Count Olaf, Neil Patrick Harris is the real deal. He can be that typical over the top, funny villain that's typical for children's books and shows, but he can also be weirdly scary. Carrey didn't have that. One of my favourite members of the cast is Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket. He has this amazing voice, and his whole persona feels more Lemony Snicket than Jude Law in the movie. Everyone is so talented and so incredibly beautiful.<br/><br/>If there's something that makes this even greater than the cast and the writing, it's the cinematography and the music. Visually this show is astonishing, it's dark like it's supposed to be, but it's detailed and wonderfully surreal? Not realistic? I'm not sure whats' the right word to use, but the atmosphere is like for the dark fairy tale - which is exactly what this show is. The music is enchanting, and the theme sung by Neil Patrick Harris just gets stuck in your head. And the song at the very end of the season? Hauntingly beautiful.<br/><br/>Only thing I can complain about is how soon the season was over, but that's not really a complaint. Shorter seasons are better. Quality over quantity, when it comes to TV shows.<br/><br/>Also ever since I saw the movie I've been digging the \"don't watch / read this\" vibe the series has going on. And in the TV show the theme song is basically \"don't watch this show\". But don't listen to Lemony Snicket, watch the show.

The writing was sharp and quick, and masterfully delivered by a wide cast of superb guest stars and recurring characters alike - the Baudelaires are a wonder to watch, and portray their characters perfectly. Neil Patrick Harris, in spite of my initial doubts, conveyed Olaf as a genuinely menacing failed (?) actor, mastering that grounded instability that Carrey failed to during his tenure, but also the characters Olaf finds himself portraying within the show - credit to the makeup department for making the handsome Neil Patrick Harris fit into a whole range of largely unflattering roles. Warburton as Snicket is also charming, well spoken and carries clearly a deep weight of sadness; the way he is molded into scenes and delivers the self aware warnings of horror and inconvenience feels melodramatic but works in the absurd retro-futuristic world he finds himself in.<br/><br/>The use of CGI is also great, as while it's hardly Hollywood level, its almost cartoon surrealism always gives you this sense you're watching a sick fairy tale, especially with the lighting. I found the set design to be absolutely marvelous, not just showing the money Netflix have thrown around, but also a great understanding of the vision of the original author - something that this newer adaptation holds over its predecessor; largely because it has the original author as part of its writing team. The show also weaves in so many plot threads from later on and references for book readers that even the greatest of fans feel they are witnessing something that incorporates all parts of the world that Handler has developed, with subtle references that can make this show a joy to dig deep into. <br/><br/>There are a few flaws, I shall admit. I found Sunny's actions late into episode 2 to be a little beyond my suspension of disbelief, and I felt that the prospect of escape could have been used to greater extent to lull the children into a tragic, dramatically ironic, sense of security in episode 3 (it would feel more thematically guided). The soundtrack also felt like many Hollywood soundtracks in the modern day, used for set-dressing rather than as a feature in of itself, though still adds weight to every scene.<br/><br/>I quite liked the opening theme song and enjoyed the quick synopses at the start of each episode which never feel as though they give too much away. I also really like the unexpected musical piece which while caught me off guard, when I finally said \"Is that so?\" and just went with the flow, I really appreciated the way it acted as a bookend.<br/><br/>I fully understand complaints about how the show may seem jarring to new viewers, especially if you don't quite understand what the source material is actually like. I can empathize with people who think the characters are ridiculous and unbelievable, that the sets seem preposterous and the dialogue frankly unrealistic. However watching it as a book reader, who understands that the books are almost a satire of themselves - a work of meta fiction that I imagine can be as divisive marmite - I found myself loving every moment of it; going all in on this world is a must if you want it to sweep you so wonderfully away.<br/><br/>I also found the pacing to be far better suited to the two hour long format per book. It shows a level of devotion to the source material that essentially four movies would be created for four books, and it pays off by providing ample time for characters to develop, mysteries to unfold and the adaptation to be more faithful.<br/><br/>All in all, for all of its flaws, Netflix's adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events is a loyal adaptation with quirks of its own, that understands its absurdity and embraces it wholeheartedly, and creates the wondrous level of genuine charm the films could never truly emulate. It's a fun, tragic, witty, self-aware, emotional, alluring and xylophone series as a standalone and I cannot recommend it enough. I hope there will be a next season (it's in the works, I'm told) and I hope it is a strong as this series was.<br/><br/>(P.S.

After years of waiting this is a real treat. I've never experienced anything like this show where it is an almost exact feeling of the books. It's magical. The casting is terrific, the addition of Jacqueline was great as I love her character and can't wait to see more of her. Originally I thought she was going to be Kit Snicket but that was not the case, which makes me want to see more of the mystery that Daniel Handler and the team at Netflix have created. <br/><br/>In response to several reviews, one in particular who talked about the parents being alive. You clearly did not watch the entire season, as they were not the Baudelaire parents. I won't spoil the very pleasant twist to a mystery and backstory on characters readers of the book love. I do hope we get more of the Quagmire story than in the books. <br/><br/>It's absolutely terrific and much better than the 2004 movie adaption. For the people who said they liked that movie, I have to ask why as it was so far off from the books it was like fan fiction. I was always annoyed by how they did not have Klaus wearing glasses in the movie and that alone would mean they could have never made a sequel to that movie as the central plot to Miserable Mill is glasses. <br/><br/>I also love how they are teasing the backstory on Snicket who is just as much of a character in the books as the Baudelaires but his role and family's role come much later in the series. It is also nice to see VFD so forefront from the very beginning. <br/><br/>Daniel Handler who is actually Lemony Snicket, wrote the show and is the executive producer so to the other reviewers who claim to have read the books I seriously doubt that. This is his vision coming to life and we should all be so appreciative to be part of this amazing time. These books and show not only created an amazing mystery but create a love for literature, grammar and going to the library. They make reading fun and it is sad to see people who obviously did not read the books insult this masterpiece of a show.<br/><br/>The show will also go darker. The first three books were never dark. Book four was the turning point after five we go into more of the mystery, more deaths, and more character development with Olaf's troupe. <br/><br/>Another review said Mr. Poe grew annoying. He was exactly like that in the books. The Baudelaires ALWAYS told him how about Olaf and he would always ignore them and put them in another horrible situation. So yes, he is that stupid. That is his character and you won't see him much after The Austere Academy. <br/><br/>I do hope we see tidbits and additions from the prequel series All The Wrong Questions, The Unauthorized Autobiography, The Beatrice Letters (which is sort of mentioned) Horseradish, Bitter Truths You Can't Avoid, and 13 Words. Daniel said the show will only be three seasons but there is so much material that this can extend for years to come.<br/><br/>This is nothing short of a magical treat that will make all of the true fans of the series cry from nostalgia and bring you back into this whimsical world of Lemony Snicket.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "24 out of 39 found this helpful.", "date": "14 January 2017"}, {"title": " You Must Watch It", "content": "When I watched half of the first episode I did not think Neil Patrick Harris was good for the role of Count Olaf but he brought the character to life as funny but evil at the same time, he was perfect for the role.

It certainly wasn't joy, because, as all viewers of the show have been repeatedly warned, the story of the Baudelaire is a bleak tale, filled with despair, woe, and an unsettling amount of poisonous fungi. But it wasn't sadness either. After a while, it hit me: it was gratitude.<br/><br/>I don't think any creative work has ever made me so grateful for its mere existence as Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events. This was a series that ought to have been doomed from the get-go. The children's books which inspired the series recycled the same basic plot six different times, featured scenes and disguises which could not easily translate to the screen and relied heavily on wordplay. Nickelodeon had already tried and failed to adopt the Snicket books, and ended up with a pretty serviceable comedy, but in no captured the darkness that defines source material.<br/><br/>But most of all, standing defiantly in the way of any successful adaptation of the series, there were my expectations. I, along with a generation of bookworm children, have been waiting 20 years to see the full story of the Baudelaire orphans play out on screen, since a seven-year-old me got a copy of The Bad Beginning for Chanukah and for several days was too scarred by Olaf and his horrifying child marriage plot to go to sleep. More so than the trauma, however, the mystery, humour, and warped sense of beauty present in the series defined my taste in literature. With two decades of waiting behind me, I was bracing for disappointment.<br/><br/>But by God, they nailed it. I can barely believe it.<br/><br/>The creators of the Netflix series (and this is where the creators of the 2004 movie dropped the ball) seemed to have a strong understanding of what readers loved in the original books. A Series of Unfortunate Events was also a series of tiny gags and in-jokes and cultural references, and Netflix loyally preserved so many of these - the bizarre costumes, the literary references, the over-the-top settings. They even managed to preserve the fourth-wall-breaking narration by having the character of Lemony Snicket (Patrick Warburton) appear mid-action, Rod Sterling style. The TV series adheres closely to the plot of the books, and when it veers away from its source material, the changes feel organic -like something Lemony Snicket wrote but had to cut out.<br/><br/>Most importantly, though, the series kept the aura of the original books. A Series of Unfortunate Events is what it is due to a blending of contrasts - beauty and darkness, humour and sorrow. The show managed to toe the very thin line between comedy and tragedy, landing both laugh-out-loud jokes and moments of genuine emotion. Combined with the surreal sets and haunting soundtrack, this skillful handling highlights the theme of the series - that there can be beauty and nobility even in a confusing, horrifying world - and is the reason that time and again readers and viewers ignore Lemony Snicket's entreaties to \"look away.\"<br/><br/>Aside from pandering to fans of the books, A Series of Unfortunate Events offers a lot to new viewers. The writing is clever, the jokes come thick and fast, and the cast nails their characters - including, somehow, Presley Smith, who, as an infant, shouldn't be able to act at all. Neil Patrick Harris memorably captures Olaf in all his many disguises, Lucy Punch is a hilarious and over-the-top Esme Squalor, VFD's agents for good are suitably dashing, and the viewers want to strangle K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe) and preparatory school brat Carmelita Spats (who hopefully will not keep Kitana Turnbull, the actress who portrays her, typecast for too long).<br/><br/>The series is not without its issues, the foremost being the pacing. The story progresses at a Wes Anderson-style breakneck pace from start to finish. It's a thrill to watch, but it which doesn't leave as much time to watch the characters at leisure. Since the misery of the series frequently stems from friends and allies being whisked away from the Baudelaires just when they are thinking their troubles are finally behind them, the speed of certain episodes weakens several of what ought to be dramatic moments. The TV series also worked in much more closure and happy endings, which certainly felt good, and which and had enough of a grounding in the books so as to not feel forced, but which did subtract from the iconic bleakness of the books. Most perplexingly, Neil Patrick Harris seems to have convinced the show's creators to let him perform several musical numbers, most of which were completely at odds with whatever scene they interrupted. Whatever it takes to get Neil Patrick Harris, I suppose.<br/><br/>Really though, when you're adopting a beloved book series - especially one so integral to the childhoods of a generation - accurately capturing the feel, if not the exact plot, of the original, trumps all else. With that out of the way, and given the strength of the source material, even a series that has everything stacked against it will became a guaranteed success.

She is an overbearing parent who chastises and spy's on her 15 yr. old and harasses her youngest because of the poor girl's weight. Her shallow nature is shown as a defense mechanism for a woman whose own mother (Conchetta Tomei) is even more overbearing than her daughter and toward her husband whom she verbally spars with when they are together.<br/><br/>From the opening song, a reprise of the great Pete Seger song \"Little Boxes\", to the weekly dilemmas for the characters of coping in suburbia the show scores.

And WEEDS certainly is wonderfully bizarre.<br/><br/>Mary-Louise Parker (THE WEST WING) stars as Nancy Botwin, a recent widow with two children and a cash flow problem. She lives in the fictitious town of Agrestic in Anywhere Suburbia, America. In fact, the shows lead-in goes through great pains to show us how common an area she and her family live in. This is vital since most of today's drug culture tends to live right under our proverbial noses. And the drug, as the title intends, is marijuana, often considered shameful by some to be considered \"illegal\" while others throw tantrums about its gateway significance. But Nancy has to feed her family and she'll do whatever it takes to ensure their survival.<br/><br/>In the midst of this seemingly benign town we have a troop of old and new pot smokers. The older generation is exhibited by none other than Kevin Nealon (ANGER MANAGEMENT) whose character, Doug Wilson, is a bored and immature accountant. Self-centered and completely useless in terms of assisting his neighbors, his character is absolutely fantastic. You could easily picture him still in high school if it weren't for his extremely receding hairline and the family minivan he drives. The newer generation is brought to light by Nancy Botwin's brother-in-law, Andy, played by the excellent Justin Kirk (FLANNEL PAJAMAS, 2006). He has no direction in life and is now firmly entrenched in Nancy's home. His failings at life are mirrored through his careless attitudes toward women or growing in any meaningful way. But once in a while \u0097 just occasionally \u0097 he'll make a remark of wonderful profoundness that blows Nancy away. He also is a much needed father-figure (although a VERY screwed up one) for Nancy's two boys, Shane (Alexander Gould, FINDING NEMO) and Silas (Hunter Parrish, RV). It is Silas, the high schooler, whom we get to see experiment with the emerging drug culture that surrounds his household. Although initially unaware of his mother's \"business\", he quickly reveals to the viewer that he's \"not stupid\" about what's happening under his own roof.<br/><br/>Nancy's friends are a mixed bag. Celia (Elizabeth Perkins, BIG), is a member of the PTA, has a child who suffers with being overweight, and recently found out her husband had an affair with the local, and beautiful, Asian tennis instructor. As the series progresses, we learn that Celia has breast cancer and this comes as devastating news for someone so infatuated with one's appearance (as seen through the mother-daughter relationships). The Shepard's, a black family that live in a \"bad part of town\", act as Nancy's suppliers of the green leaf. They battle finances versus keeping their business strictly business whenever Nancy comes around (which fluctuates as her business expands and contracts).<br/><br/>The wonderful thing about this series is that it puts a mess of moral material in the viewer's lap. What is wrong with marijuana when Percocet and other heavy narcotics are readily available via a doctor's prescription? Is it wrong for a person to support their family by dealing in something as shady as drug trafficking? Can a woman be both a loving and compassionate mother while at the same time selling something potentially addicting? Is it hypocritical for someone to sell \"the stuff\" while at the same time punishing their kids when they catch them doing some of it? Quite a moral quagmire, I'd say.<br/><br/>The other thing that makes this series work is it's sexy. Mary-Louise Parker has that ...something about her that makes her both a respectable looking woman and just a tad slutty. She's a sexual being who struggles with life in the shadow of her husband's death and has to decide what's best for her, her kids, and her husband's memory; most times these things are in direct opposition of each other. Elizabeth Perkins mirrors much of Parker's character in that she too has that respectable/slutty look but also some uppityness ...until her cancer rears up. Then she becomes more introspective and the slut takes over, for a while.<br/><br/>The series producers also put in a deaf and sexually promiscuous girlfriend for Nancy's son, Silas. This added an entirely new dimension to Silas' character as he's forced to grow-up without a father to guide him through this teenage sexual minefield and he finds solace with the deaf girl's household more than with his own whenever internal family problems arise.<br/><br/>This first season took about two episodes to get rolling, but once it did there was no stopping it. You really need to open your mind to the possibilities surrounding this show. It's not JUST about drugs. It's about the people that are shoved into this niche group for the sake of survival, and it's captivating to watch how their flawed lives intermingle. Pot smoker or not, these characters are headed for interesting days.

What made the series so popular was never the 'ritual' of the plots, however; if you loved the show, it was because of the chemistry of the stars. Hannibal, B.A., Face, and Murdock were all likable guys, and seemed to enjoy every moment together...and fans of the series have always 'picked up' on that camaraderie.<br/><br/>The brainchild of Stephen Cannell and Frank Lupo, NBC loved the concept of the show, and gave the series a prime 'starting' point, airing the pilot episode after a Super Bowl, guaranteeing great initial ratings. Featuring Tim Dunigan as 'Face' (Dirk Benedict was unavailable for the pilot), the show benefited enormously from Mr. T's presence, as ROCKY 3 had made him an overnight star. Another 'plus' was George Peppard's return to weekly television; his \"Banecek\" had been a much loved NBC series, until he walked off the show (Cannell, one of the writers of the earlier series, understood the ex-alcoholic Peppard's occasional mood swings, and offered him a large salary and a lot of creative control in the new series, resulting in one of the happier periods in the actor's tragic life).<br/><br/>A major discovery for \"The A-Team\" was Dwight Schultz, as 'Howling Mad Murdock'. A remarkably versatile actor, Schultz was adept at accents, physical humor, and rapid-fire one-liners, and his exchanges with Mr. T were funny without ever being demeaning. Peppard took a liking to the young actor, as well, and the warmth between the pair could be seen in nearly every episode. With Benedict's arrival (he had been the break-out star of \"Battlestar Galactica\", and had a large female following), Peppard had all the elements he felt were needed to make \"The A-Team\" work...which didn't bode well for the one female regular, Melinda Culea, as reporter Amy Allen. Although she gave the show a more balanced slant, and was excellent in her role, Peppard always considered her a 'fifth wheel'...and when Cannell did not renew her contract for the third season, it was generally assumed that George Peppard used his leverage to oust her. A new female character was introduced, played by Marla Heasley, but her character would remain less active, and would have a story 'arc' that would have her leave the series in 1985.<br/><br/>A television show with a single concept, no matter how enjoyable the cast, can't run indefinitely, and by the end of the fourth season, \"The A-Team\" had pretty well exhausted all the variations the writers could imagine. Entertainment figures (Hulk Hogan, Boy George and the Culture Club, Rick James, Isaac Hayes) appeared in weak efforts to bolster ratings, and NBC pressured Cannell to make major changes to the series.<br/><br/>Bowing to network pressure, the fifth season began by having the A-Team finally captured and court-martialed. Escaping with the aid of new regular Frankie Santana (Eddie Velez), the team soon found themselves 'prisoners' of a secret government agency run by Gen. Hunt Stockwell (Robert Vaughn), who offered them full pardons if they would take on a number of assignments \"too risky\" for the U.S. intelligence community to handle. The episodes sank to formulaic \"Mission Impossible\" clones, with George Peppard's authority lost to new boss Vaughn, and the 'blue-collar' charm of the earlier seasons sadly absent. When the series was canceled, while fans mourned, few were surprised.<br/><br/>What has been a surprise is the 'cult' status the series has achieved in the years since it left the air. While George Peppard never lived long enough to see it happen (he died in 1994, from pneumonia), the still-growing popularity of the show has been a source of pride and amazement for Benedict, Schultz, and Mr. T (who nearly died of cancer, but has made a complete recovery), and the show is about to re-emerge as a feature film, with Stephen Cannell producing. <br/><br/>Not bad for a 'single concept' series!", "rating": null, "helpful": "74 out of 82 found this helpful.", "date": "26 December 2003"}, {"title": " You Love It When These Plans Come Together", "content": "The A-Team was one of three shows - the others being The Cosby Show and Miami Vice - that rescued NBC in the 1980s, and this mixture of action and comedy still holds up as an entertaining concoction.<br/><br/>The show succeeds primarily on the personalities of the cast.

Murdoch can be funny, but as Wendy helps bring out in this episode, Schultz is also a qualified dramatic performer.<br/><br/>Ultimately fleshing out the show was the Gerard-esque pursuer of the team, Colonel Roderick Decker.  Lance LeGault portrayed Decker and made one of TV's best recurring villians.  Decker gained sympathy from his determination and it showed in one of the show's weaker episodes, \"Incident At Crystal Lake\" where he and his executive officer Captain Crane are attacked by four criminals and brutally beaten; no pleasure is derived from seeing Decker and Crane brutalized; if anything the viewer despises this scene precisely because the two Army officers are so humiliated.  This sympathy angle is best shown in the show's flashback episode \"Curtain Call\" where Decker has the team cornered and they offer no resistance to arrest and also in a later episode where Hannibal needs to protect the family of his client from mobsters, and the only way he can is to draw Decker into the fray. <br/><br/>\nAs Crane, future director Carl Franklin displays superb chemistry with LeGault throughout the run of the show, and it was a mystery when, after two episodes of the show's 1985-6 season, Crane was curiously dropped.<br/><br/>This is a show where everything revolves around personality.  The plots and production values are deliberately on a budget; it is the personality of the characters that drives the show and makes it work.  Hannibal always loves it when a plan comes together, B.A. is always cantankerous and terrified of flying (except, curiously, in one 1986 episode where Peck is rescued and they fly out in a helicopter), Templeton Peck always has a scam running, and Murdoch is always engagingly nuts.  <br/><br/>And it all works, each episode, of a pivotal action comedy series of the 1980s.", "rating": null, "helpful": "59 out of 65 found this helpful.", "date": "30 January 2004"}, {"title": " BEST TV SHOW EVER", "content": "What constitutes a really really good TV show? I think it has to have good characters, good stories,action, car chases, villains and it has to be totally crazy and unafraid to show the impossible.<br/><br/>The A-Team had it all. It is the type of show one can watch over and over again and still enjoy it. I have very fond memories of The A-Team from the 1980's. I get all nostalgic when watching it. Why is it that the TV writers and producers from the 1980's produced such good stuff? Why can nobody write a good show nowadays.<br/><br/>The storyline for the A-Team hardly ever changed. Some underdog such as a farmer or small business owner would be getting hassle from some rich guy who wanted to put them out of business. The underdog would call in the A-Team. The A-Team would thrash the bad guys. The bad guys would get hold of as much weaponry as they could. The A-Team would then get hold of even better weaponry. There would be a good scrap at the end and plenty of gunfire (although neither the good guys or bad guys could hit anyone). The A-Team would beat the baddies and leave them for the police. That was the story for most the episodes. There were deviations from the normal formula (particularly in the last season)at times. In one episode a mercenary called Kyle tries to put the A-Team out of commission. In another episode Howlin' Mad Murdock was wounded whilst the US Army were on the Team's trail.<br/><br/>The really good thing about the A-Team was that it was totally crazy and didn't take itself seriously. There were so many odd things about this series.<br/><br/>For example, the A-Team never seemed to have a permanent house. I guess they lived in that van but I never saw any suitcases or personal belongings in their van.<br/><br/>There were other crazy things. The Team used to bust Murdock out of a psychiatric hospital when they needed him. Perhaps the hospital chiefs should have put a 24 hour guard on his door. The other funny thing was the way the Team always used to put B.A. Baracus to sleep when they needed to fly. They never failed in doing that. In short, the Team could do anything. They could evade the US Army constantly and they could build anything from scrap. The only thing they couldn't do was shoot anyone-they always missed. It was all these crazy things that made the A-Team great.<br/><br/>The characters were brilliant. The late George Peppard was Hannibal who always had a plan and only enjoyed himself when there were bullets flying past him and things getting blown up. Mr T played the grumpy B.A. Baracus whose heart was in the wrong place. He was tough but scared of flying. Dirk Benedict played Faceman who was the ultimate conman. He could play any part and get anything for the team. Dwight Schultz played the mad howlin'Murdock who may have been mad but he could certainly be counted on. Throughout the series the Team were joined by the likes of the beautiful Amy Allen and the slick Frankie Santana. The last season deviated from the normal formula but it was still good.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a great show which brings back great memories whenever I watch it. It was just one of the many shows which made the 80's great. A big pat on the back must go to everyone involved in this wonderful show.

I first stumbled on this marvelous, kind of innocent mindless fun show, when a video was distributed, containing a double episode. I can't really remember much of that particular episode, except that the team was on a cruise ship and that they met a sleazy lounge singer. I loved it immediately but I never thought that the series would ever be aired on Danish TV. Luckily, I was wrong and all the episodes were shown.<br/><br/>The A-Team was a rather silly, even corny 50 minute show but who could resist the priceless squabbles between B.A. and Murdock. Templeton Peck was a rather sissy character but his scams were always entertaining, though simple. And of course it wouldn't have been much of a fun time without delirious old Hannibal Smith, who got the jazz and always seemed a little off.<br/><br/>Actually, what I just described is only a rough part of each character. They weren't as simple as this all the time and it would have been pretty unlikely that they could avoid capture if they were brainless stereotypes.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the actors was marvelous and that's what made it work. The plots were less interesting. They usually featured people that couldn't pay them one penny for helping them out of some kind of trouble that the police didn't care about. Was it just me or did it seem highly unlikely that anybody would contact them in such strange ways, as being hi-jacked into a moving van to see if their stories checked out or being approached by some guy in a disguise who talked with a weird accent. But like all 50 minute shows it wasn't all fun and games either. A few episodes dealt with almost realistic situations like drugs and juvenile delinquency.<br/><br/>Had George Peppard not died I think it would have been a gas to have a reunion of this group of misfits.

The plots weren't exactly loaded with endless twists, but that was part of the fun - who else looked forward to the week's DIY montage where the quartet built that week's weapons? (As Hannibal pointed out in one of the novelisations, it's amazing how the bad guys always locked them up with precisely what they needed to escape.) <br/><br/>And contrary to popular belief, our heroes did get hurt from time to time (the clip show episode \"Curtain Call\" used Murdock being shot as an excuse for his comrades to hold a remembrance of episodes past; in \"The Battle Of Bel Air\" the helicopter containing the A-Team crashed at the end of the climax, injuring everyone EXCEPT B.A. Baracus); occasionally episodes started with someone actually getting murdered (the man in the exploding car in \"Skins,\" one of the battling convicts in \"Pros &amp; Cons\"). The show didn't dwell on it, true, but it was there.<br/><br/>This remains Cannell's most successful show as an independent producer, and demonstrates how he's more adaptable than the more critically acceptable Steven Bochco (this is not to put down Bochco, but can you imagine the man with the would-be violinist for a dad coming up with shows as wildly different as \"The Greatest American Hero,\" \"Top of the Hill\" and \"Wiseguy\"?).

They are sought after by the U.S. Army for crimes they didn't commit. The A-Team are wanted for robbing the bank of Hanoi.<br/><br/>The A-Team is led by Col. John \"Hannibal\" Smith, played so awesome by the late George Peppard (Breakfast At Tiffany's, Battle Beyond The Stars, and Treasure Of The Yankee Zepher).

B.A. has a fear of flying, that is why when the team need to fly somewhere, Hannibal always has to drug him to get him on the plane cause B.A. refuses to fly, no matter what situation they are in. B.A. may seem mean, but he really is a nice person, he gets along with kids really well.<br/><br/>Capt H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock is a member of the team who is not all there.Murdock resided at the V.A. Hospital for the first 4 seasons. Murdock is crazy, likes to talk about his invisible dog named \"Billy\", a dog that does not exist, he may be nuts but he is a great pilot. Murdock tends to get on B.A. Baracus's nerves from time to time. Murdock is played so well by actor Dwight Schultz (Star Trek:The Next Generation and The Temp).<br/><br/>Lt. Templeton Peck a.k.a. \"Face\"or \"Faceman\", played awesome by Dirk Benedict (Battlestar Galactica, Ruckus, and Alaska) is a great con man for the team, he gets the team things they need for anything, he even gets Murdock out of the V.A.

Face drives a real nice Corvette.<br/><br/>Amy Allen, played by the beautiful Melinda Culea, is a reporter who works with The A-Team from time to time, gets them information.

The A-Team is always being chased after by the U.S. Army., the Colonels that have tried to catch them are Col. Lynch, played by William Lucking (The River Wild, The Trigger Effect, and Erin Brockovich), Col. Roderick Decker, played by Lance LeGault (Iron Eagle, Mortal Combat:Annihilation), Col.

Hunt Stockwell, played by Robert Vaughn (The Man From U.N.C.L.E., Superman III, and Black Moon Rising)is in charge of the agency.<br/><br/>I think \"The A-Team\" is a well done show, it may seem violent, but the focus is what it is all about, soldiers who help people out, they only shoot when they have to.

Watching an \"The A-Team\" episode was always an adventure, the next day I would always talked about with my friends, how 'neat' it all was. Everybody loved \"The A-Team\"! <br/><br/>However it is a completely ridicules series to watch these days of course. Basically ever episode is build up the same; Someone with trouble hires the A-Team, A-Team comes, A-Team kicks butt, A-Team builds something, A-Team saves the day. Also occasionally Murdock first has to escape from the mental hospital and B.A. has to be drugged because there are going to fly. There are lot of these repeating returning moments in \"The A-Team\". It's ridicules but somehow you never get tired of it.<br/><br/>Absolutely best thing are the characters. The four main persons are excellent on their own but even better when they were together. Especially Murdock and B.A. were at their best when they were together in a scene. Hannibal (George Peppard) is the leader and always the man with the plan, he sometimes disguises himself in silly looking costumes. Put a pillow beneath his shirt, give him a fake mustache and a big fat cigar and voil\u00e0, he is a businessman. B.A. (Mr. T) is the strong almost indestructible man with his trademark golden chains and his fear of flying and his love for milk. Face (Dirk Benedict) is the ladies man who often uses his charm as his weapon. Murdock (Dwight Schultz) is the crazy fool and the pilot of the bunch. Every character has his own specialty, it's simple but works effective for a TV-series like this.<br/><br/>The action was also often the same, all of the car chases were always filmed at the same way and it was extremely obvious at times that they used puppets during certain stunts. Also it was amazing to see how everybody always survived the biggest crashes and explosions.<br/><br/>Always one of the highlights of an episode was when our hero's were building something. They build some most amazing things at times such as tanks. Like \"MacGyver\", all they ever needed was a pack of bubblegum, some duct tape and a screwdriver.<br/><br/>It is too bad that the final season was a disgrace. Sure it had the wonderful Robert Vaughn always in a fairly large role but the fun element was really gone in the last season. Often the stories were extremely ridicules even for \"The A-Team\" standards and it simply was not fun or enjoyable to watch. Also the final episode was an huge disappointment. Basically is was just a standard episode like any other from season 5 without anything special that would indicate that this was the final episode.<br/><br/>Still I will always have fond memories of \"The A-Team\" and I often watch the re-runs.

My uncle laughed that the show (The A-Team) was that one where they shot off thousands of rounds of ammunition and no one ever got hit or died. My uncle was a 'Fed' and a sharp-shooter who would face off in competition. I didn't mind that about the show so much, yeah no one died. I got familiar with who Mr. T was from this as I had seen him once on 'Silver Spoons' as Ricky Schroeder's body guard.<br/><br/>I followed the show on the network and onto the cable stations that would carry it later.

I was pretty happy about that. As I was sitting there in a big leather chair, in the sitting area, Dirk came up and said something to an acquaintance of his there, then, sat down and smoked a premium cigar. He talked to some people, then with me about everyday stuff, politics and then I asked about his work and the days of The A Team and he said that they (He and Peppard) used to sit in between the shooting 'break' and smoke cigars and get in trouble sometimes with the studio, probably rowdy behavior. All in all, this was a great time to be sitting puffing on great cigars exchanging smoke and listening as well as shooting the breeze with good Ole Dirk B. I had also heard that when the beginning of shooting started for the production of the A-Team DeWight Shultz arrived and went to meet his co-stars. On the lot he went to be introduced to Peppard and George replied after meeting Dewight, \"Hi my name is George Peppard...and I am not a nice man.\" That might knock you on your tail if you had a confidence problem. At any rate I have enjoyed the show and still do on DVD.<br/><br/>This was a show that on the departure of the network running it after cancellation.

There is the setting and the time -- Hastings, on the southern coast of England during World War II. Hastings of course was the site of the last successful invasion of England, in 1066, and that threat seems real in the early days of the war. In the series, it is a provincial town where Deputy Chief Superintendent Foyle tries to solve local crimes of theft and murder, while dealing with wartime problems of black markets, sabotage and espionage. In addition to meddling from police superiors with their own agendas, Foyle must contend with bureaucratic and military interference from London as the war creates situations that lets criminals go free.<br/><br/>Then there are the scripts and the actors, not to mention the overall quality of the production -- lucid photography, theme music with echoes of Brideshead Revisited, period clothing, vehicles, etc. The writing is measured, intelligent, no wasted words. Honeysuckle Weeks and Anthony Howell in the supporting roles of Samantha Stewart and Paul Milner are excellent and play off each other well.<br/><br/>But the show belongs to Michael Kitchen and you wonder why you've never seen this actor before and when you will see him again. He conveys the competence and integrity you want in your hero, but the real attraction, I think, is that he is the ultimate father figure. He is concerned about people without wearing it on his sleeve; gruff, even curt, but letting us glimpse the tenderness behind it; and he is wise, not only a clever detective but wise in the ways of the human heart. He is a father not only to his son, Andrew, an RAF pilot, but also to Sam and Milner and to any number of characters in the various episodes, including his goddaughter in the last (final?) episode. Invariably, this father knows best. While he conveys a sense of vulnerability, you never have the feeling Foyle has really made a mistake. This is why I think the films are comforting. With all the chaos of war, and darkness of human behavior, Foyle moves through it all, self-possessed, caring, and ultimately, even when circumstances beyond his control keep him from actually incarcerating the wrongdoer, successful in protecting his charges from evil.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "104 out of 104 found this helpful.", "date": "8 August 2007"}, {"title": " Intelligent, original and brave", "content": "Foyle's War tackles a great many of perceived truths of World War 2 head on, attempting to show a view of wartime Britain in a new light.

The war is like the weather is in other mysteries; criminals often use it as cover for their activities (blackmarket petrol, draft dodging, burglary, blackmail, and the like hidden by blackouts, bombing raids, and official secrets) and it's the job of the police to uncover all of the layers. In doing so, Chief Inspector Foyle asks hard moral questions - even in wartime, when thousands are being killed every day, is murder murder? The \"bigger picture\" is often cited as justification by the criminals, and, through association, this paints the leaders of the war with the same brush.

The way Kitchen can convey a wealth of meaning with the slightest glance or change in tone when speaking is wonderful to watch. It's almost as if he was born to play this character. Also, the whole concept of police work having to continue as normally as possible in a time of war is intriguing. In many ways, the job would have been so much harder with the backdrop of war and the resultant shortage of resources and increase in disruption. It was a fine idea from the start. Having said that, I found as the series went on and I began to review earlier episodes that something about it had begun to irritate me, and I eventually realised that it was the way in which most of the other characters - apart from Foyle's own inner circle - were portrayed as uniformly negative. Granted, this is a crime and murder-mystery series, so Foyle is dealing primarily with criminals and red-herring characters. But sometimes, it seems as though the writer Anthony Horowitz wants us to believe everyone in wartime Britain was either rotten to the core or afflicted with moral cowardice. No doubt not everyone displayed the \"bulldog spirit\" that got the nation through those difficult years - every country at war has its share of defeatists, shirkers and traitors - but Horowitz seemed unwilling to allow that positive determined quality in any of his \"guest\" characters, whether major or minor in the story. This is especially true of anyone in a position of authority. Just about every single person that Foyle deals with who holds rank or official status is portrayed in varying degrees as arrogant, callous, treacherous, obstructive or incompetent - sometimes a combination of these. It's as though Horowitz wants us to think that either Britain's entire wartime leadership was working against its own national interests or that there was never a sense of righteousness in the fight against Nazism. Foyle's War sometimes seemed to be against his own government and his own superiors.

As I continued in the series, Foyle did not change much, but I adapted and began to truly appreciate the work that went into creating feature-length episodes with intriguing plots and subplots. There is genius in the writing, producing, and acting. The sets and period equipment are very well done and seem very consistent.<br/><br/>I am an avid videophile, and watch all the \"old fashioned\" stuff, whether made from 1930-1950 or made to depict this period. Nearly all the \"modern\" attempts to depict the Word War II period take such liberties and do such violence to the memory of the people and cultures involved, that they are distasteful and unwatchable in my assessment. This British-made \"modern\" treatment is, on the other hand, superb. The idea of mixing wartime England with a police/mystery story is just amazing and well done. Both elements are given appropriate coverage and the balance is artistically maintained.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this series for its quality.

Not because it was gripping, or exceptional. Mostly because the episodes (mind you, all have proper movie length) have a drilling undertone to them,that grows on you like the moss on those Welsh rocks you see all over the place.<br/><br/>The set-up is, I would guess, the new neo-noir (at least I would place them there). It kinda sombre, somewhat depressing, especially when you look at the bleak landscape and the crap weather. And it seems all the 'movies' take place in autumn or even winter. The Welsh title is \"Y gwyll\", the dusk. So, even the colours are kinda dim and gone. That is a real plus.<br/><br/>What really bugs me (and at the same time kept me watching it) are the hints given concerning the characters, both the protagonists, as well as the antagonists, but mostly the protagonists. Little will be told about their motives or the background, and much (much TOO much) will be left to the imagination. However, the characters that suppose to drive the show are, as is the land around them, somewhat bleak and dull, too. Tom Mathias strikes me as a fully-functional, yet utterly depressed. In terms of acting all characters look very real, it's almost like talking to you neighbour.<br/><br/>The movies lack action and purely draw their power from the fact that all involved are somewhat 'broken'. So, if it's some gloomy and depressing real-life crime-drama you want, watch this. And since it's winter in the northern hemisphere, they fit in quite nicely. It's like listening to Norwegian Black Metal, whilst driving through the snowy and desolate peaks of northern Scandinavia. Then you know how this music came about or what kind of mood it is supposed transport. The movies work employing the same tactic, IMO.<br/><br/>One big plus is the slow pace, paired up with nice suspense. Something most movies (or shows) seek to avoid by bright colours, action and flashy detectives. All in all it kind of reminds me of a rural, Welsh/British \"True Detective\". And the use of Welsh yields some credibility. I am hoping for a second season, and I hope for some more insight into the minds of the protagonists. I'd also like to see some more character development (towards bad or good, I do not care).<br/><br/>(S2 update) <br/><br/>So I finished the second series and I am rather taken with it. The character development is still rather slow, but there is enough to work with in order to get a good read on the characters. Also, I am rather surprised that there is so much crime in such a small community. By now the population of the region it is set in should have dropped significantly ;) We're talking some 70k in the region surrounding Aberystwyth. The filming and directing has improved slightly, IMO. There are, however, some plot strands that feel a bit 'forced'. But it's not terribly bad or outlandish. Especially the tie-ins with older cases. I would have expected something like that much earlier (and on a greater scale) considering the small community (see above). All in all a good and worthy continuation of the series- still dark and depressing. And I've found myself enjoying the Welsh parts; a very interesting language.<br/><br/>(S3 update) <br/><br/>The good news is that the pace of the series has not been changed. Pretty much everything that made it great is still there. The writers did a really good job of both coming up with new cases, as well as weaving those past cases and some new plot twists into the overall arc. I also liked the steady, yet moderate, progression of the character development. It might be just me, but I would say that overall acting has slightly improved - maybe because the supporting roles were fleshed out a bit, not sure though and it just might be a gut feeling. The landscape is still dreary, desolate and depressing - like most people who inhabit it.

The lead detective sure does try hard to resuscitate people, though. He seems to pound on chests a lot out in damp fields..

It features attractive girls and plenty of nudity.<br/><br/>With that being said, the show starts off seeming like just a fanservice anime with some elements of a story thrown in, but a story quickly develops--Hyoudou Issei is a perverted high school student who finally gets his first girlfriend, a girl named Yuuma. However, after their first date, she kills him, and it is revealed that she is a fallen angel. He is revived by the gorgeous Rias Gremory, a red-haired beauty that is the president of the Occult Research Club at Issei's school. She tells him that she is a demon, and that he has been revived as a demon to serve as her underling.<br/><br/>The show is funny and has plenty of action and, uh, \"certain\" scenes are prevalent throughout. Unlike an anime like, say, Highschool of the Dead, the fanservice in High School DxD actually serves as somewhat of a plot device (considering Issei's character, I guess that's to be expected).<br/><br/>The story develops further as it progresses, eventually turning into a kind of cutesy, somewhat clich\u00e9 romantic-ish plot. Although the whole nudity thing might fool you, the show's foundation is actually very strong, benefiting from an intriguing story and one of the most likable cast of characters in anime--although I might just be saying that because I'm a member of the target audience.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very light-hearted story about demons, fallen angels, and breasts--although whether you want to make it about breasts is your choice.

It's hilarious to see the excitement the male characters feel when see a someone hot, in this animation. It's just like real life was when one was younger. To be honest, the only difference with getting older (I'm 34) is that you kind of have to act somewhat more maturely. Mind you, as we get older, we certainly don't suffer from the embarrassment or lack of self-confidence experienced by these characters.<br/><br/>You could certainly pick holes in this anime, but I think they made a great job of creating something that has a great deal of truth to it.<br/><br/>As a person who doesn't believe in the supernatural (Gods, Devils, Jesuses, etc) I particularly like the stance that the devils are good and the angels are evil. There's far too much television and film based around Christian mythology, which is irritating. It seems like a cop-out most of the time, because we've had and still have much richer creative ideas than those conceived by the individuals whose literature formed the bible. Nevertheless, this fresh take on Christian mythology is refreshing.<br/><br/>If you consider yourself a non-sexual, or strongly feminist or religious person; I would advice watching this, if only so that I can imagine you cringing at ideas and actions that mirror real life; but are so alien to you that you abhor them.<br/><br/>Enjoy!", "rating": 10, "helpful": "10 out of 13 found this helpful.", "date": "11 February 2017"}, {"title": " I love this Anime I am alive for this Anime", "content": "Brother please try to understand....

This was a great first season that helped build this mythos that can be improved even more in future seasons. The premise of the season sees Superman's Grandfather Seg-El having to deal with life as a refugee on Krypton, until he receives a message from the future that gives him a purpose. Cameron Cruffe plays Seg-El and he does a good job. At first I thought he came across as quite stoic but as the season progressed I became more invested in his character and I really liked his progression as a character over the season. The supporting cast is also really good, the standout in my opinion was former Arrow actor Colin Salmon in a role I will not spoil if you do not already know. He has a really interesting dynamic on the show and I liked how his character interacted with the other characters. Georgina Campbell plays Lyta-Zod and she does a good job in her role, similar to Seg her character is quite bland at first but she grows well over the season with some intriguing twists and turns involved. Shaun Sipos plays Adam Strange and his character was a nice change up from the rest of the cast, his journey is an important one and it shows that this b-list character can be well done if given the chance. Ann Ogbomo plays Jayna-Zod and she had some time and effort put into her character that made her interesting and her dynamic with Lyta is a highlight of the season. Braniac is the main villain of the first season and even though he doesn't have much screen time he was always a presence and in the back of each characters mind. When he does turn up his look is fantastic, like it has been ripped directly from the comic books. The story of the show is very intriguing and unique, seeing these different story arcs coming together comes across very well. It keeps the show moving in different directions that makes each episode a must watch. The script has some decent drama in it that makes you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. However, there are time where it comes across as a bit forced and the elements of humor really don't come across well and feel out of place. The style of the show is grand in scope, the CGI for the citys is fantastic and way more then i expected for a tv show. But they really need to improve the quality of the action scenes for next season, there are just too many cuts in the fight scenes and usually the lighting makes it difficult to understand what is going on. Overall this is a very impressive first season of this show which should be seen by DC fans and casuals alike as it has things for everybody.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "47 out of 60 found this helpful.", "date": "8 October 2018"}, {"title": " Someone needs to pick this up for a new season", "content": "Just finished binge-watching both seasons, and I must say, for a SyFy series, this aint half-bad.

'DC: Legends of tomorrow' are notorious for this. I don't need to be reminded every episode that that one character is gay every time she/he hits the screen. I get it, move the plot forward. But when I see viewers beginning to complaining over what a character looks like, especially a character we've never seen or heard of before, then you just need to stfu.<br/><br/>I stumbled upon one such reviewer who claimed to have used \"logic\" in his/her analysis of 'Krypton.' This user had an issue with the Zod characters being black. \"How was Zod in 'Man of Steel' Caucasian but the Zods here are black? Seems very PC to me Lolz.\"<br/><br/>Apparently this person's \"logic\" failed them. First off there is no such thing as a \"Caucasian Kryptonian\" there is no such thing as a \"Black Kryptonian.\"\nTaking a step back, obvious the characters are portrayed by black and white actors and actress... but haven't you heard of suspended belief in sci-fi? Non of these characters are human. They are ALIENS from an alien society! Secondly, the Zod and El names are house names not family names. Lastly, Kryptonians are born Gatica style. There are no natural births (that we're aware of) until Superman comes around. Kryptonains are adopted into these houses so they can look like whatever they like.<br/><br/>\"But... But you don't see no one trying to make Black Panther white though.\"\nWell Black Panther is a human being from Africa, not an alien born in a test tube from another planet.<br/><br/>Anyway with that aside. I'd like to say that this show is great for the DC Universe. For one, I like the fact that the same writers who were behind many of DC's animated series are also behind this show. DC animations are excellent in my books, far better than Marvel animations due to the fact that DC animations focus more so on the everyday side of superheroes and their reception to the broader public that they have sworn themselves to protect.

He muddies the water and diminishes the lead character. I want Seg-El to fight for his own reasons rather than some unknowable descendant or some preordained future.

Throughout the game, if one were to be killed, the player would also die in the real world.<br/><br/>In this anime, you never know who is going to die next which keeps the viewers constantly on edge. A character that might have seemed important could be killed at any moment and the fact that those characters actually die in the real world makes the story even more emotional. The story itself is definitely unique and entertaining. The action/fighting is good and the emotions run high in this anime, however, it does have a few flaws. <br/><br/>First off, everything feels rushed in the first half of this anime. In a world that has 100 floors, you only see about 10 of them. To me, I found it annoying to find out that the next episode he had made it 20 floors higher without any explanation. I understand that you can't show him fighting on each floor level, but it could have been more gradual than going from (ex.) floor 20 to floor 47. The first story is completed within 14 episodes and that is it's problem. They do not give enough time for the stories to develop fully. You meet new characters in the beginning of an episode and towards the end of that episode many days have gone by within the anime but truly you've only seen them throughout one episode of 20 minutes, not 2-3 episodes. So when those (not-so) new characters die at the end of the episode where they were first introduced, it doesn't pack the punch it could have had those characters been in the anime longer.<br/><br/>Secondly, SAO lacks Character depth. After watching 14 episodes of Sword Art Online, you know barely anything about the main characters. They still manage to make you like and care for them, but I think that these feelings could have been amplified had we known more about them. <br/><br/>----------- Now for the second half: SPOILERS<br/><br/>The story continues into a new video game in which Kirito enters in order to save his lover Asuna. In this new game if you get killed, you simply respawn. After watching the first half of SAO, this second half right away seems pathetic and childlike. This story focuses on love instead of survival and in my opinion it should have never have been made. They really should have just spent the extra episodes on the first story. This would have fixed the two flaws I pointed out: They could have added more character depth and not made the anime feel as rushed.

She plays the tsudere role pretty well at first, but towards episode 10 or so she increasingly becomes nothing more than the helpless waifu to worry when Kirito is in danger. <br/><br/>And now I start with the problems in this show. <br/><br/>This is the basic format for the first half: 1) Introduce cute female character. 2) Let us see lots of her breasts and other body parts 3) Ideally invent some situation that involves her accidentally showing a bit too much body, then getting really embarrassed or angry. 4) Invent random monster for Kirito to fight, female character must be in need of protection. 5) Have some speech about love or hope or something 6) Rinse and repeat. <br/><br/>There's a little bit of a sidetrack with some hentai porn, but that's most of the first half. Then we have a similar situation in the second half, but just with the same female character (Sugu) on repeat whilst the supposed 'love' of Kirito is all trapped in a cage being molested so all the creepy people watching can masturbate. <br/><br/>To illustrate Characters who appear in more than one episode:<br/><br/>Kirito, male - basically Goku<br/><br/>Sugu, female in love with Kirito<br/><br/>Asuna in love with Kirito<br/><br/>Lisbeth, f in love with K<br/><br/>Silica, f in love with K<br/><br/>Alicia, f who hits on K<br/><br/>Sakuya, f who hits on K (lots of fan service)<br/><br/>Klein, m<br/><br/>Agil, m<br/><br/>Kuradeel, m<br/><br/>Basicaly most of the characters who actually do things are females and what they do is have their bodies exhibited for the viewer while they're saved by the all powerful Kirito who they then fall in love with. <br/><br/>I could go on about the grand lists of plot holes, things that don't make sense, amount of boring dialog/things that happen and the fact I never once feared for any of the main characters. But that'll just be waffle.

Being a long time MMO player and anime watcher, an anime about an MMO seemed like it would be right up my ally. How wrong I was.<br/><br/>The show revolves around the main character Kirito and his in-game (and later IRL) girlfriend Asuna and their story after they get trapped within an MMO that causes its players to die for real if they die within the game. It seemed like an interesting concept that was executed in all the wrong ways.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to an anime about the struggles of being trapped within an MMO world and the quest to level up and beat the final boss to \"escape\" the MMO. However, instead of focusing on that quest, the series focuses heavily on the romance aspect of the series. Much of the leveling and dungeoning process is simply skipped over in favor of giving the main male lead Kirito more time with one of his many lady friends (namely Asuna). At one point during the show, the series goes way off track when Kirito and Asuna decide to get married in game and go have a honeymoon for 2 whole episodes (Two whole episodes of this!). I would have rather seen a series where the leveling and dungeoning process was the main point, and the romance was simply secondary. Instead, the romance takes up much the the series, and the actual MMO parts are pushed to the side or simply skimmed over. This seems rather contradictory, as one would think the characters would be more focused on leveling and beating the game instead of romancing each other, considering they are trapped there and could potentially die.<br/><br/>However, the most glaring problem with this anime is the inconsistency with the two main characters. Asuna, the main female lead and Kirito's love interest, changes multiple times for apparently no reason throughout the first season. She is first portrayed as a strong player that is also a loner, and refusing any offers to partner up with others. Later, after a timeskip, she is shown again, but this time instead as a Tsundre, bossy person that is now in a guild for some reason (despite claiming to be a loner). Some time after that, she turns into a doting, pushover, waifu type of character and remains that way for the rest of the series. All of these personality changes occur without any explanation or plot element that would explain a shift in personality.<br/><br/>However, with as bad as Asuna is, the main character Kirito is 100x worse. He is by far the worst gary stu I've ever seen in an anime. The series essentially revolves around proving how awesome and special Kirito is. Kirito, like Asuna, is originally described as a loner that prefers to play alone, also known as a \"beater\" in the game. The series gets this wrong right off the bat as they tell us he has this personality instead of showing us. This supposed loner personality is constantly contradicted, as only a couple episodes into the show, Kirito joins a guild and is constantly meeting, playing with, and helping other players. A pretty odd thing for a loner to do right? Oddly enough, all of these players he helps are attractive females in revealing armor that all fall in love with him for no real reason. After a few episodes of this, I realized that this was in fact a harem anime, not the action/adventure I originally thought it was.<br/><br/>Instead of showing leveling and dungeoning progression, each episode of this anime either has Kirito wooing some new girl to add to his harem or romancing Asuna. Amongst the girls that are in his harem, there is also his sister/cousin that has also fallen in love with him for some reason. Of course, Kirito ultimately chooses Asuna, since she is the prettiest and most powerful girl in the game. Don't expect to see many male characters that aren't evil or incredibly peripheral in this series, there's only room for Kirito and his various harem girls.<br/><br/>Kirito always wins his battles through some kind of plot armor, exaggerated to the point where it even breaks the rules of the game at a couple points. He has a special dual wielding ability that no one else has for no other reason aside from the fact that he's special, and also frequently uses other abilities that shouldn't even be possible. At no point is there ever a fear of him dying or even losing, as you know there will always be some random power up he gets that allows him to win.<br/><br/>And unfortunately, this series and its plot only get worse as the series progresses. As bad as the first half of the first season was, it only gets worse. After escaping Sword Art Online, later arcs portray Kirito and his harem girls in their adventures in other mmos. For one, you'd think the characters would be hesitant to play other mmos after their experience in SAO (not much is really said about the people who actually died from the game). But nope, they jump into other mmos without even thinking about it. And these other mmo arcs lose what little plot suspense the first arc had, as they take away the risk of dying that the first mmo arc had.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Sword Art Online is just a harem, fanservice anime with little plot/character development or consistency. Everything about it is gimmicky and poorly executed to the point where it has no saving graces (that is, unless you're into the fanservice). There are plenty of good shounen animes out there and this simply isn't one of them.

And this has been perhaps the best read I've had in ages. The storyline, characters, vastness of the world and romance between Asuna and Kirito are perfect, and the twists will leave you dying for more. If you're here for an anime with a great storyline, have played any RPGS or enjoy a little romance mixed with action and suspense, then this is the anime for you. Although there has only been 4 episodes (at the time of this review), the anime has covered a substantial part of volume 2 in the sword art series, so from here on out the main and incredible storyline will be followed. The animation is beautiful to say the least, and will no doubt accurately represent the amazing setting from the light novels as well as the character models. The voice acting for the main characters Asuna and Kirito have been spot on (of course), and the sound quality is overall, like the animation, perfect.<br/><br/>As I hinted at above, the story will have you hooked from the beginning , I'm sure many of you have played RPGS, and if you died in those RPGS, you'd respawn and try again of course. But in this anime, the RPG becomes real life, if you health bar drops you're killed almost instantly in real life. With that kind of premise, this anime will be very suspenseful and engaging. I'll focus on the main characters for now because most of the others haven't been fairly introduced yet. Off the bat you can tell Kirito isn't the average anime protagonist, he chooses to go solo for the sake of his own survival rather than stay with his \"noob\" friend and protecting him in the VRMMORPG. This might seem like a shortcoming, but in the novels he quickly changes upon meeting Asuna (his main love interest+party member), and becomes a character you'll love. Asuna is very strong willed and at first seems to contrast with the anti-social and awkward Kirito, but we later find out how similar they are, and their relationship is perhaps the best I've seen in any other anime or Manga. This anime will only be about 25 or 26 episodes long, covering just volumes 1,2, and perhaps some of 8 in the process, if it does well enough movies and ova's or even another season could be launched, allowing us to further immerse in this incredible universe. <br/><br/>And I'm sure by the time this anime is finished (or long before), everyone will be rushing to read the novels, and they won't be disappointed!", "rating": 10, "helpful": "62 out of 116 found this helpful.", "date": "30 October 2012"}, {"title": " Over hyped and kind of stupid, but enjoyable nonetheless", "content": "I have mixed feelings about this show.

Kiriyaga Kazuto (Kirito) is one of the beta- testers for this game and was able to easily get his hands on one of the limited 10,000 copies sold in Japan. But things take a \"deadly\" turn when the video-game's creator, Kayaba Akihiko, forces players to keep playing until someone manages to beat the game. In order to do so, players must defeat 100 \"bosses\"; each on it's own level in the game and each more powerful than the other. If players die in the game, or someone in the real world attempts to take off the NerveGear, the NerveGear's micro-wave safety system will turn off and it will fry their brain, killing them in real life. <br/><br/>The first three episodes were absolutely incredible! You automatically become drawn into the story, the characters are all so diverse, and the incredible action sequences have you hanging on the edge of your seat! There is so much at stake, and everyone is sacrificing so much to ensure that the game will be beat. The series also grows tense as trust between people grow thin, and players even start to kill one another to ensure their own survival.<br/><br/>Each of the characters was completely unique because they all had their own strengths and weaknesses, forcing everyone to work together in order to survive. One of the most notable side characters is Asuna, an attractive and shy girl who really knows how to wield a sword. She manages to help Kirito defeat the first boss as if they both did it before. I didn't have a doubt that she would be a very strong character that would help Kirito throughout the series.<br/><br/>The train started to move really fast, and everything was going fine. That is, until episode four. That's when the series completely \"jumped the shark\" and became what I hoped it would not become; a harem romance series with a worthless male protagonist.<br/><br/>Starting at Episode 4, the series starts to skip a lot of levels, so you miss-out on a lot of the story and action. And it's starting at Episode 4 when it starts to slowly sink in that Kirito isn't all that much of a nice guy.<br/><br/>Kirito may be strong, but he only cares about himself and becoming the most powerful character in the game. He hides secrets from his allies which lead to their inevitable deaths, he puts the lives of strangers on the line just to get a more powerful sword, and often uses other people as a means to help him grind his way up the rankings. <br/><br/>What makes this character even more despicable is how many girls are attracted to him and how he treats those girls.<br/><br/>It is a given fact that girls are attracted to strong, independent and cute guys, even if they are completely heartless. I have no idea what these girls see in Kirito (besides how he's one of the strongest characters in SAO). Rather than this, once a new female characters is introduced into the series, they are completely forgotten after the next episode. <br/><br/>In other words, not only are there far too many side-characters in this series, Kirito doesn't care about a single one of them. Not many people who watch this series notice this, though, and that's why this show is completely over-rated (because a good story doesn't really matter, right?)<br/><br/>But that's okay, at least we got Asuna to make the series worth watching, right? <br/><br/>WRONG! <br/><br/>By the time the series ends, Asuna goes from being a strong and independent heroin to a damsel-in-distress who can do nothing without Kirito around. The writers completely ruined Asuna's character just to please the large crowd of fan-boys, and that's unacceptable! <br/><br/>As for the action, it's still there, but only in a couple of episodes for short periods of time. The music and animation is still as good as it was in the beginning, however, there is no good plot to make watching this series worth it. And by then end of the series, nothing is explained. <br/><br/>There is no motive to why the game creator trapped people inside SAO, or how Kirito managed to come back to life for a short moment in time only to somehow kill the final boss (which was suppose to be immortal) with ONE STAB. <br/><br/>AND THEN THERE'S THE SECOND HALF OF SAO, which is when \"Alfheim Online\" gets introduced. It's as if the writers made the second-half of the series just to please the fan-boys and further throw SAO's potential out the window.<br/><br/>This section of the anime is even hated by the most die-hard SAO fans for a reason; the suspense and action from the first part simply isn't there. The second-half just throws cute girls in your face and the series becomes extremely awkward and annoying, especially once Kirito's sister gets introduced (and if you've watched enough anime, then you know where this is going). <br/><br/>If I were to compare this show to another television show, it would definitely be the series LOST. It started off with incredible potential, then it just went downhill and never came back up.<br/><br/>In conclusion, \"Sword Art Online\" had incredible potential as an action series, and the first three episodes proved that.

I promise you will enjoy it very much. :)<br/><br/>-------------- SPOILERS AHEAD --------------------<br/><br/>As a gamer myself, this story is like a gamer's dream come true. Virtual reality and MMORPG together is as awesome as gaming can get - and this story laid out all the possibilities that a gamer could imagine. As you travel through the story following the protagonist Kirito, you really do feel what it's like to play MMORPG like you are actually living in that virtual world.<br/><br/>But that's not all... The story has the amazing premise that you put your life on the line to play this game. With life and death involved, it becomes far more interesting as you see what kind of choices the characters make, and their emotions are much more raw and real - fear, despair, hope, courage, love... etc.<br/><br/>Even though you already know by fact that the protagonist does not die in stories EVER (99.9% of the time), but you still can't help but be on the edge of your seat whenever the characters' lives are in danger because it is a real \"death game\". For me, what got me the most hooked was the characters' strong will to survive, their way of sacrificing for each other, and their ability to unite as one in will and heart in order to \"save the world\". All these sound so clich\u00e9 but they are truly the most attractive qualities of the show. :)<br/><br/>With that being said, the life-and-death risk ends at episode 14 where the game is cleared. To be honest, I didn't like how the game was cleared (at least in the anime), because it was never explained how Kirito \"came back to life\" and how Asuna did too later on. I know they are the main characters, but that does not align with the rules of that virtual world... D: It makes me frustrated how there are \"exceptions\" to the system just to make certain things happen. But the other amazing parts of the story can make up for these minor flaws.<br/><br/>What happens after episode 14 is really the main flaw of SAO. It should've just ended at episode 14 to wrap up this wonderful story. With no life-risking factor in the following arc of the story, everything becomes bland and less meaningful. I won't go into much details because simply to put... the second part was a waste of time.<br/><br/>Overall, the story (up until ep.14) is 9/10 in my book. :)<br/><br/>By the way, if you are a gamer, the music compositions will surely make you nostalgic.

On the day of launch, 10,000 players of the first VRMMORPG: Sword Art Online, receive news on Aincrad's dark secret: they are unable to log-out, and a death in- game equals a death in real life. Despite the general idea you'd get from the first episode, the story actually goes for a more meaningful theme of exploring the psychological impacts on individuals and exploring what is real when the line between virtual reality and reality begin to blur. It actually ends up being fairly light-hearted and has touches of slice-of-life in some areas and tackles some touchy subjects in our world, such as PTSD, all while still maintaining a suspenseful and emotional thrillers for the arcs that have them. There are many life lessons to take from this anime, but plan to analyze if you want to find them all. There are many plot twists throughout the series and some of its major strengths are addressing how certain happenings are possible in the story and foreshadowing of plot elements that are usually brought into fruition in later arcs. There is plenty of exposition on the world's rules and some of the more confusing plot elements through dialogue, so if you're aiming to fully understand the story, it's necessary to pay attention. However, some of the finer details are only in the light novels, so if you're still interested in fully understanding it, time must be devoted to reading them. It's also worth mentioning that some plots can be clich\u00e9, such as Fairy Dance's main goal, and can have uncomfortable scenes. 10/10 for an overall narrative. Arc 1-Aincrad: 10/10, Arc 2- Fairy Dance: 7/10, Arc 3-Phantom Bullet: 9.5/10, Arc 4-Calibur and Mother's Rosario: 6/10 for Calibur, 10/10 for Mother's Rosario.<br/><br/>Animation and Sound: Nothing short of a masterpiece in both of these categories. The MMO worlds are breathtaking to say the least. Whether it be the Middle Age-like Aincrad, the Norse mythology inspired Alfheim, or the Cyberpunk world of SBC Glocken, there are plenty of worlds to get lost in in this anime. The soundtrack is by the ever talented Yuki Kajiura, known for her work in Madoka Magica and Fate/Zero, and, needless to say, it fits the tone of the anime and the situations. The voice acting, in my opinion, was great between both the English subs and the English dub. 10/10 for both.<br/><br/>Characters: This category is what sold me and cemented Sword Art Online at my #1 favorite anime series. The main characters are fully realized, both in characterization and character development. I'll only go into a few since covering the main 5 for the individual arcs focused on would be a little too long. Kirito is an introverted, rude on occasions, but very kind individual who still manages to suffer from serious guilt over the course of the series for reasons I don't want to spoil, and he grows as a person throughout his adventures to the MMO worlds. Asuna, in my opinion, hasn't gotten enough credit I believe she deserves as a character. She's proactive to the plot, sweet, fairly smart, yet short-tempered and has trouble speaking her mind when faced with legitimate authority. The side characters, while sidelined shortly after getting screen time, were enjoyable. Some of them have simple backgrounds and don't measure up to the main characters in terms of depth, but they all have personalities that fit them, and the episodes make sure to let you know their place in the world, mainly to make the world feel more alive. 9/10 for SAO I, 10/10 for SAO II. Overall rating for category: 10/10<br/><br/>Enjoyment: It isn't my absolute favorite anime for nothing. It's a phenomenal series and shouldn't be passed-up due to a controversy that I personally consider ridiculous. 10/10<br/><br/>Overall: 9.5/10 for SAO I, 10/10 for SAO II. Overall for entire series: 10/10<br/><br/>If you love romance, thrillers, slice-of-life, action, and adventure with meaningful messages spread throughout, and don't mind a series that tackles touchy subjects with a couple of uncomfortable scenes, I'd highly recommend checking Sword Art Online out.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "10 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "19 May 2016"}, {"title": " Best anime I've ever seen in my life", "content": "I just got done watching Sword Art Online episodes 1-14.

That's why they have the resurrection item like Disgaea mentioned. There is a delay before the player is killed in the real world, following his avatar's death. ... Now, the same can be said about Kirito killing Kayaba.<br/><br/>Season 2\nA year after escaping Sword Art Online, Kazuto Kirigaya has been settling back into the real world. However, his peace is short-lived as a new incident occurs in a game called Gun Gale Online, where a player by the name of Death Gun appears to be killing people in the real world by shooting them in-game. Approached by officials to assist in investigating the murders, Kazuto assumes his persona of Kirito once again and logs into Gun Gale Online, intent on stopping the killer.\nOverall this season is more thrilling compared to season one, The second season begins with a new virtual reality MMORPG called Gun Gale Online. Rumors are circulating about a person named Death Gun who can fire a bullet in the game that will also kill people in real life. Kirito, the protagonist of the last season, starts working with the Ministry of Internal Affairs to investigate whether such a thing is possible. This arc starts off as a mystery, but it suffers from pacing problems that make it hard to keep an invested interest. The deuteragonist, Sinon, is an avid Gun Gale Online player. She's a well-known sniper in the game, and she even plans on competing in a competition with the silliest name imaginable (Bullet of Bullets). Kirito and Sinon end up working together as Sinon helps Kirito find Death Gun, and Kirito helps Sinon through her fears.<br/><br/>When Sinon was a young girl, a man barged into the post office and aimed a gun at her mother. Sinon managed to take the gun from him and shot him. Because of this event, Sinon is terrified of guns and is playing Gun Gale Online as immersion therapy to conquer her fears. Sinon's stress triggers whenever she comes into close contact with guns or realistic replicas. At first, this seems like a well done representation of a trigger - Sinon panics when she tries to hold the gun replica she keeps in her desk at home. Her breathing becomes labored and she can only remember how terrified she felt the time she held a gun and killed someone. It's surprisingly dark for Sword Art Online, and the show would have pulled it off had it not done it in such an overdramatic manner. The over the top, highly saturated red in the background and an unreasonable amount of blood flowing across the floor distract from the terror Sinon feels.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "10 out of 17 found this helpful.", "date": "1 January 2019"}, {"title": " Amazing", "content": "Ignore the negative reviews, and see it for yourself.\nIt is actually one of my favourite series I have watched, the bond between Kirito and Asuna is special.

Also finding there is a Light Novel to read and you can see from the manga it heavily improves apon the source showing how anime should improve the source.<br/><br/>Ok let's get on to the main character in short are very expressive and a joy to watch. Rimuru's voice fits perfectly and for a slime it's(slimes are genderless) expressions are pretty wide for a slime. We even see how Rimuru effects the world and how he interacts with others. Also just to note It's an overpowered protagonist but isn't the most powerful in the land yet.<br/><br/>The comedy elements work very well when melded with Slime's story and characters but remember comedy is subjective so not everyone will interpret it the same. From my experience it had me laughing out loud at certain adult jokes and character facial expressions. Other characters definitely have their momments and the interaction between characters are just great.<br/><br/>This may be a light heart comedy at timed but it can get dark.

The story starts well and Rimuru is a fine central character; he may be very powerful, after gaining many new skills, but he is keen to make friends and forge alliances rather than the usual more confrontational stories. That doesn't mean there is no excitement though; many enemies need to see just how strong he is before they become friends.

Not in the tired \"Scream\" sense of self-awareness, but in its willingness to mix genres and blur boundaries. At the most basic level it's a Space Western. But Bebop is not content to be merely that, so there are added dashes of film noir, gothic horror, creature-feature, black comedy, screwball comedy, spy action, crime, romance, tragedy, action, philosophy, science, spirituality, fatalism, optimism, buddy-buddy stories, slapstick humour, parody-- just about every type of tale under the sun appears in some shape or form during Bebop's run. It's a show where each episode really is different from the last. Were it not for the recurring characters, it would be hard to believe that the brightly-coloured blaxploitation parody \"Mushroom Samba\" could possibly come from the same series as the bleakly violent \"Real Folk Blues\".<br/><br/>The world that the series inhabits is distinctly post-modern, too; space ships fly through hyperspace gates, but once on the ground their pilots fight with twentieth-century handguns. Scenic bays would look for all the world like they were taken from modern-day Japan were they not dwarfed by Jupiter, the enormous gas giant looming in the sky like some enormous benevolent god.<br/><br/>And the music - tribal drums and chants give way to electronic pulses that give way to jazz sax and trumpets that give way to rock guitars that give way to blues harmonicas... composer Yoko Kanno faultlessly turns her hand to an eclectc selection of genres and instruments, ably backed up by her band, \"Seatbelts\".<br/><br/>All of which sounds terribly impressive, but why on Earth should you watch it? Because, buddy, it's one of the finest television shows ever made.<br/><br/>I have to admit I'm not a big anime fan. Most anime that makes it over here seems to be either about schoolgirls with supernatural powers who battle evil, or adolescent boys who - for some convoluted reason - wind up having to pilot big giant robots. And whilst I'm assured that shows such as Escaflowne (schoolgirls and magic) and Evangelion (boys and robots) are actually rather good, they completely fail to get my blood pumping.<br/><br/>\nEnter Bebop. Ultra cool Spike, grumpy strategist Jet, trigger-happy Faye, nutball Ed and intelligent dog Ein are as far away from the usual brats and bots anime as you can possibly get. Their motivation, too, is far from the usual anime fare. These guys aren't bounty hunters because they want to fight crime and keep the peace - all they want is a wad of cash, and bounty hunting seems like the best place to make big money fast. Although they will do the right thing when pressed, they rarely forget their true motivation - and if they do, their perpetual lack of food will soon remind them. Life isn't easy, and when you're a bounty hunter it's even harder.<br/><br/>Not that the crew of the spaceship Bebop are one-note characters. As the series progresses, our initial assumptions about the characters are overturned. At first Spike appears to be the cliched laid-back slacker (who just happens to be a mean jeet-kun-do fighter), but we then learn of his fall from the criminal underworld and of a loss that killed him emotionally. Jet's the obvious gruff authority figure, until we realise that he actually cares for the crew of the Bebop as if they were his kids (and seems to have dabbled in pot and psychadelic drugs when he was a teenager). Faye's the usual feisty stand-offish female lead but only because her amazingly tragic past makes her push away friends for fear that she'll become attached to them. Ed's just some nutty kid until we meet her crazy father and realise that it could well be her deprived childhood that sent her over the edge. And Ein? Well sometimes it's hard being a super intelligent Welsh Corgi on a ship where nobody appreciates you, you know?<br/><br/>But not every episode is deathly serious - the character development is mixed in perfectly with humour (both light and dark), fistfights, shoot-outs, car chases, aerial fights, space battles and some of the lushest animation you'll see in an animated TV series. And all of this spread over only 26 episodes.<br/><br/>Yes, many people espouse the old \"leave 'em wanting more\" line, but so few of them actually do it; Buffy the Vampire Slayer is the perfect example of a series that spends three or four years being top-notch TV then freefalls due to apparent apathy from both the cast and writers. Bebop avoids this by wrapping every dangling plot thread up in just one season of television. And after the final jaw-dropping episode it's quite clear that the series is most definitely over.<br/><br/>Never before or since have I seen a series of such astonishing variety, intelligence and style.

However, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, it's basically about space bounty hunters set to an old time jazz music soundtrack with plenty of classy old time stories and dark morals along the way. If you like action, space, jazz, or comedy, you may like Cowboy Bebop. If you like old time bounty hunter, private eye, or detective movies, you'll probably like Cowboy Bebop. If you like dark stories with twists that really make you feel for the characters, you'll like Cowboy Bebop. This is one series you don't have to be an anime fan to appreciate, but you have to be willing to give it a fair chance.<br/><br/>A single episode of Cowboy Bebop packs more punch than several entire anime series I know of. If you're not a fan of the show by the end of episode one alone, you probably won't be. The characters are as real as any old time bounty hunter / detective movie, and every bit as interesting. The sci-fi space twist doesn't take away from the show in the slightest, it adds much. A good way of thinking about the show is Lupin the 3rd mixed with Outlaw Star, with more depth. With episode titles like Asteroid Blues, Honky Tonk Woman, Waltz for Venus, and Jupiter Jazz, the space, class, and jazz heavy style is quite apparent from the beginning. This isn't just some theme slapped on top of an anime, rather a critical part of the show.<br/><br/>The characters are well rounded and all very interesting. Unlike a lot of anime, there is no annoying character you wish they would have left out. Each character is given equal importance, though the show centers on the bounty hunter Spike.<br/><br/>Spike describes himself as an \"old fashioned cowboy.\" He spends a lot of the series searching for someone he once knew, I'll avoid details so I don't spoil anything. He could be a master thief if he so choose, his dexterity and fighting skills are nearly unmatched. With a good 'whatever' attitude, he's great fun to watch.<br/><br/>Jet is more of an old time detective. He's the owner of the ship \"Bebop\", and best friend of Spike. He does his fair share in bounty hunting like Spike, mostly gathering information and providing backup to Spike.<br/><br/>Faye is pretty much the anime embodiment of the women from detective movies. A fiercely materialistic woman, she does whatever it takes to get what she wants. She's not against stealing from anyone or using anyone to get it, then leaving them cold. An incredible bounty hunter in her own right, she joins the team without invitation or welcome. Much hilarious bickering and bounty thefts come between Faye and Spike from the outset.<br/><br/>Ed is a hacker genius girl who joins the group after a promise from Faye to get information. They try to leave her dry after they get what they need. but Ed's hacking skills make that impossible. She's often comic relief, and may be insane. Who can tell? In any case, when hacking or computer skills are needed, Ed is there. When not needed, she's. still there, being a hilarious pain in the neck. She's often with Ein, a seemingly ordinary mutt that gets picked up along the way with a few not so hidden talents.<br/><br/>In any case, Cowboy Bebop is a series anyone should watch. It has some language, a lot of violence, and some dark stories, but nothing that any kid these days hasn't seen a hundred times over. Even if you're not a bounty hunter or jazz fan, give this series a shot. Don't be surprised if you start to take a liking to jazz music or Yoko Kanno's amazing music.

Shinichi Watanabe crafted this mostly episodic anime with a beautiful plot arc that doesn't detract a bit from any moment in the series.<br/><br/>Following the misadventures of a crew of unlikely bounty hunters through the future solar system, Bebop liberally dabbles in jazz, both the music and the attitude.  The lead character, Spike Spiegel, is as much an antihero in the anime tradition as he would be in a Hemingway novel- witty and gutsy, with a twist of nihlistic worldview.

Simply put, the show is amazing. From the art, to the music, and most importantly, the story line - Cowboy Bebop delivers. Although most reviewers have summed up the storyline fairly well, I'll give a brief overview.<br/><br/>In the not so distant future, many planets have been colonized and huge technological advancements have been made, but enough with the obvious. Two men, Spike and Jet meet up with future comrades Faye and Ed and team up (or fly it solo) to form the most effective bounty hunting team in the universe. Technology benefits both bounty hunter (known as Cowboys) and criminal as the crew of the Bebop Ship try to make an honest Wulong (the futuristic form of currency) while each member encounters shades of their illuminous past.<br/><br/>A huge bondship amongst the characters is felt almost from the start, despite on-going tensions on the Bebop. Furthermore, each character is given at least two whole episodes, which elaborate on their past, which intertwines oddly with the present (an on-going theme in Cowboy Bebop).<br/><br/>Their pasts are as diverse as their personalities and at some points you'll have a hard time even figuring out who the main character is. One is a former worker of a crime syndicate, one a former police officer, one a thief, and the last a computer hacker. Some similarities do exist though, namely stylish outfits and attitudes, but even then, these similarities are VERY few. <br/><br/>The coolest thing about Cowboy Bebop is it's ability to give you something drastically different each session (don't call it an episode, it's a session). Some sessions wrap you up in action, some make you cry, still some sessions will make you roll on the ground in laughter. One thing for sure is you will get a very satisfying feeling once the credits hit.<br/><br/>The soundtrack for the entire series is another high point. Virtually each session is entangled in some form of sophisticated music, usually Jazz, which is a welcome breeze from the stagnation of today's modern music.<br/><br/>Compared to other anime, Bebop reigns supreme (along with a couple of others), and puts kids shows like Dragon Ball Z (which are virtually plotless in the light of Cowboy Bebop) to shame.

When I hear that word I think of Cartoon Network, of the overly wordy internal monologues from 'Speed Racer,' of the pseudo-interesting transformation scenes from 'Sailor Moon,' of one person rushing at another from what appears to be several hundred yards away in 'Dragonball Z,' of convoluted plots and robots that pull mile-long guns out of thin air in 'Gundam 0083.'  It's all overly ridiculous, and in their attempts to look 'cool' a lot of animes instead end up looking stupid.<br/><br/>So boy was I surprised when I first saw 'Cowboy Bebop.'<br/><br/>I'm still in the process of watching all 26 episodes, so I don't know everything about the series, but from what I've seen, it's head-and-shoulders better than any anime out there.<br/><br/>It's a fairly simple premise: around 2020 there was a weird explosion which took out part of Luna and put moon rocks in orbit around Earth in a miniature asteroid belt.  Earth was rendered more or less uninhabitable, but the same weird explosion also held the keys to Hyperspace Gates, a safe and reliable form of transportation which the planetless Earthlings used to colonize their solar system.  With this expansion came an explosion in the Mafia, the black market, the criminal underworld; to control it, InterStellar Space Police was created.  But even the ISSP wasn't enough, and so the Police began to put out bounties on criminals.  A subculture of bounty hunters evolved; best estimates suggest that there are over 300,000 in the Sol system alone.  They have revived and adopted an ancient title: \"Cowboy.\"<br/><br/>'Cowboy Bebop' focuses on the travels of bounty hunter Spike Spiegel, a tall, lanky martial artist who oozes more style than Baz Luhrmann.  He and his partner Jet Black travel the solar system in their ship, the Bebop (hence the title of the show), tracking down bounties and entertaining their audiences again and again.  But it's not entirely accurate to say that the show FOCUSES on Spike and Jet, because there are two main characters who join the show in later episodes--Faye Valentine, a sexy, outrageous woman with a shadowed past and no tact (and a wardrobe that the animators seem to enjoy making look like it might fall off at any given moment) and a bizarre 13-year-old girl named Ed (don't ask) who can basically hack into any computer system and provides surreal comic relief on the side.  But it's not entirely accurate to say the show focuses on THEM, either, because the star is undeniably Spike.  The show starts and ends with his past.  What about that past?  Ah, but that would be telling.<br/><br/>In a medium where characters routinely jump fifty feet into the air and then produce huge beams of energy from somewhere, CB's realism is welcome and refreshing.  The animation is fluid and subtle--watching Spike fist-fight the week's bounty in the premier episode is a sight to behold.  It's obvious that the animators have put a lot more thought into realistic movement than they normally do.  These cel-bound wonders are mixed with a sprinkling of CGI that would do Babylon 5 proud.  All together, it creates a visually appealing mix, made even more endearing by the fact that the laws of physics evidently still apply.  Despite his extensive martial arts training, Spike produces no energy beams, makes no Matrix-esque leaps, and more or less keeps his feet planted on the earth, the same as the series does.<br/><br/>Characters are handled exquisitely.  With only four characters and 26 episodes to deal with, it's a little easier to keep everything vigorous and interesting, but it's still refreshing to see CB using ALL of its characters in EVERY episode--and generally managing to develop them all too.  I know of NO television series where every episode manages to add something new to every character.  Frankly, I don't think there is one.  That alone says something about CB's quality.<br/><br/>Finally, we have the music.  It's no coincidence that the show is named after a style of music, and composer Yoko Kanno has created over three hours worth of lush, diverse, interesting music for the series.  In a medium where music is created, thrown away on a weekly basis, and generally only exists to warn the viewer that something significant is going to happen, Cowboy Bebop uses its soundtrack to maximum effect.  I've only seen eleven episodes, but I can already point to three or four moments when the music absolutely MAKES the scene, and I've probably missed more.<br/><br/>One thing I should say--Cowboy Bebop, like most animes, isn't really meant as commentary or satire.  It is not intended to be socially relevant, to present controversial themes, to make viewers sit up and re-evaluate their lives.  It is simply intended to entertain--and that it does.  The stories it tells are not unique, but the way they are told is.  Strong animation is combined with incredible storytelling and extraordinary music to create an anime unlike any other.

Our four main characters that are bound together by greed, revenge, and desire.<br/><br/>Little to no background information is given about any of the characters from the beginning. Each character has a past that is hidden throughout many episodes. Slowly, the audience learns of the sins and tragedies that quietly haunt those aboard the spaceship of Bebop.<br/><br/>art~10<br/><br/>Despite being over a decade and a half the animations in cowboy bebop are amazing in providing the dangerous rugged environment of this criminal filled space.<br/><br/>Sunrise, who generally do an excellent job on animation, really pushed the boat out with this series. when compared with other shows that were released around the same time (Outlaw Star for example), it can clearly be seen that the art, animation and character design in Cowboy Bebop is something special. The animation during the numerous action sequences is especially impressive and the character movements are free-flowing and naturalistic.<br/><br/>The outdated animations contribute greatly to the classy western style of the anime. Everything from the smoke of cigarettes to guns blazing are portrayed brilliantly. The choreography of martial arts and space flight is done in a fluid and smooth fashion. The characters look great and production never seems to drop for a single moment.<br/><br/>sound~9.5 First off, the music. All music is performed by The Seatbelts and they are outstandingly good.<br/><br/>I wholeheartedly believe that it is safe to say that regardless of your ideas about Cowboy Bebop, everyone can agree that the music in this anime is absolutely amazing. So amazing that without the music I believe that Cowboy Bebop would never have achieved the success it has had to this day. Never have I come across another example such as Cowboy Bebop where the music is such an integral part of the show. From the Blues to the unmatched soul of harmonica solos, the music in Cowboy Bebop does its job 110%. To say that the the music is fitting would be an understatement. Cowboy Bebop's music boosts the atmosphere and situation of every scene to its highest potential and provides a convincing atmosphere like no other.<br/><br/>The dub of Cowboy Bebop is the arguably the most highly praised dub ever produced in the anime industry and also my favorite. Watanabe Shinichiro even stated that he believed the English dub surpasses the Japanese dub, a feat that is notoriously rare. Every character's voice is portrayed brilliantly with every word filled with real human emotion. The English voice acting is truly a one of a kind in a world of horribly ear wrenching dubs.<br/><br/>The Opening and the Ending of Cowboy Bebop are probably one of the most popular Opening and Ending Themes of all time.<br/><br/>The OP(opening) (\"Tank!\" by The Seatbelts) is a jazzy explosion of adrenaline. Listening to it is a joy and pumps the viewer's eagerness to watch the episode. It keeps you on your feet and is in many ways the most famous trademark of the Cowboy Bebop series.<br/><br/>The ED (ending) for most of the show (\"The Real Folk Blues\" by The Seatbelts feat. Mai Yamane) is equally as amazing but instead of pumping the viewer's eagerness the ED in turn helps the viewer digest what was just displayed on the screen.<br/><br/>Character~10<br/><br/>Cowboy Bebop has one of the most memorable casts of any show I have ever watched. They are eccentric, unique, strong willed, and powerfully convincing. We have Spike Spiegel who is a male bounty hunter in his late twenties that is trying to escape an inescapable past.<br/><br/>Jet black, The father like figure of the spaceship Bebop who has been stricken by unjust tragedies.<br/><br/>Faye Valentine, the strong female character who is kept in the dark about her own life.<br/><br/>And then we have Edward, the teenage female hacker with a background as confusing as herself.<br/><br/>the characters of Cowboy Bebop are outstanding. Their strengths overcome their flaws when united as a whole. Beautifully drawn and creative, Watanabe Shinichiro has invented a golden cast.<br/><br/>Overall/Enjoyment~ 10/10<br/><br/>This anime is a classic and i strongly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something extra.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "9 out of 12 found this helpful.", "date": "12 October 2014"}, {"title": " I'm gonna carry that weight...", "content": "Let me start by saying, i registered today to write my comment on Cowboy Bebop.<br/><br/>I finished the series for the second time yesterday, and it made an even bigger impression on me this time.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is the best series ever created in my opinion, regardless of anime, live action, or whatever. The story is exceptional work, the characters are as alive and deep as it ever gets. It is (forgive me for using this word again, but there is no other expression)exceptionally well drawn, even for an anime. The soundtrack (oh the music)has been a part of my collection for a long time now. It is just fantastic, i cannot imagine anything else, that would fit the world of Cowboy Bebop better, than the kick-ass jazz, blues, medley that dominates this brilliant list.<br/><br/>All in all, nobody should miss this stuff. Im sure there are and will be dislikers, but nothing is perfect, and thats the way it should be.

But COWBOY BEBOP has the kind of reputation that even a greenhorn like me can't ignore. Sitting through the series (short as it is) proved an interesting watch, but only that. I have no idea what I was expecting and the hype probably did me in. I see the similarities to FIREFLY (they're often compared), but this wasn't nearly as watchable.<br/><br/>But I'm not blind and can see that this is a well-made series. It's got great visuals (man, those establishing shots are something), great bluesy atmosphere, and attention to real firearms. The American voice cast seemed like good matches for their characters and I like that the Bebop crew just sorta fell in, no contrived reasons. And let me also just say that the music on this series was phenomenal, and enough for me to sell out the soundtrack. This show really had the knack for sneaking up behind you with a character's backstory. A session will proceed at its customary leisurely pace and then *bam!*, you just learned something major. The pacing did throw me off; here you have characters who are fluent in gunplay and piloting spaceships, and most of the time they're sitting back and talking. It was odd. The ending was also rather rushed for the same reason.<br/><br/>I suspect a rewatch further down the road will change my mind on this. I certainly haven't given up as things like this tend to bug me. I'm the last guy to throw around \"overrated\", and that certainly doesn't apply here.

Uh Oh!", "content": "Cowboy Bebop is one of the most acclaimed anime out there, especially since it was an early introduction for many fans. Its been running on Adult Swim for a freaking decade! By the time I was watching Saturday night anime, it was only on late. The two episodes I did watch didn't impress me.<br/><br/>Now that I'm older and wiser, I thought I could appreciate it more. Perhaps those two episodes were flukes. But alas, this series just isn't for me. There is some fun action, and the animation is among the best. I love the detailed, realistic sci-fi machinery, settings, and backgrounds. They pulled me halfway through the series before I quit.<br/><br/>But the character and plot of Cowboy Bebop are pretty shallow. The episodes are individual vignettes, so strong writing and characters are needed to hold them up. Instead, we have two-dimensional good guys hunting down one-dimensional bad guys. Our main cast barely develops, even with a few memories pulled up. They're fun, but they get boring after a dozen episodes. As for the side-characters, half of the them are stereotypical thugs, and most of the rest did not have enough time, depth, or personality to connect with me. Plot-wise, I almost always thought \"It was alright\" instead of \"Wow, that was amazing!\"<br/><br/>When I first started, I was pretty pumped up. Then I was mildly interested. Then I relegated it to background noise. I have never given an anime more of a chance. I can see why people love it, but I don't see how its well-written. Even at its best, I only thought it was okay. But apparently, that isn't enough, considering even respectful, 5/10 reviews are getting a barrage of downvotes.

I also like it at a pace that keeps the story interesting, whilst also not rushing it making the story feel underdeveloped and difficult to comprehend.<br/><br/>This anime has got it all.\nEverything from the historical aspects, to how it establishes its cast, all the way to the wide array of emotions it's managed to surge within me during such a short amount of time, is just phenomenal...and we're only five episodes in. Also, don't even get me started on the animation quality and the splendid use of CGI.<br/><br/>This is how CGI's supposed to be used to make an animated story feel real.\nThis, is amazing.<br/><br/>Making characters feel realistic and relatable, whilst also grounding them in a story that's only been on for 100 minutes, give or take, is amazing. Movies can do this, because they \"only\" need a crescendo like build up that's more often than not really fast paced, and end it all with a climax built up from the accumulated emotions of the main character. A television series needs to do all of that, and at the same time also keep the viewer interested through a much slower pace.<br/><br/>An amazing example of how Vinland Saga handles character grounding came from episode four of this series. Seeing Thors handling the situation at hand the way he did felt realistic, because of how the series already had developed him as a character. Some might argue his ideals were naive, and I might agree, but that doesn't make his actions feel any less real.<br/><br/>But,\nforget about Thors and his ideals for a second. Forget the fantastic animation quality of the episode and lets for the love of God forget how unrealistic it actually is to jump ten meters straight.<br/><br/>Let's focus on Askeladd. We'd already seen a glimpse of him during the previous episode, where he shows up and immediately establishes himself as the slippery kind of crook guy that doesn't hesitate to step on any kind of honor to get what he wants. What's truly amazing about this next episode is seeing Askeladd handling Thors and their diametrical ideals confronting one another. The respect Askeladd managed to feel for a man whose view of the world really is his polar opposite, as well as the complex array of emotions he felt during the episode just added another level of layer to his character.<br/><br/>That's grounding a character in a story, and that's doing it in just one episode.\nThat, is superb.<br/><br/>I've seen some compare this to Attack on Titan, and I get it. A main character that's growing through a search for revenge and all that jazz.\nThe series I'd like to compare this to would rather be early Berserk and early Game of Thrones, though.\nThe fact that these two shows were able to build a believable universe with an intriguing plot during such a short period of time with relatable emotions built upon actual realism is what made them true masterpieces.<br/><br/>I'm not saying Vinland Saga will ascend. I'm not even saying it will keep on delivering.<br/><br/>I'm saying it's already a masterpiece.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "47 out of 66 found this helpful.", "date": "6 August 2019"}, {"title": " I can only say \"wow\"", "content": "After having seen Kimetsu no Yaiba and Dororo, animes that belongs to 2019, I did a survey on Instagram saying that, \"in your opinion, what was the best anime of 2019 between Kimetsu no Yaiba and Dororo\" , then I find one that tells me In his opinion, Vinland Saga is the best he has seen in 2019.<br/><br/>At that point I asked myself, \"What anime is that?\"\nAnd I quickly started searching Vinland Saga on IMDb and I find 8.9 score.

Thorfinn the protagonist begins as a child with the desire to grow up and be just like his father, the most powerful Vicking ever. His father was a very strong person, but Askeladd (one of his former company companions) for money had a desire to kill Thorfinn's father, Thors. Thorfinn comes along with his father at the time. Once on the battlefield, Thors defends himself from the Askeladd army using only his fists, he had no desire to kill anyone. The moment Thors dies, his son blinded by anger and revenge decides to unite with Askeladd and his army, and once he gets stronger, kill him so that he can avenge his father.<br/><br/>From then on the main plot continues to evolve and improve making Vinland Saga become a cult anime that should be remembered along with shows like Fullmetal Alchemist, Hunter x Hunter, Attack On Titan, Death Note etc...<br/><br/>A masterpiece without a doubt.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "5 out of 5 found this helpful.", "date": "14 July 2020"}, {"title": " Top 5 Anime Ever Produced in Human History", "content": "No Anime was ever as immersive as to make me cry on the FIRST half of the VERY FIRST episode.

There's no \"skipping\" songs on this playlist. Pay close attention to Perfect Harmony. It was written by Madison Reyes (Julie) and Charlie Gillespie (Luke). GORGEOUS!<br/><br/>Jadah Marie, as Flynn, is an absolute delight and sets the bar extremely high for every \"Bestie\" who follows in her wake. Kenny Ortega knew what he was doing when he drafted her from his Descendants cast. Flynn is the BFF we all need and the one we should all strive to be. LOVE HER! The band is fantastic as well. The actors were cast because of their chemistry and it shows in every scene. The have created their own family and it will be interesting to see how that evolves as more people become aware of their ghost status. While the sparks between Luke and Julie are obvious, this is not a teeny-bopper romance show. Their relationship in no way overshadows any of the others.<br/><br/>I found it particularly satisfying to see how the whole \"ghost\" situation was handled. There is none of that \"lurking around the bedroom watching her sleep or change clothes\" stuff going on here.

Kaneki Ken is an average quiet college freshman who loves reading books and hanging out with his only friend, Hide. The Tokyo they live in is going through a quiet chaos created by human- look-alike people called Ghouls, who live among humans but feed on their flesh. Kaneki doesn't have anyone--no family and only Hide for a friend--which probably makes him the perfect target because nobody will ask about this kid. When he goes on his first date with the girl he likes, he has no idea his life is about to change forever. It is after that night and after he is attacked that Kaneki receives a transplant and becomes a half-Ghoul. He's been human all his life and now one of the basic needs for him to survive has become killing people and eating them. Ghouls cannot eat anything but human flesh; not only human food tastes horrible to them, but it also makes them ill. Ghouls are pretty much hunted by investigators in Tokyo, so Kaneki has to hide his new self, even from his one and only friend Hide. Hide is 'food' now, so what happens if Kaneki starves himself to insanity?<br/><br/>The story starts and expands as Kaneki struggles to keep his humanity through his encounter with different conflicting groups--Ghouls that cannibalize other Ghouls, those who kill humans and eat them more for enjoyment rather than need, humans that refuse to accept Ghouls are creatures capable of feeling as much as humans, humans who hunt Ghouls, and Ghouls that believe humans should all be destroyed. Slowly, the story turns into a character study: How far does it take for the innocent to break?<br/><br/>I started watching Tokyo Ghoul when I kept hearing the title here and there on the internet, and as you can imagine after the first episode I couldn't stop watching (I read the manga only after the series ended.) If you want an Attack on Titan kind of anime with a solid action plot, you might not like Tokyo Ghoul as much. Yes, it has some great action sequences and a lot (and I mean A LOT) of gore and violence-- especially the last two episodes are definitely not for the faint-hearted. But what makes the show especial is the characters. Kaneki is a great protagonist. He is 'real'. I've watched some series with the main character adapting to their new situation so unrealistically fast. Some might see Kaneki as weak for the way he struggles to become a real Ghoul or remain a real human, and how he's trapped between the two worlds without a place or anyone to go to. But those are features that make Kaneki a real, likable character, and make where the plot heads to so very sad, and equally satisfying.<br/><br/>Long story short: Watch Tokyo Ghoul if you love violent, psychological horror stories or/and if you love seeing some VERY good character development.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "66 out of 82 found this helpful.", "date": "22 September 2014"}, {"title": " 5/10 first season was the masterpiece.

What happens to the main character just wasn't enough to drive the plot forward in my mind; the \"now what? so what?\" question kept nagging at me. But I was patient and kept watching and realized how wrong my initial impression was. I realized that the slow pacing and lack of a central purpose/goal of the early episodes actually works to improve character development so that the finale hits us that much harder. From the midpoint on Tokyo Ghoul turns into an absolute masterpiece; I began to see depth to the whole story and the shows profound take on ethics and psychology. <br/><br/>This series has potential to become one of the best anime's in recent memory if it gets a few more seasons. In fact, I think that the plot is thick enough here to warrant many more seasons. Season 1 does a excellent job setting the context and introducing us to the characters. It would be a shame if Tokyo Ghoul ended after just 24 episodes. I want more than that. If you fail to reach the midpoint of the first season, you will judge this series inaccurately based on limited data.

Mine occurred during emo favourite \"Tokyo Ghoul,\" recommended to be because of its 'good story and characters.' Hah. Of course, in comparrisson to classic literature the series' writing pales, most anime's will, but even in context of the genre, this is a disaster.<br/><br/>A sufficient summary of the story is elementary to elucidate its severe shortcomings. In an alternate Tokyo, man is living alongside a hidden society of ghouls. After the student Kaneki is nearly killed and saved by transplantation of a ghoul's organs, he transforms into a half-ghoul, and can no longer fit into normal life. He ultimately finds his place in a group of peaceful ghouls and is consolidated by his new friends, and will-they-won't-they love interest Touka. Meanwhile, the special forces continue their hunt to eliminate all ghouls whilst war looms inside the savage society itself.<br/><br/>Throughout the series, Kaneki is so thouroughly pulled through the wringer that his hair turns white and his nails become black (surprisingly, this metamorphosis did not come with ear piercings included) and becomes an other, more beastly, person. All this happens over the course of two episodes, before which he is a persistent whiner, and after which he is a persistent whiner who now eats his fleshies. This is apparently regarded as good character building. Kaneki's change of heart is not ununderstandable; the problem is that the other 22 episodes, his character is as stagnant as it is unlikable.<br/><br/>To add some constructive criticism: The basic concept is crap. The worldbuilding is on the same level as \"Twilight\"'s; the rules make as much sense as \"Gremlins\"'s: Ghouls can only obtain energy by eating human flesh, all other food will taste slimy and is without nutrition. That is not how metabolism works. There is no self-imposed rule that can satisfyingly explain this; it is just there as a way to create conflict. Oh, but there is one exception: Ghouls can drink coffee. Why is that? So Kaneki and Co. can work together in a cute little coffee shop, of course. It is painfully obvious the universe's rules were conceived to suit the setting, which was not that good to begin with.<br/><br/>But the main problem is more prevalent: \"Tokyo Ghoul\" is a shallow and utterly joyless series. There is nothing wrong with a dramatical tone, quite the contrary: Comic relief in anime is often a nuisance (here we nod at \"Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\"), but in order for the drama to hit, the viewer has to be invested in the characters. In only the first two episodes, Kaneki is respectively nearly killed and revived as a half-ghoul. His world has been turned upside down and his live as he lived it destroyed. The problem is that the viewer has not witnessed this normal life for more than ten minutes. One cannot relate without context. The writers go for the tragic irony of being stuck in two worlds, and not fitting in either, but the real loser is the viewer, who is stuck in two worlds, and does not care about either. The only pleasure that can be dirived from \"Tokyo Ghoul\" is the sadistic enjoyment of seeing these unbelievably unlikable characters suffer. And there is plenty of opportunity for that, as the series makes the beginner's mistake of thinking that misery equals meaning.<br/><br/>The writing on the side characters is quite bad as well. Most are too busy with reveling in there own squalor to notice Kaneki, and those who do mainly act like a jerk towards him (which is understandable but tiresome.) The villains are usually granted a minute of exposition-heavy background and are discarded after a few episodes like used tissues. Instead of building up a main plot, the series meanders through its inpleasanteries until it stops on a note unsatisfying enough to encourage the viewer to watch the even worse follow-ups.<br/><br/>There are occassional glimpses of good moments, but they are sparse. Touka removing the glove of an obsessed ghoul hunter she just killed, and discovering it was worn to hide a wedding ring is a great example of visual storytelling, and completely non-verbal. Until she explains the situation out loud, that is, and repeats her exposition in a close-up flashback to make sure the message is understood. Every good idea \"Tokyo Ghoul\" has (and there are not many) falls flat because of the pathetic execution.<br/><br/>For those with any critical standards for characters and storytelling, \"Tokyo Ghoul\" is a pain to sit through, but if you like posting slightly perverse fan art of white-haired anime boys on Tumblr, you will probably have a blast. Apparently, the manga is better, but I wonder what storytelling could outweigh such a dreadful set-up. And there are so many more constructive ways to spend one's time.

Now, Kaneki must survive as a ghoul by using his powers, and to further polish them. It has a lot of character development, ad a unique story. It had a pretty good art direction, but I think that the series went a bit downhill with the premiere of season 2. Studio Pierrot did a fairly good good job on adapting Tokyo Ghoul, but I have to point out a few things. In season 1, they switched the Gourmet Arc and the Dove's Emergence Arc (I guess Pierrot wanted Ryouko to live for a little while). They left out important plot details (like how Kaneki learned the technique to easily break an arm=, and don't get me started with season 2! Season 2 left aside Touka (this also includes Kaneki on the first episodes. Please take in mind that he is the protagonist) leaving her with little screen time, and it focused a bit too much on CCG.

Where to even begin with this one. Some of the most common words I hear about this show are that it's \"dark\", \"badass\", and most of all, \"edgy\". And I think a good way to describe this show is through the meaning of the word \"edgy\" itself. In my eyes, edginess is used to describe something overly dramatic in a dark sense to the point where it's unrealistic enough to break immersion. Unfortunately for Tokyo Ghoul, despite doing everything else mostly right, it suffers quite a bit from this lack of realism.<br/><br/>STORY - 6.5/10<br/><br/>Let's start with some of the good stuff. The story revolves around a society built around humans and ghouls, which are humanoid creatures with weird powers that can only survive by eating people. I know, real pleasant. This dynamic created as a result of ghouls and humans living in the same world sparks some interesting discussions about discrimination, isolation, and best of all, the power of kindness. However, the story often feels forced into going in certain directions, not leaving enough time to properly foreshadow or develop big events. This starts happening especially near the end, and it takes quite a toll on character development. Which leads me to my next point....<br/><br/>CHARACTERS - 5.3/10<br/><br/>This was the weakest point of the show for me, and it's where the flaws in the writing really started to present themselves. Our protagonist is Ken Kaneki, the man who's worshipped around the globe by 12 year old boys and crushed on hardcore by 12 year old girls. Whenever this dude puts on his mask, panties drop so hard that....ok I'll stop. But yeah, this is the guy who gets the by far the most screen time, the most development, etc. He starts out pretty well as a nice kid at heart trying to fight off his harmful urges. So far so good, but there's a certain degree of ridiculousness in the way the show overdramatizes his inner conflict, to the point where I had to suppress my laughter. He keeps struggling with these urges for most of the show, and it doesn't really seem to get much worse or much better. That is, until near the end, where our boy undergoes some MASSIVE changes that are not just forced story-wise, but literally forced out of him by an outside influence. There's extremely little time to actually flesh out his development, and this causes his character to just feel unrealistic and inhuman, which is a shame since they'd been doing a fine job of showcasing his human side before then. As for the other characters, there's really not much to say. There are some nice ghouls, some mean ghouls, some nice humans, and some mean humans. There are also some of these who appear mean at first and later show caring sides, like say, Touka and Nishiki. But none of these are really developed beyond their personality traits. Now don't get me wrong, it's not all bad. The personalities of these characters are well defined and human-like, even in Kaneki (for most of the show). But in terms of development, there's definitely something left to be desired across the board.<br/><br/>ART - 7.3/10<br/><br/>The art in the show is the textbook definition of solid. Settings look realistic, fights are smooth and vibrant, and there's even some visual symbolism scattered throughout, which is always nice. Something that especially stood out to me was the art style for the characters. The people/ghouls look reallyyy good in this show. The dudes are hot and the girls are *hot*. That's all I really have to say, no complaints here but at the same time, nothing groundbreaking.<br/><br/>SOUND - 7.1/10<br/><br/>Soundtrack's also good. It fits nicely with the tone for each scene, and it never breaks the immersion of an impactful moment or fight. One track that stood out in particular was \"Licht und Schatten,\" and it added a nice amount of hype/emotion to every scene it was played in. As far as the opening goes, it's also pretty good, and it's super iconic so there's that. The ending didn't really stand out to me though. And voice acting, well, it did what it was supposed to do successfully, but as I said before some of our characters can be quite the drama queens.<br/><br/>OVERALL ENJOYMENT - 6.5/10<br/><br/>As a result of all of this I definitely ended up enjoying the show more often than not. The premise was fun to follow and think about, and the more than adequate production quality helped drive home the experience. Even the characters were enjoyable to watch, but their emotional moments didn't hit quite as hard as they could've if these characters had been written more carefully. So in the end, If you like a lot of dark and heavy drama and you can suspend some level of disbelief in regards to characters, chances are that you'll thoroughly enjoy this.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "2 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "21 March 2020"}, {"title": " awesome", "content": "First i would like to say\n*manga is top notch anime adaptation is little poor\nthere is a gap between root A episode 12 and Re: episode 1 (how kaneki lost his memory).\nyou are required to go through that part through manga.<br/><br/>*everything else is awesome about the anime", "rating": 9, "helpful": "2 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "30 October 2019"}]}, "/title/tt9055008/": {"title": "Evil", "reviews": [{"title": " Disturbing and Thought-provoking", "content": "Horror has finally grown up.

Some of the episodes were more disturbing than anything I've seen in a long time - the virtual reality goggles segment, the multiple personalities woman in Vatican III, the mother-babysitter's irresponsibility, the masked little girl persuading the kids to play \"Funeral\", etc.\nIt's still not clear what the show's attitude on the supernatural, religion, the Catholic Church, and psychology is: is it trying to present little slivers of unexplainable occurrences without really committing to \"yes, there are indeed demons and all the stuff the exorcists believe\"? Or is it debunking them? That tension, and how it keeps seesawing between those points of view, keeps the show going - that and the recurring evil characters, especially Leland, who (to me) is scary in his utter lack of scariness. He's terrific in embodying evil in a soft-spoken and likeable man, and then he starts talking and you realize that he's effortlessly one of the worst people on TV.\nOne of the underlying themes of the show seems to be that with or without a supernatural element, there are people in the world who want to do evil things. So this means that it isn't necessary to have a supernatural connection or demon connected to every character or plot line, which makes this, as the title says, a show not about ghosties or beasties but about evil itself - what does it look like and how does it act?", "rating": 9, "helpful": "125 out of 137 found this helpful.", "date": "3 December 2019"}, {"title": " Look for it to be cancelled...", "content": "... because this is a fantastic show so far (and fantastic shows get cancelled while trash lasts for seasons and seasons).

The premise of the film isn't necessarily bad but the execution is sad really sad.<br/><br/>This group of 'astronauts' (more about that in a minute) seem to be presented with several situations an episode that other series might spend several episodes (or a season) dealing with. The whole series feels rushed ( perhaps they were pretty sure that the series wouldn't be renewed and wanted to get all of their ideas out there). This honestly reminds of 'Lost in Space' series from the '60's. Situations develop and are dealt with in a matter of fact manner that makes them seem really immaterial and unimportant.<br/><br/>The science in this series is laughable. Perhaps it's meant to be. A few scientific words and phrases are used, (often incorrectly) and a lot of pseudo-scientific sounding words are thrown about freely. Some basic research in astronomy and space travel would have served them well. This story should be sucked into a Black Hole.<br/><br/>Now, the 'astronauts'. How this rag, tag group of individuals would ever end up on the same space mission is beyond me. With the exception of Niko and William, who is AI, the rest of the team must have been picked up outside of Starbucks on a Saturday morning. Each has a particular skill, to varying degrees, but they have no training, organizational skills or discipline and chain of command isn't even an afterthought. Most of them would have been forced in the airlock and jettisoned on most any other series. Oh, and the soma sleep chambers seem to be able to keep producing an unlimited number of new characters. A character gets killed, let's awake someone else from their soma chamber.<br/><br/>Back on Earth things are a bit better. Erik and Niko's daughter Jana seem to hold things together until the military gets involved and Marshall law is instituted.Then things get laughable and fun times ensue with the Artifact. This isn't a spoiler, but why does the military usually respond to something coming to Earth with only rifles? Honestly, what can a bullet do to deter an advanced civilization?<br/><br/>To be fair (I really am trying), perhaps this series was to be more about interpersonal relations and just happens to be set in this time period. Again with the exception of Niko we never really get to know the character's backgrounds. We just start to get to know Cas but then it goes no where. Several conversations take place between characters that would be best said at the coffee shop on Saturday morning than while exploring the universe, The whole story seems disjointed and seems to skip around a lot.<br/><br/>To summarize, I really, really wanted to like this series. Katee Sackoff does a good job as Niki. Samuel Anderson plays William well. From there the characters seem one dimensional, very shallow. The back-biting mutinous behavior of the crew on the ship reminds me of a middle school lunch period, hardly believable of an astronaut corp of the future.<br/><br/>On a side note: I am certainly no prude but the almost constant use of profanity served no purpose and felt really forced.

I was born in 1976, so that means when \"MacGyver\" premiered in 1985-- I was nine years old.  My father and my older brother used to watch it, but it never really kept my interest as I was too young to understand and appreciate the intelligence and physics of everything. MacGyver-- along with \"Hill Street Blues\"-- was blown off by me when it started... only to be embraced whole-heartedly by me in my teen years.<br/><br/>When I re-discovered \"MacGyver\", I was in junior high, and had begun watching it on a daily basis in syndication on the USA Network.  It came on at a great time-- 5pm.  I was out of school by 3:30 every day, and had plenty of time to get home to watch it 5 days a week.  True, I saw the same episodes over and over again, but I loved it so much, I didn't care.<br/><br/>One of the best things about this show is that MacGyver was the perfect role model for young guys who grew up watching the show.  He didn't smoke, he didn't drink, he gave his rewards to charity, he never swore or got angry, he hated guns, and he used his WITS to get himself or others out of trouble. <br/><br/>--and \"MacGyver\" used an aspect not seen (to my knowledge) since the days of Sam Spade... the show used \"Film Noir\"-- basically, you hear the person's thoughts in a voice-over while they're doing what they're describing. <br/><br/>\nNow, I can appreciate the biggest complaint about this show: some people don't like it because it's unrealistic that a man could make an explosive device with a lightbulb, a paperclip, and some cleaning supplies.  Yes, some of the \"MacGyverisms\" were eye-rollers... especially in the series finale-- when he and his newly-found son escape out of some kind of pit by strapping fire extinguishers to their backs and setting them off.  Yes, that's stupid. But come on, people!  This is SEVEN YEARS of thinking up MacGyverisms! They can't ALL be gems!  But most of them were REALLY clever and REALLY worked!<br/><br/>I know for a fact that this show inspired me to be a better, more-helpful person to others... and to use my mind to remedy situations.  I've tried to watch \"Stargate SG-1\" with Richard Dean Anderson... but it just makes me sad, because I want to see the long hair and the brown leather jacket with the red plaid interior lining.<br/><br/>From what I understand, \"MacGyver\" is only playing at 10am Monday through Friday on WGN (a Chicago station) nowadays.  USA dumped it (jerks) and I haven't seen it since.  But I'm dying for another reunion show.  I miss Jack Dalton. (Bruce McGill)  I miss Pete Thornton. (Dana Elcar-- who's gone blind from Gloucoma, bless him)  Both are fine, fine actors who added greatly to the show.<br/><br/>But... sadly, all good things must end.  It's been off the air for years, but I still think about the show all the time.  <br/><br/>If you've come here for a review to see if the show's worth watching, it absolutely is.

One of these heroes was special agent/survival-expert Angus MacGyver, a guy that, unlike other action-series heroes, didn't grab the nearest firearm when things got hot. For him, an used paper clip, the wrap from a bubblegum, a spring from the bottom of a rusty old bed and his trusty Swiss army knife (which has become MacGyver's trademark) would do the job.<br/><br/>The thing with MacGyver is that it's original. Rare to any other series today, it focuses on the brain instead of brute force, which is actually a good thing, considering that television today is heading for a more \"brains-off, action-on\"-attitude. Angus MacGyver hates weapons and therefore never uses them, but instead, combining limited resources, he finds simple and elegant ways of dealing with the problem at hand. And the best part is, that (atleast in theory) MacGyver's inventions would really work, making it even more fascinating (even though some of them are not to be recommended to try).<br/><br/>Admittably, some of the episodes may not feature the best acting according to modern-day standards, and some of the ideas and solutions may be slightly used up, but seeing as the series aired in the mid-80's, I don't find it in anyway disturbing, rather the opposite, I find MacGyver to be a true treasure among the TV-series of today, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys wit, humor and a good time spent getting surprised by the geniousness of MacGyver's contraptions!", "rating": null, "helpful": "103 out of 108 found this helpful.", "date": "22 January 2002"}, {"title": " Greatest show of all time!", "content": "This show was excellently written and cast.

The Dukes always fought their way out of trouble just long enough for Roscoe to come arrest the bad guys and with Mac, well he would just make a radio receiver out of a paperclip grass and a shoelace or he would make a dart gun out of bubble gum and toothpick.  I honeslty believe that this this was the toughest man in the world.  Put him up against the Terminator and he would have found a way to dismantle his CPU without ever touching it.

Whatever the definition of it, (MacGyver) was a pure gold from the 1980s.<br/><br/>For being the actor who was unafraid to use his glasses during the audition, showing a lack of pretension that the show makers wanted in their lead--(Richard Dean Anderson) made it to be the title character. And how he portrayed it fine as innocent and intelligent secret agent that became one of the most memorable characters in TV history. We were waiting him, on the Egyptian national TV (channel one), every Wednesday night. Since the opening credits' electronic, nice and catchy tune, we gather craving what kind of scientific tricks he would come up with this round. It is a real cult favorite, and - strangely - the show which I've never met anyone hates!<br/><br/>At first, the episodes were close to the American super spy's adventures. Therefore it was ordinary at one point to watch (MacGyver) landing from a fallen plane, with a beautiful girl, in a hanging-to-a-parachute convertible car. It's the fanciful propaganda however through unique character of unarmed hero where \"mind is the ultimate weapon\". But this character itself, so its distinct resourcefulness, prevailed eventually as the attraction's core more than any \"save the world\" kind of Bond plots. Even (Dana Elcar) as (Pete) was having the most childlike face ever been for intelligence boss.<br/><br/>When the Cold War drew to a close in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, (MacGyver) became like a social worker who deals with family issues more than secret agent with ticking bombs, to watch him just saving a troubled kid from killing himself and stuff. At that phase of the show, there were these episodes where the lead traveled into time, by mysterious dreams, to live some different adventures in other lands and times; since his very time became that boring! But these episodes managed to be magnificent as well.<br/><br/>The excellent episodes are many. For instance, I can't forget \"Phoenix Under Siege\" where (MacGyver) was fighting an evil man in one building in such limited time pre-Die Hard. Or \"Target MacGyver\" where he unites with his grandfather to face some evil gunmen in a deserted cowboy city with just simple wiles. Or \"Good Knight MacGyver\" where he travels into time, to live a hellish night in the age of King Arthur.<br/><br/>Back when the show was on, I remember reading that some people accused it of presenting lies more than scientific facts at times (something got to do with generating electricity by cactus!). But anyway, we just believed the show as a show, a very engaging and entertaining one too. And the important meanings that we've learned from it were: Always be prepared. It takes a lot of study first to be a hero. So many wonders can be made by one Swiss army knife. And yes, brains can beat brawn.<br/><br/>Sure you'll ask: why there are no shows like (MacGyver) anymore? But with whole 7 seasons, the saturation was inevitable. Though, this spirit and these thoughts became old fashion nowadays. I believe that making a show for both kids and grown-ups, that enjoys and teaches them in the same time, turned out to be a lousy idea now in the 2000s, especially with the forensic medicine's too many bloody shows that may originate 3 types of generations later: forensic doctors, serial killers, and serial killers' victims!<br/><br/>Finally, I want to assure a little point of view.

Another reason might be the slow pacing. A lot of the episodes revolve around Macgyver developing a new relationship with a person and then having some sort of adventure with them. But since the series is heavily episodic, these relationships are always reset at the end of the episode for the most part: notable exceptions include Macgyver's bumbling best friend-Jack Dalton, boss/friend-Pete Thornton, and arch-nemesis Murdoc. Another problem with the continuity is the fact that Macgyver uses so many actors for different parts, many times for episodes one after another.<br/><br/>Now with all this being said, I still love Macgyver quite a bit, even if I have to acknowledge the show's limitations. Within each 44-minute episode, you'll get a pretty engaging, adventure story (later seasons have a lot of added drama as well), and usually more than a few clever Macgyverisms-were Macgyver finds a clever way to escape situations. Macgyver always being the same is also an advantage because viewers can always expect him to be a great, caring role-model in each and every episode. Its an oldie, but still a classic.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "7 out of 9 found this helpful.", "date": "26 June 2006"}, {"title": " The Best TV Series Ever Created!", "content": "MacGyver is a great TV series that I have enjoyed since the very first episode.  Even though the first few seasons were more enjoyable than the last couple (mainly because of the plots), this show is still better than today's television shows. With basically no sex and no gory violence, this show is good for people of all ages.  In fact, I began watching this show in 1985 when I was only four years old.  This show helped reinforce my love of science as I grew older, and I still enjoy watching reruns of this show today. It is difficult to find shows wherein the main character cares about other people and is not out to seek revenge on everyone who does him/her wrong.  Richard Dean Anderson was perfect for the role of MacGyver and the rest of the cast also added to the show (the casting staff did a great job). It is too bad that the show ended after seven years, and I would enjoy seeing another MacGyver movie come out (if it was like the first few seasons).  I also enjoy seeing Richard Dean Anderson in other shows and movies that he has done after MacGyver, which include Stargate SG-1, Pandora's Clock, and Past the Bleachers (all of which he did/does an excellent job in). This show was very innovative (where else could the main character use duct tape, a Swiss Army Knife, and other common items to get out of desperate situation?).  Although not everything could have been done quite as easily as MacGyver did them, MacGyver was relatively realistic (with the exception of a few shows) and is still interesting to watch.  My favorite episodes are Countdown, Soft Touch, Out in the Cold, and Blood Brothers, all of which are very creative.

Saul Rubinek's Artie Nielsen, who acts as a sort of curator to the warehouse is the gruff, often exasperated anchor point to the rest of the crew and I have to admit: I wasn't crazy about his character at first but he really grew on me.

Love seeing her on the little screen after such an amazing amount of varied roles on both the tube and the silver screen. The whole cast is a nice mish-mash of personalities that compliment one another but I have to admit a growing favorite of mine is Allison Scagliotti's \"Claudia Donovan\", who's funny, bright, endearing and occasionally flawed which makes her all the more likable. She winds up getting into some seriously funny messes that require the leads (an equally humorous Eddie McClintock and perfect straight-man Joanne Kelly as agents Lattimer and Bering) to bail her out. The weekly series always has some really cool artifact that belonged to some famous historical figure that wields some kind of science-bending power to it and the leads are tasked with retrieving said artifacts without getting themselves killed or some such other disaster.

I'll admit the humor is kind of juvenile but it's also pretty clever and very, very funny. I love the countless references they make. The show is about 3 telemarketers (Anders, Blake and Adam) who all live and work together in California. They are stoners, slackers, alcoholics and most importantly very funny!

However, I just felt the jokes felt a little forced. Like they though that if they just threw the joke in a goofy voice or quirky attitude and it's gonna automatically result in laughter. It may work for some people, sadly didn't work for me. This is the same problem I have with comedians like Daniel Tosh or Ray William Johnson, they deliver their jokes in a semi-quirky tone and expect people to laugh just because the idea was probably funny. How you present your jokes is just as important as the joke itself. Have you ever tried to retell a really funny joke to your friends and it didn't come out funny? That's because the delivery was off. This is the issue I see with this show. It definitely has potential but so far it hasn't won me over.

Season two is about real life Betty Broderick's murder of her ex husband and his new wife. It's good but I think they played a little too fast and loose with the facts on the telling of her story. In real life she was melting down and having crazy fits of anger long before the marriage was over. I also felt uncomfortable with how much back story they gave to Betty's character. The way they portrayed her, she was more a victim than a perpetrator. It left me with a decidedly bad taste about her getting as long a sentence as she did. They've denied her parole more than once because she still shows no remorse to this day. It seems housewives from the 50s either took bucket loads of Valium or turned into raging murderers to cope with their relegation to breeding and kitchen duties. To have one's spouse trade you in for a younger model after all the blood, sweat and tears of raising four children...

I am also a frequent TV watcher, although my tastes definitely gravitate towards the more edgy cable offerings than the big network shows (that quite frankly are usually somewhat \"dumbed down\" to be appropriate for the masses). Due to my former profession, I felt compelled to watch this show, although I assumed I would be completely disappointed and would find flaws throughout.<br/><br/>Well, the pilot exceeded my expectations. No, the depiction of the Academy is not perfect, but some of the scenes were eerily similar to what I experienced. While most viewers would assume that surely the romances and flings in the show are purely silly fantasy fluff, I can assure you that those types of behaviors did occur at the FBI Academy (infrequently, yes, and with much more average looking people, yes). Funny enough, my biggest gripe was how \"nice\" the instructors are in the show; I cannot begin to imagine what would have happened if someone was talking on a cell phone at the firing range. FBI Academy instructors in reality are incredibly tough; I still have scars on my knuckles to prove it (but they are some of the best and most dedicated individuals on the planet). But minor gripes aside, the feeling of being back in college in a dorm but with the structure (physically and mentally) of boot camp is what it was really like.<br/><br/>Sure, the storyline is far-fetched, but this is a fictional TV show. It is not the next Homeland; I do not expect it to clean house at the next Emmy Awards show. But for what it is, it is well done, and feels like the show writers at least had enough input to keep the story in line with the \"real\" side of the FBI.<br/><br/>In summary, this is an admirable effort, especially for a major network; the pilot gets a nice 8 out of 10 from me. If the show goes downhill (which is definitely possible; it seems like one of those shows that might be best as a one-season-only run), I will update my review accordingly. But for now, I will continue to be entertained for an hour each week with the escapism that the show offers.<br/><br/>*** UPDATE ***<br/><br/>It saddens me to have to update the review, but I feel it is my responsibility to do so since I have elected to stop watching the show. Bottom line, it feels like this was written by somebody who is paid by the plot twist, and at some point it cheapens the show to not being watchable. Also, I have to agree with another commenter who felt like the show must be a Shonda Rhimes production (nothing against her, but the show looks and feels much more like Grey's Anatomy than Homeland). I finally had to stop watching because of the gross inaccuracies about the lives of the NATs at the FBI Academy. The show still has entertaining moments, but with so many great shows out there, I am having to pull the plug on this one to make room for others. I suspect that will be the fate of this show; it started strong and has a full season 1 order, but I would be surprised if it made through a 2nd season.

I'm from Sweden myself and have a lot of thoughts, most of them negative, regarding Swedish movies. But Beck I like and that's quite an achievement from their part. The Beck series revolves around Martin Beck, Gunvald Larsson and their colleagues at the police force in Stockholm, Sweden. Beck is a divorced, middle-aged man while Larsson is young, forward and a quite violent man (against suspects that is). Together they make a perfect team, investigating crimes committed in Sweden, around Stockholm. The movies have a well written storyline, with diverse crimes, with no fear of showing brutal murders, horrible cases, or to go outside the Swedish border, making this series of movies great! Plot twists are only to be expected at the ending, making sure that everyone is kept in the dark of the outcome until the very end, which isn't always that easy to accomplish. <br/><br/>The series of movies are well-known here for a couple of things; Gunvald Larsson's short temper, and his great sarcastic lines! The neighbor of Beck, who always seem to be on sick-leave - wearing a lovely neck-collar, and who always is willing to give Beck some alcohol. And last but not least; the great actors!

If you are not averse to subtitles, you will find among foreign productions some outstanding series in this genre, and \"Beck\" is one of them. <br/><br/>\"Beck\" \u2013 after \"Wallander\" and \"Van Veeteren\" \u2013 is the third Swedish-language police- procedural series I have watched, and it may be the best, which is high praise. I should qualify that by saying I have watched only the first 18 episodes of \"Beck\" (produced from 1997 to 2005), available in the USA as sets 1 through 6. Eight subsequent episodes have been produced and released on DVD, but not yet, as far as I can tell, with Region 1 encoding. <br/><br/>\"Beck,\" which aired as a Swedish TV series from 1997 to 2009, is based on the books of Mai Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6 in which Inspector Martin Beck, the lead detective of a special homicide team of the Swedish police, was the central character. I gather that the team (in this series) is based in Stockholm, but the crimes they investigate are not limited to that city. Each episode is approximately 90 minutes in length and represents a complete case. I found the stories to be uniformly engrossing, and in several there were twists at the end that I did not see coming. <br/><br/>Tying the episodes together is a cadre of well-cast, well-acted characters that appear in all, or nearly all, episodes, and other characters whose tenure spans fewer episodes. Three characters, who appear in all episodes, merit special mention: Beck: level-headed, insightful, possessed of more of an everyman quality than most leading characters (he reminded me of my junior high biology teacher); Gunvald, Beck's right-hand man: brash, swaggering, politically incorrect, tough \u2013 the iron fist in Beck's velvet glove; Grannen: Beck's wonderfully eccentric neighbor - he rarely failed to make me laugh. <br/><br/>Note: As a result of having read a user review (on another site) that lauded the series but was critical of the quality of the video transfer, especially in light of the fact the reviewer considered the DVD sets to be pricey, I purchased just one set and was attentive to image quality when I watched the first episode.

For those of us in the U.S. accustomed to Law and Order and CSI, with maybe a little Masterpiece Mystery thrown in for good measure, it may or may not surprise that many other countries have a robust tradition of detective and cop shows. Italy, France, Finland... The list goes on and on. Many of these shows are wonderful.<br/><br/>Some of the very best of these come from Scandinavia. They include the omnipotent Wallander -- the mother of all mystery shows. But there are also less well-known series, like Beck. (I always have to laugh because evidently \"Beck\" is trademarked... I can't help but wonder how the internationally famous musician feels about that...).<br/><br/>At any rate, Martin Beck and his compadres in the Homicide Division have been solving murders on television since the late 90's (there have been about 30 episodes made since then). The shows are \"movie\" length -- 90 minutes, so you have plenty of time to get thoroughly engaged. The stories are based on books by Mai Sj\u00f6wall and Per Wahl\u00f6\u00f6 that I have not read (but admit I should). Thanks to the invaluable MHz International Mystery (and also my local provider, Comcast), I have watched several episodes.<br/><br/>Beck (played wonderfully by Peter Haber) has a sidekick (of course he does!), Larsson (played by the smoldering Mikael Persbrandt), and where Beck is a pretty decent, well-intentioned chap (especially compared to some of his maladjusted counterparts in other Scandinavian series), his partner is a sort of Darth Vader to Beck's Luke. Larsson is the ultimate Bad Cop. He is bigoted. He's violent. He's snarky. He's funny and yet he's frightening. He does things cops shouldn't do. The discordance between the two characters is pitch-perfect, and adds to the fascination.<br/><br/>The plots are very good indeed. The pacing is perfect -- not too frenetic, and yet not too languid. They are right in the Goldilocks Zone. But be forewarned that the stories can be extremely disturbing. For example, a baby in a bassinet is viciously dropped to her death from a balcony. I can't help but think in most U.S. shows, the threat of such a terrible death would be made, but the action would not occur. But here, we see it happen, and to be honest I'm pretty sure I wish I hadn't. The audience is in no way protected from the brutality.<br/><br/>Amazingly, and unlike many of the other series out of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, there is some blessed comic relief provided in the episodes, in the guise of Grannen, Beck's bizarre (to put it mildly) next-door neighbor. I don't want to spoil anything about him for you here. So I'll just say if he doesn't make you laugh out loud at your TV, then you might need to work on your sense of humor.<br/><br/>These are really quite good. If you're a mystery fan, they'll be worth your time to watch, and your money if you want to buy the DVDs.

She is a great taker and she knows how to play her father. She constantly hits him up for money as she perpetually makes bad choices. And her actions have indirectly been responsible for deaths, but Martin never seems to catch on that he has fathered a completely selfish adult. While no one is a better detective or friend then Beck, when it comes to his life he is in denial about his personal choices. His relationship with co-worker Lena Klingstrom frustrates them both because of his indecision.\u00a0 And when Beck has to make a decision about going forward with anyone, he generally wusses out Beck has an able assistant in Gunvald Larsson, but Gunvald can be hot-tempered and has a problem with authority, especially with women in authority; and he is a bit of an instigator who likes to create fiction among colleagues he doesn't like. Yet, he is a solid cop who always has Beck's back. As we move along from series to series, we get exposure to more of Gunvald's background and understand his complex characterization. Best scene with essence of character is Gunvald\u00a0heading into a biker bar and pulling his out his gun and\u00a0checking it's loaded and cocked. When his younger associate, Oskar, asks if he thinks that will be necessary, Gunvald says he hopes so.<br/><br/>Lena Klingstrom is brought into the team initially for her IT skills but those seem to fade away as the series goes forward. At one point, she just disappears and it isn't until a later season we find she had transferred to another district. She returns eventually but her relationship with Beck has now completely changed.<br/><br/>Oskar Bergman is the tyro of the team who Gunvald treats with complete disdain much to the displeasure of his co-workers but no one really steps in to halt it. But as we near the end of the series, Oskar has his heroic moment when he saves his boss.<br/><br/>Beck also has the neighbor from Hell in Grannen who provides humor in what can otherwise be a dark depressive series. Some of the murders in this series include cutting bodies into parts while victims are alive, skinning them while alive, burying them alive, killing just for the joy of killing, dealing with corporate misadventures, and a variety of bosses from bikers to board rooms. The mysteries can be excellent whodunits with lots of twists you don't see coming. Other times we know who is guilty but have to wait and see how Beck finally puts the clues together. When things get too depressive, Grannen's character becomes even more bizarre and laughable. He constantly wears a neck collar which we assume is his key to obtain medical benefits because we never see him at work just frequently drinking telling Beck outrageous stories of his misspent life. And without a doubt, you will roar at some of his antics.<br/><br/>The series spans about twenty years from 1997 to 2016, and Beck goes through several partners and bosses which keeps the series fresh and topical. While Beck gets close to women, there is always something that steps in and ends what might be a promising relationship.<br/><br/>The biggest purely physical change takes place between series one and two. The station house Beck works in goes from 20th to 21st Century in a huge leap. In series one everything is old and crappy; and in series two everything has become ultra-modern, even the doors to the various offices now slide open as the detectives have hand held remotes just for that purpose. However, those remotes disappear pretty quickly as the writers must have seen how ridiculous they were.<br/><br/>Beck also undergoes some changes from maverick detective to more organization man. If you can, try to watch the episodes in order to better understand who the players are and why they disappear and reappear. You will also notice as the series became more popular, the producers found more money which shows up in the opening sequences which become more sophisticated, to Beck finally getting his own theme song.<br/><br/>Beck is a solid series and well worth the time but don't get attached to any of the characters as you can't be sure of a return.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "6 out of 8 found this helpful.", "date": "8 January 2017"}, {"title": " Always full of action and mystery", "content": "Only reason I wouldnt give this a 10 is sometimes the detectives just dont act like professional law enforcement, except for Gunwald, they go into situations without weapons drawn when you can hear there is a standoff.

This opening sequence sums up the US remake of Utopia nicely, unimaginative. It doesn't even feel like the show is trying to have any kind of identity of its own. I wasn't expecting it to be as stylized as the UK version was, I didn't expect them to try and copy what the UK show did, but didn't expect it to be as bland as it is either. A good example of how uninspired the show feels is the music, something that has become iconic from the UK version because of Cristobal Tapia de Veer's score, but here it sounds like music that could be from any number of syndicated police procedural shows, it's forgettable and bland and I doubt anyone will be adding the music from the show to their playlists any time soon. And it's not just the music, everything feels generic like they're doing just the bare minimum to get a scene done instead of trying to create something unique that's memorable and stands out. I think I've seen one interesting camera shot in the first two episodes.<br/><br/>At the end of the day though it's the story that they're telling that's the important thing, so hopefully they explore and expand on the story in new and interesting ways that the UK show didn't, but so far they haven't done that, they've changed certain things and added others, but all these changes have managed to do is reduce the mystery, intrigue and tension that the story in the original was so good at building.

The characters were compelling and the story was truly mesmerising. Then you have the booming colours from the beautiful cinematography and the wildly ambitious and twisted soundtrack.<br/><br/>When it was first announced that there will be a US version and that David Fincher will be in charge - I was over the moon. The UK version was cancelled after the second series which was when the story had just taken an incredible twist. The subject of a secret government organisation dead set on reducing the population in order to (from their perspective) save the planet whilst following a rag-tag group of conspiracy theorists and comic book enthusiasts who are doing everything they can to stop them is nail biting and ballsy to say the least. Tons of controversy and dark moments with a great understanding of British self-deprecating humour gives it a very memorable feel.<br/><br/>Fincher was then taken off the task due to the financial constraints of his ambitions plans. This news was was gut-wrenching for myself as I was dying to know where the story was going to go!\nGillian Flynn was then announced to take over and I thought \"Gone Girl was pretty good, very well\". It appears I may have been wrong...<br/><br/>So what happened? Well, writing unlikeable characters and relying on the like-ability of the actors playing them isn't a good start. Sasha Lane's Jessica Hyde is almost unbearable. It's pretty clear that plenty of the cast and crew had never seen the original.<br/><br/>One of the best qualities of the original is that it's open-ended as to whose side your on. The US version your side is chosen for you and you're forced to route for a group of people you're praying are given less and less screen time The more you learn about them. And what they did to Arby! Jesus wept.<br/><br/>This is a seemingly cheap knockoff that won't surpass the original. The \"shocking\" moments don't hold a candle to that of its predecessor - which used mostly unknown actors and relied on the grand scale of the story. Worked like a dream.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "37 out of 55 found this helpful.", "date": "3 October 2020"}, {"title": " Go home Utopia you're drunk", "content": "As far as I can tell the script writer and show runner have never seen the show this was rebooting. If someone read a synopsis of the show, waited 2 weeks so it was fuzzy, got drunk and described it to a hack writer, it would be a bit like this US version.<br/><br/>It isn't just as a reworking or retelling it got wrong, because even if I don't take the original into account, this show was just bland.<br/><br/>I guess the writer/s would periodically remember it was meant to be a quirky show, so they just added in one moment of absolutely pointless quirkiness per episode, but badly making me think \"what was the point of this, moment? It adds nothing to plot or character development\"<br/><br/>Then it would go right back to being bland and vapid, and it becomes clear pretty quickly the cooky bits are just there to jangle some shiny keys in front of us and keep our eyes pointed at the screen.<br/><br/>The writing was poor. Obviously the writers had favourites, so only a couple of characters were fully two dimensional. The rest weren't that well developed.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't terrible, but I suppose you can only do so much with a sub-par script. John Cusack did OK, but the guy from the American Office (I forget his name) was the one who did a good job, showing depth that wasn't really in the script. So, good job that guy.<br/><br/>It confused me that Becky and Ian swapped races from the original, until I remembered that that generally Hollywood seems to think a white man and black woman can kiss/shag on screen no problem, but not a black man and a white woman.<br/><br/>I have no idea what the point of the extra member of the group was for, but at least the writers agreed with me, as they had nothing for her to do, and then just got rid of her unceremoniously.<br/><br/>One of the two real downers was how glorified the violence was. The show-runner said she wanted to reduce the level of violence from the original. The thing is that in the original there isn't much violence, but they are in a brutal environment with ruthless forces against them, and consequences happen. When violence happens in the UK show it is sudden, brutal, quick and shocking, the way violence actually happens - it is deliberately made awful because violence is terrible, not awesome.<br/><br/>In the US version there is much more violence and it it made to be not shocking, it it totally Hollywood style violence. You feel nothing about it as it's shown as no big thing. There's even a montage of multiple people being shot in the head in quick succession. A little hole, a maybe a blood puddle if they have to stay in the same room as the body afterwards. No fuss no muss and nothing to make you interested.<br/><br/>The second real downer is how small, easy, and inconsequential the conspiracy is and how easily it's uncovered.<br/><br/>Part of it is that in the UK version there is no 'bad guy', though the protagonists assume there is one, because the baddie is not a person it is the idea that is the enemy. Which makes it harder to see, harder to stand against, and the bad guys could be anyone.<br/><br/>The ambiguity is gone. In the original you follow and root for the protagonists, but over time you start to wonder if the antagonists are in the right.\nAs Wilson Wilson puts it, \"They're the enemy. But what if the enemy is right?\" and you see what he means by that and why, and may agree with him.<br/><br/>In the US version there's the bad guy. He's the baddy, he has to be stopped, adventure ensues. Which is the opposite of the whole theme of the UK show - as the real Jessica says \"There are no sides. Just people who help you and people who don't.\"<br/><br/>Also, the US version of Arby's is terrible. No fault of the actor, he did his best bless him, but the character was just awful. He' supposed to be sort of eerily terrifying, almost robotic, despite not appearing remotely intimidating.<br/><br/>For example, his partner, who was killed off in the wrong way by the wrong person at the wrong time in this version, is not scared of guns being pointed at him,torture, or of anyone in the world, except Arby, who he is scared of.\nArby considers killing to be no more significant than twisting the top off a bottle of water to get to the water inside.<br/><br/>This version is a fidgety grinning emotional child-like guy who has a gun. Then he has some kind of breakdown for no reason made clear by the script. That's basically it.<br/><br/>Not the worst thing I've watched, but pretty poor as a bland show and abysmal as a reboot/reimagined property.\nFrankly I couldn't care less if it gets renewed, but I'll probably re-watch the original as it's a really good and original show.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "39 out of 59 found this helpful.", "date": "3 October 2020"}, {"title": " I don't understand all the bad reviews", "content": "Let me address this in different sections so it's easier for the people who hate this show to skip to the reason they hate it<br/><br/>1.

Seeing a huge man intimidate a child from a swimming pool with a remote control boat that runs amok before getting chastized by an adult wasn't my usual idea of comedy gold.<br/><br/>Some people use the term \"disposable entertainment\" negatively. But there was something reliable about an episode of Benidorm. You could watch it in the hotel room, casually in the middle of the week or as part of your weekend viewing.<br/><br/>Set in the Mediterranean sun, it was ingeniously simply to just make a show where characters were just always on holiday but yet still find problems.<br/><br/>Filled to overflow with rich vibrant comedic characters that came and went and then came back again when needed. Sometimes appearing for a short time before then making a bigger splash. This kept the show fresh and to some extent wasn't really one show but at least two shows on a sort of spectrum that turned from one to another. Hardly any episode can be considered truly bad to my mind because every episode always had a mix of things going on until the final season but i'll get to that...<br/><br/>I imagine the show divided into three basic eras. The first three seasons are the vintage period. The show began basically as a satire (is that the right word?) about the British abroad. A rich cultural cross section including the nuclear Garvey family (as stable as a nuclear plant too), the gentrified gay coupe (ah...the 2000s...) , the intellectual man-child with his mother and this is just the beginning all experiencing the highs and lows of the budget vacation; those who wish to travel to sunny Spain and remain locked in a British enclave with nay a paella in sight. When a certain character didn't occur in the next season, you never missed them for long since there were so many more to pick up the slack. You kept getting old friends and exciting new faces.<br/><br/>The humour was an intelligent mixture of broad gags and nuanced characterization that always went down smooth (except for when it...didn't, I'll get to that). The plots were engaging and the format of each episode corresponding to the events of a day made the whole thing just feel relaxed no matter what happened.<br/><br/>The next few seasons saw a bit of a reshuffle which made me wonder if the best years were behind us but new characters actually became new old favorites. To think Kenneth and Joyce would rise to become the very face of the show.<br/><br/>The final four years see a big change (I won't spoil it) but by now we've worked into a comfortable format that is less about sending up the British abroad and just utilizing the excellent characters and it became 50% a workplace comedy with the staff fully integrated into the story lines. An additional workplace element was the misadventures of the staff at the Solana's hair salon Blo and Go in which we get four characters, each initially part of their own separate clique but eventually coming together into a well functioning comedy power quartet.<br/><br/>There are so many details regarding the characters and the memorable elements and how they develop over time entertainingly. Wise cracking dad Mick Harvey trying to do right by his family but who keeps messing up, the Elderly Swingers who could fill a risque desk calendar with the thing they say, Mateo, the \"greasy barman\" who goes from negative cultural stereotype to a cultural stereotype who became a premier character. I also liked how Tiger went from trouble maker to really maturing to being a sympathetic youthful presence in the show.<br/><br/>I've rewatched this, in fact, much of it twice. There's enough of it to just binge on it shamelessly. Though I must say it nice to be able skip some not so choice moments. Namely, a lot of yelling and things getting lavatorial.<br/><br/>The show kept a consistent quality for 9 consecutive seasons but sadly it was the tenth that really crashed. I only noticed this on rewatching, but it doesn't quite work and I think the reason for this was the type of stories they were telling. The frustrating misunderstandings of Rob, his girl and his family were just pulled from a hundred cliche family sitcoms and let's face it: Rob and Cyd are perfect for each other because they are incredibly bland characters. This storyline and Monty's trouble with Sammy Valentino are stories that might work very well as a single episode of something but the aforementioned format of each episode corresponding to the events of a single day meant that these below average stores just got way too much air time. I think they expected a new season but ultimately the final episode is one of the worst final episodes of any show. The absence of Jodie (she is such a cutie!) was sadly the least of this season's worries. But never mind.<br/><br/>This is a show where things get super silly and then occasionally super serious but not for too long. Relationships are tested, forged and strengthened. I will say this also for the show: you will see people at their lowest and their highest. It makes an effort to reward the viewers that stick with it. I had tears in my eyes during the Pauline storyline, perhaps the most poignant character in the whole show by a strange turn. They play her alcoholism for laughs (ah...the...oh wait that was this decade) but like I said it gets both serious and funny.

Of course, my parents didn't have the resources to hire an entire corps of costumers and props masters, so I had to make do with a jumpsuit from Sears that had the Batman symbol printed on it.  Such is Life.  Still, I always thought Batman was the best of the legion of super-heroes to come around (except for perhaps Spiderman, whom I discovered later on).<br/><br/>Watching the tv show now as an adult, I realize just how campy and ridiculous it was, but where as a child I interpreted the action sequences as dynamic and exciting, now I see these same scenes as well-staged comedy, which is how the original producers intended it to be seen.  Who can forget the big cartoon graphics such as \"BAM!\" and \"POW!\" and \"Crrr-Rash!\" which flashed up just before Batman slugged a villain or knocked over a prop?  I beat up the sofa cushions with just as much enthusiasm. And don't even get me started on the car (Batmobile), the boat (Batboat), and helicopter (Batcopter) which I absolutely had to have in Corgi miniatures (still have mine in a box in the garage, along with James Bond's Aston Martin and the Monkeemobile).  And all the kids knew the Batman song. NaNa NaNa NaNa NaNa Batman!<br/><br/>Looking back at it now, I see that even though Adam West and Burt Ward, two relative unknowns at the time, never really recovered from being typecast, just about all of the supporting actors were accomplished in either films, tv, or the stage, such as Cesar Romero and Victor Buono (check him out in \"What Ever Happened To Baby Jane\"), and they managed to continue their careers.  A few, such as Eartha Kitt, used the \"Batman\" series as a springboard to other things (I saw Kitt's performance as the Wicked Witch in \"Wizard of Oz\" on stage and she was fantastic).  But whatever their future careers became, they turned in quality performances on the show.<br/><br/>I always had a thing for both Cat Woman (all 3 of them) and Batgirl.  The costume designers really knew how to show off a woman's curves in those tight-fitting catsuits with big metallic utility belts and high-heeled shoes, but I suppose that was the fashion back in the late-60's.  They probably fit right in with the mini-dresses and go-go boots the other girls were wearing.<br/><br/>\nYour kids will love the show and will watch it again and again. You'll enjoy it the first two times you see it, but then it'll get stale and boring.

Of course, the premise needs no explanation, but Batman (Adam West) and Robin (Burt Ward) are truly a cross between old-style superheroes and the 1960s. Like many other '60s TV shows (think \"Bewitched\", \"Gilligan's Island\" and \"I Dream of Jeannie\"), \"Batman\" was as zany as possible and a laugh riot every step of the way. And the villains? The perfidious Penguin (Burgess Meredith), conniving Catwoman (Julie Newmar, later Eartha Kitt), the jackknife Joker (Cesar Romero) and the ruckus-causing Riddler (Frank Gorshin) are exactly what anyone could ask for.

Who's he?", "content": "Created by Bob Kane, 'Batman' is, along with 'Superman', one of the world's most instantly recognisable superheroes. He was at his most popular in the mid-to-late '60's, thanks to a three-season television series that conquered the world. It came out of that same wonderful, mad era of U.S. television as 'Star Trek', 'Get Smart', 'The Monkees' and 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.' Fox had sat on the rights for a while before producer William Dozier hit on the inspired idea of 'camping' the character. 'Batman' quickly became America's coolest show. It worked on two levels; kids lapped up the adventure while adults found it hilarious. It was the 'Police Squad!' of its day. <br/><br/>Each episode opened with a daring, imaginative crime, such as the theft of a priceless painting from the Gotham City Art Gallery. A clue would alert Commissioner Gordon ( Neil Hamilton ) and Chief O'Hara ( Stafford Repp ) as to the identity of the culprit. Gordon would then pick up the Bat Phone. At stately Wayne Manor, millionaire Bruce Wayne ( Adam West ) and his youthful ward Dick Grayson ( Burt Ward ) would be summoned away from Aunt Harriet's ( Madge Blake ) side by their faithful butler Alfred ( Alan Napier ). A hidden door in the Manor's library concealed the Bat Poles. Bruce and Dick slid down these, emerging fully attired as 'Batman' and 'Robin' in the Batcave, an amazing hideout packed with sophisticated equipment for crime fighting. Our heroes jumped into the Batmobile, and roared off towards Gotham City to meet with Gordon and O'Hara. Everything about the genre was ridiculed mercilessly, even the cliffhanger endings. Over the fights the words 'Zap!' 'Pow!' and 'Blamm!' were superimposed. <br/><br/>The array of villains Batman faced on a weekly basis would have put the wind up even James Bond - the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, the Catwoman, Mr.Freeze, The Mad Hatter, plus a few created specially for the series such as 'Clock King', 'The Bookworm', 'King Tut' and 'Louie The Lilac'. 'Batman' became the 'in' show to appear on; stars such as Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, Frank Gorshin, George Sanders, Victor Buono, Roddy McDowall, Anne Baxter, Cliff Robertson, Ida Lupino, Liberace, Tallulah Bankhead, Eli Wallach, Rudy Vallee, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Milton Berle, Joan Collins all put on outrageous costumes and accents to menace our heroes. The one who had the greatest impact on me personally though was the awesome Julie Newmar as 'Catwoman'. She set the screen alight with her suggestive dialogue and feline body language. Other celebrities were happy simply to lean out of a window whenever the Dynamic Duo went into one of their famous wall-climbing routines, including Jerry Lewis, Edward G.Robertson and Sammy Davis Jr.<br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes had Batman talking to Commissioner Gordon by phone from the Batcave and pretending to be both himself and Bruce Wayne. Though Batman doesn't change his voice Gordon is convinced he's talking to two different people. Another was the scene where Gordon rings Batman for help, only to learn that the Caped Crusader is unavailable. \"The day I've dreaded has finally arrived, O'Hara! We'll have to solve this case ourselves!\".<br/><br/>Until 'Star Wars' opened a decade later, it is fair to say 'Batman' enjoyed the most merchandising of any film/television concept ( I was given a Dinky Toy 'Batmobile' for my 5th birthday in 1968 ). There was even a film version in 1966, pitting our heroes against Joker, Penguin, Catwoman ( played by Lee Meriwether ) and Riddler. <br/><br/>Like all fads though, 'Batman' did not last. The third season introduced 'Batgirl' ( Yvonne Craig ) as a regular, and the show reduced from two episodes a week to just one, but ratings did not improve.<br/><br/>It would be twenty years before 'Batman' was resurrected for a new generation firstly by Tim Burton and then Joel Schumacher. More recently, Christopher Nolan's 'Batman Begins' and 'The Dark Knight' brought a more sober approach to the superhero. Fans of the comic book applauded - I was not among them. The gritty, realistic tone of the newer Batmans is alien to me - like putting 'Austin Powers' in a Daniel Craig-type Bond film.

While the show stayed true to the origins of Bob Kane's classic comic strip and went up the alley with all the non-stop thrills,high action and adventure it can muster and so much more. For the three seasons and a half that it was on the air,the show premiered in mid-season for the 1965-1966 season,producing 120 episodes,all in color under executive producer William Dozier(who also served as the narrator) under his production company Greenway Productions and Twentieth Century-Fox Television for ABC. From it's premiere episode,the series took America by storm and by the end of 1966 BATMANIA was everywhere from merchandising to rare appearances and even ending up during the halftime show of the First Super Bowl! BATMAN was so successful on television,producer William Dozier brought the Dynamic Duo to a bigger audience in a full length theatrical feature film based on Bob Kane's comic strip and the television series of the same title that roared into cinemas in August of 1966 released by Greenway Productions and Twentieth Century-Fox.<br/><br/>What made BATMAN so successful during it's first two seasons was the general structure of the series stayed true to Bob Kane's original comics. Millionaire Bruce Wayne/Batman(Adam West),and his young ward Dick Grayson/Robin(Burt Ward)were individually as the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder as they waged an endless battle against the villains who plagued Gotham City. The only person who knew there true identity was Alfred Pennyworrth(Alan Napier). In addition to the underground Bat Cave,where every device was carefully labeled with it's function along with the fabulous Bat Lab,they used a marvelously equipped car,the Bat Mobile to chase and apprehend criminals. Whenever there services were needed,Police Commissioner Gordon(Neil Hamilton),along with Chief O'Hara(Stafford Repp) could summon them with the searchlight-like Bat Signal or call them on the special Bat Phone. There were other devices that Batman and Robin used to defeat criminals such as the Bat Shield just to name a few. There was also the Bat Boat and the Bat Copter as well. BATMAN became an overnight sensation when it premiered on January 12,1966 with the first episode \"Hi Diddle Riddle\"(with special guest villain Frank Gorshin) and the conclusion \"Smack In The Middle\"(airing January 13,1966),aired in two-part stories that ran on Wednesday and Thursday nights for all of Season 1 and most of Season 2. The climax of the first part left the pair being captured by that week's diabolical villain or villainess where they are left in a dire predicament or cliffhanger from which they would managed to extricate themselves from on the following night. From there,it became a monster hit. For it's first season,it was one of the top ten highest rated shows on television (It was in the top five of the Nielsens during its first 2 seasons),making huge stars of both Adam West and Burt Ward during it's era.<br/><br/>Appearing as a guest villain or villainess on the show became something of a status symbol. Out of the 30 or so villains that were guest stars on the show,only three were with it from the beginning to the end. Stars like Burgess Meredith(Penguin),Cesar Romero(Joker),Frank Gorshin(Riddler,and later on was played by John Astin). Other villains were Julie Newmar(Catwoman,and later on was played by Eartha Kitt),and Vincent Price(Egghead),and even the diabolical King Tut(Victor Buono). By the start of the third season,the ratings were slipping and the novelty was about to fade where the format was cut to a once a week format. A new superhero,Batgirl(Yvonne Craig) who regularly team with Batman and Robin to fight the villains and not to mention facing the villains wrath,didn't help in the ratings. By March 14,1968,the biggest television phenomenon of the mid-1960's was gone. NBC was set to pick up BATMAN in the fall of 1968 after ABC canceled it. NBC was ready to put the show back to a twice a week format for it's 1968-1969 season. The second format that NBC had for BATMAN was expanding the show to a full hour and having Adam West and Burt Ward in and Yvonne Craig out. There were other plans for turning this campy superhero show into a serious crime drama,which basically fell through by the executives at NBC. However,that plan also failed,and NBC rejected the idea of picking up the series from ABC. For the 1968-1969 season, ABC didn't waste any time finding a replacement for the now canceled BATMAN.

But I'm not at all certain that it had to be...<br/><br/>In fact, in looking at the first two episodes, which featured Frank Gorshin as the first \"Special Guest Villain,\" The Riddler, the program was quite hard-nosed, pretty straight and sinister (considering the costuming of the lead players), and actually somewhat poignant with the performance of Jill St. John. I would compare these first two episodes with any adventure series and say that they hold their own.<br/><br/>Of course, what happened was that with the wild Rogue's Gallery of villains, the over-the-top costuming, the dutch angle camera setups, with the straight-laced line reads of the two heroes, and the bugle like narration of \"Desmond Doomsday\" (the alias for Producer William Dozier) Batman was destined to be seen as nothing but pure camp. Not that that's bad, unless you feel this tarnished the legend of The Caped Crusader.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the show became the hottest thing happening, nearly overnight. All sorts of acting greats wanted their chance to challenge the Dynamic Duo, and unlikely villains played by Liberace, Van Johnson, Art Carney and Zsa Zsa Gabor all appeared, in addition to the semi-regular performers, Caesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, Julie Newmar and the aforementioned Gorshin. Those that couldn't be villains turned up in cameos, from Dick Clark to Sammy Davis Jr. to Santa Claus (as portrayed by old time actor Andy Divine) all had a moment of Batman and Robin's time. Though perhaps the most puzzling cameo was when Colonel Klink of \"Hogan's Heroes\" turned up at a Gotham City window. Not only was he from presumably 23 years in the past, he would have been a Nazi in an American city AND he was from a program on another network! If you know of an explanation for this, please pass it along.<br/><br/>The elements that made the show work were the Batmobile, a beautiful and evocative vehicle that transported the heroes from their secret location the 14 miles to Gotham City before the opening credits for that episode were finished. It's still one of the most instantly recognized automobiles, based on the 1955 Lincoln Futura and restyled by George Barris. Add in the gadgetry, Batman's utility belt, the bust of Shakespeare that held the switch that opened the bookcase... \"To the batpoles!\" and of course, the talents of the stars, Adam West, Burt Ward, Alan Napier, who was nothing short of brilliant as Alfred, Neil Hamilton and Stafford Repp as the commissioner and chief of police and later the charm of Yvonne Craig as the addition to create \"The Terrific Trio.\"<br/><br/>But even as the formula was working, it was wearing out its welcome as it went, and by the time the show started their third season, the ratings were clearly slipping possibly due to the tone change making the episodes sillier rather than more adventuresome. Despite the addition of Batgirl, and a change in the format so that each episode was self contained, rather than having a two part cliffhanger, the magical run ended and ABC canceled it.<br/><br/>There was a rumor that NBC was interested in giving the program a fourth season, however 20th Century Fox, the production company for the series had already demolished the centerpiece of the program, the batcave set, and NBC was unwilling to spend the time and money to rebuild it.<br/><br/>Probably just as well, as Batman has since been through numerous incarnations to get back to the standard that Bob Kane originally had for him.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "17 out of 21 found this helpful.", "date": "24 August 2006"}, {"title": " Holy Hell Batman we'll live on forever!", "content": "Troy Whigham's first up review here really nails it!

Major favorites were Victor Buono as King Tut (how many other 10-year-olds had seen \"Whatever Happened to Baby Jane\", I wonder?), Vincent Price as Egghead (again, \"House of Wax\" was hardly a children's movie!) and Roddy McDowall as Bookworm (hey, \"Lassie Come Home\" was actually for kids!). And naturally, Joker, Riddler, Penguin and Catwoman were always welcome in our living room.<br/><br/>I've recently streamed a few episodes just for the heck of it. One featured Liberace as Chandell (very clever name!). I'm not a Liberace fan and he wasn't a favored villain in my youth, but as an adult I got a few really good laughs out of this episode. Firstly, after a robbery at Stately Wayne Manor, Commissioner Gordon picks up the Batphone only to be advised by Alfred that Batman and Robin are on vacation. There's a look of pure horror on his face as he turns to Chief O'Hara and says \"I think we may have to\u0085 solve this one ourselves!\" As a kid I wouldn't have batted an eye; as an adult I cracked up\u0085 you mean, DO YOUR JOB for a change? It was a hilarious line and Neil Hamilton really nailed it\u0085 I bet he enjoyed the rare opportunity to be a bigger part of the plot. And Stafford Repp got in a few zingers as well, over and above his weekly sigh of \"saints preserve us!\": at one point, Chief O'Hara decides that snipers with machine guns in the balcony of the local concert hall are the way to deter any possible criminal acts during Chandell's performance, again producing howls from the grown-ups. Fears for Aunt Harriet's virtue are voiced when she visits Chandell in his dressing room\u0085 trust me, Aunt Harriet is safe with Chandell (but the Boy Wonder might not have been). The funniest scene by far was the absent Bruce Wayne ruminating that Commissioner Gordon would doubtless have things well in hand and would work tirelessly to apprehend the villain\u0085 cut to Commissioner Gordon with a row of large pill bottles lined up on his desk. So stalwart Commissioner Gordon is amped up on speed? Pure comedy gold. The cherry on top of the cupcake was Liberace's performance as evil twin brother Harry the gangster, puffing cigars and talking out of the corner of his mouth; he was quite entertaining as something other than his grinning sequin-studded pianist persona.<br/><br/>Recommended for nostalgia factor only\u0085 anyone raised on the darker film series probably wouldn't understand.

There is absolutely nothing dark about Adam West's rendition of the character.<br/><br/>In this age of infomercials and reality TV, reruns have become a thing of the past, but I've really been enjoying revisiting the show via the newly released DVDs of this short-lived sensation. Looking back on this show nearly 50 years later, I just don't know how the players kept a straight face with their intentionally cheesy lines. Neil Hamilton, a film actor of some prominence from the silent era through the 1930's, is just great as the stone-faced Commissioner Gordon. I didn't even know his place in film history until years later when I got into classic films.<br/><br/>And as for Adam West, I've always admired his great positive attitude about his short lived fame. Through the years he's often parodied his role in commercials and you could tell he was really enjoying himself and poking fun at the character he once played. The DVDs have a long interview with Adam West and he really is a great guy. Now in his 80's, West just said he felt very fortunate to have had work as an actor throughout his career, to have good friends and a great family, and to have been part of such a big part of 60's TV culture, even if for a short time - what a class act who did not let fame go to his head.<br/><br/>Now for the show itself. Everybody wanted to be a guest star villain, and many did. As well as the original villains from the Batman comics such as the Riddler, The Penguin, and The Joker, there were some added that were unique to the series such as Victor Buono as King Tut. The odd thing about Tut was that the show actually showed the origin of Tut as a criminal - a respected Egyptologist who was hit on the head and became an arch criminal when not in his right mind. He was also one of the rare villains for which Batman seemed to have compassion. Nobody ever wondered why The Joker wandered around in loud suits and makeup or why The Penguin never got tired of smoking cigarettes ala FDR and wearing a tux.<br/><br/>Then there is Robin, who is actually Batman's young ward Dick Grayson. Dick is actually in high school, and at Wayne mansion Bruce Wayne is always lecturing Dick about the importance of good diet, exercise, education and seat belts. Yet, that doesn't prevent Bruce Wayne as Batman from putting someone not of legal age repeatedly in harm's way. And harm never seemed to mean mere gun play. Instead it was the danger of being eaten by giant clams or being sawed in half by a buzz saw. You couldn't say Gotham's criminals lacked imagination.<br/><br/>Finally an observation about Batman in relation to \"Wild Wild West\", both of which aired at about the same time in the 1960's. Wild Wild West had good ratings, but the show's producers decided to cancel because CBS said the show was too violent, when the fight scenes were no worse than Batman's fight scenes. Maybe they should have added some cartoon KAPOW!, OUCH! and POW!. Seriously, add those captions into the Wild Wild West fight scenes and you would have had the same thing.<br/><br/>So if you have some time and spare cash, get the Batman DVDs and watch one of the great fads of television that people still remember fondly 50 years later. And see if you notice the little jokey touches like Ma Barker's buxom daughter's prison number being \"35-23-34\" and the fact that Robin's bat pole was smaller than Batman's pole.

It is not the best of anything to do with Batman I've seen, and any fans of the comics will perhaps be disappointed, but Batman(1966) is still a great show. Is it silly? Yes it is, and somewhat camp too, with some of the lines and the delivery of them. But that worked in the show's favour, the campiness actually added to the quality of the show for me, and a vast majority of it was witty and fresh.<br/><br/>So why isn't this show a 10 in my book? For me, the show took a spiral downwards during Season 3, it wasn't unwatchable or anything, there were some high points such as Joan Collins' Siren and King Tut who was surprisingly consistent, but there were some weak episodes, the humour wasn't as sharp, witty or satirical and the change of pace(no more cliffhangers) kind of hurt it as well. The episode with Dr.Cassandra epitomised this in my opinion, I wasn't so taken with Sandman, Minerva or Puzzler either and mostly because the story lines weren't as good or the villains themselves were on the dull side, and while Eartha Kitt was a good Catwoman, Julie Newmar was sexier and handled the comedy better. Also Julie had the better-written story lines and dialogue. Lee Merriweather was great too in the movie, which compliments the series very well, but some of the first episodes I saw of this show were those with Julie in. As for Yvonne Craig's Batgirl, the performance was okay but I got the sense that in relation to some of the stories Batgirl felt shoe horned in.<br/><br/>Season 3 aside, Seasons 1 and 2 have some classics. Season 1 is the best, I loved the sharp and witty humour and it maintained its endearing campy freshness that made the show so appealing to me. Season 2 wasn't as good, with a couple of not-so-good episodes, but I liked how much broader the satire got in this season. What was my favourite episode? Many to choose from, but the one where Penguin stands for Mayor is classic.<br/><br/>The production values are pretty good. I liked the photography and the costumes, while the batmobile is wonderful to watch and Gotham City is well-realised without having the spectacle of the Burton and Nolan movies for instance, not a bad thing by the way. The theme song also gives the show its energy, to me the theme song is one of those things that gives the show its status, very driven with a fun, catchy melody it is just irresistible. And I liked the neat little cartoon sequence that went with it.<br/><br/>The story lines are fun and fresh, the idea of the two parters to create something contrasting and different worked wonders, while the writing does a really good job of cheering me up after a long day and the fight sequences are fun and decently choreographed. The performances are good too. Adam West is a fun Batman, and deserves credit for making the campiest of lines sound credible by his deadpan delivery. Burt Ward is good as Robin, his \"Holy...\" catchphrases may grate depending on who you are, but he contrasts well with West's Batman. Alfred is charmingly played by Alan Napier, Neil Hamilton is a hoot and the narration is deliciously sardonic. But the villains made the show for me, while I was interested in Vincent Price, George Sanders and David Wayne as Egghead, Mr Freeze and Mad Hatter, and Frank Gorshin nailed Riddler(John Astin not so much), my favourites were Penguin and Joker, wonderfully played by Burgess Meredith and Cesar Romero.<br/><br/>Overall, a fun show and great to watch after a hard day. 9/10 Bethany Cox", "rating": 9, "helpful": "4 out of 4 found this helpful.", "date": "4 March 2011"}, {"title": " Laughs From The Book Of Exodus", "content": "Bob Kane created Batman to be a creature of the night, but in the 1950s comics became so macabre (with be-headings, torture and other select anti-social behavior), the comics code authority came into being.

And all that's left is them looking like they're trying too hard. That's just not fun anymore.

The opening banter was good and the jokes about Jacob Zuma very topical and clearly enjoyed by the South African audience. Who is the curmudgeonly version of Stig? He's very unfunny.

By season 2 the show settled on their starring lineup: Jeremy Clarkson, James May, and Richard Hammond, three very British and somewhat incompetent automotive journalists who reviewed the latest models, revisited classics, discussed automotive news, and interviewed celebrities in their own unique way, Most amusing of all were their challenges, road trips, and hair-brained schemes to apply their automotive knowledge and passion to make life easier and the world a better place (often with disastrous results).<br/><br/>Top Gear worked so well in this format because of the chemistry between the three presenters. They were genuinely organic and funny, contrasted with the cringe-inducing subsequent hosts. When Jeremy was fired in 2015, James and Richard stuck to their guns and resigned as well, knowing all three of them are what contributed to the show's success. We will never see Top Gear in this format again, but The Grand Tour is just about the best replacement we could've realistically asked for.<br/><br/>It follows the same general format as the old show: reviews, interviews, discussions, challenges, and adventures. It's the same 3 presenters, but this time (for the first 3 seasons anyway) each episode is filmed at a different location in the world. My first annoyance with this, is that because they're following the old format so closely, and they can't use the same titles and lingo from Top Gear, the replacements are so transparent. Instead of The Stig they had The American who was soon replaced with Abby. The Stig was a huge part of Top Gear's identity. Granted he was more of a prop than a character, but his anonymity and socially removed behavior allowed for some great gags. Jeremy now says \"terrible disappointment\" and \"back to the tent\" instead of \"bombshell\" and \"back to the studio\". Conversation street is clearly just the news, but at least Richard gives a unique intro every time and the animated shorts are hilarious.<br/><br/>My second, bigger gripe with the Grand Tour is how some parts are a lot more obviously staged than in Top Gear. TG had many staged scenes, but the show somehow managed to make all the dialogue, actions, and body language feel natural. It's hard to explain without spoiling many scenes in GT, but the dialogue feels noticeably more scripted and the events more convoluted.<br/><br/>Many fans are sad that the show (for the time being) will not be continuing in its old format with the tent. I however look forward to season 4 since it will be entirely adventures, which were always the high point of any season of TG or GT. The Grand Tour is not really about the cars anyway. Everything Top Gear has done season 23 and on is proof of that. Jeremy, Hamster, and Captain Slow are the heart of GT, specifically their humor, unbreakable optimism, and sense of adventure.

A family sitcom on the WB pitched around country music star Reba McEntire. It took me a good 3 years of convincing to even give it a try and, low and beyond I was pleasantly surprised. \"Reba\" is genuinely funny.<br/><br/>McEntire plays Reba Hart, mother of 3 in the TV-neglected city of Houston, whose life is thrown into chaos when her husband Brock (Christopher Rich, \"Murphy Brown\") has an affair with Barbra Jean (Melissa Peterman) and the resulting divorce coincides with her oldest daughter, Cheyenne (Joanna Garcia, \"Freaks and Geeks\") becoming pregnant and her baby and new husband Van (Steve Howey) being forced to move in with mom.<br/><br/>When \"Reba\" begins we are pretty much thrown clear from all the angst and drama that the show's back-story involves. In true impossible sitcom fashion Brock and Barbra Jean have moved in next door to Reba and hilarity ensues. You might call \"Reba\" \"Grace Under Fire Lite\". It has shaved the bitterness and edge off of Brett Butler's gutsy spousal abuse sitcom and it is an even funnier and more pleasing show because of it.<br/><br/>Sidebar. TV does a lot to trivialize the impact of divorce, and though it might seem like that on the page, \"Reba\" doesn't do that. It is certainly \"sitcom-ized\", but the nuggets of truth behind all the one-liners feel authentic. Like the best family sitcoms, \"Reba\" uses silly typical sitcom premises only to peel them back and use them to delve into a deeper character issue underneath. Rarely have I seen a family sitcom handle children of divorce, male depression, teen pregnancy and a woman over 40 dating with such intelligence and insight. But the tone is still kept light and upbeat. No Very Special Episodes here.<br/><br/>The writing is surprisingly sharp and the bits are multi-layered and steeped in a respect for the characters. At the center of the series is the back-and-forth between Reba and Barbra Jean, which is basically a classic rivalry of Reba hurling insults and Barbra Jean not picking them up. Peterman, embodying the proverbial bull in a china shop, chews up the scenery big time in a very funny way. Barbra Jean is like no mistress/stepmother you've ever seen \u0096 obnoxious, ditsy and sweetly endearing. Also in the hamming up department is Howey, who is another graduate from the Jim Carrey/Ryan Reynolds School of Acting and, by God, this guy cracks me up. This is good work by all involved, also including deadpan funny deliveries from Rich and Scarlett Pomers (as Reba's neglected middle-child Kyra who gets all the best one-liners). But who knew that Reba McEntire was such a natural comic actress? Her delivery and comic timing is top-of-the-line for the genre.<br/><br/>\"Reba\" is a more complex and evolved family sitcom than it first might look. Seasons span entire story arcs: Kyra moves out, Brock's mid-life crisis, Van's football career, Brock and Barbra Jean break-up. I dig the way the show fleshes out the characters, even Brock isn't confined to \"deadbeat husband\" status, but walks the line that keeps us from completely liking them. The worst thing that could happen to Reba would be to have her and Barbra Jean truly become friends. Aside from the fact that it would ruin the show's dynamic, it would be insulting unrealistic. It comes close, but the show doesn't hold it for long. In the 5th season the show hits a stride, breaking out of its own domestic drama and having a little fun with real world issues like zero tolerance, sodas in school and Hurricane Katrina evacuees in Houston.<br/><br/>Judging it in the genre, if \"8 Simple Rules\" and \"George Lopez\" are 3-star shows, than \"Reba\" is much better. In fact, it is the best family sitcom on TV today. Insightful and genuinely funny without being at all crass.

While I'm sure Ms. McIntire can sing and has a fan base that supports that, being in a sitcom shooting out zingers and calling her the next Lucille Ball is far, far removed from reality.<br/><br/>Reba herself has no presence which is needed here to establish the fact that she is cast as the put-upon woman of which her entire family is centered. Yet after watching a few episodes there is no real connection to the character. I could care less about her adventures because her whole character seems to be MIA. Reba McIntire has no screen presence, and to make a show around her seems very short-sighted and indicative of most 'family-oriented' programming: to push a sitcom full of men-stupid/women-do-everything stereotypes that appeal to nobody but those who can't afford cable.<br/><br/>The show is a waste of time.

Or, perhaps, they made her *too* lovable, for Reba Hart seems to waver between being mean and scary (hence Van's line to his wife Cheyenne \"I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!\") and being sweet and caring with little transition in between. Roseanne at least managed to get it across that she was being cruel to be kind, since she was always mean and sarcastic and, whenever she tried to open up, it was hard for her.

Initially, it was about an eccentric time-traveller from another planet, who looked human and affected an English manner and style. The interior of his time machine (called a TARDIS) was huge and highly advanced, but the exterior quaintly resembled an English public call box. The Doctor was a self-imposed exile from a race of powerful beings called the Time Lords. The Time Lords observed history, but never interfered with it. This bored the almighty heck out of the Doctor, so he made off with an older TARDIS and decided to see the Universe for himself. <br/><br/>When the original actor who played the Doctor decided to leave the show, the writers came up with the inventive concept of `regeneration'. Whenever the Doctor was close to death, or actually killed, he would `regenerate' into a new body (and persona). The show went through seven highly talented actors in this fashion.<br/><br/>The format of the show was highly adaptable. Didn't like the way the show was going? Just wait two or three years. The style always seemed to change whenever there was a change of Doctor, producer and/or script editor. The series went from educational children's drama to monster show to intelligent adult sci-fi/drama to gothic horror to high camp, et cetera, et cetera, and so forth.<br/><br/>This was a wonderful, imaginative, fun show when it was on.

Every few weeks, the Doctor would travel to a different planet or time, allowing the show's cast, setting, and tone to constantly change.  Even the Doctor himself was periodically replaced by a new actor, \"regenerating\" his body whenever he was on the verge of death.  This format gave the show an amazing freshness and allowed it to last for over a quarter of a century without becoming stale.  <br/><br/>Since the show's cancellation, Doctor Who has been sustained by hundreds of books and radio shows.  Although the concept is beginning to seem a bit old now, great \"Who\" stories are still coming out all the time. <br/><br/>\nTelevision remains the ultimate format for Doctor Who, however, and the series has something to offer for just about everyone.  The early episodes, starring William Hartnell, were mysterious and realistic in tone, and are terribly underrated by the show's fans.  Tom Baker, the most popular Doctor internationally, had a succession of wild and colorful adventures that are more entertaining and a lot funnier than most of the sitcoms on TV today. In its dying days, when Sylvester McCoy was in the lead role, Doctor Who became highly allegorical and politically charged.    <br/><br/>Every Doctor's era has some merit, though some are obviously more inspired than others.  In the early 70s and early 80s in particular, the show suffered from some poor production values and repetitive plots, but even the bad episodes are fun to watch and often redeemed by some strength \u0096 good performances, an interesting plot twist, etc.  <br/><br/>Lovers of modern, flashy science fiction will probably laugh Doctor Who off the screen because of its modest special effects, but nevertheless it remains one of the most visually inventive TV shows ever made.  Episodes like Tomb of the Cybermen and Remembrance of the Daleks contain unforgettable images that stack up to anything Hollywood produced on a 100x bigger budget.  If you want to pick the show's visuals apart, you can, but you'll be doing yourself a disservice if you don't suspend your disbelief and allow yourself to be drawn into the Doctor's universe.<br/><br/>I may be in the minority, but I enjoyed the 1996 TV Movie that attempted to resurrect Doctor Who years after its cancellation.  I don't buy the argument that Doctor Who couldn't survive in today's big-budget entertainment arena. The intelligence of the X-Men and Spider-Man movies has convinced me that a slick, cerebral version of Doctor Who could be produced today that would be faithful to the not-so-slick, cerebral original.  But regardless of whether Doctor Who returns or not, it remains one of the great TV shows of all time. It still wins awards even today, and enjoys widespread popular and critical acclaim.  Even Doctor Who's detractors only serve to prove that the show is famous enough to draw criticism!  <br/><br/>In short, Doctor Who is smart, fun, and endlessly creative.  It has kept me entertained for over fifteen years, and my enthusiasm for it has barely waned.

Classic Who has so many different styles and stories and protagonists. It's amazing concepts and different, iconic things.things that are just common knowledge in our culture today. Eight Doctors. Eight eras. There's just too much of it to put into words. Doctor Who is just part of British culture due to this fine, twenty six season long story of a time travelling alien.<br/><br/>Each Doctor's era is very different. They seem to have the same style as the Doctor. The Doctor ran the show, with the exception of the First Doctor (William Hartnell) to a degree, who let his companions take charge. Each Doctor had unique personalities, and the style and stories of Classic Who matched the Doctor they were assigned to.<br/><br/>The First Doctor was more of an adviser and let his companions take control, but he was still a crazy, lovable alien just like his other incarnations. The Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) is my favourite, he's very childish but intelligent and was grown up when he needed to be. The Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) was the earthbound Doctor started off as arrogant and annoyed, but gradually became more loving. The Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) arguably made the show popular and is the most known Classic Doctor. He's also arguably the most childish and always had that huge smile.<br/><br/>The Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison) was the youngest Classic Doctor, but acted like the oldest at times. He's arguably the most unlucky Doctor as he just wants fun but death surrounds him. The Sixth Doctor (Colin Baker) is arguably (yes, again) the most disliked Doctor due to his arrogance and choice of clothing (not his fault). He was very childish and serious most of the time. The Seventh Doctor (Sylvester McCoy) was the clown to start off with, but gradually got much darker and more manipulative but always remained childish. The Eighth Doctor (Paul McGann) was probably the most human Doctor, and seemed to be one of the most childish but had a hidden sadness and rage, leading into New Who.<br/><br/>The TARDIS is the Doctor's iconic time and space travelling machine. It has became so iconic in British culture that if a child sees an old police box, he'll/she'll probably shout \"TARDIS!\" and point. The Master is the Doctor's nemesis, his Moriarty, who can also regenerate when injured as they are both the aliens called Time Lords from Gallifrey.

If only each story was cut in half, bar some of the better paces stories.<br/><br/>So a huge cultural thing, but the series itself has a number of problems.

I grew up in Australia, the Australian bush specifically. The first doctor I was old enough to actually appreciate was Slyvester McCoy. I had seen all the Pertwee and Tom Baker episodes as a kid but hadn't taken them in, so my first episode I have any real memory of is Time and the Rani. And I was hooked pretty much from there. As a child of 7, I had no concept of good Doctor Who or bad Doctor Who, or, as I prefer to call them both as a grown adult; \"Doctor Who.\" I just knew he was a Time Lord, from the planet Gallifrey, that he drifted around through time and space in a Police Box and helped people. I didn't care about effects or acting, I just liked the premise.<br/><br/>It took about 5 years after the McCoy era ended in 1990 (in Australia) for the show to return, at 4am in the morning, and it was Peter Davison episodes they were showing. Every morning I would get up and watch the show and Davison ended up becoming MY Doctor.<br/><br/>I spent a lot of the so called \"Wilderness years\" watching the old episodes, becoming acquainted with Hartnell's Doctor and re watching some Tom Baker episodes I never really followed as a child. I could see the changing world views on show, from the fear of nuclear destruction in The Daleks to the sympathetic look at Christianity in The Romans, to attacks on consumerism in the Sun Makers and anti-Thatcher sentiments of the Happiness Patrol and the increasing prominence of secular humanism within the show's ideals.<br/><br/>I could notice stylistic changes from action oriented in early 70s, to hammer horror influences in the mid 70s, to bonkers Monty Python silliness in the late 70s and then glossy and pessimistic kill fests in the early to mid 80s. I came to admire the way the show changed and adapted as it got older. Season 22 was a disaster, both stylistically and thematically, but it was the only real clunker the show had in its original run which lasted 26 seasons. The key idea that the show had to keep was that the Doctor was an alien with a magic box who flies into a town, finds a problem, fixes said problem, and flies off.<br/><br/>I'll list briefly the episodes that I enjoyed the most as a youngling and then take off, probably not having achieved anything apart from indulging myself.<br/><br/>Remembrance of the Daleks- First episode I ever watched obsessively. Devious doctor, dalek civil war, creepy little girl, lots of deaths and a satisfying resolution. I hear criticism of this being too continuity heavy. All I will say is I was 8, and had no problems understanding that the daleks were fighting each other over Davros, the doctor had left the hand in a previous incarnation and he had got it from his home planet. Kids really aren't as stupid as some adults seems to think. As Peter Davison later paraphrased \"The challenge with writing Doctor Who is keeping it simple enough for the adults to follow, but complicated enough for the kids to stay interested.\" Deadly Assassin- loved it. Crispy Master. Decadent Gallifrey. Awesome Castellan. Big stakes and Tom Baker at his best. This was another one fans at the time hated because it showed the Time Lords and Gallifrey in a different light to ever before.<br/><br/>The Romans- got the VHS in 1996(I think) and loved this one. Ian became one of my favourite companions. Felt like such an epic.

With that in mind, I thought it might be an opportune time to reflect on some of the great stories of the past.<br/><br/>From First Doctor William Hartnell's era, my choice of favourite story would have to be \"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\". The use of extensive location filming enhances its atmosphere greatly. I know that, forty years on, the Robomen look and sound silly and the flying saucer is obviously dangled from a piece of string but the serial's shortcomings are compensated by the imagery of the Dalek rising from the River Thames and a group of them patrolling Trafalgar Square, not to mention crossing Westminster Bridge in the trailer. And then there is the sensitive ending marking Carole Ann Ford's departure from the series after playing the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan, for ten stories...<br/><br/>So many perfect serials from Second Doctor Patrick Troughton's time on the show! \"Fury from the Deep\" is my choice because it frightened me more than anything else I'd ever seen. It has several excellent cliffhangers and I'll never forget one of the characters walking out to sea and not stopping as she becomes totally immersed by the water or Victoria trapped in a locked room as the seaweed and foam threaten to engulf her. I long to see this story again but, alas, it seems gone forever.<br/><br/>I love the first six serials of the Jon Pertwee era because they are complex and challenging. Of the six, \"The Mind of Evil\" is my favourite though writer Don Houghton's other serial, \"Inferno\", comes a close second. The reason I like it is because the idea of a parasite feeding off the fear in men's minds is so much more frightening than some lumbering monster!<br/><br/>My favourite Tom Baker serial is \"Genesis of the Daleks\" despite the BBC always falling back on it for repeat seasons! Writer Terry Nation, creator of the Daleks, devised the character of Davros in order to raise the standard of dialogue between hero and enemy, succeeding here in discussing many moral issues. Sarah Jane Smith seemingly falling to her death from the rocket scaffolding, as she tries to make her escape, and the freeze frame is another moment that will always stay with me.<br/><br/>Cliffhangers play an important part in making a good serial and \"The Caves of Androzani\" boasts two of the finest. When Peter Davison's Doctor and new companion Peri are shot dead at the end of the first episode I didn't foresee the resolution. It's a shame it took until the last story of this era to get it right but director Graeme Harper presents us with a thoroughly gripping tour de force. Christopher Gable is electrifying as Sharaz Jek and I love the scene of the dying Doctor, coat caked in mud, struggling to carry his companion back to the TARDIS in an act of self-sacrifice that leads to his premature regeneration at the story's close.<br/><br/>\"Revelation of the Daleks\" is \"Doctor Who\" for adults. Writer Eric Saward presents us with an alternative take on the Doctor through the character of Orcini, and his sidekick with personal hygiene problems, which is why Colin Baker's Doctor doesn't really enter the fray until over halfway through. Nicola Bryant, as Peri, is lucky to have worked with Harper on both his serials which may account for why she is one of my favourite companions. There are moments of real pathos in this serial such as Natasha discovering what has really become of her father and the death of Jobel, which is no mean feat when you consider the ghastly nature of his character!<br/><br/>Finally, from Sylvester McCoy's three years on the show, my choice has to be \"The Curse of Fenric\". This period has come in for much criticism when, certainly during the last two years, the show was actually beginning to find its feet again. It wasn't all played for laughs as is often suggested. One of the scariest things in this serial isn't the Haemovores or the rather placid Ancient One but the transformation of the two girls into vampires because the allegory, equating loose morality with bodily decay, is far more frightening than any monster could be, even when those monsters are well-realised. The story contains some very memorable dialogue too. Who can forget the chilling menace of \"We play the contest again... Time Lord\"?<br/><br/>And, if I was only allowed just one of the seven to take to my mythical island it would have to be, if it still existed in the BBC's archive, \"Fury from the Deep\". I don't think I would be disappointed, given the opportunity to see it again, as anything that can leave such an indelible mark on the memory has to have been an extremely powerful piece.", "rating": null, "helpful": "24 out of 29 found this helpful.", "date": "18 March 2005"}, {"title": " Some recommendations for new viewers", "content": "The sheer volume of Doctor Who episodes makes briefly commenting on all aspects of this wonderful show a challenge.  However, I can make some recommendations for new viewers.<br/><br/>If the ONLY thing you want from science fiction is special effects, then Doctor Who is not for you.  The quality of the effects are often admirable when the shoestring production budget considerations are factored in, but Doctor Who never really equaled the special effects of other shows.  What Doctor Who does deliver is keen attention to character, dialogue, and plot. Doctor Who was always something more than its 1963 b&amp;w kid's show origins suggest, and over the years it evolved into a program that could make some very clever, thought-provoking comments and observations while at the same time delivering a fun and suspenseful adventure.<br/><br/>Cliffhangers were what made me a fan from the beginning.  Unfortunately, Doctor Who tends to be shown now in movie-style blocks.  This dilutes those marvelous cliffhangers.  Every episode of the show is about a half-hour, but most stories had at least 4 parts.  At the end of each part, the Doctor or one of his many companions faces seemingly absolute, inescapable doom of some kind or another.  I was lucky enough to first see Doctor Who on PBS, one half-hour episode per week-night.  My friends and I had to wait a whole agonizing day to see the Doctor's clever escape or rescue.  I don't know how the UK fans had the patience to wait a week. If you can, you should try to preserve the breaks too in order to get a real sense of the show, even if you just pause a few moments between parts.<br/><br/>One more thing to remember is that the Doctor is enigmatic.  We still don't know everything there is to know about this renegade Time Lord.  Part of the fun of the show is learning about the complex character and his history. But rest assured, his hearts are always in the right place.<br/><br/>So which episode should you start with?  Every fan has a favorite Doctor and episode.  I think you can't go wrong with \"Remembrance of the Daleks\" (1988).  The 7th Doctor and Ace are a great team.  Or try \"City of Death\" (1979), a terrific 4th Doctor and Romana story set in Paris.

The premise of a space craft being able to visit any time period or any planet means the possibilities are limitless . However it`s a series often ridiculed and no television show is producer proof , a fact that shows up in the late 70s and 80s<br/><br/>Created in 1963 by Sydney Newman the first producer was Verity Lambert a woman who would later become a legend of broadcasting in the 70s up till today. Lambert`s talent shines through in the early episodes with William Hartnell as the Doctor. True it`s got a budget of sixpence and the sets are as big as a cupboard but the production has excellent writers and is treated with absolute respect most of all from the actors who always manage to suspend our disbelief with convincing acting , especially William Russell who plays Ian Chesterton . Ian plays the typical heroic figure to Hartnell`s atypical antihero, and it`s intresting to note the antagonistic approach towards the early tardis crew. Also interesting to note that each SF story was followed by a historical story . Strangely the SF ones have dated very badly<br/><br/>By the time Patrick Troughton took over as the Doctor  , Dalekmania , antagonism between the changing tardis crew ,  and historical stories had disappeared and in it`s place we had more formuliac and scarier stories in their place. Unfortunately the BBC junked most of this eras mastertapes so we only have a brief taste of this era, but Troughton never gave a bad performance and his assistants were sexy<br/><br/>Jon Pertwee , colour , and an entirely Earthbound format was introduced in 1970 . I`m not alone in saying this was the best era and was when I first started watching the show aged about four years old though I had to watch it behind the couch. Every Saturday afternoon was the highlight of my life , all my friends watched it as the viewing figures climbed. Alas the Pertwee era hasn`t aged very well as I found out watching the repeats over 20 years later.<br/><br/>Tom Baker had an era of two halves when he took over from Pertwee. Coinciding with the change of actors we had a change of producers as Barry Letts gave way to Phillip Hinchcliffe who took DOCTOR WHO to even greater heights 14 million viewers would tune in as the show became more adult and terrifying , concerned mothers and viewers pressure groups would bombard the BBC with complaints about the horror on show which meant when Hinchcliffe was replaced with Graham Williams in 1977 and with it ended the programme`s most acclaimed period. It probably wasn`t William`s fault but DOCTOR WHO  soon started becoming very silly , the monsters were laughable and Tom Baker seemed to be taking the p***.<br/><br/>In 1980 John Nathan Turner took over the producer reins and when Baker left the following year he cast Peter Davison as the Doctor. The early Davison episodes were certainly an improvement on the latter Baker era , KINDA for example features a guest appearance by Simon Rouse of THE BILL fame and gives the greatest performance in the show`s history , while THE CAVES OF ANDROZANI often wins fan polls as the greatest ever DOCTOR WHO story but the cracks were starting to show as Nathan Turner started introducing more and more old foes and when Colin Baker was ( Mis)cast as the Doctor in 1984 his whole first season featured old enemies and anorakish references to the past. This led to the BBC putting the show on hold for a year<br/><br/>The show returned in 1986 worse than ever and now cut to 14 episodes a year, Colin Baker was sacked and replaced by Sylvester McCoy who was an even bigger disaster than Baker and by the time the show was axed in 1989 it only had something like 3 million viewers. As a fan I`d describe it as a mercy killing.<br/><br/>So ended a once great television series . It has become a fondly remembered legend and there`s often rumours of a Hollywood remake , but as the American 1996 TVM showed megabuck budgets can`t enhance a poor script.

Harry and Sarah must be his Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, I thought. He was some eccentric scientist. At the end of his first adventure, \"Robot\", he, Harry and Sarah enter this blue cabinet, the strangest noise in the world is heard, and the cabinet disappears. Now the stumper was Brigadier Lethbridge Stewart's non-chalant reaction to the vanishing box. LIttle did I realize there was nearly twenty years history to what I was watching. I knew nothing about Time Lords, Gallifrey or what a Tardis was, let alone a walk-in police call box, something not found in America.<br/><br/>I missed Harry's departure and thought the actor must have just quit the show, but he did show up later. Then Elizabeth Sladen left and I had no idea what to expect. Gallifrey? What was Gallifrey? He has to go back and get Sarah. <br/><br/>The Gallifrean adventure was followed up with the introduction of Leela, the jungle girl. When she stormed into the tardis, I knew I was watching a show I could not begin to predict. K-9? Need I say more? I was destroyed when Leela left, and with Romanadveratrelunder's arrival I just sat back and went for the ride. When Lalla Ward (Romana II) left, I was a little more braced for what I was watching. So I thought. As Tegan, Nyssa and Adric watched, the Doctor saw all his old friends, then his old enemies. What did this mean?<br/><br/>Enter Peter Davison. I would learn that what I had just watched, five episodes a week, like a soap opera in a matter of eight months, was a twenty year old character. Tom Baker had already quit being the Doctor by the time I started watching it. <br/><br/>Davison's reign would be short and not as thrilling as Baker's.

For many, including myself, it represents a world of incredible wonders and many memorable relationships with a handful of Doctors and three times as many \"assistants\". Of course, the Daleks ARE \"Dr. Who\", there's no getting around that, but the Cybermen ran a fair race with them, too.<br/><br/>For me, however, \"Dr. Who\" is Linx, the helmeted Sontaran who appeared in the episode \"The Time Warrior\". At the end of the first ep, he removes his cover to reveal pure alien ugliness, and there the ep ended. I have always loved those cliffhangers where a putrid looking alien is revealed. Cue the transporting, sonically rich theme music and wait for the next installment as the ugly alien image you just saw remains at the front of your cerebellum.<br/><br/>\"Dr. Who\" is a series of amazing ideas, wonderful pseudo-science, exciting adventures and, yes, sexy women. I will always have a very special place in my heart (and elsewhere) for Jo (Katy Manning) after I spotted her pink panties in one episode. I adored Sarah-Jane (Elisabeth Sladen), too, and felt short-changed when Tom Baker, my favorite Doctor, married the second Leila (Lala Ward), an actress I'd lusted after since Hammer's \"Vampire Circus\". The primitive Leila (Louise Jamieson) was a great addition to the cast, too, with her barely-there costume and impatient, naive personality.<br/><br/>I recall vividly \"The Robots of Death\" because their voices were so comforting yet disturbing. They looked amazing, too, with their pseudo-human-like faces of metal. The \"Zygons\" (\"Terror of the Zygons\"), who resided under Loch Ness, and had greasy, flesh-like control instruments in their spaceship, resembled giant, rotten carrots were also my favorites. After Linx screwed up his mission, The Sontarans regrouped and sent Field Major Steyr to Earth in a two-parter known as \"The Sontaran Experiment\". The images of the grumpy Steyr talking to his bosses on a TV embedded in a rock were priceless, as was Sarah-Jane's first reaction to seeing Steyr's face: \"Linx!?\". I still hold much fondness for John Pertwee, the third Doctor, who brought great gravity and sophistication to the role. Patrick Traughton's finest hour for me was when he was battling \"The Sea Devils\", wet, misshapen creatures who sabotaged oil rigs on their road to world conquest. As a lover of plastic creatures, the Nestenes got my vote every time. Their appearance in \"Terror of the Autons\" chilled my tiny bones when I first encountered them, and I would never see a mannequin in the same way again.<br/><br/>As mighty villains go, Davros (from \"Genesis of the Daleks\") was hard to beat. Once again, he was one of Who's Ugly Aliens, and what a frightful fellow he was. Unable to walk and saddled with a mechanical, sickly voice, he exuded evil and made his Dalek accomplices pale in comparison. The Master was always good fun, too, as was the lovable Brigadier.<br/><br/>The new \"Dr. Who\" episodes have impressed me, but there's no point in writing about them here because, well, they're from a different world and deserve their own review.<br/><br/>I am sorry to all the monsters and potential world dominators I have not discussed here.

Kevin (played brilliantly by Fred Savage) comes of age in suburbia in a neighborhood that many of our parents (including my mom) grew up in.  Kevin lives in a ranch house with his parents, Jack (Dan Lauria), an accountant, Norma (Alley Mills) a housewife, and his older siblings, hippie Karen (Olivia D'Abo) and smart-alecky Wayne (Jason Hervey).  He has a childhood sweetheart in Gwendolyne \"Winnie\" Cooper (Danica McKellar), and a best friend in lovable geek Paul Pfeiffer (Josh Saviano).  Kevin deals with normal situations that is territorial with adolesence--first loves, heartbreak, middle school, high school, puberty, and growing up.  Kevin grows up in uncertain times, much like children are today.  Each episode is a chapter in Kevin's life, and follows him between the ages of 13 and 18--the most crucial years of growing up.<br/><br/>When this show was made, they definitely looked at the lives of teenagers. The characters were realistic, and no matter when you grew up, you could relate.  Everyone could relate to Kevin, and many felt his adolescent pain. You knew your parents were overburdening, but realized later that they were only trying to help you.  Everyone had a sibling like Wayne, and possibly like Karen.<br/><br/>I'm a product of the 1980s, and being born in 1982 put me out of the loop in regard to what the 1960s and 1970s were really like.  My parents came of age in this decade, so they easily related to Kevin.  The situations were comical, and this show was always good, clean fun.  The humor wasn't overburdening, but it was evident, and we always laughed, but it also impacted you and made you think after it was all over.  This show premired when my brother and I were only 5, and we watched it with our parents every week until it went off the air.  I don't think this show ever was capable of cancellation, but it went out the way it was intended, and it left an indellible impression on this generation.  When the reruns returned to television on Nick-at-Nite in 1998, my classmates and I, already in ninth grade, began to watch again.  Now, I'm a sophomore in college, and if I can catch the reruns on ABC Family during the week, I'm thrilled.  I truly miss this show, and watching reruns brings back great memories.<br/><br/>I don't have a favorite episode or memory--I have many favorite episodes and memories.  Two of the moments that I can still remember vividly are when Winnie's older brother died in Vietnam and Kevin and Winnie shared their first kiss, and when Kevin's math teacher died.  My mom, brother, and I always used to laugh (and still do) at my dad, who resembles Jack Arnold. We could be talking about something funny during dinner, and my father will sit there, stone-faced, much like Jack always did.  I used to love when they'd ask him a question, and he would utter a low growl.  While my dad has NEVER done that, he has always resembled Jack.  Only now, several years later, he finds it funny that we thought that of him.<br/><br/>This was a wonderful show that never wore out its welcome, and continues to entertain those who catch the reruns.  If you have the chance in your hectic day, as I sometimes do, catch a rerun or set your VCR to tape an episode for you.  Relive a classic television program that continues to entertain and inspire years later.

When I started watching this amazing show in the mid 90s (when the series was officially over but had reruns going nonstop) I was so taken by it. Not because it made me reflect on my childhood (because I was right smack in the middle of it) but because I had a big crush on Winnie and it was funny. It also gave me a little insight to suburb life which intrigued me because I was born &amp; raised in Harlem, NYC.<br/><br/>Fast forward 20yrs to present day. I'm now 31yrs old (OK OK, so I'm not an old man yet) and I find that Netflix has FINALLY released this fabulous series on Instant streaming.

It was every bit as great as I remembered it, PLUS MORE!!! NOW I was able to enjoy it because of how it cause me to reflect on my childhood. After moving from NYC to the suburbs in my early youth, I could relate to a lot of what Kevin Arnold went through and how the narrator (old Kevin Arnold) saw things through his own eyes. Let me tell you, this show made me cry when I was young because I was such a fan of the Winnie &amp; Kevin relationship.... now this show made me cry again!!

I had a nerdy best friend (like Paul - even looked like him!) who I usually ended up sticking up for (I remember giving more than one beat down to people who picked on him when he wasn't watching). I even had a female close friend for all my high school and college years who I was madly in love with, but alas, to her I was never more than just a really good friend.

The great thing about this show is that it has something for everyone. It evokes memories for two generations of viewers (1) Since it premiered in the late 80s (and carried over into the early 90s), it reminds those of us who were lucky enough to see all the popular shows of the time. For me, some of my favorite shows came out during this era. And (2) Since it's set in the late 60s/early 70s, it vividly evokes a time and place for viewers that lived during that era.<br/><br/>The true genius of The Wonder Years is that regardless of the fact that it was an \"80s/90s\" show and set in the \"60s/70s\", it truthfully presented growing pains of it's central character Kevin Arnold (brilliantly played be series star Fred Savage, who was nominated for a Best Actor Emmy for his work). At the time of the show's run, I really overlooked how difficult it must have been for this young actor to carry such a well-written, conceived show. Savage was so good, he should have taken home at least ONE Emmy for his work! The show itself actually took home the Emmy for Best Comedy Series after only it's first SIX episodes! It's like the Emmys actually had foresight and knew this show was going to be special. Too bad they now don't have hindsight and either award the wrong shows are over-award certain shows and actors to the detriment of other great shows and actors.<br/><br/>Savage was just so good in this role, as good or better than many adult actors. Another brilliant stroke of genius that made this show work was the narration by an unseen-only heard Daniel Stern (voice of the adult Kevin). When I first watched the show, I thought the narration was a bit much at times, but in re-watching old eps, the narration is a huge reason that many scenes and moments worked. The intermingling of the narrator dialogue (Kevin's future inner voice) with Kevin's situation at the time was perfectly done, with just the right doses of humor, sarcasm, wit, and gravitas.<br/><br/>Savage was working with a great supporting cast: Dan Lauria and Alley Mills (as Kevin's parents Jack and Norma Arnold), Jason Hervey (as Kevin's butthead of a big brother Wayne!), Olivia D'abo (as Kevin's flower-child sister Karen, the oldest of the siblings), Josh Saviano (as Kevin's nerdy best friend Paul), and Danica McKellar (as Kevin's eternal youthful infatuation and first love Winnie Cooper). These actors played well off of Savage and the show did a masterful job of always telling the story from Kevin's point of view, with the other characters reactionary, but at the same time, giving us glimpses into their personalities.<br/><br/>The Wonder Years touched upon pretty much every big theme of a pre-teen/teenager's life: puberty, Kevin's crushes on girls and one of his teachers, the sibling rivalry between Kevin and Wayne, Kevin's being bullied (ironically mostly from a girl, the recurring character Becky!), summer camp, first date, Kevin running for class president, Kevin's perspective on his parents, etc., but also issues of the time like the Vietnam War. The main thing is that Kevin was always portrayed as a normal kid with normal kid issues, flaws, thoughts, behavior, but it was always presented in a poignant, humorous, heartwarming manner. After all these years, the show doesn't even look dated at all!

Granted that this is a deeply personal show for me...but judging from the other reviews, it seems to be a deeply personal show for a lot of people. What is amazing about The Wonder Years is its ability to relate cross generations. I'm not going to talk specifically about any one episode because there are too many and no one here wants to read about my life story, but bear with me. I was born in 1980...so when I started watching The Wonder Years I was 8 and it ended when I was 13.....pretty much my formative years as a child. Watching the show during this time even as a child it was important to me. As a child, I could relate to Kevin or at least some of the other characters on a level where the understanding to me had everything to do with his experiences as a child and not a whole lot for the generation in which he lived his life. It worked for my parents because the show both created nostalgia to the time period in which they grew up as well and holding nostalgic memories of experiences that they may have had in common with the characters. Watching this show later in life only further showed me how great a show this truly was. Viewing this show 20+ years later you are able to see the show in a completely different light. While I'm not able to share in the nostalgia of the time period...as my parents...I am able to better relate to teenage Kevin....and his parents, grandparents, and dare I even say his jackass of a brother Wayne. If I wrote this review at another time I might be able to write a better one, but I am writing this on pure emotion and I can honestly tell you that this was one of the best shows ever made for television. The creators and the writers knew exactly what they were doing and it showed. Perhaps the Wonder Years was a little too far ahead of its time...or maybe America is all the stupider.

The final episode still to this day comes to almost bring me to tears, even now as an adult. Just thinking about the way things turned out; how Kevin and Winnie ended up separate from one another; how Jack, superman as far as I am concerned, turned his life around and finally achieved true happiness only to come to pass away after only a couple more years; how Norma, the sweetest and most caring mom of all-time made things work for her both in the home as she always had, but now also out in the real world (although I can't imagine how she made along after Jack passed and conversely just how he would have handled losing her if the situation were reversed); how troubled-Wayne transformed himself into an entirely different and better person as he matured and went to work for his dad (the influence Jack had on him late in life undoubtedly made all the difference for Wayne); how Karen came back into the picture with a new baby boy on the way and truly happy as she deserved to be; and Paul, or as I like to call him, \"Mr. Do-No-Wrong\" and how his consistency throughout the entirety of the series remained a constant (and I love Paul and I'm so proud of him for getting accepted into Harvard and going into law); just thinking about all of these great people and how things turned out for them, though it seems collectively that they achieved happiness, it is also bittersweet. When I think about the possibility of Kevin and Winnie not ending up together, it just makes me sad. Winnie is so perfect in so many ways, in fact, in my life, I measure the girls pursue by her. And just the way Kevin treated her and acted when he was around her and was so happy to be with her, he just deserved her. But I guess that life doesn't always work out the way it's supposed to. And Jack, THE stand-up guy among stand-up guys, to think that he so convincingly and successfully transitioned from his go-nowhere position at Norcom (that by the way was killing him, and probably was the cause of his ultimate death when it came down to it) to owning his own hand-made furniture business, just to die two years later, the thought brings with it so much sorrow. He's the type of dad I sometimes wish I had (and in some ways I do have this type of dad, but it some ways I also do not). I know that to some he seems rough around the edges, but just look at his situation. He's a Korean-war-veteran, he has an incredibly demanding job (for much of his life anyway), he has bills to worry about, he has a daughter who makes spontaneous decisions that affect the entire family (with much of the strain landing directly onto him as the father), a son in Wayne who really up until his early 20's has no direction in life, and Kevin, who brings with him both the good and the bad when it concerns his father. And even with all of this, under it all, he is a truly loving father, a dedicated husband, an incredibly hard-worker, and really truly a great man over all. His life, in my opinion, emulates the life of a true success story, even though it was cut so short. And Norma, oh god, who could ever forget about Norma? Let's not forget the fact that she is drop-dead gorgeous, but besides that, as far as personality is concerned, she's probably the sweetest thing I've ever laid my eyes on. She's such a loving mother and wife and homemaker, but in addition to all this, as we learn from her success, she's also competent when it comes to business matters as well. But this is really getting away from what she is all about at least as far as the show is concerned.

Daniel Stern, known for staring in the terrific movie \"Diner\", was the little voice inside Kevin that became the adult interpretation to Kevin's childhood chicanery!! The whole genre of the late sixties and early seventies was so astutely depicted on this show, right up to the fact that his mother looked just like Doris Day!! The trials and tribulations of the Arnold family were indeed a harbinger of the encroaching radicalism of American culture... Perhaps, the most impressionable character who effectuated these changing times most plausibly, was the role of Kevin's sister!! Winnie, Kevin's sort of girlfriend, was perhaps the most sensitive relationship in the series.... Looking back at it though, the whole family relationship with the older brother, the mother, the father and the sister as well as the interaction with their friends, were all delicate in their own way... The show illustrated how a comprehensive understanding of every one of the members in your family required a loving dedication to what being a family was all about!! The conception that things are suppose to be one way, and yet, they wound up being quite another, was a painstaking experience for the entire Arnold family!! This was an opportunity for adversity to manifest itself as some constructive element of household unification!! Perenially, this domestic fortitude was portrayed on \"The Wonder Years\" as an ideological staple!! Perhaps the most compelling aspect of \"The Wonder Years\" was that it pinpointed the formidable scenario of the true love clich\u00e9,(for families) and made it stick!! This was not a hokey case of true love conquering all, rather, an insight to how emotional support evoked an understanding of the bittersweet ordeals in any given domicile which are dealt with properly when everyone cares for one another!! \"The Wonder Years\" was a fabulous T.V. Show, and ,it came off as being emotionally nurturing and empathetic to the needs of the overly mortgaged YUPPIE, because, it was something for them to reminisce about!! This show was one of my favorite television shows ever!! I do not see it in syndication that much, too bad!! It must be the cable package I have, or my schedule, I would love to see reruns of \"The Wonder Years\" I think that that would be a lot of fun!!", "rating": 10, "helpful": "8 out of 9 found this helpful.", "date": "21 July 2007"}, {"title": " The perfect show", "content": "This is perhaps one of the best TV shows ever written.

The story is alleged to be largely true. It involves an unlikely trio who are bound together in an attempt to create a market-worthy personal computer. The year is 1983 and IBM rules the market.<br/><br/>First, there is Joe MacMillan (Lee Pace), a type A rainmaker from New York whose opinion of himself may only be eclipsed by his ability to sell anything to anybody. He lands a job at Cardiff Electric in Texas and promises to overhaul their sales figures. But does he have deeper, perhaps darker, plans?<br/><br/>Joe aligns himself with one of Cardiff's corporate drones, Gordon Clark (Scoot McNairy), an apathetic near-alcoholic who would seem to have nothing to offer. But Joe sees something in Gordon and challenges him to think beyond the meager circumstances of his conformist life. It's a dangerous gambit for Gordon, whose wife wants nothing more than conformity and reliability.<br/><br/>Joe also crosses paths with a young woman named Cameron Howe (Mackenzie Davis), a self-sufficient young woman who lives outside society's rules, though not very profitably. Though she is extremely experienced at working with computers and code, she spends her time playing video games in an arcade and scoffing at conformity and the rules of society. Physically, she reminds me of Mary Stuart Masterson in \"Some Kind of Wonderful\". <br/><br/>Each of the three may possess a particular kind of genius. Or they may just be destined losers; it is difficult to tell.<br/><br/>Joe's plan involves reverse engineering an IBM PC and then--well, it is difficult to tell just where his plan may lead them, but it will undoubtedly be a risky enterprise. Can he be the glue that holds this volatile team together? After watching the pilot for \"Halt and Catch Fire\", I am willing to watch and find out. It's a compelling premise and the actors are very watchable.<br/><br/>After you fire a shot across the bow of IBM, how do you keep them from raiding your enterprise?<br/><br/>Update: Now that I have watched a few episodes, I am happy to report that each of the various primary actors are being fleshed out and they have their own story lines and characteristics.

In \"Jesse\", the relationship between the nanny and the charges is the starting point for the funny situations, because the nanny can be a little wacky but preserves intelligence enough to display.

It was the kind of show that even in its last days still wanted its fans begging for more. And we may yet get more, who knows.<br/><br/>Two characters remained through the show's run and anchored it until it's conclusion. Dennis Franz as Detective Andy Sipowicz, a very flawed individual, an alcoholic bigot, but the best detective around. And Gordon Clapp as Detective Greg Medavoy, a decent man with a lot of issues of confidence. The rest of the cast came and went through the 15th precinct of Manhattan just like life itself.<br/><br/>Sipowicz took over the show after the departure of his first partner David Caruso. He was predicted to be a breakout star and he sought to take advantage of his new found fame with a major movie career. A lot of folks wondered if NYPD Blue would survive at that point. Sipowicz was supposed to be a supporting character with the problems just mentioned, Archie Bunker with a badge. But he went in Alcoholics Anonymous and preached its virtues as did Daniel J. Travanti from Hill Street Blues. And over a dozen years, Sipowicz grew in strength and character. <br/><br/>Dennis Franz had three succeeding partners all who had a different character and background. Jimmy Smits, Rick Schroeder, and Mark-Paul Gosselaar were all very good and very different. In the case of Gosselaar he was finally able to shake the casting specter of Zack Morris from Saved By The Bell.<br/><br/>The women detectives all had an individuality about them as well. Probably Kim Delaney as the alcoholic Diane Russell was the best. She was counseled by Andy Sipowicz and brought into AA, but she also wound up marrying Jimmy Smits's character Bobby DeSimone and bravely carrying on after his demise. Sipowicz married ADA Sylvia Costas played by Sharon Lawrence and after she was killed in an unforgettable court house shooting episode. Andy later married again to young detective Charlotte Ross and found again some domestic happiness.<br/><br/>In fact it was getting to be a running joke towards the end that it was as fatal to be around Dennis Franz as it was to be involved with a Cartright from Bonanza. Partners Jimmy Smits and Rick Schroeder died, wife Sylvia Lawrence died, and his son from an even earlier marriage was killed all during the run of the show. But Sipowicz dealt with it all.<br/><br/>The detective squad of the 15th precinct had four heads, James McDaniel, Esai Morales, John O'Donahue, and Graham Currie. One of them actually was a cop, John O'Donahue. He played this mediocre time server Eddie Gibson who was an absolute doofus and originally was a detective on the graveyard shift. When he took the sergeant's test, passed it and wound up succeeding Morales the whole squad was ready to flip. But Gibson wasn't totally stupid, he knew these people and he basically let them have their head.<br/><br/>James McDaniel had a wonderful character in Arthur Fancy and he had all the problems and frustrations of being a black man who rises in the NYPD. I remember once in an episode he was asked why he didn't get rid of a bigot like Sipowicz. To which he replied if I got rid of him it isn't like I'm going to get as his replacement some candidate for the brotherhood award. Probably I'll get another white cop with the same attitudes, but who isn't half as good on the job.<br/><br/>We got to know all these people and what baggage they might have brought to each case they were assigned to. Probably NYPD Blue could have kept going, but Steven Bochco decided to end it while still on high. And he did in fact give it an ending of sorts unlike Hill Street Blues. It was an ironic ending in fact for Sipowicz. But you'll have to see the final episode in fact you'll have to see the entire series which you can catch on cable television to appreciate why.<br/><br/>But the elements are there for a TV movie or six.

Anywhere, here are my thoughts, just randomly said:<br/><br/>David Caruso may have gotten top billing as the star of the show but Dennis Franz is the actor who dominates when on screen. He is the most dramatic figure in this crime series that features character studies, almost to the point of being soap opera-like. In fact, all the love-lives of the main characters are explored, especially as the episodes developed that first season.<br/><br/>In the beginning, some sex scenes were used to grab viewers. This was new to TV then. All the characters in the show may not have been likable but they were all interesting. To me, the most likable was Nicholas Turturro's \"Martinez.\" <br/><br/>The cops - men and women - all talked tough and the show's writers liked to insert words like \"a-hole\" and \"prick\" because, I suspect, they could get away with using them. This was TV's first drama to use words like that and have the open sexuality that was shown here. We saw side shots of breasts and Caruso's butt, etc. Speaking of Caruso, he left after this first season and that really annoyed a lot of the viewers, I am told. After an unsuccessful movie career, he landed back on his feet in TV with the very successful CSI: Miami show. Franz, meanwhile, stuck it out for the long NYPD run.<br/><br/>I found the first season interesting but too much soap opera and not enough straight crime story didn't encourage me to buy any further season DVD sets.", "rating": 6, "helpful": "23 out of 52 found this helpful.", "date": "7 November 2006"}, {"title": " Excellent acting, writing and characterizations!", "content": "I have read the comments listed and I want to add my reflection on the entire show and the number of years on the air.

The first season was outstanding as it brought a level of reality never seen on TV.<br/><br/>Early in the second season, David Caruso had a contract dispute and left the show. The show would never be the same. Jimmy Smits came in and, though he was pretty good, was no David Caruso. The show leveled out in terms of pushing the boundaries and became a little stale. Then they killed off Jimmy Smits and brought in Rick(y) Schroeder. This is when the show hit the wall and went straight downhill.

No real Agatha Christie who-dunit plots here, cases are solved almost on a domino effect: man has been shot in bed with his mistress, wife did it. Gang member is shot in a drive by, some snitch is going to give in a vital information, etc. Interrogation scenes are on a much higher level, although more or less following the same pattern, but they feel very realistic. But what makes this show great is personal struggles, loves, loses, ups and downs, going on all the time, egsisting in the parallel with everyday cop work. Stronghold of the show during last ten years has been Andy Sipowicz, aging detective masterfully played by Dennis Franz (who won 4 Emmys, Golden Globe and 2 SAG's for role in this series). His character went throu a lot during the shows run - most gripping plots included him making peace with estranged son, only to see him shot during a robbery, and constant fight with his bigotry and hate towards colored people (must see Backboard Jungle episode from season 3, arguably the finest hour of television I EVER saw). Later on it seemed he finally found his peace with his second wife Sylvia and newborn son Theo when boom: his best friend Simone dies from heart infection and Sylvia is shot. From that moment this gripping show became a soap-opera about Andy being single dad, about Theo getting sick, about attempt to reconcille with his first wife and than, they matched him romantically with a young beutiful blonde detective: YUCK!

Ten years later, the first season still stands above and beyond anything since. While Dennis Franz became the center of NYPD Blue, and has done an incredible job, it was David Caruso who stole the show in Season 1. The brilliant breakout performance he gave was both a blessing and a curse for the show (and for his career) as he was gone in a contract dispute four episodes into Season 2. But for anyone who watches reruns of Season 1 on TNT or watches Season 1 on DVD, you are in for a real treat. The character development was extremely well-done, the writing top-notch and the storylines spread out over the entire season, not just tightly wrapped up in 60 minutes. Caruso, unfortunately, became the butt of many jokes after his career all but disappeared after he left this show. However, he has since rebounded nicely with CSI: Miami. It's too bad he didn't last on NYPD Blue because his character was the perfect partner for Franz' Sipowicz. Since he wasn't killed off, I continue to hold out hope that he'll make a cameo appearance again before NYPD Blue ends its run next spring. The other partners that came later couldn't compare. Especially Smits (Zzzzzzzzzzzzz). Season 1 features some great appearances by actors who were unknown at the time, such as Friends' David Schwimmer (4B), ER's Sherry Stringfield,  Judging Amy's Amy Brenneman, The West Wing's Bradley Whitford, Just Shoot Me's Wendie Malick, not to mention the introduction of \"Donna Abandando\" (played brilliantly by Gail O'Grady). God Bless her and all her NY Ranger memorabilia. Her storyline with Medavoy was the first (and last) good storyline Medavoy ever had. Abandando is still missed. Other great characters included \"James Sinclair\" (played by Daniel Benzali who went on to star in the wonderful first season of Murder One) and Luis Guzman as Martinez' \"Poppy\". Each episode was an event, along the lines of The Sopranos nowadays, not just another hour of a cop show. The show went downhill after Season 1, albeit slowly, with ridiculous storylines that included killing off pretty much everyone Sipowicz was close too. Franz continued to shine--and still does. He is the sole reason this show has lasted as long as it has. There was a brief spark again when Rick Schroeder was on the show. Other than that, nothing has touched Season 1. As much as it was Caruso's Detective John Kelly that catapulted the show to its success in the first season, the best episode is the season finale and the perfomance of Dennis Franz when encountering Steve White on an old kidnapping case (the Bucci case). The name of the episode is \"Rockin' Robin\". Look for Franz' facial expressions when questioning White in the trailer about the kidnapping. His finest--and I mean FINEST--hour.

To see top-notch production values, an absorbing story-line and great acting, 'The Missing' is essentially a must watch.<br/><br/>Seven eighths of 'The Missing' is simply phenomenal, with the only fault being that it was difficult to find anything to fault it. 'The Missing' does stumble in the last episode somewhat, which is a shame. The production values, music, script and acting are without complaint, but the episode does drag a bit and does get bogged down by being overstuffed and occasionally over-complicated, also with an ending too ambiguous and abrupt. Maybe it does leave room for a series 2, but considering how the rest of the series unfolded and was told one can't help feeling that a possible second series would focus on a different story.<br/><br/>Production values here are simply exquisite. There is such a brooding moodiness and at the same time a gleaming beauty to how everything is shot, and the dark mood seen in the lighting and how the scenery is like a character of its own are furthermore striking. The music score is not overused or intrusive, yet with enough to make it atmospherically haunting and distinctively memorable. The script is intelligent and thought-provoking, with a lot of insight into sensitive adult issues explored with astute sensitivity and intelligence, with enough tightness to stop it from rambling.<br/><br/>Despite the last episode not being as great as the rest, the story is incredibly absorbing even as a slow-burner, and like with this year's 'One of Us' (not as good, but was also gripped on the whole), it does have to be commended for trying to be different from other mystery dramas, focusing enough on the mystery but focusing also on the aftermath and repercussions for the families and also presenting a moral edge. There is a huge amount of atmosphere too, the production values help as well as the skillful direction, but it is high in tension and conflict with plenty of twists and turns that all feel relevant and stop the storytelling from dragging. Much of it is suspenseful and poignant, and everything makes logical sense.<br/><br/>Also loved what was done with the characters, so vividly drawn and presented as characters that are both vulnerable and deeply flawed, one gets to know them so well and really care about their main situation, as well as any other situation they face. The acting is of high quality all round, Frances O'Connor fares the weakest of the main characters but that doesn't mean in any way that she's bad, just that everybody else impressed even more. James Nesbitt's performance in 'The Missing' ranks among his best, while Ken Stott is chillingly loathsome and Titus De Voogdt is very believable as a sympathetic monster (this may sound oxymoronic, but definitely possible).<br/><br/>Outshining them all is the simply sublime performance of Tch\u00e9ky Karyo, a performance worthy of award recognition and manages to make what could easily have been a stereotype into one of the most complex and most fascinating characters of any show of this genre in recent years.<br/><br/>In conclusion, exceptional drama and would have been even better with a last episode that lived up to the rest. 9/10 Bethany Cox", "rating": 9, "helpful": "36 out of 43 found this helpful.", "date": "26 September 2016"}, {"title": " Enjoyed both seasons immensely", "content": "While sick I had time to binge both seasons, which is the best way to address episodic cliff-hangers.

It would be different if they're speaking a made up language, so no one understood it, but people who speak French or other languages spoken in the show will understand it, so that rules out the mystery aspect of it.

Madeleine has still not been found, even after an extensive police search; but hitherto the search has led to speculation about the role of Madeleine\"s parents in the affair, and whether or not they were involved in abducting her.<br/><br/>In Harry and Jack Williams' drama, set in France in 2006 and 2014, Tony and Emily Hughes (James Nesbitt, Frances O\"Connor) are on holiday when their five-year-old son Oliver (Oliver Hunt) is mysteriously abducted on the night of the World Cup Final in 2006 between France and Brazil. No one appears to know where he is; and the incident goes cold until 2014, when Tony discovers new evidence in a Facebook photograph as to where Oliver might be. He enlists the help of retired detective Julien Baptiste (Tch\u00e9ky Karyo), and embarks on a quest that is mostly frustrating, but sometimes enlightening.<br/><br/>Tom Shankland's production vividly communicates the experience of trying to deal with institutions such as the police and/or the justice system in a foreign country; in Tony's eyes at least, they seem inefficient and dedicated to obstructing rather than facilitating the task of finding Oliver. On the other hand, there are equally corrupt forces at work among the British community, most notably centering round the mysterious philanthropist Ian Garrett (Ken Stott). What seems like a routine disappearance of an infant turns into something much more sinister.<br/><br/>Filmed mostly in Belgium, the production makes great play of the contrast between the chocolate-box settings of the village (where Oliver disappears) and the nefarious goings-on taking place inside the buildings. The atmosphere is well summed up through an astute of symbols - a fly crawling up a net curtain suggesting corruption, a hand-held camera behind Emily's head indicating uncertainty.<br/><br/>Nesbitt offers a convincing portrayal of an outwardly ordinary British citizen with a questionable past, that leads the Inspector to suspect that Tony might not quite be the whiter-than-white victim he pretends to be. <br/><br/>The production unfolds slowly, with considerable emphasis placed on atmospherics, but each episode ends on a convincing cliff-hanger encouraging viewers to watch even more.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "36 out of 48 found this helpful.", "date": "22 November 2014"}, {"title": " British drama at it's very best", "content": "People go on about US drama but whilst some is very good some is utter dross.<br/><br/>That is how TV is you will never be satisfied with it all but as I type this the UK is waiting to see what happened to Alice (this is no spoiler) and the nation wants to know.<br/><br/>That is not only top drama but drama which will last the years.<br/><br/>In both series 1 &amp; 2 the story stands alone and all the actors are on opt form but it is Julien Baptiste that becomes the moral and physical centre of the story.

Then, imagine never waking up from it", "content": "I'm not a fan of dramatic family stories, whether or not based on true events, and definitely not when they are stretched to a long- running mini-series instead of a normal-length film feature. But when my wife said that she really wanted to follow this series when it aired on television, I didn't object at all and this initially because of (a) the involvement of some of the names in cast and crew and (b) because apparently the vast majority of the series \u2013 even though set in France \u2013 was filmed and produced in my native country Belgium. \"The Missing\" is directed by the Brit Tom Shankland, who made a couple of intriguing and semi-successful horror flicks (\"The Children\", \"W Delta Z\"), and stars a number of talented actors and actresses, like Tch\u00e9ky Karyo (\"Bad Boys\") and Jason Flemyng (\"Snatch.\"). It rarely ever happens that such an interesting bunch lands in Belgium, and it's even rarer that local TV-actors from this country (like Titus De Voogdt or Hilde Heijnen) receive the opportunity to co-star in such a prestigious and international production. The fantastic Belgian band Amatorski even had the chance to deliver the fantastic title song that'll remain stuck in your head and heart after each and every single episode (oh my love, I pray each day that you come home and be okay\u0085) <br/><br/>So, I started watching for the cast &amp; crew and the Belgian filming locations, but it didn't even took half an episode before I got completely absorbed by the identifiable and heart-wrenching story. In the summer of 2006, during the World Cup Football, The Hughes family (Tony and Emily and their 5-year-old son Oliver) are on their way to a vacation in the South of France when their car breaks down in the Northern part of the country. Since it'll take a few days to fix the engine, they book a room in a cheap little hotel in a sleepy little village. Father and son go swimming in the evening, but when Tony tries to order drinks at the crowded cafeteria bar, Oliver lets go of his hand. Only seconds later, it seems as if the little boy has vanished off the face of the planet. The authorities immediately take the case seriously and abduction seems the most logical scenario. The French super-inspector Julien Baptiste is in charge of the investigation, along with his British colleague Mark Walsh, and the case promptly gets international media attention. Experts in the field of children disappearances claim that the first month is crucial to find the missing child; otherwise the case is likely never to get solved. And yet, the series isn't mainly set in 2006 but in 2013. Seven years after that dreadful summer, Oliver \u2013 or Olly \u2013 is still missing and Tony Hughes never gave up his obsessive private investigation. In 2013, Tony claims to have found new and breakthrough evidence when he stumbles upon a photograph of a random tourist kid wearing the personalized scarf that Oliver was wearing on the day of his disappearance. After quite a bit of political and administrative interference, the case is re-opened and more suspicious details surrounding Oliver's disappearance are brought to the surface, although very slowly and often with severe difficulties. Many things have changed between the summer of 2006 and the new 2013 investigation, but they are all gradually clarified during flashbacks back and forth in time. Tony and Emily are separated and she's about to get re-married to inspector Walsh, Julien Baptiste comes out of retirement and suffers from a permanent leg injury, a French policeman is serving a sentence in jail, a seemingly gentle British businessman that offered financial support went missing as well and old witnesses are finally willing to collaborate in exchange for a compensation. <br/><br/>When you are a parent yourself \u2013 like I am \u2013 it's extremely difficult to watch realistic and emotionally agonizing TV-series like \"The Missing\", especially because you know that at some point the script will have to tackle taboo subjects like pedophilia and child murderers (at least if the series is courageous enough). I have a five-year- old son myself and I can assure you that my wife and I often saw our worst parental nightmares come to life because in our minds we replaced the image of Oliver Hughes with that of our own son. It is assumed that \"The Missing\" is loosely inspired by the case of Madeleine McCann. There are indeed a lot of similarities between this fictional tale and the real-life McCann case, like the circumstances of the disappearances, the painful accusation (one of) the parents, wealthy financial sponsors and the many dead-end investigation theories. Based on what I've seen in \"The Missing\", I can only express my deepest respect and sympathies for the McCann family as well as for any other parent who ever had to struggle through this nightmarish ordeal. With regards to the pedophilia aspects, I must say the screenplay handles this matter professionally, with different profiles of culprits. The facts in the case of Oliver Hughes are often extremely complex, far-fetched and hard to believe, but everything somehow gets properly explained in the end\u0085 except for one thing. Director Tom Shankland and his entire cast &amp; crew manage to maintain a very high tension level throughout eight episodes of nearly a full hour running time, and each and every single episode ends with a downright astounding cliffhanger that makes you hold your breath until the next one. One last comment about the ending, though. There are a lot of people (on internet forums, for example) complaining about the ending and the lack of closure. Well, guess what, a lot of people \u2013 like the protagonists in \"The Missing\" \u2013 go through dramatic and life- altering ordeals and never get any closure, neither.

Some reviewers have suggested the pacing to be slow, but having watched the first 4 episodes now the pacing for me is well timed, we get some background information, we think we are getting a handle on some of the facts surrounding the case then as the tension builds we are knocked back from the edge of our seats with one swift body blow and our perceptions immediately change.

Deserved WAY more than 124 eps/6 seasons...", "content": "*LONG REVIEW*<br/><br/>I started season 1 this past June, and I'll be honest.. the whole political thing with Teddy, Tandy, and Lamar kind of turned me off a bit because politics is not my thing, and to me that was just wasted screen time on boring characters. I watched season 1 pretty slowly, averaging around 1 episode a day and never expecting to become really engaged in the show. But once I got to the finale with Rayna's revelation to Deacon about being Maddie's father and his relapse/the car accident, my interest skyrocketed! I then blew threw the remaining 5 seasons and finished it last night.<br/><br/>I'm kind of shocked that such a small number of people in the world have rated and reviewed the show on here, and I can't understand how it only has a 7.7/10. It is definitely underrated and seems to be pretty unknown, which is such a shame! I think that many people might have passed on watching it when they read the plot and found out it's about country music. If only they decided to give it a chance, they would find out how amazing it is...<br/><br/>Nashville is a show that contains the perfect combination of music, artistry, heart, emotion, drama, and even humour. Ironicially, being someone who was never a fan of country music, I was shocked to hear so many songs that I instantly loved. The soundtrack is overflowing with beautiful lyrics and melodies that totally hit my heart. The songs are so powerful and exist as their own characters in the show. It's beautiful because it makes you realize just how much music can connect and unite us all. I've definitely become a die hard fan of Nashville's music, and I know that I won't ever judge the genre of country music again.<br/><br/>Here are some of my thoughts on things I loved and things I wasn't a fan of. Although I have some criticisms, they aren't big enough to me to rate it below the 10 I gave it.<br/><br/>QUEEN OF COUNTRY: One thing I had trouble buying was Rayna as the \"Queen of Country\", solely in terms of the vocal aspect. In my opinion, all of the female singers on the show had noticeably better voices than Connie's. Her voice was very sweet sounding and clear, but it lacked the sheer power and range that the others had. Lennon &amp; Maisy (Maddie &amp; Daphne) were especially so darn impressive for their young ages! So giving Rayna that title was a big statement and I don't think her voice was able to live up to it.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS I DISLIKED: I found each of these characters annoying for specific reasons and just wished they would disappear. Most of them did, but it didn't happen soon enough: Teddy, Tandy, Lamar, Luke Wheeler, Jeff Fordham, Layla Grant, Charlie Wentworth, Beverly, Vita, Cash, Frankie, Markus Keen, Autumn Chase, Damien, Brad Maitland, Alannah's purple hair.<br/><br/>I was obsessed with Scarlett &amp; Gunnar as a singing duo because their voices were pure magic together, but it became extremely exhausting to watch their on and off relationship. They were always so stagnant as a couple and didn't really ever grow together. It was quite sad to watch. They were no Deacon &amp; Rayna, that's for sure.<br/><br/>Juliette also became exhausting to watch. She always seemed to take a couple steps forward and way too many back. Watching her was like being on a rollercoaster that you're just so over and want to end. Although, I did find her postpartum depression storyline extremely powerful, as well as her decision to leave the music industry.<br/><br/>CHARACTER DEATHS: I love the fact that there were so many realistic storylines on the show, but I do think there were a bit too many deaths that occurred. I can't imagine that many people in my family and social circle dying in a span of only 6 years. I think a few of those characters should've been written out of the show in ways other than death.<br/><br/>RAYNA'S DEATH: I almost can't wrap my head around Deacon &amp; Rayna being ripped apart from each other so soon after finally being together and getting married. It feels too heavy to even think about. And that flashback scene to their wedding night in the series finale..... that was the most bittersweet moment of both joy and heartache for me, especially when Rayna said \"sometimes once in your life somebody gets into your bloodstream\". It reminded me of exactly why they were soulmates! Ugh.. As heartbreaking and gut-wrenching as Rayna's death was (I ugly cried uncontrollably and still do every time I rewatch it), I felt like it weirdly worked for the show because of Connie's decision to leave, and death being pretty much the only way to justify writing Rayna out of the script. I think that the writers did such a great job with the second half of season 5 and season 6, and they reinforce why Nashville has become my favourite show. I find those seasons to be very powerful and I enjoy them just as much as when Rayna was there. To me, the show elevated to this entirely new level of raw, real, and emotional after her death. The songs, scenes, and family relationships felt so special, as if they were all honouring her memory. Although Rayna's death killed the beautiful Deacon/Rayna relationship, I do love that it was able to shine a huge spotlight on Deacon, as it forced him to really step up as a father to Maddie &amp; Daphne. We got to see what he was truly capable of on his own as a standalone character and not just as Rayna's \"side man\" anymore. Which leads me into my next point...<br/><br/>MY FAVES: Deacon, Maddie, and Daphne are my favourite characters. I loved watching their individual growth throughout the 6 seasons (let's forget Maddie being horrible during the emancipation), but I equally loved watching all of their scenes with each other, whether it was Maddie &amp; Daphne as sisters, Deacon &amp; Daphne as stepfather and stepdaughter, or my favourite one of all... Deacon &amp; Maddie as the father and daughter trying to navigate newfound paternity. All of those relationships felt so authentic &amp; true to life.<br/><br/>I loved the journey that the writers took us on with establishing the Deacon &amp; Maddie relationship. It started out slow and simple, being mostly based around music, but it eventually grew more and more into something really beautiful between them. It became such a real and relatable father/daughter relationship. Even when they argued or disagreed at times, it spoke volumes about the depth of their relationship and how invested they had become in each other. And once Rayna was gone, that relationship was able to flourish fully and it became a major fixture of the show. With how deep their relationship became, you would think Deacon had been raising Maddie right from the day she was born. I got so wrapped up in everything that sometimes I even forgot that he only got involved when she was 14. To me, that really shows what good writing and good acting can do.<br/><br/>It was also so endearing how Deacon considered Daphne his own and how close they got, and that she even got comfortable enough to call him dad. He was such a present and supportive father to her, especially in season 6, and I just adored their scenes together. He treated Maddie &amp; Daphne as if they were both his biological daughters, and I'll be honest... Teddy became such a distant memory to me, which is fine because I never liked him. I'm so glad he got pushed out of the family situation. He just didn't belong there at all.<br/><br/>After Rayna's death, the girls put Deacon through the ringer at times, but his dedication and love for them, and needing to fulfill his promise to Rayna, pulled them all through it. Those strong relationships were exactly what the show needed during that transitional period. He truly became the heart of the show at that point and held it all together, in my opinion. He was basically Superdad, and deserved every second he got to be their parent.<br/><br/>I can't forget to mention how much I love the endearing Deacon/Scarlett relationship. Their scenes as uncle and niece always made me laugh and smile, and basically just warmed my heart. I loved how they would constantly challenge each other and just wing it when they traded off advice.<br/><br/>JESSIE: Being a die hard fan of Deacon &amp; Rayna, I surprisingly loved Jessie and ADORED her and Deacon together! If he couldn't have Rayna, then I honestly believe she was the next best option for him. She was so cute, sweet, sensitive, and compassionate, and brought a calming &amp; healing energy into Deacon's life. Not to mention, they had amazing chemistry! The series finale left it a bit open-ended for his love life - we saw a potential spark with Ilse.. but in my mind, Deacon &amp; Jessie eventually found their way back to each other.<br/><br/>THE MUSIC: There were so many amazing musical scenes in the entire series, but my absolute favourite is Deacon giving that outstanding Opry performance of Good Rain or Jesus in 5x21! It was so touching how he was able to come out from under Rayna's musical shadow and have the glory of his own shining moment, but using his performance as a way to honour her at the same time. That was such a powerful scene because it epitomized exactly how music can heal people.<br/><br/>CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: I probably seem biased here, but the best character development of the series was Deacon, hands down! He was always a sweet guy, but he was also hot-headed and struggled a lot with his alcoholism. But once he became Maddie &amp; Daphne's guardian, he instantly transformed into this rock solid fatherly force of nature. And the fact that he grieved Rayna's death in a healthy way and beat his demons by never going back to drinking, and he chose to forgive his own dad for the past, makes him the strongest/most inspirational character on the show to me. For 6 seasons Chip Esten played every facet of who Deacon was flawlessly, and with undeniable skill and charm. He had so much emotion pouring out of his eyes at all times that he could somehow tell a story without even speaking.

It's fluid, it's clean and it has a comic book feel to it that gives a nice nod to Carl Barks and his original creation. Also, I like that Huey, Dewey and Louie are given actual individual personalities. In the original, they were pretty much interchangeable. This one, each has a unique appearance and demeanor. Webby is also much better in this one. The writing is strong. A great mix of humor, adventure and character development. Having Donald Duck as a main character is great and adds new dimensions to the show. The only thing early on that really bugged me was the new voice of Scrooge. I know that Alan Young has passed away, but it's going to take some time to get used to this new voice. In defense, I do like the characterization of Scrooge, so once I get used to the voice, it shouldn't be bad either. The other voice actors are great.

And when people get burned out, they begin to dissect, dismiss and demean those rare but invaluable examples of reboots done right, just out of a misplaced sense of moral superiority. Case in point- 2017's \"DuckTales\", a retelling of the classic cartoon series that started thirty years back in 1987. Having grown up alongside the original series, I get it. Our nostalgia is a beloved part of our lives, and nothing could ever possibly measure up to sky-high expectations... Especially not in this case... right? ...right?<br/><br/>Well, I'm here to tell you. In every single imaginable way, Disney has pulled it off, with a loving and clever reboot that captures the essence and magic of that original run, while making necessary and valid updates when needed. \"DuckTales\" is an absolute joy, boasting strong and stylish animation, a wonderful voice-over cast that nails the tone, and some extremely clever writing that took me by a surprise more than once, even as a man quickly approaching his 30's. And it's frankly shocking seeing the plethora of highly critical reviews here... and even moreso shocking to see many of the reviews containing blatant and overblown exaggerations of minor issues or even outright lies about the content of the series, just so they can smugly slap it with an unfair one or two outta ten score and bemoan how their childhood has been \"ruined.\"<br/><br/>Just take it from this fan... go in with an open mind, and you'll be thoroughly charmed and thrilled with the results!<br/><br/>Grouchy trillionaire Scrooge McDuck (voice of David Tennant) is surprised when his estranged relative Donald (Tony Anselmo) drops off the triplets Huey, Dewey, and Louie (Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz, Bobby Moynihan) one day, demanding he watch over them while he leaves to be interviewed for a new job. While Scrooge initially ignores the boys, a series of strange events brings them together as he re-discovers his old sense of adventure and excitement. And so, they team up, along with pilot Launchpad (Beck Bennett) and the headstrong Webby (Kate Micucci), and embark on a series of strange and peculiar new adventures in search of fame and treasure. Along they way, they fight fearsome creatures, encounter old enemies and begin a search for the elusive Della... the long-lost mother of Huey, Dewey and Louise.<br/><br/>To start with one of the more publicized aspects of the series, I absolutely love the entire cast. Obviously Tony Anselmo is a complete joy as Donald... after all, he's been voicing the character for over thirty years now, including in the original run of the series. Pudi, Schwartz and Moynihan are all excellent as the lead trio, and though they might not sound as childlike, all nail the characters quite well and have that delightful, young sense of glee to their performances- you can tell all three are trying their hardest, and are infectiously engaging. I also really adore Miccuci, and I very much appreciate how Webby has been updated to be a more proactive and academically intelligent character. But the revelation here is David Tennant as Scrooge McDuck. He knocks it out of the park. Absolutely perfect turn as the beloved character.<br/><br/>The animation style has been a source of much love and much controversy, but I really dig it. It's stylized to be a bit more stark, contrasted and simplistic... almost like an animated comic book, which is appropriate as comics were the inspiration for the '87 series. Yes, there is a degree of stylistic whiplash going from the old to the new, but stick with it. It grows on you quickly, and it serves the material very well. And the writing is fantastic. It has the same tonality as the original, but brings it a bit more up to speed for modern times. Though don't worry. It's not bogged down by needless references or contrived self-aware meta-humor. It's very much just geared towards things children in this day and age will understand. There's a bit more gadgetry at play, passing nods to modern popular culture, a few jokes about current trends and that sort-of thing. But its never to the detriment of the series, and it's always in the service of the story or world-building.<br/><br/>Over the past few days, I've watched the first six episodes, and I have to say... I'll probably keep watching. I adored the original run of the series growing up and was constantly viewing reruns and video-taped episodes on a daily basis. And now, a beloved part of my childhood has returned, as good as it ever was. Though there will sadly always be doubters and those who can't let go of the past and embrace the future, I would highly recommend the new \"DuckTales\" to open-minded fans old and new alike! It really is as good as the original in every single way. And it easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10 from me!

I however strongly disagree. The reboot is very faithful to the original, without repeating the exact same formula as the original had. All of the characters, including the triplets and Webby, now have their own personality.<br/><br/>Webby is no longer the stereotypical \"girly\" fourth triplet. She's spontaneous, creative and a quick thinker as well as a quick talker (even more so in stressful situations).<br/><br/>Huey seems to be the only one who's still in the Junior Woodchucks. He's the oldest, more organized triplet. He's not as spontaneous as his siblings are. But make no mistake: he's still mischievous. He seems to be cool with getting dragged into dangerous situations together with his two younger brothers, never showing any signs of being really scared. He's level headed. But can get overly excited about small things such as activities on field trips.<br/><br/>Dewey is the middle child. He's extremely spontaneous even more so than Webby and his two brothers. He's not afraid of putting his own life in danger. He seems to enjoy taking risks that put him in deadly situations.<br/><br/>Louie is the youngest triplet. He's by far the most laid back triplet. He likes to slack off. A lot. He is, however, ready to act whenever the need arises. He has talked to Webby more his brothers thus far. <br/><br/>Scrooge McDuck is believed to be the uncle of Donald Duck but the triplets have always called him uncle Scrooge. He's the richest duck in the world. He has a bit of an Indiana Jones vibe about him. He is famous in the world as an adventurer and loves to get himself into trouble (unlike the Scrooge in the old series). Despite his old age he's surprisingly agile and can take quite the beating and still fight back without any problem.<br/><br/>Donald Duck is the Uncle and the caretaker of the triplets. Unlike the original show, Donald will have an important role in the reboot. He was Scrooge's sidekick once but they parted ways after an incident of some kind.<br/><br/>I like the new voice actors surprisingly much.

I won't lie; I was very skeptical that Disney would live up to the original Ducktales cartoons and the Barks/Rosa classic comics.<br/><br/>Before I continue, I have to say that the series bears very little resemblance to the Barksian universe on which both shows are based, so don't expect an adaptation of 'Tralla La' or 'The Mines of King Solomon' here.<br/><br/>The show's main strength over its' 80's predecessor lies in its' character development. Huey, Dewey and Louie are now three completely different personalities that complement one another. Huey is mature and reserved, Dewey (the focus of the show) is the most daring and reckless, and Louie is lazy and self-serving. More importantly, the two female protagonists of the original (Bentina Beakley and her granddaughter Webbigail Vanderquack) are far more interesting than their 80's versions. Webby is smart and resourceful, and Mrs Beakley has a very interesting back story. I love this series' inclusion of Donald Duck, unlike the original which kicked him out of the show in the first few minutes. The character that (lovably) remains the same as in the original is Launchpad, and his clumsy charm never fails.<br/><br/>I have seen only the first season thus far; the season did have an interesting story arc which concluded in an amazing season finale.

There's very little in ways of morals which the original show contained, so I'd call the storytelling irresponsible (as it's just face-value drivel) and generic at best.<br/><br/>All that said, OK, I wasn't expecting a continuation of the original show. I realize we live in modern times when people no longer tell stories that have a sense of adventure and traditional storytelling because everything must make something modern and completely irrelevant to the material a butt of jokes, most recently mocking Mark Zuckerberg in a very mean-spirited way (not a huge fan of Mark either but c'mon...).<br/><br/>The character design isn't horrible, I like what they've done with some of the characters- Webby is an oddball but a pretty convincing female and Mrs Beakley is some sort of secret-agent-like character. I guess I appreciate the appearance of terra-firmians, which was one of my less favorite of the classic episodes. I have no idea why they made Gyro Gearloose completely full of himself. The smartest, most talented people I know are not only humble, but self deprecating, just like the original Gyro. Huey, Dewey and Louie now have...well, not exactly distinguishable personalities, except they're all jerks surrounded by actually sort-of interesting disposable side characters. Scrooge partners with Glumgold? Is nothing sacred?<br/><br/>When they released the initial art of the titular characters in a Jeep driving through a Serengeti, I didn't expect entire episodes dedicated to social networks. The art spoke the same language the original series did, so these past 8 episodes are an unwelcome surprise to say the least. My point is that with all the decisions they made to change everything from what it used to be to what they changed it to, the show does absolutely nothing to stand out among the rest of the same shows full of yelling and topical references, denoting that the writers actually don't have anything of value to say other than ventilating their opinions on various modern issues. It's actually quite boring. I don't know about you, but I watched Ducktales as a kid because it was nothing like my life. This Ducktales is like everything you see walking down a street or channel surfing. By comparison, ANY of the first two original Ducktales' season's (before it turned to mush) is a better choice to watch. Or better yet, read some Don Rosa or Carl Barks instead.<br/><br/>I'm quite convinced this show won't stand the test of time...who will want to watch this twenty years from now? I'm not sure I want to watch more than the 8 episodes, but I loved Ducktales, and at least SOME of the episodes aren't complete garbage and manage to present their voice in a new and surprising way, thus barely making it worth watching (while doing everything to betray the source material).<br/><br/>Bottom line is, if you throw away everything that made Ducktales what it was, what are you left with? Not Ducktales, that's what.", "rating": null, "helpful": "21 out of 46 found this helpful.", "date": "22 October 2017"}, {"title": " A horrid remake", "content": "I loved the duck comics, especial by Carl Barks and I adored the original Ducktales for their decent stories, magical music, good pacing and faithful characters (after episode 70 the quality started to decline). So let's talk about the reboot after I watched all the 1st season and 2x14 just to see if I still believe the same things.<br/><br/>The good things:\nDonald is here and they fixed his attrocious voice after 90 years, but only for 1 episode. Um, that's it. And it's cool that it's semi-serialized since there is a bigger mystery to solve in the overall arc.<br/><br/>The average things:\nThe music (the original had amazing music). The animation is okay. The fact that they have many character from the duck-lore is fine. Some stories are promising, like the mystery of the kid's mother and why Donald has a grudge with Scrooge.<br/><br/>The bad things:\n1) Poor storytelling.\nNo pacing, no emotion. You meet Scrooges parents but they are jerks. You learn about Scrooge's 1st dime but you don't feel anything about it, they simply show it without any gravity behind it. The mysteries I mentioned above they are treated similarly, like you are consuming fast food. The show tries to be funny at the expense of characters and good stories. And the artificial drama where someone has a secret and the others react dramatically to it, it's a cheap trope that needs to die. Also the 1st season ends as it starts, rebooting itself, rendering pointless all character development!<br/><br/>2) Poor characters.\nWebby is a ninja tomboy and Mrs. Beakley is a bodyguard now? This can actually be feminist propaganda, since Mrs. Beakley is the strongest character (she's trained in every martial art and action tactics and was a member of S.H.U.S.H. as Agent 22) and Webby is better than the boys in everything, yeah a Mary Sue. The boys are obnoxious as their traits are all negatives (Dewey is quick to throw himself into dangerous situations without thinking, just to prove himself. Huey is nerdy and superanalytical of everything. Louie is lazy and careless). Donald is a world famous explorer? In the comics he was always the underdog who struggled to get by! The moneybin is not on a hill but on an island? Duckworth is a ghost? Nothing makes sense anymore.<br/><br/>3) Poor art choices.\nThe art is very flat and boring. I get they go for stylized semi-raster comicbook look, but it looks cheap. The voice acting is bad, Webbys voice especially is very annoying. Also Launchpad McQuack, a useless and nonsensical character who is there only to crash Scrooge's helicopters on buildings, still exists.<br/><br/>That's the impression I was left with. So, watching episode 2x14, what do I think? Well after 8 minutes of Webby and her nonsense I quit watching the episode.

She's as adventurous as the triplets and a more \"take charge personality than her counterpart on the 1987 series. When you pause on Webby's \"big board\" searching for hidden references, you might also notice a doll impaled on her bedroom wall that looks like the old Webby character voiced by Russi Taylor, who also did the voices of all three boys back in the day.<br/><br/>Speaking of the original cast; Tony Anselmo reprises his role as Donald Duck for the show. I know the surviving voice actors from the original series had campaigned to do the voice work again, and with all of these hidden surprises, I'm hoping to hear their familiar voices in the future.<br/><br/>I do miss Alan Young. He was Scrooge McDuck to me. I love the addition of David Tennant (an actual Scotsman playing a Scottish Duck), but his voice-over will take some getting used to. It might be interesting to note that while David Tennant played the 10th Doctor on 'Doctor Who', Alan Young was also connecting to time travel in the 1960's classic 'The Time Machine'. Also (to put a smile on your face) while Alan Young was the star of the 1961-1966 series 'Mister Ed', David Tennant is incredibly allergic to horses.", "rating": null, "helpful": "17 out of 36 found this helpful.", "date": "20 August 2017"}, {"title": " An excellent reboot!", "content": "When I saw teaser images last year, I was honestly skeptical. I feared this new take on \"DuckTales\" was going to be like the modern \"Mickey Mouse\" cartoons -- crass, mean-spirited, hostile, frightening, and repulsive. Given Disney's cashing in on nostalgia, much like Cartoon Network (\"The Powerpuff Girls\" and \"Teen Titans\"), I feared for the worst. But then, a few months later, I heard a friend tell me about how good this reboot looked.<br/><br/>Then, just now, I watched the first two episodes of the new \"DuckTales\" on YouTube. And boy, was I blown away! What a vast improvement! Huey, Dewey, and Louie (Danny Pudi, Ben Schwartz and Bobby Moynihan, respectively) have their own personalities and identifiable traits besides being triplets. Webbigail (Kate Micucci) is no longer just a \"girly-girl\" but an adventurous tomboy who wants nothing more than to see the world with her own eyes.<br/><br/>As for adults like Mrs. Beakley (Toks Olagundoye), Launchpad (Beck Bennett), and Donald Duck (Tony Anselmo), their characters are carefully preserved and improved upon; especially Mrs. Beakley, who is more suitable as a bodyguard than as a housekeeper (though she certainly doesn't do a bad job at the latter, either). Flintheart Glomgold (Paul F. Tompkins) is a bit more odd-looking (mostly for his stoutness), but his wicked, greedy personality, too, is depicted accurately.<br/><br/>The character designs threw me off just a bit. In fact, I initially thought some of the designs looked more lifeless. But, after watching the first two episodes, it reminded me of my experience with \"The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.\" When Zelda and Nintendo fans saw teasers of that game, we all thought it was going to look stupid and childish. But, when we played the actual game, boy were we wrong! The cel-shaded effects were just what \"The Wind Waker\" needed to paint its colorful, life-filled atmosphere.<br/><br/>Same is the case here -- the character designs might seem alien at first, especially if you grew up with the original \"DuckTales.\" But, once you're used to them, you'll grow to like the characters, the excellent and imaginative imagery, and the intricate details used to create Francisco Agnones and Matt Youngberg's fantastic re-imagined world in Duckburg and beyond.<br/><br/>The writing is also quite good, and it's the kind that doesn't talk down to the target audience or teach kids that adults are idiots. One moment I liked is in which Scrooge McDuck (voiced by the current Doctor Who, David Tennant), after crossing a bridge with traps set off by Dewey, tells him that neither he nor his brothers know what they are doing and that their smart-alec behavior has only put them in danger, not to mention respect their elders. The nephews don't seem very respectful, but hey. It's the debut episode and they never met Scrooge McDuck before.<br/><br/>Because of my lack of faith in modern television, I never got the chance to watch \"Wonder over Yonder,\" \"Gravity Falls,\" \"The Legend of Korra,\" \"Steven Universe,\" the final season of \"Samurai Jack,\" or \"Star vs.\" Nowadays, I pretty much watch what's on Netflix or YouTube, more than anything else. But, after watching this new take on \"DuckTales,\" I feel more regret than before.<br/><br/>With all that said, I have this to say to the staff at Disney Television Animation: you have everything to be proud of, and as long as you keep up what you've done to make the debut episodes of \"DuckTales,\" you're actually making something that is not a cash-in on nostalgia.

In my opinion every character is likable in their own way, whether they're interesting or just plain funny, and I like the idea of combining an overarching plot with mini stories for each episode. I like the concept of a character (the mother) not only being missing, but seemingly being erased from existence, with any trace of her hidden away and never spoken of. I also think Lena is a pretty interesting character, with that mysterious shadow creature that she seems reluctantly loyal to.

I feel like the characters have more to them. The triplets aren't just - well - triplets. They each have their own personalities, which really makes it feel more real. Webby is no longer the token girl. She's creative, strong, smart, tough and overall awesome. Don't even get me started on Scrooge McDuck and Donald. They clearly have some history, as do a lot of the characters.<br/><br/>There are ACTUAL mysteries that just makes you hooked. Where is Donald's sister? What happaned to her? What's up with Lena and Magica de Spell? There are actual questions and mysteries that makes you want to keep up. Not to mention more focus on the adventures. In the original show they went on adventures too, sure, but it never had any heavy focus. This time around Scrooge McDuck is a legend. It's what makes the show so great.<br/><br/>Not to mention a recent episode with Goldie. The dynamic between Goldie and Scrooge is just wonderful. Earlier she's shown as an elderly woman who loves gold and riches. That's it. Now, she's an adventurer like Scrooge. They have a thing going but at the same time they're rivals. <br/><br/>The story goes much deeper and I feel like the characters are more three-dimensional characters.

The triplets have their own personalities and there's a whole mystery to be solved with their mothers.<br/><br/>The show takes everything you love about the original and makes it even better.

About the only thing that is not explained well, that adds to the humor of many episodes, is the importance of the \"first pick\" when you create your team for the first time. Think of it like when you were in high school, and people were picking a team for basketball. If only one kid was 7' tall in senior high, obviously everyone wanted him first on their team.<br/><br/>It reminds me of an adult version of The Guild\ufeff. When I say adult, there is a lot of drug and sex reference. When I say drug, when they hit the bong they actually hit the bong, and either real fake pot smoke or CGI smoke is seen, unlike some shows that only imply it. Also, you will see, at the least, the ass of a few guys as well as a girl. There are even a few \"watching porn\" scenes where I can't help but wonder how this show made it to extended cable and not HBO/Max. This show has maintained a TV-MA status that puts South Park to shame! There is also plenty of language. The F bomb is the only thing that gets bleeped, everything else is pretty much fair game. The \"other\" version of cat, as well as many other references.<br/><br/>Overall, the humor is extremely raunchy. One of the writers of the show did such works as The Dictator, Bruno, EuroTrip, Seinfeld, and even Herman's Head (I miss that show). If you are familiar with the humor of these first two shows, then you can imagine what to expect here. Fans of The Mindy Project will be familiar with one main cast member, as well as a few of the guest stars that show up.<br/><br/>The downside to this show is that to get the best value for your watching is you have to watch every episode.

Many times, new and edgy sitcoms come on air for a season or two and then seem to fizzle out. Sometimes the plot just isn't good enough, the characters may not be entertaining, however, one show that should be held above the rest is based on a fantasy football league.<br/><br/>The League, which began its first season in October 2009, is a sitcom about a coveted fantasy football league, its dedicated members, and their quirky everyday lives. The show is a semi-improvised comedy who follows a group of friends whose lives revolve around their fantasy football league and their league prize, The Shiva. We follow them through their everyday smack talk, trade discussions, and awkward life situations. <br/><br/>The show is very well constructed from top to bottom. Not many other shows have the ability to run for a full seven seasons, especially with such a simple concept. However, the simple concept is what most of the viewers love about the show. It is all about friends hanging out and discussing fantasy football, while still dealing with the motions of everyday life. Many viewers, who also play fantasy football, see this as the ideal plot for entertainment and it is very attractive for them to watch. Each episode focuses on one hurdle that each of the main characters has to get around, whether it's something at work, in the fantasy league, or with their family, the show seems to always find just the right amount of comedic spin to add.<br/><br/>The main characters have been shaped to form a diverse group of friends in order to provide maximum entertainment for the audience. Each character has their own type of comedy, which makes the show appeal to all kinds of viewers. There's Ruxin, the cut-and-dry, witty lawyer, who always seems to get himself into awkward situations at work with his sarcasm. Pete, the bachelor, works an average job, but he spends most of his time looking for the right girl. Andre is a very successful, but strange, plastic surgeon who always finds himself at the butt of his friend's jokes. Kevin and Jenny are the married couple in the league who go through all the same issues as a normal married couple, while still being rivals in the fantasy league. And then there's Taco, the wacky brother of Kevin, who uses his stupidity to make the audience laugh. The creators Jeff and Jackie Schaffer did a superb job when putting together the characters, because they mesh flawlessly and they give every kind of viewer a favorite character. Many times, like the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, the selection of characters is far too similar and there is little diversity for the audience to choose from. This hasn't been an issue for fans of The League because of their assortment of characters and personalities.<br/><br/>Also, The League's directors and creators have done a masterful job bringing on guest stars to improve the appeal for viewers. They use the advantage of being the only sitcom about fantasy football to their advantage and have brought in an array of actual NFL players and analysts throughout the series. Throughout the years the likes of Terry Bradshaw, Hall of Fame NFL Quarterback; Matt Forte, Chicago Bears Running Back; and many others have been guest stars on the show. Each one who has been on usually doesn't have the best first impression of the league members and many times they don't usually have the best last impression, either. Most of the players quickly find out that the members of the league will do whatever it takes to win.<br/><br/>Another way The League has done a fantastic job is choosing the setting. It seems to rotate between the same old bar, houses and offices, but they all seem to fit in perfectly with the quirky comedy that is being executed at the time. There's nothing special about the bar, it's a simple bar, but it is the perfect environment for the members of The League to crack jokes at each other. Everyone's house fits their back story to a tee. Ruxin has the more extravagant, larger house, because he is a lawyer. Kevin and Jenny live in an average sized suburban home because they both work middle class jobs. Pete, the bachelor, naturally lives alone in a small apartment. And Andre, the big time plastic surgeon lives on his own in a spacious, upscale penthouse apartment. All of which fit their exact behavior, personalities and back stories.<br/><br/>One thing that is often overlooked in a show is the supporting cast. The supporting cast can help make or break a show, like the sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond, which had a fantastic supporting cast that fit together like an actual family and solved problems like an actual family would, that created much appeal for the audience and that's part of the reason why it had such a long run. The League's casting department has done a fabulous job of bringing in actors and actresses that compliment the main characters. Their timing is superb and seem to chime in at the exact right time to crack a joke. This is key to having a successful show.<br/><br/>After watching the whole series a full time through and re- watching much of it, it is very hard to find something this show lacks. It seems to offer something for everybody, with all different kinds of comedy, actors and plots. Even though it is about fantasy football, it has an appeal to those who have no idea what fantasy football is. They do a great job of appealing to a wide range of viewers and have established a loyal fan base.

Yet, the jokes are strong enough to keep any fan of comedy entertained. <br/><br/>There is a good amount of scantily-clad women as well as jokes concerning genitalia that seem aimed at the football-watching audience which, as this show is a superior enough product to surpass the goal of garnering an audience of 40-something year old couch potatoes, could easily be done away with. <br/><br/>Overall, it is funnier than most comedy and the natural flow of the show as well as the charming improvisation of many of its characters give it great potential (if the two aforementioned problems are fixed, namely: being less obvious with the football references and trying to appeal to a broader audience by cutting down on the sexist images of women and offensive humor).", "rating": 7, "helpful": "9 out of 15 found this helpful.", "date": "6 May 2011"}, {"title": " Just Normal Fantasy Football Stuff", "content": "Having recently finished my first full rewatch of The League, I've realised I have a few things to say in regards to reviewing it. I think it's important I mention first that I have below zero interest in American football or 'fantasy football' and my interest in the show was piqued originally by my being a fan of the Duplass brothers and because I knew it was a show recommended along with good comedies such as Always Sunny, The Office and Archer. I'm happy to say that the football subject matter never steals the focus away from the core relationships between the characters and someone who knows nothing about the sport and its star players will not be left confused or patronized whenever they are actually talking about it. One of the League's strengths is certainly that it can balance the dialogue between the specific subject matter and an endless amount of jokes, insults, banter between characters, instances of reoccurring gags and less than serious situations. The League is definitely a dialogue-driven show and the writers deliver, I think its where the comedy is strongest, as I am not particularly a fan of a lot of the visual humour thrown in along with it: think sex comedy, gross-out, 'insane' characters like Rafi and a hell of a lot of Paul Scheer's Andre being mocked or belittled in some way - it gets old fast, to say the least.<br/><br/>Another particular thing about the League which I would say is a strength but could put some people of is basically how unsavory most of the characters are; only to each other, generally, but this is a show where you find competition, feuds, 'trash-talking' and bullying instead of endearments and 'traditional' friendship. Most of the characters are reasonable, normal people who simply take part in the League and its associated dramas. Nick Kroll's Ruxin takes a more over-the-top spin on how 'evil' he is, as he would certainly go the furthest to win against the others, and the subsequent development of his anger and stubbornness actually made him my favourite character - but on the other hand you have Andre who never really gets the credit he deserves, at least as practically the nicest, most caring member of the group, and Taco who ironically never gets the comeuppance he deserves as the uncaring, stoned sexual genius that mostly just Flanderizes him in the later seasons. And then there's Rafi, who never gets better and only gets more grating, and no, I didn't enjoy the Rafi and Dirty Randy episodes at all really. I have respect for Jason Mantzoukas as an actor and I've seen that he can play it straight and bring characters to life, but man has he had to play this character in half of his acting roles at this point.<br/><br/>With a show that lasted this long, there's the big question that you might want answering before you start at Season 1: does it remain consistent in quality until the show ends? The answer: yes, almost. I felt that the first six seasons were all as good as each other, and only with about half the episodes of Season 7 did I notice an obvious drop in quality. Honestly at least they let the show end before dragging it any further into mediocrity, it's clear scheduling was becoming an issue with Nick Kroll and Mark Duplass absent from some episodes in the last season, and the jokes were becoming tired and overdone. I shouldn't have to mention the animated episode. I liked the final episode, anyway, and I think it closed the show in a decent way, though it was just another diss on Andre.<br/><br/>Overall, The League is a competent, funny, easily digestible show that I think rivals the likes of Always Sunny and Archer for unlikable characters and entertaining dialogue. It has some great stars and a generally consistent tone, with the characters having well executed season-long arcs. Don't expect the world from it, but if you like the first couple of episodes then you'll probably like the entire show.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "2 out of 2 found this helpful.", "date": "12 March 2019"}, {"title": " The League", "content": "I see a lot of people writing about the actual American football side of the show..

The cast does the best it can with the script, and there are some talented actors in the mix (and some not very talented, but that's OK)...but the logic and reasons behind each of the episodes, the actual story, is so poorly thought out and with plot holes you could drive an aircraft carrier through.<br/><br/>Take, for instance, a stand-off with a Russian cruiser (guess we aren't the last ship, after all) that is supposed to be commanded by a brilliant Russian naval commander. Problem is, he doesn't even do the smallest things, or local tactics, in the interchanges with the US ship. Like knowing when high tide would be in his locality. Like not putting eyes on the port facilities and ship when over the horizon (landing marines, for instance) or guarding the only other exit out of the harbor.

WHY? It is already purified and frankly speaking as it is Coors Lite, dang near nothing but water anyway. Why put it through a system that can only contaminate it? Second, they get the ship moving by...three para-drop chutes, tied to the ship. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a 9,000 ton ship was moved by three essentially bedsheets.

(possible spoilers)", "content": "Why is this show so immensely popular? Back in 2006, I saw the first episode and thought, Hey, this isn't so bad. As the series progressed, however, I found Hannah Montana to be incredibly dull, unrealistic, and a terrible example for children.<br/><br/>Let's start with the \"dull\" part: Hannah Montana completely lacks in just about everything. For example, the laugh track is played obnoxiously often throughout the show at moments that aren't even remotely funny. The \"comedy\" also desperately needs better acting; I haven't seen a difference in Miley's expressions at all, and it's always the same little grimace and hand motions. A good or even decent actress would know to vary facial expressions and movements. Simply walking around with hands and arms in the shrug position doesn't cut it. It's not just Miley that demonstrates the poor caliber of acting; nearly the whole cast is incapable of acting. Emily Osment is the only exception. Aside from the acting, the plot line is exceptionally bland; it chronicles the double life of a not-so-great teenager. Personally, I could think of so much more enlightening subjects around which to base a show.<br/><br/>Moreover, the show is totally unrealistic. Blonde wigs don't magically transform people into mediocre singers (yes, I just called the singing mediocre). Any person can see that Miley looks exactly like Hannah Montana (hmm, wonder why), and therefore Miley would be mobbed as soon as she stepped out of her front door. However, she is totally able to keep her cover and keep her night life under the radar like magic.<br/><br/>Also, the show is an atrocious example for the young children who watch this show. It insists that it's okay to be exceptionally cruel to your friends; they'll always come back. It says to feel free to use all the sarcasm you want; it doesn't affect people. That is not the way the world works; cruelty should not be acceptable. It should not be funny, either. For some reason, we are supposed to find insults, sarcasm, and bad attitudes to be hilarious. Miley is basically a spewing fountain of sarcasm. I can't recall one episode where she hasn't used her \"Ya think?!\" line (multiple times at that, and apparently this is \"funny\"). Since when is shouting at your supposed \"best friends\" okay to do? I have a five-year-old relative, and she adores the Disney Channel, in particular Hannah Montana. About three months ago, her mother had to ban her from watching the show because she was developing an attitude similar to Miley's: mean, sarcastic, and trashy. Here was a five-year-old little girl who was back-sassing her parents, acting like she owned the world, treating her younger brother like dirt, and dancing in a very suggestive manner. Was the aim of the Disney Channel to produce a show that would transform all the innocent little girls of the USA into trashy preteens?<br/><br/>This show is possibly the worst show the Disney Channel has come up with. It's sad to see that this is what kids are watching. I advise everyone to stay away; the show is not all it's cracked up to be.<br/><br/>A very sad 1/10.", "rating": 1, "helpful": "182 out of 282 found this helpful.", "date": "21 September 2007"}, {"title": " One of the many examples of why Disney has gone downhill...", "content": "Did I like Disney at one time?

But now, those days are over, and the company is now referred to as a has been. I've tried to tolerate Disney in recent years, but anymore, the majority of what comes out of it is plain crap. The show Hanna Montana is a good indication of that.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, I grew up with sitcoms, and back in the 80s and 90s, there was always a good sitcom to watch with the whole family. Not now. I honestly can't see why Hanna Montana is so popular among the kids and the young teens crowd. It is dull, and the laugh track that is common in sitcoms is played in even the most boring of parts. Miley Cryus herself displays poor acting, heck, I say the whole crew lacks talent. Like HSM, this show is just another poor example of what Disney nowadays seems to think as good entertainment. It is not.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most insulting is when Hanna (Miley) puts on a wig as a disguise. Suddenly, it's as if no one knew who she was. How pathetic is that? She also yells at her best friends, like that it's okay to do in real life. Miley pretty much uses her cheesy lines and cruel ways to deal with things, and in the end, her friends always return. She even has her father playing in this, helping her along the way just in case something bad happens. So to make myself clear, Hanna Montana is a joke, bringing in a bland plot line with some of the most wretched clich\u00e9s I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I wish the Disney Channel would go back to the way it was.

Mitchel Musso and Emily Osment as her two friends Oliver and Lily, respectively, are both riots in their hilarious roles.

The cast is all awesome, though the shining stars are, in my opinion, Osment, Musso, and Earles. One of my favorite parts about the show is the fact that the dad is not a dumb dad like in so many other TV series.

The only thing I noticed is that the writers are still seem uncertain of how her character should be permanently act on the show. It seems like the past few episodes that she acts completely different from one episode to another, in different parts. But thats okay because her acting makes up for it. Miley's brother Jackson, played by Jason Earles, adds more humor to the show. I think the entire cast is great. But the best thing is that its a real funny show.

Well, at least he's not obsessed anymore. My best friend's boyfriend is like him. No doubt about it. Now if only Oliver had a double life, too.<br/><br/>()Jason Earles plays Miley's embarrassing older brother, Jackson. I don't that much to say about him. He's just funny at times. Sometimes, he doesn't make any sense. I just feel bad for the Stewart family. Oh yeah, none of my friends or family is like him.<br/><br/>()Last, but certainly not least, the role of Miley Stewart's father, Robbie Ray, is portrayed by Miley Cyrus's father, Billy Ray Cyrus. I like him. He's totally funny. I like it when he sings. Robbie Ray is a cool dad. I wish he was my dad--my dad died 14 years ago. Anyway, my mom's boyfriend, my possible step-dad, is just like Robbie Ray.<br/><br/>()In conclusion, from Miley to Billy Ray, you got yourself a hilarious cast. I'm just glad that Miley has Lily as a friend, otherwise, if she had another guy friend and never had Lily, then the show would have to be renamed. What will happen in the second season?

I am brand new to this and I will try to keep the guidelines while writing my comment about Hannah Montana. I used to not like kids in movies or TV shows, but now I have changed my thinking. I just love the Disney Channel. There are a lot of really good and cute shows on there, but I think Hannah Montana is probably my favorite. Between all of the character's on there, of course Miley Stewart/Hannan Montana is my \"fav\". But all the other's run a close race. But Billy Ray Cyrus is just a real natural on there. The looks that he gives his kids when they either do wrong or are trying to talk him into doing something. And Vicki Lawrence when she was on there was a natural mother/me maw. And Jackson and all the funny little things he does. And the way that Billy Ray Cyrus always works the song he was famous for into different places on the show is really cute. Even my husband likes it. But she is so pretty and cute, I can't believe it took them so long to discover her.And I just love Lilly/Lola. She is just the right person for that role.

I loved it, now by all means it is a pilot so obviously it is a little slower in the beginning but they are just introducing you to the characters and letting you get a glimpse of the setting and atmosphere. It mostly follows our character Vinnie (Franco) who is a good guy bartender that is surrounded by pimps, prostitutes, policeman and every one in between. He is constantly getting harassed by people looking for their money that his twin brother (also played by Franco) owes them without exactly knowing where his twin brother is. I see the other reviewers have a personal vendetta against Franco saying that he doesn't deserve these serious roles because he doesn't act well enough for it. I love Franco as the stoner comedian as much as the next person but I truly think he is a good actor and is capable of doing these roles. He grabs my attention whenever he is in the scene, I fully believe who he is as the character and thinks he does a really good job, plus it's HBO, they know what they are doing so I trust with my heart<br/><br/>We also get a great look at a couple of the pimps that are running the streets of Manhattan with the prostitutes they own as well as themselves being very wealthy for the time and with the confidence of Gods. A great shout out to Gary Carr (Cici) playing a smooth talking pimp that with in minutes can make a small town girl change her life and work for him. Any time he comes in scene his dialogue and charisma is a complete treat and makes you think he really is a pimp running around New York. The way he holds himself in this show is awesome, makes you respect him even though you know what he is doing is very cynical when fully thought about.<br/><br/>Another great performance is Maggie Gyllenhaal (Candy) a prostitute that has no pimp because she is strong willed enough herself that she doesn't need someone looking out for her and taking her profits. You feel for character, the loneliness, the moral consciousness, everything. She does a great job in her performance in really selling how the life of a lady like that was when they weren't under the hand of drugs or an abusive person above them, they just were doing what they did to make ends meet.<br/><br/>Now everything else, such as the setting and back drops, beautiful. gets you completely in the mindset of New York city in the 70's. The music choice is great and they don't overplay it like other shows/movies do in trying to persuade you to get into the setting. The costume department are nailing the 70's era wardrobe from the working man, to the pimps, to the prostitutes they capture the essence of it greatly and it creates a nostalgic feeling for any one that was living in the 70's can remember.<br/><br/>Storyline, like a said slower in the beginning because they were setting the groundwork and foundation for what the show will become in due time but I still was very interested the entire time. There definitely are quite a bit of characters and plots going on at once but you can already see them link up in the pilot episode and you can tell they will mesh together very nicely being in the city that everyone is constantly running into each other. But all in all i am very pleased with the pilot episode and I have a strong feeling with as each new episode comes out it will only get better and will really have a great story with in the city of Manhattan, New York. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of HBO series, or want to see a life that we lost, the 70's, or just want to see a show with great wardrobe and music I would definitely recommend watching The Deuce.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "32 out of 64 found this helpful.", "date": "29 August 2017"}, {"title": " Conveys the era well.", "content": "I lived in Spanish Harlem in the period of this series.

I was laughed out of clothing stores where I applied for sales jobs by gay clerks who correctly judged me as a provincial. Yes, it was a tough town.<br/><br/>I partook of 42nd Street entertainments occasionally. Times Square and 42nd Street were shabby and inhabited by street people of every sort. The vibe was similar to what we can experience today in large cities of Africa, South America and South East Asia. Why? Because Manhattan then was a place where run-down housing was cheap. Hordes of disenfranchised young people fled there from every corner of America. The false promise of success drew them. Yet the aristocracy still ruled and exploited them. <br/><br/>This series has captured the mood of 42nd Street and Times Square of that time. It has even brought back to me some of the smells of that district. It was pungent with cigarette smoke, burned grease from shabby diners, cheap perfume, and disinfectant. Cars spewed unfiltered pollution. Cabs honked incessantly. Loud voices pierced the din. Wary tourists gawked and skittered.<br/><br/>I appreciate the show's avoidance of retrospective political correctness. Hookers, pimps and corrupt cops were not gentile.

While Katherine Hepburn was playing upper class women of stature, the reality on the ground was quite different, especially for working-class women and women of color.<br/><br/>This is the kind of programming which might save channels like HBO in an age of increased streaming competition.

Thanks.<br/><br/>---------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW------------------------------<br/><br/>The Deuce is one of those shows that defies description, because what you think it's going to be changes and evolves. It's mature, well acted, and completely different than anything I've seen in a long time. <br/><br/>This show has such a raw feel to it that you feel the grit dripping off the screen. It's real, and filled with colorful characters that leave an impression. A few I began to care about during the first episode. I love when the work is so good, I become invested in a show and there's a strong desire to come back and see what happens.<br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhaal, who has consistently impressed me over the years doesn't disappoint here. She's just fantastic. As a matter of fact, most all the actors in this show really seem to give it their all. There are characters galore, and lots of plot points to get involved in. That being said, it doesn't feel too busy. There's just the right amount things going on.<br/><br/>I really have to admit that I thought it would be something else. I nearly ignored it. I'm glad I watched though, and I can see it becoming one of my favorite new shows. <br/><br/>There's a lot of nudity as one would probably expect, both male and female, including male genitalia, so if you aren't ready for that sort of thing in your face, be forewarned. It's not gratuitous though, and fits within the flow of the story. I don't consider that a spoiler, as there is other information on IMDb in the \"parents guide\" that cautions about the nudity. <br/><br/>The bottom line, this show is worth my time, and you may find it worth yours as well.

I've tried to be deliberately vague to avoid plot spoilers but if you're very sensitive about this then stop reading now!<br/><br/>Nothing here is very original but that doesn't bother me in itself as long as it's well done, however, this really isn't with the writing being the main culprit. The plot has too many flaws, even taking into account artistic license, and the characters are simply TOO random and inconsistent to be believable and sympathetic people that we can relate to. What's worse is that avoiding simple mistakes and greater depth, maybe adding another couple of episodes to the series or better writing and editing, could have made the whole thing a lot more complete.<br/><br/>We have a teenage girl that morphs from a family minded, idealist into a barely recognisable love sick, morally clueless, lost soul. If this is how it was going to go then her starting point should have been different and the journey laid out in more depth so that it had some credibility but for me there was none.<br/><br/>We have a young man murdering a small child and showing zero remorse, or any psychological impact, but then we're asked to believe that, because he had a rough childhood, he's just misunderstood rather than being the psychopath that he's portrayed as in the first half of the series. This isn't a twist in the plot, it's treating your audience like idiots expected them to lap up any rubbish you throw at them. This is underlined by the fact that a dark haired young boy somehow grows up having mousy blonde hair. If you don't respect your audience enough to care about details like this then why should we care about anything you put in front of us?<br/><br/>We have a serious criminal mastermind who apparently warrants intensive (and morally ambiguous to say the least) long term under cover investigation but then inexplicably transforms into a, not so bad, small time, bumbling crook.<br/><br/>Two of the revenge gang are just clich\u00e9s that aren't even considered important enough to explain their place in the overall story. You have the humongous, largely silent, brooding black guy who is somehow the \"brother\" of the short, skinny but deadly white guy.

A man trying to turn a new leaf and leave his demons behind only to have them chase him across the globe, he goes back to his ruthless past self to try and deal with his nightmare present. His (sober) judgement about what to voluntarily share with a woman that's only just emerging from a coma is suspect to say the least.<br/><br/>A group of women of good character kill an attacker, clearly in self defence, yet decide to make themselves criminals rather than victims by covering it up.

With a script as truly bad as this, it is little wonder that the characters struggle to become even one-dimensional in form. They include 'the good time gal' barmaid, the silent but brooding native people (who, given the dreadful nature of the script I expected to say 'White man bring heap big many problem' at any moment), the Frankenstein monster of a corporate executive, the cool but unhinged assassin, the pudding basin haircut kid (really? Jeez, that's not been around since Kramer v Kramer back in 1979) and the loyal but dim-as-a-two-watt bulb wife.

There's some good acting and production quality that's really not bad for regular TV. A mix of comfortable &amp; relatable and new &amp; interesting. But although there was much to appreciate about the characters and their relationships, it was still fairly white savior-y and inauthentic and the overall plot was basic.<br/><br/>I appreciated seeing a disabled person living with all kinds of trauma and the personal manifestations of those struggles while still being a strong, relatable, lovable lead. But even she became more and more of a caricature.<br/><br/>The plot was ok, not groundbreaking but watchable enough until the painfully contrived twist ending, by which point it was clear that they'd had to stretch the season through too many episodes. But by season 2, its irritatingly unwatchable as they basically keep trying to squeeze every last drop out of the first season setup. It's just a myriad of ridiculous choices, unnecessary misunderstandings and forced conflict/endangerment. Not to mention all the lost opportunities on characters and relationships that just fall to the way side while painfully drawing out the ones that remain. Its just absurd.<br/><br/>I keep trying to just go along for the ride but I'm beyond seasick from how hard it tries to twist and turn within such a thin frame. It feels like a showrunner had an inspired moment and then instead of really working it through, just handed the basic idea off to a class of writing students to fill in the bulk of the story.<br/><br/>The actors, for the most part, do a great job with what little they are given but as the show stretches on, it doesn't go any deeper so the characters just get more and more thin.<br/><br/>I genuinely hate to criticize, generally if I write a review, its in defense of a production but this had such potential and then got so mercilessly strangled that someone, somewhere, needs to know what they did... and I'm guessing producers and execs are as much to blame as the writers.

Within the first five minutes of the first episode you will have a very clear picture of what it meant to have to undergo surgery at a time when even today's most common surgical procedures had hardly been tested \u2013 let alone successfully. With this new series, writers Jack Amiel and Michael Begler have created a fascinating \u2013 and gripping \u2013 look at the humble beginnings of modern medicine, and frankly: it made me realize just how lucky I am to live today. <br/><br/>The show's title is derived from the 'Knickerbocker Hospital', a fictional hospital at the turn of the 20th. century in New York which serves as the centre stage around which the lives and struggles of the protagonists revolve. 'The Nick' shows us an uneasy, turbulent time where everything is in motion, and although the benefits of the so called \"modern age\" are already waiting around the corner, the situation for people without money is grim. Immigrants live in horrible sanitary situations, little children have to work in factories and social frictions and racial prejudice run deep within society.<br/><br/>Clive Owen does an excellent job portraying a conflicted but passionate surgeon who's constantly trying to push the boundaries by inventing or refining surgical methods in the hope of lowering the mortality rate among his patients. The rest of the cast is also terrific; their performances - along with the great writing - help create a sense of realism that is rarely seen in films or TV-shows depicting that era. The same can be said of the fantastic production values \u2013 the team behind 'The Knick' obviously went to great lengths to portray everyday life of that era as accurately as possible. Virtually every frame oozes quality: the city of New York at the beginning of the twentieth century has been meticulously recreated and every busy street corner, alley or candle-lit room feels authentic. Small wonder, perhaps, given that the director, producer, cinematographer and editor of all 20 episodes is none other than multi-talent and Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh.<br/><br/>My verdict: This is a fascinating, gripping portrayal of the dawn of modern surgery as well as an intense human drama and an authentic look at an era we normally only get to see in films about Sherlock Holmes or Jack the Ripper.

On the exterior, The Knick is a historical look at early 1900's New York City and the plot is based around a newly promoted head surgeon, Dr. Thackery (Clive Owen), of The Knickerbocker Hospital. The medical aspect of the show is truly fascinating, intense and shocking. The surgeries shown on the show are not for the faint of heart and have the look of a butcher shop rather then what we currently expect in an operating room. <br/><br/>The sets are beautiful and well done to portray a century year old time period. I have heard complaints about the music and blurry vision of some of the cameras and shots that Director Steven Soderbergh incorporates throughout the show. If you want a clean cut narrative with perfectly clean shots and no unique sound, then feel free to go watch network television. I find the electronic music very interesting and almost a sort of heart beat to the show. The blurry shots are absolutely justified as this world is dimly lit and fuzzy on its own accord. The music and cinematography do it great justice.<br/><br/>The acting on the show is also top notch as Clive Owen leads a team that is in sync throughout. Andre Holland is a revelation as Dr. Algernon Edwards, a African American doctor literally fighting for respect in an extremely racist medical world. These two characters and their relationship form the essence of much of the show's themes which are very relevant even today. Beneath each character there lies more depth then you will receive in most television. Dr Thackery is burdened by his past and his temptations, yet is dedicated to saving the lives of his patients and not selling out. It is a gray world at The Knick and one in which lies death, drugs, sex, racism and deceit, and at the same time brings us heroics, ethics, humanity and discovery.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "34 out of 38 found this helpful.", "date": "30 September 2014"}, {"title": " Can't get enough!", "content": "I cannot get enough of this show, it is extraordinary in so many ways and I am restlessly awaiting the start of season 2.

It's rare that nearly every perspective is appealing. On other series they have strong leads and probably one or two well written supporting cast. This is not so with The Knick, audience would find something endearing in the unorthodox characters as they all have their unique slightly destructive charm.<br/><br/>With Steven Soderbergh at helm, the artistic vibe just oozes from the dirty New York.

I was utterly fascinated with the instruments, exam table and all the medicines and gear that was there. I still have photos and several pieces from that office.<br/><br/>Having been the victim of a major accident five years later, subsequently spending months in the hospital, I again was fascinated by the differences between modern medicine and what served as medicine in the early 1900's.<br/><br/>Watching this show, the subject comes back again; it is intriguing, fascinating, compelling... So realistic and true to the day. The make-up, effects and realism of the sets is stunning. If you were to look at operating theater photographs from the early 1900's era, you would see the realism that the show has created in these scenes. Add to that the elaborate street scenes, amazing costumes and attention to detail that the production employs and I hope that you will see the extreme talent and effort that has gone into The Knick. Take special note of some of the special effects showing medical conditions and operating trauma, it's very realistic and downright scary. It will make you thankful for modern medicine and the amazing advances of the medical establishment during the 20th century.<br/><br/>The direction and cinematography is well done. Dialog based scenes are typically shot with the rule of thirds followed (pleasing) but there are many non-dialog scenes where the director moves away from the banal by shooting action from odd angles (carving of pig carcasses with action at mid-line filmed low) or a fight sequence filmed with a wide angle 'behind the hero' view -- this keeps the visual story interesting. Add the Contagion-like soundtrack (I know - a 1900s drama with a techno music track = ?) and the overall experience is captivating.<br/><br/>Finally, I am not sure everyone is familiar with the 'steampunk' enthusiasm (movement?) that is finding its way into both culture (art, collecting) and mainstream style (go to a high end plumbing /appliance store and you will see what I mean!) -- this show captures the industrial late 19th century look extremely well. <br/><br/>I am literally sad when each hour is over.

The nurse has to inject him as he's too shaky to do so himself. <br/><br/>This sounds a lot more like heroin withdrawal than cocaine withdrawal.

I can't think of any other stars in the history of television who can actually enticed the viewing public more than the Angels, especially the MAGIC FOUR namely, Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett-Majors, Jaclyn Smith, and Cheryl Ladd (Of course, the other two angels, Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts created a sensation too, but the \"Magic Four\" are the ones who started it all).<br/><br/>I didn't had a chance to see the first season when it was first broadcast, as I was very \"young\" then, but lucky me, it was a huge success and was re-played again and again, every year. Funny, because a lot of people thought the series lasted until 1983 or 1985 because it was like being re-played forever!<br/><br/>I must say, that the first season is the best of the rest and the chemistry of the original three are just wonderful. The second series with Cheryl Ladd was excellent too, but everyone knows that Jackson and Ladd were not in good terms, so, I guess, it affects the way the people look at them.<br/><br/>I started as a fan of Kate Jackson, I reckon, for she's the only known star before the series started. But the two other lovely angels are hard to ignore. Fawcett is so bubbly and appealing while Smith is the most beautiful angel you can think of. But,I am still surprised up to now, why Fawcett became the more popular angel during her time on the show.<br/><br/>She was even dubbed the sexiest of all the angels, where in fact, I believe, it is Jaclyn Smith, who's got the most curvaeous body of the three and looks great in that famous \"white bikini\" on the show. Even, in the hair department, I believe that Smith's hair is actually more flouncy and sexier than Fawcett. But then, I guess, Fawcett's popularity came right up with the released of her poster which was very timely for the show.But all in all, the original three are just wonderful.<br/><br/>Then came, Cheryl Ladd. She's a welcome addition to the show. She's sexy, beautiful and very charming. Her introduction to the show with ANGELS IN PARADISE is one of my fave episodes and one the best of the series. Who can forget the scene when they're about to rescue Charlie in the yacht? Ladd came out from the water in a bikini with Jaclyn Smith (in her tiniest in a \"green\" bikini). No wonder the second season became more popular than the first one. I called this, the BIKINI FEVER!<br/><br/>Then, Jackson, left the show. I believe, that Shelley Hack, did a wonderful job as the next angel, actually. Her characer speaks for her action in the show. Remember, the scene with Bosley in \"LoveBoat Angels,\" when she told him that she's a bit scared to be part of the group because of what they have started already? Well, maybe her portrayal of her character was just too classy for the show but she's actually a stand out in the show. I also think that she's one of the two best-dressed angels on the show --the other one is Jaclyn Smith.<br/><br/>Smith and Hack are in they're best when they're together. I like their chemistry on the show. It's a pity, she only lasted one season.<br/><br/>The last of the Angels, Tanya Roberts is a fave, too. She's got this fabulous body and sexy eyes. Roberts, actually became more popular overseas and the bikini fever is back again. She was, obviously, given all the bikini scenes on the show. With Smith wanting to leave and Ladd, just happy to go along with the show, Roberts was given the responsibility to carry the show. Alas, the chemistry, didn't work out.<br/><br/>The show opened a lot of things to women on television. Sad, to say, none has the charisma of the angels.

I would like to disagree.<br/><br/>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there were few enough female 'action' stars on television to be role models for young girls.  The various women in 'Charlie's Angels' were (according to the OP) police officers before Charlie hired them -- and as female police officers, they were given stupid 'girl' jobs like handing out parking tickets, and handling switchboards, and so on.  Charlie gave them jobs in which they could actually fight crime -- and they did fight crime, together. If one of them needed rescue, it wasn't a man that came to rescue her, but one of the other two 'angels'.  They were independent, intelligent, single, employed women who worked well together and supported one another.<br/><br/>The show is dated now, given how strong feminism has become since then. Back then, however, it was more than enough for at least one little girl to see that she didn't have to grow up and get married and have babies to be happy in life.

Many of the scenes used in the opening credits of the show are from this pilot episode. Then in the fall of September of 1976 ABC introduce the three stunning, sexy and young former police officers, private detectives working for the Charles Townsend Detective Agency with the entire crew back except David Ogden Stiers. In the opening sequence of the first season no one knew where the Angels went to the police academy. The wealthy Charlie Townsend, their never-seen boss, relayed assignments via a speaker telephone. The Angels worked with their trusty male counter-part, John Bosley. After only 23 episodes, Farrah left the show at the end of the first season. When Farrah Fawcett left the series, her absence was explained by having her character Jill become a professional racing driver on the NASCAR circuit. Along with a new Angel, the show received a new time slot. The Angels remained on Wednesday nights, but moved from 10pm to 9pm. This change in time opened up a whole world of new viewers who wanted to know what the big fuss was all about and kept the \"Angels\" right where they belong - on top of the ratings! The 1977-1978 season ended with high ratings, proved that Kris, Cheryl Ladd, was every bit as popular with the viewers as Farrah. In the 1979-1980 season, the answer came with Shelley Hack, a model who had been prominent in Revlon's \"Charlie\" Perfume ads and commercials. Shelley entered The Townsend Office as Tiffany Welles, an Ivy League scholar who also was a graduate from the Boston Police Academy. Spelling and Goldberg had the idea that with this new Angel/model at the helm, she could bring an elegant and classy touch to Charlie's trio! Kate Jackson's absence was explained by having Sabrina getting married and starting a family. The writers treaded lightly as they tried to figure out how to make Tiffany Welles the new \"Sabrina Duncan\". The 1979-1980 seasons' problem was the sudden decline in ratings. The series found itself in the top 20's instead of the top 10 were it had been for the last three years. The ratings drop was directed at the new Angel and at the end of the season, Shelley was let go of her detective duties. Thus, beginning, for another hunt for a new Angel! By 1980, Charlie's Angels was beginning to feel its age and was declining fast. Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg wanted to go with a fresh new image. After careful consideration, they decided to hire virtually unknown actress, Tanya Roberts. This time around, the character would be a model-turned-detective, street-smart Julie Rogers. The new Angel showed her face in the three-hour 1980-1981 season premiere on November 30, 1980. High hopes were placed on Charlie's newest Angel to pull the series out its failing ratings. To help give it an added boost, the Angels were sent to Hawaii for the first six episodes. Hawaii wasn't only chosen to intrigue the audience but to keep the Angels scantily clad in swimsuits! Charlie's opening monologue has now undergone a complete overhaul. It begins, \"Once upon a time, there were three beautiful girls. Two of them graduated from the police academy. The other graduated from a top school for models. And they each reaped the rewards of their exciting careers Bosley looks over brochures of Hawaii in anticipation of the Angels' possible assignment there. Charlie arranges for Julie to receive a probationary investigator's license and begin working with Kris and Kelly. Unfortunately, at this point, the audience was no longer keeping up with the Angels antics. In February 1981, the show went on hiatus and wasn't shown again until June of 1981. Charlie's Angels was not winning any viewers in the summer of '81 with its remaining episodes. The show that had made women crime fighters popular during the 1970's was taken off the air. Charlie's Angels was a huge success the moment it hit the airwaves in 1976. The Angels were on gum cards, doll boxes, T-shirts, board games, puzzles and posters. If you wanted to hire the Angels you had to call the office phone number was 555-0267. Kelly Garrett (Jaclyn Smith) was the only Angel to last the entire series. Kelly was an orphan. John Forsythe' was never on the set - his voice was recorded, and dubbed in later. The Angels all drove Ford automobiles. Jill (and later Kris) drove a Cobra, Kelly drove a Mustang, and Sabrina drove a Pinto. For the record, Bosley drove a Ford L.T.D. Although Charlie was never heard, he did actually appear in a couple of episodes, but his face was never shown. Kelly is the only Angel to have been shot throughout the run of the show. Sabrina was the only Angel that was previously married. She was married to a fellow officer when she was still a cop but the marriage ended in divorce.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "12 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "25 February 2007"}, {"title": " Farrah Fawcett was by far the stand-out!", "content": "Farrah Fawcett was a huge part of the shows initial success.

Added to that,Farrah Fawcett decided to quit after the first season despite her on-going contract after she became the most popular among the cast.

A show with females in the lead as detectives? Flipping their hair, wearing fabulous clothes and being desired by men every week? I got it. Okay, now let's get down to the nitty gritty. By far and large most mild or avid \"Angels\" fans will fight tooth and nail defending seasons 1 - 3. These seasons starred Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett-Majors ( as she was known then ), Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd. Get over yourselves. These seasons felt so typical to me. Almost cookie cutter. Farrah ( my least favorite Angel ) was bubbly but in an annoying, nails on a chalk board way. Kate was far too masculine-esqe for the show. I am all for not wanting to be a bikini clad bimbo but c'mon. Cheryl Ladd never really gelled until season 4. With Kate out of there she had more of a chance to shine. Jaclyn Smith grew as an actress and was so gracious, lovely, composed, elegant and focused. Season 4 &amp; 5 introduced my favorite Angels. The cultured, intelligent, tough, classy and gorgeous Shelley Hack ( Tiffany Welles ) and the even tougher, sexy, street raised and and flame-haired Tanya Roberts ( Julie Roberts ). These two are always put down, overly criticized or just plain forgotten. Neither were to blame for the downfall of the series. The show by the end of the 3rd season was down to the Top 30 and slipping. This was before Tiff &amp; Julie joined rank. The shotty, poor, cringe enducing scripts and poor management of the show are to blame. Even Jaclyn and Cheryl have gone on record numerous time defending Shelley. As she seems the most beaten up. Some say she took the show to serious. When in reality it was the opposite. She didn't look at the show with such grandiose ideas like everyone else. Personally, I preferred the class and sass of Shelley &amp; Tanya. They beat the stereo-type of the initial Angels. And also with Tanya the producers finally got the brunette, blonde &amp; red-head they had wanted since the conception of the show. I ask you to take an unbiased look back at seasons 4 - 5.

Even \"Mad Magazine\" did a nasty swipe at it's improbabilities (not noting that those improbabilities were built in for emphasizing the evils that real Allied veterans faced against the real Nazis). I remember that the MAD satire suggested going one step better - do a series about Jewish concentration camp inmates called \"Hochman's Heroes\". Nobody, certainly not the writers and producers of \"Hogan's Heroes\", ever suggested the death camps were funny or material for possible humor. <br/><br/>When Werner Klemperer was on a talk show (Mike Douglas or Merv Griffin, I forget which) in the 1970s talking about his Emmy winning role of Col. Wilhelm Klink, Klemperer explained his willingness to play the commandant of a German P.O.W. camp in World War II. After all, like fellow stars John Banner, Leon Askin, and Ron Clary he was a survivor of the period, and a Jew (and so like Banner and Askin he had fled the Nazis, unlike Clary who was in a concentration camp but survived). Klemperer made certain that none of the proposed episodes would ever glorify the Nazis (he termed them, \"those fellows\" - a rather mild use of language but he was a gentleman) before he agreed to sign up. One has to look at his long career in film and television to see how consistent he was. Klemperer could play villains, and he certainly was very effective playing die-in-the-soul Nazis. He appeared as Adolf Eichman in one film, and was the Nazi fanatic at the Nuremburg trials in \"Judgement At Nuremburg\" (\"Traitor! TRAITOR!!\" - his most famous line there at Burt Lancaster). Even in an episode of ONE STEP BEYOND he was a loyal SS man trying to flee Nazi Germany in it's dying days on a submarine to South America. Like the great Conrad Veidt, Klemperer knew his real enemy and did a fine job delineating the particular animal to the world. So curiously did Banner, who played Gregor Strasser in the movie \"Hitler\", with Richard Basehart.<br/><br/>If one sees the episodes, the more typical Nazi slime are not the comic caricatures. Only one comic caricature, Howard Caine, never has a redeeming feature - but he is a Gestapo officer. The late Leon Askin (he recently died) is always throwing his fat bulk about as General Burkhalter, and does gloat at possible Allied defeats, but he is a family man, always trying to push the possible marriage of his hideous sister (Kathleen Freeman in a typically good performance) with the trapped Klink. John Banner's simple soldier Sgt. Schultz has a long tradition going back to the post World War I novel \"The Good Soldier Schweik\", about the unconvinced conscript who is there just to survive and go home. The show was based (in part) on the William Holden film of the play \"Stalag 17\", where Otto Preminger was the conniving camp commandant and Sig Ruman was the jovial, untrustworthy sergeant. In the context of that fine Billy Wilder film both roles were well written and cast. But the variations in Klink and Schultz in the television series are (odd to think of it) rounder and more believable.<br/><br/>The episode that I think reveals the truth about them is one where Hogan (Bob Crane, a talented man who was brutally murdered a few years later) manages to convince the Nazi leadership near the camp that the Allies and the Axis have decided to end the war. Klink, Burkhalter, Schultz, Hogan are in Klink's office toasting with schnapps, and now in a relaxed mood, they discuss future plans. Hogan will return to the states and his former job. Burkhalter will still be in a command position in the post-war Nazi Army. But there will be (naturally) a large number of soldiers and officers on all sides who will be decommissioned. While the human Klink is glad the war will be over, he sadly shakes his head. He doesn't know what he will do in the post-war world. He will have his half-pay pension, and has saved a little money. He will have to find work of some sort. Then he looks at Banner and (somewhat mockingly) says, \"And you Schultz, what will you do?\" Banner, quietly sipping his schnapps, says, \"Oh, that's no problem...I will always have a job waiting for me at the Dinkle Toy corporation.\" The other three are not surprised, but it does fill in some of Schultz's background. One can see him making or selling little toys. Klink says, \"Oh, that company is huge. It's the largest toy firm in Europe. What job do you have there?\" Perfectly timed, Banner savoring his schnapps and the impact of his comment says, \"I AM THE DINKLE TOY CORPORATION!\" Klink's eyes widen and his ever present monocle pops out. That in the post-German world lowly, put upon Schultz would actually be a major industrialist never occurred to the Colonel. And in one's mind, recalling the economic miracle that has made Germany the muscular power it is since 1950, the \"Schultz\"s of that country did their job pretty well.<br/><br/>That is why I feel the series was better written and thought out than many of it's critics felt. It didn't glorify what was horrible and unjustifiable in German occupied Europe from 1938 - 1945.

Richard Baker, British Peter Newkirk, French Louis LeBeau and Russian Leonid Kinsky in the pilot, pulled the wool over and outfoxed the Nazis. Werner Klemperer did a wonderful characterization as the pompous Commodant Wilhelm Klink and John Banner became a hysterical Sgt. Hans Schultz with his mugging and facial expressions. The only other roles of recurring Nazis belong to short-tempered General Ivan Burkhalter and the madman Major Wolfgang Hochstetter as played by Leon Askin and Howard Caine, two wonderful character actors. The critics of this show need to go back to school and learn the differences between P.O.W. Camps and Concentration Camps; even people in Germany watching this show today can see the humor and lack of logic in the Nazi's claims of being the superior master race and it is that same arrogance that works so well against them as Hogan uses their own delusions to his advantages. The show is also worthy to watch to see the early roles of William Christopher from M*A*S*H* and repeating returns of director Norm Pitlik as an actor. During the run of the series, the man must have had thirty different roles.

Star Trek had at the same time given black people and women a status of equality to men when they cast Nichelle Nichols as an African American woman as a main character.  So I am very pleased at the fact that the producers took a chance and made this character righfully as an equal.<br/><br/>The theme music is catchy, ok may be slightly annoying but Jerry Fielding did a competent job.  I a m not sure who scores the rest of the episodes, it seems they reuse and make music for certain episodes and recycle whenever they can probably due to budget but its edited nicely.

Hogan's heroes (he said) was one of his inspirations and it reminded me how much I loved this show myself, all those years ago. Who would've thought a Nazi prison camp could be the setting for a comedy series, but it was, and the results were often hilarious. The basic formula is the adversarial daily life between American POWs and their German guards, constantly trying to put one over on each other. The main character was the senior American officer (Colonel Hogan) played by the charismatic Bob Crane who strangely never found fame in any other role and was tragically murdered in Arizona. What gives this show such strength is that the 2 lead Nazis (the overweight Sergeant Schultz &amp; his pompous CO, Colonel Klink) were both played by Jewish actors. John Banner (Schultz) was Austrian and Werner Klemperer (Klink) was German and they both came to America as refugees from the wicked regime in their home countries.

People criticize it as a comedy set in a German prisoner of War camp, saying that trivializes the real human tragedies created by the Nazi regime. The thing is, Hogan's Heroes is not a spoof of prison camps. It's a spoof of World War II movies and TV shows. It came out in the wake of films like `The Longest Day', `The Great Escape', etc. which produced shows like `Combat', `The Gallant Men', 12 O'Clock High', all of which were hyper serious because of the subject matter. Such a trend requires a leavening spoof. And `Hogan's Heroes' and `McHale's Navy' provided that comic relief. Nobody ever criticized McHale's Navy for trivializing the Pacific War, any more than they criticized `F Troop' for not being a documentary about the Old West or `Get Smart' for not being written by John LaCarre. Why do we indict Hogan's heroes for being insensitive to the deprivations of the Nazis?<br/><br/>\nThis show is itself based on a hit Broadway play and movie from a decade before called `Stalag 17' which won William Holden an Oscar. If you've seen Stalag 17, the humor there is much cruder and more oblivious of the real threat of the Nazis than Hogan's Heroes. Robert Strauss and Harvey Lembeck, (later to show up in another Military spoof to which HH also obviously owes a lot), decide at one point they would like to see some female Russian POWS take showers. They grab a bucket of paint and begin painting a stripe down the middle of the road toward the building where the showers are.

However, as many actors can tell you, playing the villain is infinitely more fun than playing the hero, and that seems to go doubly well for comedies.<br/><br/>How Werner Klemperer must have loved playing the pompous, cowardly Col. Klink! And John Banner as the pacifist, food-loving teddy bear, Sgt. Schultz...watching the two of them together (or separately with Crane), you begin to realize that it was they, not Bob Crane, that had the best roles in the show. Watch Schultz say something lovably idiotic, and Klink snap from a smile to a frown in an instant barking, \"Dummkopf!\"<br/><br/>It is these two, and to a lesser degree the various actors who played the heroes, that made the show so good, I am convinced. Each week Klemperer and Banner virtually put on a comedy acting clinic -- they were that good. And when you added the piggish Gen. Burkhalter and that ultimate Angry White Man, Maj. Hochstetter, things only got funnier. All of these characters were played so well that they remain hysterically memorable more than 40 years later.<br/><br/>Try not to concentrate on the inherent absurdity of pulling this stuff off on the Nazis week after week, year after year, and getting away with it, and concentrate more on the exquisite comedic performances, and you will have yourself one hell of a good time.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "11 out of 13 found this helpful.", "date": "25 June 2008"}, {"title": " Mission Impossible with a World War II twist", "content": "As a kid I usually watched this with my dad and uncle and when I grew I up I always wondered what this show was.

I know there are a lot of people saying that Werner Klemperer(Klink), John Banner(Shultz), Robert Clary(LeBeau), and Leon Askin(Gen. Burkhalter) are hypocrites because they all either escaped or fell victim of Nazi persecution in real life; then why did they play as Nazis, or for LeBeaa play in a Nazi camp? Firstly it is a Prisoner of War camp, not a Concentration Camp. Secondly, Werner Klemperer, John Banner, and Leon Askin played as Nazis who would be either stupid or always look like a fool in the end; this is why the I said this show is about making fun of Nazis. Also, a lot of people say that this show makes World War II seem like a joke, or that life in a Nazi camp is nice. Yes, sometimes during the show one of the Allied characters cracks a joke about why the are fighting the war, or something along those lines. Yes, I do agree that is wrong to do that, but you must look at what this show is: Military Sitcom (situation COMEDY) meant to make the Nazis look bad.<br/><br/>Basically Hogan, Kinchloe, LeBeau, Newkirk, and Carter all are the main characters trapped inside a POW outside Hammelburg called Stalag-13. Hogan being the smart and cunning, Kinch being a good technician and radio operator, LeBeau being a good cook and small, Newkirk being a joker, and Carter being a Chemist but very clumsy; they all play a part in fooling Klink, Shultz, and sometimes Burkhalter and the Gestapo to sabotage vital military places in around Stalag-13 through an underground network with connection to England. With all this they disrupt the German war effort in a comedic way.<br/><br/>This is an amazing series.

If he saw a serious documentary or drama about the war, one that played up how fierce and cruel and efficiently nasty the Gestapo were, he'd be very proud of his organization. But if he saw an episode of \"Hogan's Heroes\"--especially one that features Major Hochstetter being fierce/cruel/Gestapo-nasty, with the studio audience laughing their heads off--he'd probably burst a blood vessel!<br/><br/>\"Hogan's Heroes\" is a situation comedy about a group of POWs whose insanely complicated undercover ops always involve fooling their stuffed-shirt kommandant. It doesn't make fun of real POWs or what they went through; if anything, it glamorizes them quite a bit. What it does do is make fun of people who think they're superior. Sure, it overplays how ridiculously silly the Germans were and how much damage the POWs could do (without getting shot), but exaggeration is the essence of comedy. Would \"I Love Lucy\" or \"Gilligan's Island\" be funny if only realistic things happened?<br/><br/>Granted, the basic plots can get pretty predictable--the heroes have to smuggle something or someone out of camp/out of Germany, or their operation is in danger of being discovered, or they have to sabotage something or save Klink/Schultz from the Russian front. Many episodes do have clever plot twists, but on the whole I give the plot quality a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>The scripting, on the other hand, gets 10 out of 10. It's consistently stellar over the 168 episodes, with unforgettable lines like \"I see nothink!\", \"Why is it, Kleenk, that you are always happier to see me than I am to see you?\", \"Love your barbed wire\", and Major Hochstetter's two favorite remarks: \"What is this man doing here?!?\" and \"BAAAH!\"<br/><br/>The acting was fairly good, 9/10 overall; the regulars and recurring characters tended to be better than a lot of the one-shots. A few of the actors deserve special mention: <br/><br/>John Banner (Sergeant Schultz) gets 10 out of 10. He was one of the world's great comic actors, and \"Hogan's Heroes\" couldn't have existed without him. <br/><br/>Larry Hovis (Carter) also gets 10 of 10. Not only is Carter one of the world's cutest dumb guys, in my opinion, but his Hitler impersonation is the best in TV history! <br/><br/>Howard Caine (Major Hochstetter) provided something sorely needed on this slightly overoptimistic show--a dangerous Nazi. If it weren't for the intercom in the coffeepot, Hochstetter would have uncovered the heroes' operation several times over. <br/><br/>And let's not forget Ivan Dixon (Kinchloe)! One year before Lt. Uhura, he became TV's first black communications officer.<br/><br/>Hogan's Heroes is a very funny, family-friendly situation comedy about outwitting \"superior\" bureaucrats, keeping your sense of humor in tough situations, and never giving up--especially when a job is impossible.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "10 out of 12 found this helpful.", "date": "17 October 2007"}]}, "/title/tt1225901/": {"title": "90210", "reviews": [{"title": " Dear lord, get over it!", "content": "I have literally been forced to write a review for this because I am sick of the amount of people insulting this show for such ridiculous reasons!<br/><br/>90210 is DECENT.

It would have been great to see their children be the new students (just like Degrassi). I don't think it makes sense how they wrote Brenda in the show. The dialog between Brenda and Kelly was awkward and \"unrealistic\" from the original series. It didn't make sense. Plus Kelly's sister's name is \"Erin\" and not \"Silver\".(unless I missed them say the name Erin in the show.)

There's a few aspects of the show that has definitely been done before with Degrassi and South of Nowhere. I feel like it's lacking originality and the dialog is very corny. It doesn't feel realistic in a teenage world especially when some guy impresses a girl he just met to go on a Jet.

The pilot not only filled me with consternation, but along with the following episodes it also proved that humanity will never be able to recreate the beauty of classics like Beverly Hills 90210.<br/><br/>After watching 5 minutes of this disaster, every sane person would be inclined to immediately turn off the TV. If the excruciating embarrassment it is to witness the horrible acting performances by the shallow, stupid, inane and anorexic girls in this travesty won't do the trick, maybe the loud, monotonous pop punk soundtrack, which they never hesitate to use slam out the least bit of atmosphere, will induce a headache severe enough to help you get there.<br/><br/>The screenplay is infinitely worse than anything ever shown on television, with clumsy and completely unrealistic dialogue that, whenever more than one person was in scene, made me cringe. This, along with the absurd plot convinced me that this show is not meant to attract fans of the old show, it's solely made for the \"new generation\", therefore the slack in the acting department. Naturally should be just fine if it reaches the target audience (8-14 y/o girls), but the media portrayed it differently, hence this comment.<br/><br/>It's a new generation of TV, with new ideals and values to teach, in a less obvious way than the old show did, but that was exactly the beauty of Beverly Hills 90210: they didn't wrap up the points in superfluous garbage, they just delivered it as it is. Beverly Hills 90210 dealt with real teenager problems, whereas most of the issues in 90210 seems like either just reiterations of old problems or are completely insignificant. The problem is that the lack of atmosphere and character depth makes issues like abortion, adultery, drug abuse and the plain old \"fitting in\" difficulties seem insignificant, when in reality they aren't. That's where this show, in my opinion, fails to deliver.<br/><br/>Now, on to the only positive thing that can possibly be said about this travesty: the references to Beverly Hills 90210. These references are not as vague as one could have feared, and it's given me about the only pleasant experience from watching the show.<br/><br/>If you have seen the original Beverly Hills 90210, I strongly recommend that you avoid this show.

But take a closer look and you'll see that \"Matlock\" has a look and flavor all its own. Part of the reason may be the time difference between the two shows-\"Mason\" being in the 60's, \"Matlock\", the 80's and 90's- but there are several others. In \"Matlock\", there's a little bit more of mystery solving in the spirit of \"Murder, She Wrote\" and \"Diagnosis Murder\" that gives the show a great deal of suspense. It also helps to throw in a little bit of humor here and there. But the real reason may come down to the late, great Andy Griffith. Mr. Griffith was able to take a character that could have been just another Perry Mason and make it all his own. Ben Matlock has a temper (which gets him the judges' wrath more than once), wears cheap suits despite his high fees, and loves hot dogs.

So let's forget all we know about the long run of this series and just talk about its premiere season. <br/><br/>Years after his run as Sheriff Andy Taylor, Andy Griffith finally got another regular job. This time he is playing Ben Matlock, an Atlanta lawyer who talks like Sheriff Andy. It's a comfortable role in a tried and true format; a mix of \"Perry Mason\" and \"Columbo\". \"Columbo\" veteran Dean Hargrove dreamed up the series and shared executive producer duties with Fred Silverman. <br/><br/>The focus is on the title character and Griffith is great fun to watch. He charms and sweet talks his way through each case, getting everyone to let down their guard because they underestimate this good old boy as much as they did the seemingly scatterbrained \"Columbo\". Both series revolved around the main character's ability discern something incriminating in seemingly innocent little things and to pick up on a guilty party's casual slip of the tongue. <br/><br/>In the \"Perry Mason\" tradition Matlock is not bound by the conventional rules of evidence or procedural requirements once he gets into a courtroom. He can say anything and introduce any sort of evidence simply by reassuring the judge that his line or questioning will eventually become relevant. Be prepared for the obligatory breakdowns and confessions on the witness stand. The prosecutors can only shake their heads and bluster helplessly in the face of Matlock's cunning strategy. <br/><br/>Matlock is assisted by the show's version of Perry Mason's Paul and Della. In season one these are his daughter and partner Charlene Matlock (Lori Lethin in the pilot-Linda Purl in the regular episodes) and his investigator Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday). His junior partner Michele Thomas (Nancy Stafford) would not join the team as a regular until the nest season and it wasn't until 1988 that Don Knotts reprises his Barney role as Ben's neighbor Les \"Ace\" Calhoun. <br/><br/>Season One's episodes #6 and #7 (a two part story titled \"The Don\") featured William Conrad as District Attorney James \"Fatman\" McShane. The next year the producers took this character, changed his name slightly to Jason Lochinvar 'Fatman' McCabe, and with Conrad created the long-running series \"Jake and the Fatman\".

It is frequently (and favorably) compared to \"Perry Mason\", the archetypal criminal drama that sets the gold standard for courtroom television to this day.  It's remarkable that the two shows are mentioned in the same breath.<br/><br/>Griffith is Ben Matlock, a Harvard graduate who, we are told in the early years, never takes a case for less than $250,000.  Earth to writers: criminal defendants do not have $250,000.  Like Mason, Matlock's office sees a stream of innocent people charged with murder.  Like Mason, Matlock winds up getting most of them acquitted.<br/><br/>And there, the similarities end.  Mason, the creation of detective story writer Erle Stanley Gardner, had an abiding respect for the courts, the police, and the rule of law (more so in the series than the novels that preceded them).  Everyone on the Perry Mason show was smart; Mason was just smarter.  In contrast, Matlock is perhaps the least dumb character on his show.  One mystery involved a murder with a candlestick that was found in Matlock's client's house, wrapped in a newspaper.  While Matlock was cross-examining the real killer, he discovers that the date on the newspaper was one day after his client was in jail.  This is astonishing: no one on the police force or the district attorney's office has noticed that their most damning evidence provides the defendant with an iron-clad alibi?  And Matlock, unlike Mason, cares little for the rules of evidence.  Almost every show, when the prosecutor makes an objection based on hearsay or speculation, Matlock screams to the judge that his question is \"absolutely vital to his case\" and the judge lets it in.  When I was in law school, we referred to this as the \"Matlock rule\".  He passes photographs to the jury while the judge is considering whether they are admissible, and gives long soliloquies about surprise witnesses who are \"prepared to testify\", all while the prosecutor sits mute.<br/><br/>You've guessed by now that I'm an attorney.  I don't mind suspending disbelief to enjoy a television series (surely Perry Mason's nemesis Hamilton Burger would not have been a district attorney for a decade if he could never indict the real killer).  But there's a difference between suspending disbelief and suspending intelligence.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "14 out of 29 found this helpful.", "date": "23 July 2003"}, {"title": " Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, it's Ben Matlock, legal juggernaut!", "content": "Putting into words how incredible Ben Matlock is will be very difficult but I will try!<br/><br/>For starters, his skills as a lawyer are the best, bar none, and no matter how bleak the situation looks for his client or how incriminating the evidence is on the person he's defending, Matlock always manages to win the day. Whenever he's cross examining witnesses, he manages to tie them in knots and it's always just a matter of time before they crack under Matlock's relentless questioning pressure. As far as lawyers go, Matlock is a goliath, a titan, a truly unstoppable force. *SPOILER* Even when he is drugged by a bunch of criminals and is left, barely lucid, to stumble through the middle of an extremely busy highway, hundreds of cars swerve out of the way in fear of being damaged beyond repair by Matlock's power.<br/><br/>However, Matlock's skills go far beyond his day job of a $100,000-per-case lawyer. His gun-toting prowess with a firearm is exceptional, as is his ability to wield a sword or kendo stick. If you squint, you could easily mistake Ben Matlock for Neo out of The Matrix films. Matlock is also a Michelin star chef and he makes no apologies for this fact by spending 40-50% of each episode stuffing his face with hotdogs, Monte Christo sandwiches and anything else into which he can stick a fork. In addition, Matlock is not only extremely handy around the house as he is able to carry out roof repairs, he is also an exceptional baseball pitcher in his spare time. To cut a long story short, if you are in need of the world's greatest lawyer but also require the services of a bodyguard, chef, sportsman and DIY person, Matlock is your man.<br/><br/>When defending his clients and searching for the truth, Matlock is helped along the way by a medley of wonderful assistants. Firstly, whenever Matlock needs to take a break from fist fighting, the duty of dishing out 'knuckle sandwiches' fall upon Conrad McMasters. Conrad's day job is as Matlock's private investigator and his ability to carry out this function has earned him the name, 'The Chameleon' for the way he can effortlessly blend into any role. *SPOILER* One week he'd be a bartender with mixology skills worthy of the International Bartenders Association, the next he'd be performing in adult themed movies, all in the line of duty. Conrad was also ice cool, circa minus 273 degrees Celsius cool, that he is only matched on the coolness scale by Kojak. For all you petrol heads out there, throughout the show Conrad also drives 11 different Ford Mustangs (models range from 1965 to 1994) so try to spot them all if you can. As you can imagine, Conrad's sublime choice of vehicles makes him a 'one' (so to speak) with the ladies, which itself is a recurring theme throughout the entire show, often resulting in a number of comical escapades.<br/><br/>Next up in Matlock's arsenal of crime fighting were his two gorgeous female assistants. First was Michelle Thomas, Matlock's partner for a few seasons, who was then followed by Leanne MacIntyre; a lawyer and Matlock's daughter. Just a flash of either's eyelashes or a smile from their pouty lips is usually enough to make any witness crack under the heat when they're being cross-examined. These small but significant facial actions by Matlock's sultry sirens are enough to get one's heart racing to such an extent that the show should really come with a health warning, aimed at the show's predominantly elderly and retired viewer demographic.<br/><br/>How do I sum up Matlock? Well, he has the demeanour and dress sense of James Bond, the physical dexterity and mental determination of Jason Bourne and quick wit and phenomenal intellect of Richard Feynman. Matlock blows all other courtroom dramas into the middle of next week with a realism that you could only seek to replicate in a genuine courtroom. For any budding lawyers out there, I advise you watch Matlock to see how to get the job done inside the courtroom, and out! For everyone else, Matlock makes compelling viewing as it has a bit of something for everyone: Action, drama, thrills, spills, sex appeal, comedy and mystery. Often more like a psychological thriller than a courtroom drama, I regularly felt that Matlock was more comparable to a Christopher Nolan film than the Perry Mason show, to which Matlock is usually compared.

Within a matter of seconds, security guards arrive at the murder scene to apprehend the speechless suspect. If a pistol were used and the perpetrator takes it along, this doesn't matter to the guards that the suspect hasn't one on hand.<br/><br/>5. The authorities (law enforcement, prosecutors and judges) are unable to grasp the notion that this suspect has been framed. No, they have an airtight case, by overlooking evidence and clues, such as time of death and those sorts of articles which the perpetrator has left behind.<br/><br/>6. Neither the authorities nor the jury nor anyone in Matlock's office fathom that this type of frame-up has ever happened before. No, they have an airtight case, and only high-priced defender Ben Matlock with his team of investigators would be able to locate the missing clue.<br/><br/>7. Once Matlock calls his last witness to the stand, the case is pretty well wrapped up, causing the prosecutor to request a dismissal of charges, which the judge and jury invariably welcome -- unless it was one of the judges who did it, which sometimes happens.<br/><br/>Variations of this formula and diversions from it often provide welcome fodder for the story of Ben Matlock and company. Along the way, the sometimes Assistant District Attorney Julie Marsh realizes that Ben may be right about a thing or two, this leading to a romantic rivalry between them.<br/><br/>A time or two, Julie rises to the occasion of defending the innocent, a hallmark of the Matlock team, which includes at different times his younger daughter, Charlene Matlock; his assistant attorney, Michele Thomas; his elder daughter, Leane McIntyre; his investigators, Tyler Hudson, Conrad McMasters and Cliff Lewis, as well as his friends and neighbors Les Calhoun and Billy Lewis.<br/><br/>If Matlock and his defense team would ever lose a case, the episode is only beginning, as a closer investigation would reveal enough evidence to call for a retrial or something along these lines.<br/><br/>\"Matlock\" is at its best with sensitive acting, caring for just treatment for the innocent, especially by Andy Griffith, Linda Purl, Kene Holliday, Nancy Stafford and Clarence Gilyard Jr. Later seasons tend to overlook some of its earlier sensitivity in favor of the strong-willed emotions of its ultimate cast, thereby losing some of its vision.<br/><br/>Overall, \"Matlock\" provides for an interesting episode from its catchy opening theme to its closing credits.

Both shows are about a famous lawyer who defends clients on charges of murder and comes up with the real killer, and that's about all the two share in common. \"Perry Mason\" is all about good plot: within an hour, the viewer's intelligence is challenged time and time again as Mason must find the real killer and turn up the proof as to who really did it. The show ran nine years as did \"Matlock\", but the manner in which the episodes were written was different as there was never a dull moment. The viewer was kept guessing as to who really committed the crime, and there were so many plot threads and plot twists in each episode you could never really be sure who the culprit was until the end.<br/><br/>Compare the above description to this much more modern series, which centers around lawyer Ben Matlock, played by the known television actor Andy Griffith (in much later years). In \"Matlock\", there is next to no plot at all. No real story to tell, just the whole 'someone gets killed - Matlock investigates the crime - killer uncovered' routine. And both are an hour long, so why are the plots so skimpy here compared to the much-loved older series? Simple answer: this show is all about character rather than story. That's not to say \"Perry Mason\" had one-dimensional characters either - Mason was definitely a more serious lawyer, but when the show could spare time, there were plenty of good character moments sprinkled in that gave the leading cast plenty of good chemistry. \"Matlock\" simply doesn't do much. Seen two episodes so far (sometimes I'll catch this show in the morning and miss Perry for the heck of it) and the content is very basic, no suspense, no big plot twists, just humor and filler scenes. That's it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, just because it doesn't live up to the ingeniousness of \"Perry Mason\" doesn't mean it has no merits at all. Next to no story yes, but at least the character of Ben Matlock remains fairly lovable. Not the brilliant, headstrong Perry, but a genuinely more original character with a humorous side and that old-man air about him. This is probably the most I can say about characters in the show, as I haven't seen enough of Michelle Thomas and Conrad McMasters to really judge how three-dimensional they are (although what I've seen is certainly nothing special). The house-keeper is also quite comical and provides a few nice laughs.<br/><br/>So, to wrap it up, one really has to decide what they're looking for. Do you want an intelligent, masterfully written, and outstandingly acted whodunit (Mason) or a comical and purely entertaining show with only the faintest of plots to support character development (Matlock)? If I had to pick one, I'd probably say the former because that show has its share of share of both, even while the plot does outweigh the character. There is a time and a place for this one to be sure, and it does remain decent to watch overall, but because it is not nearly as well-written and shows a lack of respect for the audiences' intelligence, it is generally not as good as its predecessor.", "rating": 7, "helpful": "1 out of 1 found this helpful.", "date": "20 July 2020"}, {"title": " Was he really a stupid permanent latrine orderly?", "content": "Ages back Andy Griffith was famous for doing his side-splitting monologues. and he made a few movies such as \"The Second Time Around,\" \" Onionhead,\" \"A Face in the Crowd\" and the unforgettable \"No Time for Sergeants\"; in the latter he was a Permanent Latrine Orderly, a classification which did not exist but was given him by his sergeant who couldn't stand him, but Will Stockdale (Griffith) thought it was a high-ranking classification in the Air Force.\nBut here, in \"Matlock\" he was a serious lawyer in Atlanta who was among the top in the whole U.S.A., though he is as homespun as Sheriff Andy Taylor.

In Britain and America the series is known by an English title as THE BUREAU. This is a review of all three seasons. I cannot think of any spy film or spy series which has approached this one in quality. It is simply the best. As everyone seems to know by now, American spy films and spy series are often funded by secret slush funds of the CIA, as PR efforts to make their spies look glamorous and patriotic, rather than sleazy and dubious. Who could fail to admire and love all CIA agents after being dazzled by the cute charm of the delightful Piper Perabo in the series COVERT AFFAIRS (2010-2014)? If they are all like that, as we are meant to believe, well then how do we get her phone number? She is irresistible. And when do we join up so that we can have the chance of being 'operatives' beside her? Although this French series appears to have had assistance from the French CIA known as DGSE (pronounced 'daygaysuh'), if only in being told how IMSI devices work, and other such intriguing technicalities, this series is certainly no propaganda fantasy to make people want to join. It has more than just a down side, it has a deeply tragic side. This series attempts to get to the bottom of just how great a cost betrayal, manipulation, and deceit have for its daily practitioners. They may be saving the world from ISIS, but they are not saving themselves or their loved ones. Nor are their own characters going uncorrupted. The acting is spectacularly good. This series is as good about spies as SPIRAL (aka ENGRENAGES, 2005-2016, see my review under 'E' for its French title) was about the Paris police. (And by the way, a surprise sixth season is belatedly appearing later this year for SPIRAL.) I have rarely seen any TV series with such impeccably perfect casting as this one. And all the roles are played with genuine depth. There are no cardboard characters in this series, they are all so well-rounded that we feel embarrassed sometimes at the intimacy with which we come to know them. The boldest, and one might say most outrageous, bit of casting for this series is Sara Giraudeau as the character Marian Loiseau. It could have failed disastrously, but in fact it works brilliantly. She is an apparently shy, lisping, wimpish, and babyish girl with a little girl's tentative voice who seems not only harmless but hopeless. But in fact she is a ruthless 'warrior' for DGSE (to use Henri Duflot's word for her). As courageous as she is, however, she does eventually suffer from terrible panic attacks while on missions. She is one of the most unexpected and spellbinding creatures in this amazing zoo of spies. Another bit of unexpectedly successful casting is the plump black agent of very few words, Irina Muluile, who plays the character known as 'the Mule' (strange coincidence with her real surname). She conveys more by saying nothing than many actors do by talking too much. The lead actor of the series is Mathieu Kassovitz, as the agent 'Malotru' (aka Paul Lefebvre and Guillaume Debailly). He delivers a magnificent performance, of enormous range. He has to play a character who is in so many wildly varying situations, including being an ISIS hostage, that he has to be ten people, not only one. This kind of challenging lead role is any actor's dream, and Kassovitz fulfils that dream admirably. The other lead actor is Jean-Pierre Darrousin, who plays Henri Duflot, the head of the operations section. He is an older man, nearing retirement, who is calm, quiet, concerned, conscientious, and thoroughly competent. He is like a father to his team. One of the lead actresses is Florence Loiret Caille ('quail'), who is subtle and superb as the deputy head. She says bitterly near the end: 'I never cry. My parents called me \"the stone\".' Whether she ends up finally crying or not I leave to the viewer's suspense. Zineb Triki (of whom there is almost no information on IMDb) is another female lead, playing the character Nadia El Mansour. She is astonishingly dignified and with a commanding presence, huge soft eyes, and limitless sadness in her gaze. She plays a Syrian, but the actress herself is of Moroccan origin, having left that country in 1995 at the age of 15, studied in France and Canada, obtained a degree in political science, became a journalist, and is now an actress. One could go on and on listing all these people who did so well, but that would involve naming the entire extensive cast of 30 episodes. All of this is the product of the 'creator', Eric Rochant. He originated the series and wrote the scripts, and he then produced and directed them all. (Clearly, he never sleeps but works 48 hours day.) It is all nothing short of a work of genius. Previously he wrote and directed the film M\u00d6BIUS (2013). It is clear, then, that Eric Rochant is not merely a paragon but a marvel. It would be impossible to give even a cursory description of the many intense and parallel adventures of the characters in this series, as the plots are so complex and interweaving, and the stories so dramatic and powerful that they sweep one away. It is all profound, with both expressed and suppressed emotions, and thoughtful reflection amidst all the non-stop and heart-stopping action. The suspense and intensity never let up for one second for the entire series, and by the time it is over, one has worn out all the edges of all the seats, and one is a frazzled emotional wreck.

However, this is the first time I feel I need to urge everyone reading this to watch this TV series.<br/><br/>There are loads and loads of TV series about different fields of the intelligence sector, but few of them succeed in being as smart as the agencies they are trying to depict. With Le Bureau des L\u00e9gendes, it's the other way around. As a viewer, you are constantly being left to guess what everyone's next move is, knowing only little or nothing at all, just like intelligence work in real life. <br/><br/>Agents constantly have to think at least three or four steps ahead and even if you succeed with your first move, there is no guarantee at all that the remaining moves will be successful. As all those actions are being taken on risk assumptions, it makes the series a gripping ride and makes you constantly feel like you're on the edge. The writers, actors and camera men pull this off brilliantly, much thanks to the outstanding writing which makes every single TV episode feel like a miniature movie. If you do some research about how the show was made, you'll notice that part of the production got never before authorized access (even though limited) to real life DGSE, which really shows off.<br/><br/>However, it's not only down to the writing, but to the acting and filming as well. The casting crew has done an amazing job. You can feel the chemistry between the actors and especially from Mathieu Kassovitz and Jean-Pierre Darroussin who bless us with amazing performances.<br/><br/>I don't want to make this review into a TL;DR piece, so I will shortly summarize by saying that Le Bureau des L\u00e9gendes is one of the most intelligent, tense, gripping and brilliantly acted espionage dramas I've ever seen.

The personal side is also treated with some detachment that allows the viewer to be more of an observer than an advocate, although given the tragedies that befall them one cannot but grieve with them.\nThere is an underlying theme to this story I think. The creators show in detail what the human cost is of working in the intelligence profession and the personal struggle, brutality, and courage it takes to do this kind of work. It is by definition a dirty business. In many ways, the series reminds me of another favorite TV series of mine, The Wire, which takes a similar approach, and applies it to undercover police work.\nThe morale here seems to be that as much as intelligence work relies on cold calculations of national interest in a hierarchical, bureaucratized environment, it is still held hostage by the very human emotions of its actors. Compassion and romance creep into carefully conceived operations as the very stressed out pawns in the intelligence machinery do their best to reconcile the demand of their jobs with their conscience and hormones.\nOne area that I think could have been given more coverage is the motivation of these people, although it is hinted at and ranges from patriotic duty to a taste for danger.\nAlso noteworthy is the fact that although enemies abound, there is no overt vilification of any one person, nation, or ideology, making this series a welcome departure from the simplistic hurrah patriotism that usual infuses works about the military and intelligence.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "11 out of 12 found this helpful.", "date": "25 May 2020"}, {"title": " Tres magnific", "content": "Simply the best tv series I have ever watched.

The fact is, any given hour-long episode of \"Kung Fu\" probably contained about 45 to 60 seconds of actual action--if not less.  The fact is, David Carradine was as good a leading man as any TV drama has ever had.  <br/><br/>And the fact is, far from being a cheap exploitation of martial arts and Eastern philosophy, \"Kung Fu\" was created and written in true reverance to those concepts.  Meticulous research was conducted, and the lessons that Masters Kan and Po (wonderfully rendered by Philip Ahn and Keye Luke, respectively) teach Caine, and that Caine in turn teaches those he encounters, are routed in authentic Shaolin philosophy.<br/><br/>Nor was the show cheesily made.  It involved lush cinematography by televisual standards and innovative use of devices such as forced perspective and slow motion (this was the first show or movie to use different gradations of speed within a single take--the shot would move at normal speed until Caine made contact with an elbow or a fist, and then suddenly switch to delicate, poetic slow motion).<br/><br/>Caine was a true archetype of television--a complete reversal of basically every American screen hero that went before.  Not just peaceful--but passive and serene.  As Caine described it--\"Kung Fu\" was an \"anti-revenge television show\"--an amazing concept when you think about it.<br/><br/>Remember, the American public was not even acquainted with the phrase \"kung fu\" before this show.  Zen Buddhism was gaining popularity in the late '60s and early '70s, but no one had ever heard of Shaolin monks.

When one reads the Tao te Ching it is hard to relate much of it to contemporary life, but Kung Fu was like a sunday school lession for Taoists. I loved it and never missed one.

The programme was, in truth, as much a celebration of the philosophy of keeping peace as the practice and teaching of martial arts. Plots were simple, maybe predictable, but they unfolded with as slowly choreographed a ritual as the teachings themselves.<br/><br/>A shaven-headed David Carradine was ideally suited to the role of mixed race Kwai Chang Kane, graduate monk of the Shao-Lin priesthood and fugitive murderer exiled in the wild-west USA. He brought an entirely-believable persona to his character whilst, in turn, acting as ambassador to the art.

The quality acting, both on the part of David Carridine and just about every character he encountered as he wandered the United States western frontier, pleasantly surprised me. I especially enjoyed the performances of the rough-edged, uncultured types who inevitably lived to regret their decision to test Caine. Without behaving simply as stereotypical outlaws these actors did a great job of making the threats or insolent comments that ultimately resulted in their humiliation at the hands (and feet) of a man that did not seem physically or psychologically capable of harming anyone.<br/><br/>I think that many viewers saw in Caine a person they admired and would like to emulate. He required very little in terms of material possessions to carry on, didn't prejudge those he met (though they sometimes prejudged him), maintained a profound spiritual life yet confronted daunting situations realistically, and possessed superior survival skills in an often less than civilized world. At a time when some people in the U.S. were seeking greater spiritual fulfillment in Eastern philosophies and religions, Caine was serving as something of a role model.<br/><br/>If someone were to recreate the Kung Fu series, viewers would probably expect, if not demand, two changes: 1. A man of Southeast Asian ethnicity would have to play the part of Caine, not a Caucasian, even if, as was the case with David Carridine, his features suggest some Chinese ancestry. 2. The man playing Caine should also possess a more athletic physique. His unassuming and unimposing interpersonal style should continue, but if a threatening situation requires that he employ his expertise in martial arts, he ought to have a build that jibes a little more with his talent.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "3 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "24 May 2011"}]}, "/title/tt8295472/": {"title": "The Order", "reviews": [{"title": " The crazier it got the better it became", "content": "Not gonna lie.

Don't overthink it.<br/><br/>Too many reviews are criticizing needless things, like; \"Where's the abandoned cars in traffic?\", \"Where are all the bodies?\", etc...But those things are completely unnecessary in terms of buying the show's premise. I think they did the right thing to not edge themselves out with grim imagery. It doesn't need a drama element.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be funny, and for that reason they had to make the decision (and rightfully so) to dismiss the typical and obvious aspects of a last-man-on-earth scenario and just go straight for the comedy. If they didn't, none of the humor would land as quickly and easily as it does.<br/><br/>Personally, I think this is one of the funniest and most interesting shows I've seen in a long time. It's rare to have a comedy nowadays that's so quotable and full of brilliant one liners, and because the characters and the situations they find themselves in are so strange, what comes from it is an incredibly original and fresh show with the potential for many future seasons of hilarious moments.<br/><br/>So if you're at all reading this review and are comparing it to other reviews to see if this show is worth watching, I suggest you just watch this show and see for yourself.

If this show had main characters that were typical of the modern day political right and spewed political stuff from their view, I would be just as turned off as I am by this show having main characters that are of the modern day left spewing their political stuff. I am not watching MSNBC or FOX NEWS...I am trying to watch a show about, you know, aliens from freaking outer space.<br/><br/>In the first episode, we get to hear about ICE, checkpoints, racial profiling, the wall (with a snuff toward Trump), illegal immigrants, police that \"didn't sign up to tear families apart\", and then it tops off with some gay military guy and a gay alien (which is not wrong imo, but it is more political messaging). Its like they specifically sat down and said how can we check off all the left talking points...and then did exactly that. Again, if they sat down and checked off the right talking points, it would be just as crappy. I imagine episode two is going to bash religion, promote UBI, some stuff about abortion, and tell us trans men/women should be able to compete with the new genders in the olympics. How stupid to shove this into the story when the story is about Roswell and aliens.<br/><br/>To be clear, none of those things I just listed are issues to me in real life, they are however political issues that have no bearing on how this story is told. This means its intentionally being used as a method of political messaging...or you guessed it, propaganda. Its obvious and its a horrible direction to take the show as you alienate people that just want to watch a good show. There is nothing wrong with being gay, denouncing the wall, advocating for immigration reform, or disliking government agencies. There is something wrong with specifically using those as devices to attempt to sway perceptions of those that mean to watch a show not about those topics and its clearly evident this is being done.<br/><br/>Having said all that.

This isn't much of an issue until she finds out about Max and his siblings being aliens. Then Liz' behavior towards them becomes suspicious, fearful, and borderline hateful. She even starts working on a way to suppress them and their powers. For a woman who worries about her own family facing prejudice for being illegal aliens, she sure is quick to subject others to similar fears and hatred.", "rating": 2, "helpful": "164 out of 249 found this helpful.", "date": "10 March 2019"}, {"title": " PC BS", "content": "Well, I really liked the original show but this one seriously needs to go on the cutting room floor.

Look no further than where the disease started (the king is patient 0) and the way that the society tries to deal with their dead; seperating the bodies of the rich from those of the poor, giving proper burial to the rich whereas burning the poor. Instead of dealing with the actual situation they choose to focus on formalities even when those can endanger the living. Not only that but the Confucian principles of not harming the body(burning,cutting etc) are only to be applied to the rich. The society is so much plagued with an archaic system of principles and conduct that they fail to see it for what it actually is, the disease itself, in that sense not only the zombies are infected but everyone.<br/><br/>Btw no guns and slow zombies in this one like the Walking Dead.

You have 2 charismatic leads plus a really good ensemble. If you ever enjoyed Castle for the secondary characters such as the relationship between father and daughter or the two detectives working with Beckett, you should enjoy this show. <br/><br/>The stories are simple but also make sense for the type of work that is supposed to be represented. This is not a spy story or a cop show although there are interactions with police and they do resolve crimes. It is more about family and interpersonal relationships.<br/><br/>Also, if you live in Canada, it is really great seeing a show with so many recognizable sites and images. Normally, shows shot in Canada will usually use scenery that can easily be seen as American so as to aid in either international sales in the case of purely Canadian productions, or are being exclusively produced for an American network. This show does not hide that it is filmed here and I applaud the producers for this. <br/><br/>Based on the episodes that I have seen so far, I hope that Private Eyes comes back for a second season.

The angle of this show is to give us the \"Adam and Eve\" in the jungle version.<br/><br/>I only saw the first episode - but this is what it's like:<br/><br/>The contestants are selected based on their \"survival skills\" and go through a \"psychological\" assessment before they enter the jungle. A man and a woman are selected and meet, for the first time, at their destination and in the nude. Together, and armed with only two essential tools, they have 21 days to get from one location to another. To do this, they must make their way through dense jungle filled with poisonous snakes and other creatures that bite and scratch. This is guaranteed to make \"being naked\" a real pain.<br/><br/>As far as nudity goes - not much is left to the imagination. Producers have blurred the absolute minimum. To be honest, it isn't much of a thrill to watch naked people, covered in mud and dirt, step on twigs. The contestants are also quick to fashion leafy coverings to make it easier to travel and deal with each other.<br/><br/>I'm not too sure about the veracity of the selection process either. In the episode that I watched, the man appeared to have some personal issues that made the woman a bit uncomfortable. I wouldn't walk through a parking lot with him - let alone traipse naked through the jungle. In spite of his \"expertise in survival\" and general manliness, he rapidly descends into a babbling lunatic incapable of caring for himself or holding up his end of this \"jungle trial by nudity.\"<br/><br/>The woman was a modest, easy going person. She didn't have any major hang-ups or issues and proved quite capable of getting herself through this ordeal. I felt bad for her. The man kept calling her \"kiddo\" for 21 days.

A similar snake bit one of the producers, which was very nasty and probably the most interesting part of the program. The couple were searching for food and the man happened upon the snake - bashed its head in and held its lifeless body up in honor of the producer. Then they cooked it and ate it. I get the eating part - but bashing it head in was cruel and didn't demonstrate his \"expertise\" in survival training at all. He looked like a crazy, naked man.

But I'm a skeptic, and when you watch a bunch of these in one sitting, certain patterns emerge. There's more to this show than meets the eye. In three of the episodes that I watched this weekend, someone conveniently finds an old metal pot, which is interesting because it doesn't make sense that a pot would just magically appear, like the holy grail, in the snake-infested muck of a Louisiana bayou, or in an alligator-infested river in Botswana? If you don't have access to potable water, you're not going to make it to 21 days and this is an expensive production. \"Look at that! A pot! I can't believe it!

(Lol, how odd that they NEVER each bring the same thing, like, \"Darn, I brought a fire starter too!! Now what are we going to do?\") And while it is fun to see the scary animals lurking in the bushes, you will never see a shot of a lion or hyena in the same frame as the people. Hyenas are opportunistic feeders who select the easiest and most attractive food. Are you telling me that these two naked and unarmed humans would not be a tasty snack? How dangerous are these places, for real? Is there actually a resort a few yards away that you can't see? I mean, really, would the producers spend all that money on one episode, only to leave the participants in their little shelters at night, with no protection, and go back to their cozy campsite, only to return in the morning to find that they'd been devoured by a lion? I don't think so.

This show \"Naked and afraid\" is supposed to be a reality show with an on-site camera crew documenting two people, a man and woman (who are unacquainted), as they attempt to survive three weeks in a remote part of the world without even the clothes on their backs.<br/><br/>The first episode takes place in a Costa Rican jungle.<br/><br/>Apart from one video camera each to help document their story, Kim and Shane are each issued one item of their choice to help with survival. She has a machete, and he has a flint-and- steel fire starter. So, it's not exactly Adam and Eve (and for that matter, there's no sex in this episode so forget about watching it if that's your primary interest).<br/><br/>The nudity becomes boring after the first minute or so. They are both outdoors types, physically well built and athletic, although at age 45 he's developing a bit of a spare tire (which is gone after 21 days of near starvation--gee, maybe I should sign up for an episode!). Clearly they are both comfortable in their skin and do not exhibit much inhibition. That said, Kim weaves some rudimentary loin cloths for them both early on, and she wears leaves over her breasts for much of the time, although they never do find a way to protect their feet.<br/><br/>I was surprised at how cold the jungle was for them. I have been to the rain forests of Costa Rica in September and it was quite hot, and people do go there at Christmas time to enjoy a nice warm surfing vacation. But, I suppose when you're hungry, unclothed, and being rained on every other day, you're going to get chilled at night.<br/><br/>I was also surprised at how difficult it was to get food. In a tropical jungle, you are literally surrounded by living creatures. It's such a rich ecology that I found it hard to believe there wasn't something edible within three feet of any given location. Shane admits early on that he's not a jungle person; he is not used to having a canopy of trees over his head. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, both he and Kim seem to know a lot about wildlife. It was cool to see him capture and decapitate that nasty snake--that really was a courageous act, given it is one of the most poisonous creatures in the world and one of its kind nearly killed the producer a few days earlier. I was waiting for them to down a howler monkey and feast on it for supper, but Shane put the kibosh on that idea, reporting that the animals were far stronger and more ferocious than the humans could imagine.<br/><br/>In many parts of Africa and Asia, creatures such as grasshoppers, beetles, grubs, ants, larvae, etc. are regularly dined upon. I suppose it's easier said than done, especially with no nets, skewers, or cooking vessels.<br/><br/>But it was distressing to watch them just sitting there, day after day, becoming weaker and more listless and even less able to forage for food. The turtle and the snake appear to have been their only meals during the entire three weeks, and for Kim at least, the turtle turned out to be a bit of a disaster.<br/><br/>The NY Post reports that Kim actually received some food and an IV for dehydration after her food poisoning scare, and Shane actually broke three toes on the fourth day (they didn't say what treatment he received, if any), and this was not related during the show, so I knock two stars off for dishonesty and non-disclosure.<br/><br/>Shane has some anger management issues, as Kim points out more than once. He had a pretty awful childhood and in fact I found myself sympathizing with him, although I did not agree with his annoyance at Kim. Kim, for her part, is charming and level headed and it's interesting at the end that she is the one with the energy and drive and the diplomacy to carry the day, insisting that they approach the pick-up spot hand-in-hand, as friends and not as the extremely drained and irritable co-conspirators that they had become. And I loved Kim's war paint that she put on at the end--very cool!<br/><br/>Despite the cheating, it was still fun to watch, somewhat agonizing at times as you empathize with these tough but increasingly desperate people struggling to get a foothold in a very unforgiving place.<br/><br/>EDIT: My review was entirely about the first episode.

Unfortunately the only thing that happens is the contestants getting hungry and cranky until they complete their 21 days and get to go home.<br/><br/>There is very little variety in the contestants. Every episode features a two person team consisting of a man and a woman. Generally the man is somewhere between 38-48 and is a survivalist or survival instructor of some sort, often with a military background. The women are usually a lot younger (mid-twenties to early thirties) and they are usually an endurance athlete, a runner or backpacker with a good deal of general outdoor knowledge. Anyway their credentials are meaningless because neither of them are competent at surviving and they just end up getting in each other's way. The men are always bossy in the way a middle-aged man who thinks he's in charge always is, and the woman is as defensive as you'd expect her to be for a 23-year-old being told what to do by a naked man in his 40s.<br/><br/>Eventually they learn to work together but ultimately accomplish very little. They build a rudimentary shelter and find water but never secure food, so they just wait out the clock while slowly starving. The men usually have a higher BMI at the beginning of the episode and naturally endure the lack of food better than the very thin endurance athletes the show usually picks for its female contestants. This all creates an awkward gender dynamic that unfairly portrays the women as being weaker because they have less body fat.<br/><br/>There are occasionally variations, such as contestants of the same age or with similar skill sets, and those are the most interesting episodes.

The balance between idealism and scheming is also really well done - most British and American movies and TV series portray all politicians as ruthless power-mongers, but generally politicians like to think they're doing the right thing, just like anyone else. The character are recognisable types - in particular, the far-right leader is clearly modelled on Mogens Glistrup, the entertaining, folksy and erratic founder of the current Progress Party.<br/><br/>The series is maybe a bit weaker on the big political issues, since it has to tackle something complex in an hour, and an issue like Afghanistan can't really be analysed in any depth in that time. The episode on a thinly-veiled Sudan with the smooth, corrupt Northern leader and the plausible Southern leader with some uncomfortable views is gripping but stereotyped.

Borgen, the latest offering in this slot is different though; it is a political drama set in a system quite different to that which I am used to so I was initially sceptical about how interesting it would be. Thankfully the dramatic elements didn't require an understanding of the Danish political system and the political elements weren't hard to follow even though no time was wasted explaining the system. The series opens with an election where the surprise winner is Birgitte Nyborg Christensen, potentially Denmark's first female Prime Minister. She doesn't have an outright majority though so must deal with the various other parties to form a coalition. She does this but her majority is slim so when anything goes wrong her government is in danger. The series doesn't just deal with the parliamentary aspects of politics; the media also plays a large part of the series. For the media side of the story we follow reporter and newsreader Katrine F\u00f8nsmark, who conveniently used to be in a relationship with the PM's spin doctor Kasper Juul. Once Birgitte is PM the series is fairly episodic with each episode dealing with a different problem; there are some ongoing background stories and occasionally something we thought was dealt with earlier on comes back to effect characters; although as the series progresses her work begins to affect her marriage.<br/><br/>Having watched the first series I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed it and look forward to the inevitable screening of further series. The stories are fairly engrossing and the main characters are all believable and interesting to watch; I was so engrossed that I forgot that I was watching a subtitled programme in a language I have no knowledge of. Sidse Babett Knudsen, Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen and Johan Philip Asb\u00e6k who play lead characters Birgitte, Katrine and Kasper put in great performances and are ably supported the cast of quality secondary characters.

Season Three will commence transmission on Danish Television on March 1, 2013, so we all have a long time to wait for the continued episodes. The first thing that needs to be said is that Season Two is far more powerful, intense, and dramatic than Season One in terms of the personal stories of the main characters. These become incredibly harrowing and tragic, so that this series continues to deepen and become more profound as it goes along. This series exceeds the brilliance and captivating character of both THE KILLING and MAD MEN (see my reviews), so that Danish TV drama seems to be reaching a pinnacle of such excellence one can barely conceive of anything higher than this. The performances, the direction, the ingenious, bold and confrontational scripts, the cinematography, the editing, the production values, are all so superb that criticism of them is impossible. The characters are all played with such force and fervour, such intimacy and conviction, that I fear Danish actors have surpassed the British, who until now were the best in the world. The most sensitive and wide-ranging performance is by the young Danish actor Pilou Asbaek, who plays the Prime Minister's 'spin doctor' (yes, the Danes use that English phrase). Asbaek's acting is a miracle of perfection. His range of moods, his expressiveness, his eyes, his face, his changes of voice, go far beyond anything ever imagined by Lee Strasberg, and could be described perhaps as 'hyper-Method'. Nearly at the same level of perfection as Asbaek are the stunning and brilliant performances of the two female leads, Sidse Knudsen as the Prime Minister and Birgitte Sorensen as Katrine the journalist. These three should all win International Oscars if there were any justice in the world and such awards existed. There is never one instant in the approximately 20 hours of this series when any of these three is anything other than mesmeric. They come alive as characters with such vivacity and conviction that one has to have a cold shower and calm down before facing the sad fact that one does not really know them and that they are really fictitious characters played by actors. One night my wife lay awake worrying about them, because of their personal problems. That is how it gets you! I don't believe I have ever seen a television series of this total intensity in my lifetime. What is so extraordinary is the well-rounded nature of the characters, who are seen from all sides and in all moods. This is as far from cardboard cutouts as it is possible to get on screen. The borderline between television and reality is obliterated by this magnificent series. The scripts are so clever that there is not a second's peace, one is swept along as by a raging torrent of events. The camera-work, with lots of travelling shots following frantic people as they move from one crisis to another like rabbits running from a farmer's gun, is electric. Many desperate political issues are faced head-on with the confrontational insistence which goes way beyond 'in your face' and reaches the level of 'seared into your brain'. Nothing and no one is spared. Politicians are killed, resign, are annihilated, commit suicide, are humiliated and their reputations obliterated with the rapidity and relentlessness of soldiers in the World War One trenches. In this series, politics is war to such an extent that one marvels that Denmark still exists and has not disappeared from the map of the world due to all that strife. If ever there were an advertisement for avoiding proportional representation at all costs, this series is it. This shows coalition politics from the inside with all its viciousness, betrayal, immoral compromises, back room horse-trading, duplicity, insane ambition, and ruthless destruction of people. No American or British series would have dared go this far. The Danes will seemingly stop at nothing to show a kind of hyper-reality on screen, and they have entered some kind of higher dimension of truth. This is not drama, this is war. You name a controversial political issue or international dilemma, and it is there. (For instance, there is a double episode dealing with the Sudan situation, which in the series is called North and South Karhuna.) The things which are said on screen about Greenland are astounding, and in Britain would surely have led to libel, abuse, or other legal actions for years to come. This is so no-holds-barred that the absence of any referee means everybody gets it in the eye. Sidse Knudsen rises above all this violent mel\u00e9e as a kind of lonely, triumphant goddess. As Prime Minister she portrays decency more convincingly than anyone since Gregory Peck. Her horribly narcissistic and loathsome husband, who abandons her out of wounded vanity, is one of the most hateful screen characters in years. He is played with despicable, self-pitying candour by Mikael Birkkjaer. Their teenage daughter, who goes to pieces mentally under the strain, is brilliantly played by the young actress Freja Riemann. The little son is touching and perfect, played with enormous, soulful eyes by child actor Emil Poulsen. Soren Malling, the police partner of Sophie Grabol in THE KILLING, brilliantly plays the TV-1 News editor. One of the most poignant performances is by Lars Knutzon as Bent Sejro, the Prime Minister's mentor. The revolting political villain Laugesen is played with such gusto by Peter Mygind that one wants to wring his neck. But the most watchable, delightful, naughty, impish, ruthless, pathetic, adorable, hateful, chameleon-like character of all is the compulsively magnetic and beautiful Birgitte Sorensen. 'Borgen' is the nickname of the Danish Parliament building (Christiansborg), just as Americans call Congress 'the Hill' and the British call Parliament 'Westminster'.

Surely, politics and real world problems occupy sometimes a too big stake with questions getting debated on at a speed one can not easily follow, but the characters remained likable, flesh and blood, and the screenplay do not let them down. Sidse Babett Knudsen's performance is impeccable as always and Brigitte's way towards inventing herself again in politics as well as in personal life provides enough fuel for the story. I can imagine that Danish viewers find some detail exaggerated or too shallow, the presented relations or roles too embellished compared to the reality and the style on some places preaching but I just live in a country where the quality of the politics and the media is extremely low, the people vested with high positions can hardly be revered and the decisions made on governmental level are too often arbitrary.

No easy chore, given the nature of coalition politics that she must navigate. It is set in Denmark, but the uneasy alliance is typical of minority Parliaments we have seen in Canada as well as the standoffs in the United States between Presidents and Congress. Denmark is a nation committed to democracy so the conflicts and characters ring familiar but the drama is every bit as evident as The West Wing or Madam Secretary. The language transmits well with the captioning of the wit and repartee that is a strong part of the script. The prime minister's aide is a political spin artist who creates the talking points for every controversial decision. In the meantime, he is caught up in a serious relationship with one of the nation's leading television journalists, a sub-plot that is also fraught with personal pitfalls and the need for objectivity. The relationship of the prime minister with her family is very moving and the viewer realizes the sacrifices that are part of being a public figure and how family and public life are on a constant collision course. She manages her personal life very well, just as she manages the political fallout from being in a position of power. The prime minister has amazing wisdom and grace but one can imagine how gruelling the life can be. Her husband is as committed to her and her politics as any man could be. It takes a toll however. For example, having to sell his shares in a wind energy investment that is about to take a big jump on news that the government is on the verge of a major breakthrough.

The theme fascinates me, since I am a political (unpaid, of course apart from the personal satisfaction) activist myself. It is easy to empathize with the main characters, since the political system and culture in Denmark and the Netherlands (my native land, located in the northwest of Europe, in the immediate vicinity of Denmark) are comparable. Be aware that the cultural aspect may pose some problems for viewers, who are used to the presidential system. The role of a prime minister in a coalition is significantly different from the role of for instance the American or French president. Borgen is made for the patient ones. With ten episodes of 55 minutes each you need to invest a full nine hours of your precious own time. Personally I enjoyed every minute of it. The reason is twofold. First, although to many people politics may seem to be boring, it is actually a world of fantasy and suspense. Beneath the efforts of the politicians to look just like common people lie professional skills of bonding, representing, managing, and yes especially competing. Outsiders who enter this world, even when they come from a business environment, are often amazed at the shallowness of the personal relations. It is a battle - with the annotation that the winners and losers are not really persons, but cliques. The leader of each clique is powerful, but also the instrument of his clique. He or she needs to be exceptionally dedicated and focused. In the end the leader considers himself (not the program of his clique) to be the solution to the political questions. This is the topic of the series Borgen: the transformation of a fairly warmhearted woman (Nyborg) into a hard-hearted prime minister. Power is addicting. During the process she even accepts the disintegration of her own family. It makes her mad, but her personality has become too self-centered to leave room for doubt. The second reason for my appreciation of Borgen is the high credibility of all of the events in the script. Each of the ten episodes has its own little tale of an urgent political affair. I consider myself to have a good insight into political life, and can find essentially no faults in each of the tales. They concentrate on the management of the affairs by the cabinet, in particular by the prime minister. Therefore much attention is paid to the contacts with the media. To sum up just a few of the affairs: a bugging scandal (sounds familiar to you?), blackmail by a foreign dictator, allegations of corruption, conflicts with the business community, violation of human rights (...?). This series is truly above-average. Since I find critique always more interesting than praise, here are some comments.

While the drama is sometimes is exaggerated compared to that of real-life (which is to be expected) the stories are however quite believable as many of the themes are inspired by true stories and problems Denmark's politicians have faced during the last 20 years.

If one can survive the pretentious opening titles and the dumb-wise Machiavellian quotes, the sopping drama from time to time, especially in the first run, second season we offer a rich and engaging story which must be applaud for its eminent storytelling and drama which is both entertaining and relevant for anyone interested in politics.

First (and major) one follows Birgitte Nyborg, a small-party leader who is suddenly most likely to become Denmarks new Prime Minister despite never running for the position. Second plot line follows young ambitious reporter, Katrine F\u00f8nsmark and her struggle to balance ambition with ethics when her ex-boyfriend (who may or may not still be in love with her) is declared PMs new chief of communication.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first 4 or 5 episodes and if I were to review them alone, they'd get an 8 from me. Unfortunately, somewhere in mid 1st season plot lines become trivial and predictable and at the same time, well-rounded characters are pushed into boring stereotypes.<br/><br/>The series regain some of its nerve in 2nd season when focus is more on the life of a PM than parliament intrigues, but making a sub plot more interesting doesn't save the main plot from drowning.<br/><br/>To me, this started out great, lost its breath, regained it a little and then remained mediocre for the rest of the episodes. To those of you expecting something as gripping and entertaining as Forbrydelsen, Borgen is likely to disappoint despite great acting performances especially by Sidse Babett Knudsen (as Birgitte Nymark), Pilou Asb\u00e6k (as Kasper Juul) and Peter Mygind (as Laugesen).<br/><br/>And, bonus info to all of you wondering if it is indeed possible that the leader of a small party could suddenly find herself in the situation that Birgitte Nyborg does: Short answer is yes.

Just as American TV in the 60s and 70s was shown worldwide, spreading the message about how wonderful life is in the USA, so these new TV series from abroad are showing Americans what life is like 'overseas.'<br/><br/>Borgen is a political TV series about Denmark - and I bet you don't know a lot about Hamlet's birthplace, so let's start there. Denmark is that piece of Europe that juts out above Germany- on the Jutland peninsula (Greenland is part of Denmark but has Home Rule, i.e., they govern themselves for the most part). Along with Norway and Sweden, it is a part of the Nordic welfare states. About 5.8 million people live in this constitutional monarchy (just like England, it has a in-name-only monarch, a Prime Minister and a Parliament). It is one of the wealthiest countries in the world with the average person making more money than the average American. It has some of the highest tax rates in the world, but the Danes live in a country with free healthcare, free tuition for all schools, including college and post-graduate, a social welfare system that works and one of the happiest places in the world to live - when asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how happy they are, most Danes respond 11.<br/><br/>Borgen literally means 'castle' but in Denmark it is the stand-in name for the government, like White House is for the US Executive branch. Birgitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen), leader of the Moderate Party, is a politician on the way up. It is no spoiler alert to tell you that she becomes the PM and the series follows both her public and personal lives. Her husband, Phillip Christensen (Mikael Birkkj\u00e6r), and two children, Laura (Freja Riemann) and Magnus (Emil Poulsen) pay a price for their wife/mother's political career - and the price isn't just being in the limelight. This is a real drama about how a political career can destroy a family, especially if the politician is a woman.<br/><br/>The other lead characters are Kasper Jull (Pilou Asb\u00e6k) and Katrine F\u00f8nsmark (Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen) journalists and sometime media consultants for the politicians in the series. Then, there is a world of characters who make up the political, media and societal leaders of Denmark. It is a fascinating tapestry of double-crosses, power grabs, idealistic hopes and realistic decisions.<br/><br/>The ensemble acting is something that you expect to see only in a BBC production - incredible. There are moments so gripping that they are difficult to watch - like a scene in season 2 when Brigitte is forced to come to grips with the fact that her teenage daughter is having serious mental problems, likely caused by Brigitte's absences due to her political career. Many times in this series characters have to make a choice between personal happiness and ambition. In a country where happiness is the norm, it is a real dilemma.<br/><br/>It is a joy to watch a series about the leader of a major democracy who is not enthroned in office, with special salutations (Mr. President) and a mansion in which to live and work. The PM is just Brigitte to all and she goes home every night to a normal looking house. But, her job is slowly corroding her personal life and while she is becoming a better PM, she is becoming less and less the optimistic, loving woman who dreamed of changing Denmark for the better.<br/><br/>There are 3 seasons of 10 episodes each to watch on Netflix - and more to come:<br/><br/>\"Ten years ago, Borgen helped redefine the global television landscape, showing that great stories can come from anywhere and be loved everywhere,\" said Lina Brouneus, director co-production and acquisition at Netflix. \"We are immensely proud to partner with DR and the whole creative team to bring this worldwide phenomenon back and to give Borgen's legion of fans the chance to be gripped once again.\"<br/><br/>The target date for the release of season 4 is 2022 - which gives you more than enough time to get hooked.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "3 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "15 September 2020"}, {"title": " An absolute Tour de Force.", "content": "I watched a ton of series and I would not have expected this political series to had such an effect on me.

While this show definitely injects doses of reality throughout, the basic premise is nothing more than your standard Rom-Com formula. But while the writing may feel clich\u00e9 at times, there is also a strong sense of self-awareness, like when the male lead, Gus, throws out his Blu-ray collection of the most obvious, guilty-pleasure Rom-Coms from the past thirty years, criticizing them for their terrible relationship advice. Or like when Bertie, the female lead's Australian roommate, interrupts a studio tour to expound upon the genius of one of her favorite Rom-Coms, The Holiday. In both cases, it's obvious that the characters have an unhealthy relationship with the genre. This is an especially interesting commentary on Gus's character, who, later in the season, tries to encourage the writers of Witchita (the show for which he works) to step up their game, instead of relying on formulas. As Gus becomes completely unhinged during a writer's meeting, it becomes apparent that for all his enthusiasm and idealism, he's actually rather unperceptive. He may have stumbled upon a good idea, but he doesn't seem to understand why it's a good idea. One of the stars of Witchita, a child actor played by Apatow's youngest, nails it when she exclaims, \"Why did you make him a writer? Every time he makes a suggestion, it's way off. He just doesn't understand the campy nature of the show.\" For this reason, I suspect Gus would have similar issues understanding the vibe of 'Love.' Not because he's an idiot, but because this show plays with a lot of subtle irony. Irony which, incidentally, the female lead, Mickey, revels in. Everything she says has a double meaning. When Gus takes her to the magic castle, she derives the most fun from watching the other spectators, an ironic, veiled criticism on magic-fans in general, which Gus takes personally, as he is, after all, one of the spectators for whom magic is a straightforward source of entertainment. Later, when Gus invites her to a party where the goal is to write theme songs for movies without theme songs, she keeps trying to find the second layer, assuming the point is to write sarcastically bad songs in order to make fun of bad movies. Of course, the biggest irony is when Mickey ends up turning into the clingy sort of girl you expected Gus to be, and Gus ends up being more of an asshole. While not entirely new ground, the whole thing about Gus being fake-nice felt refreshing, as it subverts the typical \"I Love You Beth Cooper\"* formula.<br/><br/>So while this show definitely relies heavily on a vast history of Rom-Com tropes, it engages with them in slightly ironic and often original ways. The title is another good example, as the show both lives up to its name, in that it deals constantly with the pursuit of love, while also reading as sarcastic, with there being very little actual love displayed by the characters (Bertie being the main exception). And yes, the characters are spoiled, materialistic, narcissistic screw-ups, but they also reminded me of people in my life, including myself. It's like the cast of a Rom-Com was dropped into real life, where all their vapid aspirations are suddenly revealed as such, and as a result the characters can actually evolve (for better or for worse), all the while still being subconsciously affected by the Hollywood Rom-Com machine. This technique works especially well for me, as the fusion of platitudes and realism makes the realism seem even more realistic by contrast. In fact, this is probably what I found most enjoyable about this show: the dose of realistic dialogue and acting in an otherwise familiar scene, such as the impromptu jam session at the otherwise typical Hollywood pool party, or the way the unrealistic mismatching of cool, hot chicks with dorky dudes is explained with authenticity by a group of women describing their phases of sleeping with only unattractive men.

Maybe he thought a generic title like \"Friends\" could bring him success eventually, but \"Love\" is broader by far. It even makes it very confusing searching for it in the WWW.<br/><br/>Anyway. This series isn't ambitious enough to justify such a heavy title. It is just a same-o same-o attempt to give you some \"insights\" about dating in modern USA (basically). I've lost count on how many comedies are/were/will be out there about dating.<br/><br/>So, is there any significant difference from all the previous attempts? Well, no. Not really.

The show has no qualms of working around the Hollywood-depicting-Hollywood trope, but the writers seem to have made insufficient use of writing about something so close to home.<br/><br/>The two main characters are a socially inept man(played by co-creator Paul Rust) and a liberated strong willed woman with little direction(played by Gillian Jacobs of Community fame). Any subtlety left in these characters after the first episode is weaned from them in the following nine. The likely scenario is that these two characters are meant to be used to portray a paradigm shift that the writers are about a decade too late in addressing. Playing off something dead, leads to flat lines and what feels like unintended cringe comedy.<br/><br/>One could forgive the flimsy characters if the comedy made up for it.

The characters use their phones a lot and the costume department has google searched images under the keyword hipster. But any zeitgeist is completely missing.

After viewing the sixth show, I detect a dramatic shift in the characters who have now become very close friends. The show has also matured into a somewhat dark, psychological drama where the pain and the character flaws of the two men are as much a part of the show as the murder mysteries they solve together. <br/><br/>At the start of the series, the police officer, Geordie Keating, played by Robson Green, was suspicious of the idealistic vicar, Sidney Chambers, played by James Norton, whose life was so different than his own. After a few months, Sidney wins Geordie's friendship by using his intuitive skills to help him solve the ongoing murders that plague the village. Geordie is a no nonsense police officer with a wife and four children who is made to appear almost as a \"Columbo\" figure (from the U.S. television show in the 1970's and 80's) with his worn-out raincoat and hunched figure. He is a drinker and a World War II veteran. Chambers also likes to imbibe, a bit too much, and has had a series of ill-fated affairs, going against the grain for an Anglican vicar. Chambers is well aware of his shortcomings but he has a huge heart which not only endears him to women but enables him to see the best in the people of his village.<br/><br/>Chambers also helps Geordie through a serious crisis in his family when one of his children becomes seriously ill and Geordie is unable to be with his family and share the pain that his wife Cathy is feeling; he has been trained in both war and peace to keep emotions in check. Chambers has a great heart but he is no fool and when there is a murder, he jumps right into the action, giving the overworked Geordie the benefit of his insights. We see a number of sub-plots in the series, with some comic relief from the vicar's housekeeper, Mrs. McGuire, who treats her boss like a wayward son, finding the empty whiskey bottles and watching his liaisons with the women in his life. Then there is Sidney's curate, who is unwise to the world and full of false dreams about his idyllic life as a country priest. His naive nature soon takes a beating under the patient and watchful eye of Sidney, who has much more experience to draw upon. <br/><br/>Sidney must also navigate around the impending marriage of his former lover who he stills sees socially from time to time. It is clear that the two still care deeply for one another. The show has some dramatic flashbacks for Sidney that haunt him long after the war. Geordie has also been through the ordeal of war and knows the moral ambiguities that Sidney faces. The personal sides of the two men have become more pronounced as the show moved through subsequent episodes.

Clearly,then,this is no ordinary vicar. After the ceremony a mysterious woman tells him that the deceased did not take his own life but was murdered.

He informs the police(in the shape of the excellent Mr Robson Green who eases up on his stroppy Geordie schtick a bit and is all the better for it).His suspicions are dismissed at first but gradually as he digs deeper a dastardly plot is revealed and justice prevails.

I like Inspector Keating -- and his wife and kids -- but the portrayal of the vicar Sidney Chambers is problematic for me -- he comes across as a man doing everything BUT his clerical duties, except for the gratuitous little sermon at the end of each episode. The roles of vicar and hobby- detective are poorly integrated. Chambers is a kind man, but he appears to be a vicar who would far rather be solving crimes than serving his flock and saving souls, habitually leaving his co-worker Leonard to handle his clerical duties. Chambers doesn't just help Inspector Keating a little, he becomes completely engrossed in the crime, to the point of (needlessly) walking out of church during a children's Christmas presentation. <br/><br/>Furthermore, the vicar lacks an appreciation of the sanctity of the confession, as well as the need for basic trust and confidentiality with his parishioners. He actually uses confession and trust as a tool to solve crimes. I am surprised he isn't defrocked. The episodes with the youth, Gary, who spoke privately with the vicar, comes to mind, for one example. (By the way, his church pews are never full, and rarely half-full. Is this consistent with post-war England? Maybe.)<br/><br/>In the first episode I quite liked the luscious vicar, Mr. Chambers, but after watching the first two seasons, I was willing to stop there. I grew quite tired of his boozing, smoking, and jazz. In the TV series, his character gradually comes across as increasingly irresponsible and self-indulgent, rather than broody-sexy. As he cavorts around with various women, he appears foolhardy, careless of his reputation, and somewhat stupid, even (recklessly boozing it up in a woman's bedroom, while she is half-dressed, while suspecting she might be a killer). As a vicar, he is anachronistic for the time period. <br/><br/>I am not crazy about his main love interest, Amanda, even though I sympathize with her. I have read that in the books her characterization was handled better, but the television series lacks something. <br/><br/>I love the stern but soft-hearted housekeeper, Mrs. Maguire (what the dickens!?!) and the humble vicar Leonard, who struggles with timidity and homosexuality. They make the show. Mrs. Maguire is the foil to Chambers, and Leonard's character engenders more sympathy than does the vicar Chambers.<br/><br/>For non-clerical period British detective series, my current top favorite is the new Endeavor series, portraying a young constable Morse, before he became the sometimes arrogant and unlikable Inspector Morse -- apparently a hit series back in its day. Also, I quite enjoyed the George Gentry series, which is set in Manchester (or Newcastle?) in the 1960s. Agatha Christie's Marple series is quite good, too. <br/><br/>I also highly recommend the Vera (Stanhope) series, and the Shetland series, but they are set in the 21st century, with cell phones and computers (both series were based on books by Anne Cleeves).

But the subject matter is far to heavy for my taste. In just a few shows it deals with racism, alcoholism, spousal abuse, homosexuality and how it was treated as a crime, pedophilia (with a 15 year old girl) and teenage pregnancy, and the church's covering up of crimes committed by their vicars.<br/><br/>Another problem is that it looks at these issues with a modern eye. It stirs up the pot of disharmony by bringing up every social injustice the writer can think of. It's based on modern books by James Runcie, and I don't know how accurate the show is since I've never read the books. But that problem is common for period pieces written long after the story's time-frame. The author can't really get into the mindset of 1950's villagers.<br/><br/>The final problem I'll mention is the lack of satisfaction not only throughout the show but at the endings. During the show, you can feel your blood pressure rising as the sometimes snarky, sometimes cruel people unveil themselves while the plot unfolds. And they never get any sort of comeuppance. They are allowed to be just as rude and vicious as they can be, with no hope of remorse. Then at the end, things are not brought to a happy ending.

As it turned out, we feel that none of the characters are likable. With each episode we grew to dislike them even more. <br/><br/>Sidney \u2013 a man who says he loves God, yet he wantonly behaves in a way that is most unfitting with a man of the cloth. An alcoholic. With all the scenes of him drinking, I'm surprised that he was not in a state of perpetual intoxication. How about the scene where he is guzzling the wine out of the chalice after the church service? Smoked like a chimney in winter. His sexual behavior was more of lust than of love. After a short while, I found him repulsive for a vicar. Most of the scenes with him with a woman, were animal. I find most of the kissing scenes disgusting. I liken it to two pigs fighting over the same turnip \u2013 embarrassing. How about the scene where he has this woman against the wall and is gnawing at her face (kissing?) while the love of his life is watching him. Give me the films of old, where a kiss was warm and tender and showed love and affection. Not these days. The way they kiss on screen, I am surprised that they don't draw blood.<br/><br/>Amanda \u2013 at the beginning she and Sidney had what seemed to be a warm and affectionate relationship. Then she gets engaged to someone even though she is in love with Sidney and because he is not willing to ask her to marry him. She is constantly going to see Sidney even after she is married. From what I can gather, her husband is cold and withdrawn. Why shouldn't he be? She runs to Sidney every chance she gets, instead of trying to make her marriage work. Toward the end of season 3 she seemed to be turning into a shrew.<br/><br/>Geordie \u2013 why couldn't they have left him alone. Instead they turn him into an adulterer. And the usual, when found out he is so sorry. If he wasn't found out, he would have continued his affair. How predicable! I really like this character until he cheated on his wife.<br/><br/>Mrs. Maguire \u2013 sour faced who is wise about everyone else, but is taken in by her husband that was missing for ten years. Someone who sees all and knows all and still thinks that the people of the village need Sidney even after she sees how much he drinks and probably has a good idea of his sexual caring on. She was against Amanda at the beginning, but even though she knew it was wrong because Amanda is a married woman, she warmed up to her.<br/><br/>Leonard \u2013 our token gay person who does not really care about getting engaged to a woman and then dumping her without the slightest bit of conscience bothering him about how he hurt her - no real apology there.<br/><br/>This is more of a soap opera than a crime series or anything about religion. Sidney spends too much time without his vicar's collar. I love the scene where he and Amanda are out dancing and kissing in public. No shame at all, just lust. And when would the police allow anyone other than a police official to be in the room interrogating a suspect or prisoner?<br/><br/>It is rather funny the way at the end of an episode, Sidney gives a little speech in church.

First the gay characters. I don't have anything against gays but how many gay story lines and characters can there possibly be in a small English village during the 1950s? Keep in mind this is a vicarage. A lot apparently. Even one of the vicars is gay. Then the writers had to include plenty of interracial romances. It's like a law in the UK, I think. Every British show has to have at least one (or many) interracial relationships in order to meet their diversity quota. It doesn't matter if the series took place almost 70 years ago. That's what annoys me, how unrealistic the show is. And the obvious modern PC agenda. I think, for me, I stopped liking Sidney when he cheated on Hildegard with a complete stranger. He's already an alcoholic / chain smoker. Now he can add cheater to the list. This poor woman left her country and returned to England to be with him, despite his modest salary.

English village. Beer drinking in charming pubs.<br/><br/>Only one problem: the casting of Morven Christie as the vicar's friend and one true love who marries some upper class toff because a vicar is just too common. It's just impossible (for me and friends) to see anything all that great about her. She spurned her obvious life mate because her parents demanded that she marry into the gentry, a pretty high hurdle to jump and still seem sympathetic. Christie did not manage this. She projects nothing that makes her anyone special to care about. She even looks older than Sidney. The totally adorable Sidney Chambers deserves far better.

I have trouble seeing the new vicar as up to the spellbinding old vicar, but I guess we'll see.<br/><br/>Like all British crime dramas this one has its shortcomings: the writing is often not that great, and acting by guest characters (like most of the black activist guys and that includes the daughter) is general and stereotypical. (In that case maybe it's the strain of being totally British and concentrating on being proto-Martin Luther Kings.)

Let me set the stage for all the younger viewers so they know where I'm coming from...<br/><br/>Back in the late 60's early 70's there wasn't much fare for young pre-teen children like me for Soap Opreas. They were all \"adult\" and handled \"adult\" themes, that were, honestly, way over our heads to keep us viewed day in and day out. We were of the \"Dark Shadows\" generation. To look at a soap, we wanted one that was exciting, different and on our level. Along came \"The Young and the Restless\" in 1973.<br/><br/>I knew it was for me and my pre-adolescent girl-pals, our parents didn't like it much. Our parents were watching \"Somerset\", \"The Secret Storm\", \"Edge of Night\", \"Another World\" and before \"General Hospital\" got hip, these soaps were dry and people didn't speak about much on network TV. Everyone had the same disease, everyone sat on the bed by themselves and yuck! that organ music!<br/><br/>It was exciting back then to see a daytime soap storyline wrap around themes that young ladies and young gentlemen were dealing with of those times, and it spoke to us on OUR level. Even the \"older\" more adult cast were speaking on our level, so it caught on quickly for us.<br/><br/>It's now 2003, 30 years later and \"The Young and the Restless\" is still a soap I will watch. Like all soaps, it has its moments...it goes up and down. But the \"Young and the Restless\" was NOT afraid to tackle the social, moral and racial issues of our day... STD's, AIDS, Cults, Alcoholism, Older women going after younger men (it was always the other way around!), Gigilos, Strippers, Rock Musicians, Models, oh my goodness!!! Now, yes, its more common place and these themes aren't much but \"The Young and the Restless\" was one of the first to tackle these head on and not subtly either!<br/><br/>The writing was crisp, young, on-target, just the right thing for us. Some of the best characters in my soap lifetime of watching the \"Young and the Restless\" that were dear to me were:<br/><br/>The Brooks Sisters -- Yes, the one who played the piano was the one I centered on because at the time, I could understand her problems. And \"Pumpkin\" poor, \"Pumpkin\", her story line really made me cry.<br/><br/>Nikki Reed -- Nikki and her family were tough. Nikki was a stripper. Nikki got money. Nikki got...around. Boy, we loved Nikki!<br/><br/>Katherine Chancellor -- This is the Y&amp;R grand dame. Katherine and her younger men, Katherine and her money, Katherine and her alcoholism, Katherine and her face-lifts! Cosmetic plastic surgery was not mentioned on SOAPS! This character brought it on! I really wish they would show this soap in repeats, Katherine Chancellor kicked royal butt!<br/><br/>Victor Newman -- At first I thought this character wasn't going anywhere but wow, he developed nicely and I cannot see the program without him. Rich, powerful, handsome, -- flawed. What else could you ask for? The Newman Clan -- Victoria and Nicolas growing up quite nice and spoiled and unsure as we would expect.<br/><br/>The Abbott Clan -- In the 80's, Ashley Abbott and I were on the same career track. except I didn't do it through family, I made it up the corporate ladder the hard way, but boy was I glad to see Ashley Abbott go through the turmoil, the backbiting: her brother Jack who crushed HER at every corner and had his own problems, the father and head of a HUGE fragrance corporation John, the dear Tracey Abbott who was going through almost EVERY teenage girls' nightmare, being pretty, smart and second banana to her svelte sister, the mother Deena who had an affair and...well..lets just say not all Abbotts are Abbotts and when that eventually comes out (it's 2003 now and not EVERYBODY knows) what a thrill.<br/><br/>There are so many more such as...Neil Winters who really worked his way up through the ranks; streetwise, Drucilla Barber and her over-achieving sister Olivia, Paul Williams and his detective firm, what a thrill they were in the 80's (and not to mention that little STD Paul had when coming to Genoa City, and not to mention the Cult!!) Cricket Christine Blair who was the summer entry we all looked forward to in Jr. Jabot, the scheming Diane, the unsuspecting Andy, and so on and so on and so on!!!<br/><br/>The \"Young and the Restless\" has kept true to its title always bringing in young and restless story lines as well as keeping older viewers like me interested as well. That's a tough thing to do day after day, year after year, decade after decade. Some story lines and characters won't jell with everyone -- and that's okay, that's a soap. This is one that will be bold, go out on a limb and come right into your face with current and past material, young, middle aged and older story lines that no matter how old you are you could get involved with, (maybe not!) but the Young and the Restless is still, to me, one of the best daytime soaps out there for it is young..and very restless.", "rating": null, "helpful": "77 out of 93 found this helpful.", "date": "16 May 2003"}, {"title": " Y&amp;R; #1 for 900+ weeks!!", "content": "I have been a longtime viewer of Y&amp;R.

He listened with her to serial dramas including Our Gal Sunday, The Romance of Helen Trent and Life Can Be Beautiful, on the radio. \"Mom would have soup and a sandwich and be waiting for me,\" he was quoted as saying in WORLDS WITHOUT END: THE ART AND HISTORY OF THE SOAP OPERA. Before long Bill was hooked. He was particularly taken with \"The Guiding Light, created by Irna Phillips.\" Bill brought greater characterization and depth, for example, to Y&amp;R's Victor Newman because the viewers learned that he had been left in an orphanage as a little boy. He created a financial empire so he could never be hurt again, becoming literally a \"new man\" in the process.<br/><br/>Bill's son Bradley, head writer and executive producer of B&amp;B, followed in his father's footsteps by shedding light on the controlling Stephanie Forrester. Viewers understood the domineering matriarch more after learning that Steph had been physically abused by her father, while her mother Ann, looked the other way. \"Bill himself would be poor material for a daytime character,\" entertainment writer Clifford Terry wrote in the Chicago Tribune in 1973. \"After all, how tormented can someone be whose favorite word is 'nifty'\"? Terry made this assessment about Bill noting that he didn't hold traditional positions like on-screen characters such as attorney Mickey Horton on Days or newspaper publisher Stuart Brooks on Y&amp;R. \"There's a little of me in most of the male characters I've created,\" Bill told veteran soap-opera journalist Dorothy Vine. \"There's some of me in John Abbott, Jack Abbott, Eric Forrester and even in Victor Newman. I create characters to tell a story and when you do that you have to start with some of yourself so you can understand and motivate them.\" Bill's younger self can be found in two family-oriented and ambitious brothers whom he created for Y&amp;R, Snapper and Greg Foster.<br/><br/>Bill Bell would have fit in perfectly on the TV series MAD MEN. He didn't have that dark edge that Don Draper has, but he always had that smile. -Thomas Phillips, Irna Phillips's son Bill Bell worked in the world of advertising before he became a soap-opera writer. Jerry Birn became Bill's lifelong friend but at first Jerry doubted that. They were at McCann Erickson, one of Chicago's top ad firms. Bill had something of a hot-shot reputation for writing comedy sketches and the ad copy he had written at WBBM-TV. Jerry didn't want to be \"walking the plank to make room for Golden Boy Bill. And, believe me, there was always a Golden Boy \"for a time\". The boss had taken Jill had breakfast and in Venice get my parents seeing him fall. Bill revealed that he'd lied about his age to enlist in the Navy during WW2. Later, the conversation hit a bump in the road when they talked about salaries: Bill was making more. Jerry was too impressed. As impressed he flagged down. Jerry knew Bill was getting an episode. When Bill summoned and Margaret, delivered. Wild children. He had some of the occasions of the murdered. Writers' rooms he was diagnosing , their honey moon episodes.<br/><br/>Jill &amp; Lee portrayed noble causes that they fought for. Standard Oil execs had suggestions that were sophomoric, amateurish and hopeless but Jerry thought they should go with them anyway. Bill did not agree. He told the Standard Oil folk that they could fire him but he wouldn't put their name on his work. Then he walked out. Bill would take a similar stance with NBC execs who tried to tamper with his storylines. Bill waited for CBS to fire him over the Standard Oil issues. Never happened. The head of the office got a letter from the ad director at Standard Oil applauding Bill and wanting him kept on the account. They were on for the kind of honesty and integrity that they go from Bill Bell. Bill was floored but he had one question, \"Could he have a raise\"?<br/><br/>When they weren't working, Bill &amp; Jerry hung out at a local watering hole, the Bowl and the Bottle. Jerry got Bill started on martinis. They came up with the slogan, \"The olive with the taillight,\" because they had pimentos in them. The agency passed. They pitched a food account to a female exec. When they finished she had one question, \"How much experience did they have with food?\" They got a laugh but not the account when they replied, \"We eat.\" Television changed the ad world. Clients were able to promote their products in a whole new way. Standard Oil began running TV ads during Chicago Bears game broadcasts.<br/><br/>Bill was a traditionalist. He rejected the computer age, preferring to stick with his trusted typewriter. But, he did try to move from using traditional advertising storyboards to employing live models for presentations. Jack Tinker, a top-ranking writer at McCann Erickson, shot the idea down. Jerry and Bill were the Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid of the ad world. That changed when Bill met his own Etta Place, TV personality Lee Phillip. Bill was knocking on Irna Phillips's door with one hand and with Lee's door with the other. Bill got down on one knee and asked Lee to marry him. Soon Jerry was his best man &amp; planning was underway. The Christmas card Jerry got said, \"The Bells Are Ringing!\" Bill and Lee wed on October 23, 1954.

They don't kill characters and return them back from the dead, rather they don't kill many characters. They stick to the old fashioned way of storytelling. They don't do things quickly which is why is may not be for everybody. What is their strength is the excellent cast of actors and crew members who don't just stay 3 years and leave. THey stay a lot longer and there are exceptions. I think they stay because the work is good and in Los ANgeles, you can do other things like film and television and even theater. Yes, the cast includes Jeanne Cooper, Eric Braeden, Peter Bergman, Melody Thomas Scott, Kate Linder, and so many others who have come and gone. It's not for everybody, it might be too slow for some people but the stories are good and somewhat crazy sometimes but worth watching.

The bad guys rarely get punished and the writers keep bringing back psycho-Sheila every time they need a villain and can't come up with a new one.<br/><br/>Over and over, this show has repeatedly tried very hard to promote interracial relationships even though they are statistically rare (about 3%) yet oddly enough - they never address the racial component of a relationship.<br/><br/>After many years, especially the last few, I have concluded that this show is a waste of time.

The acting in these shows ranges from passable to pretty worthless. I'd imagine it's because they're not trying since these actors are handed such rubbish scripts rushed out daily.

I would be sitting at the lunch table and I didn't exactly watch it, but by osmosis it stuck with me. I kept coming home at the same time every day for lunch for years to come. And I became fascinated by The Young and the Restless. When you are subjected to it every day for eight years, you get to know it and grow to have a love hate relationship with the show. Now that I am a grown man, it is almost embarrassing to say that I still watch this show, but it is true and I still have a love hate relationship with the damn thing. And even though I am the only one to comment on it, I know there are many other guys that watch this show as much as I do. How many times have you heard a guy say \" I wish I could have sex as much as Victor.\" For me that was a lot. Most of the guys that I went to high school with were closet Y&amp;R guys. They couldn't get enough of it. I really don't know what it is about the show that has kept me watching it for years, but there is something addictive about it. It would be easy and very macho of me to say that the sole reason is because of the beauties like Trish and Sharon and Grace walking around with their smooth stomachs and their provocative clothing, but that wouldn't be entirely correct. They are great to look at but it is more. And to really get the appeal of this show, look no further than Jack and Victor.<br/><br/>Jack and Victor have been going quibbling for as long as I have been watching. Jack and Victor have stolen women from each other ( Nicki, Diane ), they compete for business ( Jabot ) they work at the same office, and they generally hate each other. When Victor says Jack's name he literally spits it out. \" The site of you disgusts me Jackabbot! \" he was heard saying once. And he has to say his name in one syllable, as if saying it properly is too distasteful. Sure, Paul and Christine, Brad and whoever he is sleeping with, Jill and Kay, Billy and Mac, Michael Baldwin and his sneaky ways, Nick and Victoria, Malcolm and Neil, Olivia, and the rest of the cast is fun in their own right, but it is Jack and Victor that are the fun ones. I just wish that once, just once, Jack could win straight out. Not losing in the end, but actually has one clear cut victory over Mr. Money Bags. That would be refreshing. <br/><br/>Y&amp;R is the kind of show that you turn off every once in a while because it takes them six months to resolve an issue that should be done with in a matter of days. And sure time is a big problem in this show. Victor can leave the office and get home in time to see Nicki crying over whatever she is crying about this time, even though she was crying when Brad was in the room only five minutes ago. But Newman Enterprises should be in town and they live in the country. And most characters are annoying at one point or another and no one is faithful, but hey, we can overlook those things because we are addicted. <br/><br/>It really is a fun show to watch and if you haven't seen it by now, then just start watching it, you'll pick up on what you need to know in about a week.", "rating": null, "helpful": "18 out of 30 found this helpful.", "date": "1 September 1999"}, {"title": " Slag along soap opera.", "content": "I started watching this show at the tail end of the original set-up where the Brooks and Foster families dominated the story. One upper middle class, the other working class, yet interconnected and all basically decent people. Along comes \"the mustache\", a 35 year plus villain who doesn't mellow, just gets more rotten. Victor Newman's story did overlap the original families by 2 years, and for a while, he was engaged to the show's original bitch goddess heroine, Laurie Brooks. Today, only Jill Foster Abbott remains from the first episode, having been played by many actresses, with Jess Walton now in the part for almost 30 years. After the death of long-time matriarch Katharine Chancellor, Paul Williams (Doug Davidson, now with 38 years on the show) became the longest running character, and for a while, had a family of his own who supplanted the Fosters as the lower working class family. Original Foster matriarch Elizabeth Foster (Brooks, thanks to a brief marriage to patriarch Stuart) was on and off the show for 37 years, a regular presence for the show's first 12 years, but neglected even though daughter Jill was still on after she was written off. The show's writers can't seem to make up their mind of how they want to history, destroying Jill's being a Foster by making her Liz and Bill Foster's adopted daughter. <br/><br/>This wasn't the first show to capitalize on youthful characters, but with \"Y&amp;R\", it pretty much declared war on focusing on more mature characters. Certainly, Jennifer and Stuart, supposedly widowed Liz and the complex Katharine Chancellor had their own battles: Jennifer with breast cancer, Liz finding her husband Bill was alive then pulling the plug on his life support, and Katharine's alcoholism. I've seen old episodes of each of these major stories, and certainly, Julianna McCarthy should have been nominated for an Emmy for her heartbreaking performance as Liz. When they killed Liz off for good in 2010, I was heartbroken, almost feeling like I had lost my grandmother. Jennifer did die of breast cancer during the early years of the show, and Katharine just passed away, but these three women showed that during the early years, young didn't mean youth; It meant young in spirit, and the ability to deal with heartbreak, loss and depression.<br/><br/>The two early major stars were Jaime Lyn Bauer as the sultry Laurie and future prime-time TV star David Hasselhoff as Jill's brother, Snapper. But their departures from the show in 1982 pulled the story towards the growing Abbott family and Eric Braeden's ruthless Victor. I liked him around this time, but his character hasn't seemed to pick up any serious life lessons, only getting worse. In short, he's the Donald Trump of soaps. The 1984 wedding to former stripper Nikki Reed was a wonderful reunion of many of the show's veterans, with a great subplot of Victor's psychotic ex-lover Eve Howard in disguise trying to kill the bride. I was addicted to the show during the story-line the previous year when Eve (the beautiful Margaret Mason) tried to kill Victor through slow acting poison and her slide into insanity as Victor pretended to be dead to trap her.<br/><br/>Such beautiful older women as Marla Adams (Dina Abbott) and Susan Seaforth Hayes (Joanna Manning) kept me intrigued as young women like Ashley, Tracy and Patty held my interest as well. Jack Abbott and Paul Williams were fascinating young male characters, with wise John Abbott showing that powerful businessmen could be decent, even with someone like Victor Newman breathing down their neck. By the end of the 1980's, I began to loose interest in \"Y&amp;R\", but have gone back on several occasions, first when Margaret Mason returned to introduced Victor to their son, Cole, and later when Judith Chapman took over the role of John Abbott's gold-digging wife, Gloria. I also would make brief re-visits every time Dina or Joanna would pop into town, as well as one of Liz Foster's longer stays in 2003 when she had to tell Jill that she was adopted.<br/><br/>Now, the show is a shell of itself, having diminished the importance of Jill and writing off the bulk of the characters that I liked. They turned Nikki Newman into a shrew, wasted the character of Ashley Abbott, and made Victor Newman so unrealistically evil that I wished I could go back as head writer and have Eve Howard's poison taken affect. Like Sonny on \"GH\", Victor has a loyal group of fans and disgruntled viewers who would love them to be killed off for good. \"Y&amp;R\" has never had the best writing (no matter what the Emmy Awards may think) as it is often inconsistent, angry and pandering. Yet, they must be doing something right, because of the four soaps left, it has the highest ratings. Or perhaps I'm no longer young and restless either, or just above the cell phone style of Ebonics that come out of the writer's pens.", "rating": 5, "helpful": "6 out of 8 found this helpful.", "date": "15 September 2016"}, {"title": " Always a favorite show of mine", "content": "I remember when I first tuned into The Young and the Restless when I was 12 years old at home sick I got sucked into the characters of Lorie Brooks Prentiss, Leslie, Lance, Lucas, Snapper &amp; Chris Brooks Foster and I invested into these characters then within less than a year they were all gone. I was devastated. It took time to get into the Abbotts &amp; the Williams but I stayed true to this story than I have now. It is 21 years later and that is the only show that I am still hooked on. I grow up watching this show and it always fascinates me that there are always good stories which they are realistic for me and not much of a fantasy like other soaps. This was one true show that I would change my schedule around when I was in college. There was 3 semesters that I did nothing but watch Y&amp;R when Nina was married that psycho David Kimble and had a beautiful mistress named Diane Westin (Devon Pierce, the most beautiful actress that I ever thought that appeared on Y&amp;R). When that story was over I was once again devastated and picked up quickly with the other stories that was playing. That was probably my favorites storyline amongst with other favorite storylines like when Katherine blackmailed Jill, Jill's shooting, the transformation of Nina, the baby switch of Lauren's baby, Lauren and Sheila storyline, Victor's resurrection, Nick/Sharon/Matt/Amy storyline, the revelation to Danny that Daniel Jr. was not his son, Nikki's shooting, Diane's (Jenkins) plot to destroy Phyllis, Leanna plot to destroy Ashley and Victor and of course the best storyline is Katherine and Jill.

This show is the only soap that I have noticed has added comedy into it's different drama. It's refreshing to see a group of friends just hanging out at the coffee shop hanging out and laughing. It also brings in new fresh story lines that most other soaps haven't had. There are a couple of different story lines this year and part of last that I have really taken an interest in.<br/><br/>First there was the Nick, Phyllis, and Sharon storyline that played out last year where Nick and Phyllis were having an affair. I loved seeing them together and probably always will. Now this year they have had Nick forget the last couple of months so he doesn't remember Phyllis or Summer and is still in love with Sharon. The Jack, Sharon, Nick, and Phyllis love square is great and will definitely be very interesting to watch as it progresses. Then there is the fact that Phyllis could be sentenced to prison time that even makes things more interesting.<br/><br/>Then there is the Daniel storyline that Daniel is addicted to porn. IT was really interesting and ended up ending him marriage with Lily. Then there is the Cane/Amber/Daniel/Lily love square where Amber fake married Cane and Daniel and Lily are married. Cane and Lily both think that Amber and Daniel were having an affair and they separated from them. Then they is the Amber/Daniel/Kevin storyline where Amber's ex-boyfriend comes to town and then they find him dead and with a big bag full of cash. They dump off the body and bury the money because they want to keep the money. They a treasury agent comes searching for the money along with a man named Carson. It was very exciting with the fact that every turn they made there was a new problem. Now they are waiting for their trial.<br/><br/>Then my favorite storyline of all was the Brad/Victoria/JT storyline. Victoria and Brad were married then she discovered that he slept with Sharon so she slept with JT. Victoria and Jt ended up having a short affair since Brad offered to divorce Victoria if that's what she wanted. She wanted the divorce and they got it but then she discovered that she was pregnant again. Now they are waiting till the baby is born to have a DNA test to determine whether the baby is JT's or Brad's. I am personally hoping it's JT's. I don't like Brad at all.<br/><br/>The Young And The Restless brings in new story lines every week and every one of them are very interesting. This is the best soap that I have watched.

So many things that make you say, \"that's not how it works \" or \"that wouldn't happen\". When a kid is supposedly 9 months, dramatic pumping is not a big issue. You can do it like once at work, you're not rushing to the pump room every two hours like with a newborn. You also don't really leak anymore, and in case you do, you always have breast pads.\n6. I think they used babies of different ages thinking no one would notice. It's definitely annoying when you know developmental stages and milestones well and the babies they are holding and talking about are well past or not even close.\n7.

But this one is very entertaining, especially in times like these!<br/><br/>Six weeks a yacht crew of about 12 people is penned up 24/7 in the smallest spaces possible- working, sleeping, cooking, partying, fighting... while they have to serve and entertain up to 20 hours a day, during one to three days charters, highly demanding rich guests, sometimes wannabe sophisticated and mostly disrespectful, condescending scum and alcoholics, arrogant and spoiled pricks and brats, with only few exceptions.<br/><br/>Of course this creates much tension and pressure and brings out the most abysmal behaviors in one or the other crew member. Ego trips, cabin fever, intrigues and drama are preprogrammed! Especially the vengeful, cunning, yet sometimes really funny \"resting bitxx face\" chief stewardess Kate Chastain became the mistress of sabotage, manipulation and emotional cruelty. This might be the result of working too long in such a male-dominated, sexist, cynical, degrading, coldhearted and shallow environment. She herself mentioned more than once after every sexual harassment towards crew members: \"this is nothing, I've seen far worse...\"\nSo one can imagine what happens with no cameras present. I can't remember who, but someone on this show once said something like: \" I've sold my soul...\"<br/><br/>This show is a great depiction of rich societies hedonism, chauvinism and sexism, and how they get away with it too easy, without legal consequences, although there should be some. Because again:\nmoney rules the world.\nSo a mega yacht seems to be an even easier as usual hunting ground for predators and a perfect playground for bullies, both amongst the crew and the guests, though the guests are those who get away with it every time, while the \"working class\" at least sometimes has to face consequences.<br/><br/>At this point: kudos to all women in this show, who were able to stay positive, mostly calm, graceful, respectful and strong despite the stress and the embarrassing, degrading treatment they had to endure not only from guests, but more from their own crew members; especially Amy Johnson from season 2 and Courtney Skippon and Simone Mashile from Season 7.\nThe only permanent sincere, gentle and respectful man from this show I remember was Deckhand David Alanson Bradberry.<br/><br/>Captain Lee sometimes comes off as a bit grumpy, but in general seems to be a decent and correct person with conservative values. His old- fashioned, too military hierarchy- driven leadership, where people often are only allowed to speak up, if he's gracious, might make it more complicated for the crew members to cope with their problematic personal and professional relationships. For him clearly rank and age go before everything. And it seems, sometimes he still mixes up fear with respect. That may be one reason why some of the crew lie and try to cover up their mistakes. Although it makes no sense, when everything gets filmed. After watching all seven seasons, I really wonder, why he is so shocked and surprised every time at the seasons reunions about the outcome of the shows, if he never shows interest in the first place when disputes occur and crew members try to approach him?!<br/><br/>The background information about the sometimes hard and dangerous, yet exciting and joyful yachting life and the beautiful sceneries make the whole show very watchable, otherwise it would just be like big brother.<br/><br/>I give this show 6 Stars, because the music gets annoying and stories get repetitive over time, but most of all for the lack of improvement relating to solutions for sexual harassment.

In the first season we have a determined but somewhat gentle chief stew named Adreienne trying her hardest to motivate the spoiled, presumptuous Sam (a young lady) who refuses to show the slightest hint of responsibility or self awareness. Sam smirks and challenges every single instruction or order given to her by her boss and spends the entire season acting as cruel and unfair as she can, siding up with her drunk 2nd drunk stew, Kat, against Adrienne. If you are watching the show hoping to find any self awareness or moment of mea culpa coming from either party, forget all about that. Only Kat admits the truth about herself after the show is over. We never get any apology from Sam, but hopefully someday she will privately apologize to her tormented supervisor.<br/><br/>In the third season, a bi-polar or hard case ADD personality who self identifies as a dolphin throws the color and frustration into the charter season. Her mood swings jump higher than a dolphin zig zagging through the waves and at one point she actually jumps ship and swims away from the boat as fast and strong as an escaped Orca from Marine World. Clearly she is not equipped to live with and work alongside humans, but her insane antics and personality hold attention to the show. I feel bad for her exploitation however, as surely the producers have no compunction placing a head case such as hers alongside reasonable people for all the world to see.<br/><br/>The highlights are the captain, ever so reasonable, handsome and experienced, and Ben with his deep voice, dry wit and skilled hands in the kitchen.

We may never charter a luxury yacht, but \"Below Deck\" gives us an all-access pass, including a look behind the curtain. These are some reasons that the concept of the show works so well:<br/><br/>1. The Venue. A charter yacht is like a floating Vegas casino in the sense that it demands the ultimate in client service while simultaneously requiring crew skills. If you fall short in your dealings with the clientele, you will lose money. If you fall short in your sailing duties, it can result in loss of life or serious property damage. Furthermore, the quarters are cramped, especially in those areas where the crew lives for weeks at a time. This creates cabin fever and stressful interactions.\n2. The Crew. The business attracts young people, especially those looking for adventure, who are not saddled with responsibilities. As a result, there are plenty of partyers and young people looking to hook up. Conversely, the captain wants a responsible crew that puts the business and the boat before self. The crews tend to be attractive and fit.\n3. The Guests. These people pay big bucks to be pampered. Like the whales in Vegas, they expect the best. And they are often not afraid of making odd or presumptuous requests. Their tips significantly define the degree of success of each charter.<br/><br/>The ship is run like a military operation, with a hierarchy of ranks. Discipline is strict. But if you are living among the beauty and the tender climes of the Caribbean, surrounded by comely coworkers and entertainment venues, you might allow your attention to wander occasionally. The result is plenty of drama and comedy.<br/><br/>The show also pierces the veil of cordiality, contrasting the polite ministrations of the crew with their behind-the-scenes editorials.

The series is done in 13 half-hour episodes so there is little time for providing background or explanations. Rather, the intent and motivations of Christine/Chelsea/Amanda are expressed entirely in the body language, vocal tones, eyes and expressions of Ms. Keough. It is a complex character but by the end of the series I felt I understood this character as I have understood few others. Being previously unfamiliar with Ms. Keough, I was frankly stunned by her acting talent. In the later episodes, the story line transitions from the inner turmoil of the main character while living a dual life into her life entirely as a call girl. This gives Ms. Keough less to do in terms of portraying the multiple aspects of her character. The series suffers for this. Many viewers will focus on the sex scenes, some of which are probably too long if not unnecessary. This is a shame because it takes the focus away from the incredible job Ms. Keough does in realistically portraying a character trying to exist in two vastly different worlds while trying to prevent those worlds from colliding. With a less gifted actress, GFE would be a run of the mill drama. What sets this series apart is Ms. Keough's fascinating portrayal of a complex character.

The remainder of the cast is solid, and the script is well.. what it is. They're trying to make it more intriguing, and for the most part they do pull it off.

I am crushed they are changing things and that she won't be returning and I will bet that those who loved the GFE as much as I did will agree that season two will be a huge disappointment. I also loved the way they produced and directed it, and the overall feel of it. It wasn't just another TV series with drama and sex. It's stood out above the rest. And season two, it seems they are changing all that. I can understand the want to change its course, but we liked season one for a reason. I can see from the articles about how season two will be played that it's NOTHING like season one. It's gonna be just another TV series, like breaking bad or orange is the new black. Season one was different Then any other TV series I've watched and I loved it. Why change it? And with all due respect to the new cast, there is no way they will be able to do what Riley did. Between a new cast and a new direction of the show, I have a sad feeling that season two will be another bad sequel, like a second dirty dancing. The effort will be there, but the season one fans will be highly disappointed in the ratings won't be there. I can only hope that if that happens, that they will go back to what they did in season one and go back to that in season three, if it even gets renewed for a third season. What the directors and producers and Riley did in season one was absolutely genius and amazing and I think it's respect really stupid of them to change that now. Especially when the show is so new. They could have done so many great things how they just kept doing what they were doing, keeping Riley and adding on from there. The life of a provider is ever-changing in so many exciting things happen and so many different people are met.

They could have brought Avery back, she could have started her own agency or helped out a couple girls, a crazy Rendezvous between Christine and David. Etc.

Stumbled on this show accidentally and was attracted by the title.<br/><br/>I am on my episode 10 and still did not understand the \"gist\" of the show.

Same goes with her decision to uncover her supervisor's illegal activity on the lawsuit. Why would she do that and it seems like a very hasty decision to go to Erin right away without careful consideration, considering that she just started out as an intern in the firm for not very long.

What I finally figured out about the Girlfriend Experience is that it was just that, a young woman pushing herself off as giving men that GF experience while trying to find out who she was and wrestling with her self with loving it beyond her advertised GF experience and conflicted by it.<br/><br/>The main character, who goes by as many different names as she would like them to be out of body personas, will come across as a cold, mechanical, bland; and that is the beauty of this. It is played to this type of perfection by Riley Keough. I expected the complete opposite type of acting from the subject matter, but this is so raw, so \"everyday\", that you have to take notice, and she is doing it very well with quiet enthusiasm - if you were to embrace such a thing - she has in this role.<br/><br/>Christine is an Ivy league trained smart woman, who does...this. Why? She does knows why. We're trying to understand why, and she is trying to understand and do at the same time; it is the psychological and moral battle she is going through which is producing a cold exterior as a calculating call girl emerges. <br/><br/>For those seeking a titillating romp through the woods type of thing, this is not what this is. This is cold. It can be unemotional. This is a 'nothing' is happening when 'everything' is happening around this character. She is trying to sell herself as a GF Experience when it is clear (at least to me) she's a paid call girl. That 'GF Experience' is all she has to justify to herself that she's be \"above\" that. Until reality hits.<br/><br/>The character cannot shut out the real world around her. And the real world around her is unflinching, judgmental, torrent and easily brands her as the thing she feels she is not. But she is. We are watching her struggle footing between both worlds as she is clearly drawn to one. She's comfortable with it, it pleasures her and she uses that as a reason to separate the two. The production is gray, sterile - not warm at all -- so you are to feel her and her world and her turmoil. The camera angles are deliberately designed not to excite because although the character says she likes this and you would assume to see her liking this, it's still mechanical, boring, lifeless. Just as she is. <br/><br/>This is also showing us how society doesn't buy into her GF Experience ideal. So, the character needs to retaliate by trying to use her ivy league brain against her obvious pleasures. Who knows if it will work or if it will just put a blanket over it while the character learns maybe there isn't a difference between her GF Experience and calling it as it is perceived.<br/><br/>This little series is done really well based on those items mentioned above. For those wanting more on the super-sexy side, this isn't the program for you. It is a program with a character trying to be what she wants and what society makes of it all. You leave this with the conclusion that her life is her own and whatever she decides to do, it is what she has to answer to whether it satisfies her pleasures or not. She is learning that it is not her own closed little world to manipulate, to live in without preconceptions and judgments by her clients, the social internet, by her peers -- and by us, the viewer.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "10 out of 14 found this helpful.", "date": "8 June 2016"}, {"title": " three stars for season 1, one star for season 2 that is just awful", "content": "I was first intrigued by 1st few episodes of season 1, yet annoyed by the emphasis played over sex scenes.

The series features a little titillation here and there, but it's tasteful, artfully photographed, and looks great. <br/><br/>The show works in that -- even though the protagonist is a person of questionable moral values, she's surrounded by all these far more horrible, reptilian people (lawyers and other wretched/inhuman scum). So, by comparison, she comes off as the most empathetic person on the whole show; you end up bonding with her because you hate everyone else. (As Robert McKee often says: \"Empathy ... is absolute, while sympathy is optional.\" Meaning empathy is enough ... to keep us engaged. We empathize with the main character, but we don't necessarily sympathize with her. ) <br/><br/>I also like the protagonist's rebellious streak and admired her discipline and focus. As the actress herself said about the character: \"she's driven.\" (Driven to a fault, actually.) There's also something terribly sad about her too. We can sense her loneliness as, obviously, she has no friends. In fact, there's an existential quality about the whole show, which is emphasized with the Cliff Martinez-like ambient music underscoring many scenes. <br/><br/>But this show is all about the actress, Riley Keough.

This costumer movie is partially based on real events and starts in 1667 , with 28-year-old all-powerful king of France, Louis XIV . It toplines two rising British stars , Georges Blagden (\"Vikings\") in the role of Louis XIV and Alexander Vlahos in the role of Monsieur , the Sun King's enigmatic as well as gay brother whose couple is the scheming Chevalier , Evan Williams . His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history , he married Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se (Elisa Lasowski) and being son of Anne of Austria (Dominique Blanc) and Louis XIII (David Stanley) . It's developed in the court of Louis XIV who decides to build the greatest palace in the world - Versailles . This well-known monarch governed in domains where the sun never set ; as Louis continued his predecessors' work of creating a centralized state governed from the capital . We should have the same intelligence as this monarch and take advantage of the power of this story and of its marvellous renaissance background . He sought to eliminate the remnants of feudalism persisting in parts of France and , by compelling many members of the nobility to inhabit his lavish Palace of Versailles -formerly a hunting lodge belonging to Louis's father- , succeeded in pacifying the aristocracy , many members of which had participated in the Fronde rebellion during Louis's minority . However , his brother Monsieur Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans (Alexander Vlahos) has for some time been relegated to a lesser role in the Court , due to the growing power of the King' most influential secretaries , Bontemps (Stuart Bowman) , Colbert (Steve Cumyn) and especially the security chief , the relentless executioner , Fabien Marchal (Tygh Runyan) . Meantime , the situation of France is threatened by Holland ruled under charismatic William of Orange (George Webster) , being the situation of Louis XIV extremely dangerous and delicate . In the meantime , Louis decides to construct a big palace at an inhospitable place , but drained Budget , affairs and political intrigues complicate things . Louis XIV is in constant conflict with his workers and those traitors who possesses privileged information can acquire immense fortunes . During Louis's reign , France was the leading European power and it fought three major wars : the Franco-Dutch War, the War of the League of Augsburg, and the War of the Spanish Succession . Then , a dark conspiracy and the harassing by William of Orange make Versailles an uncomfortable place .<br/><br/>This upscale epic drama penned by David Wolstencroft (\"The Escape Artist\") and Simon Mirren (\"Criminal Minds\" , \u00a8Third watch\u00a8) , The 10-episode show was big budgeted , developed and co-produced by Canal Plus' original creation division . The series was in development for five years before the cameras started to roll . As of 2015, this is the most expensive television show ever produced in France . Despite being a largely French-financed project, the series was shot in English with an eye toward a larger international audience. According to costume designer Madeline Fontaine, the production required the making of about 100 key cast member costume , and about 200 mass-produced extras costumes. The Emmy Awards hosted an exclusive screening of the series pilot for its members during a board meeting in Versailles . Produced by Zodiak Fiction and Incendo , bowed onseries broke ratings record for an original drama on Canal Plus since 2013 .<br/><br/>This TV series recreates faithfully the historical facts , as long time us separate from the events are to narrate , but the shadows still hide from the public this great historic moment , and the significance of such deeds . \u00a8Versailles\u00a8 TV series is filled with those lights and shadows , gathers such a very important known event recreated in the artistic frame called French Golden Age , characterized and inspired by the ideas of an absolutism realm . The series contributes to historical , artistical and cultural memory of an era , with a look back to the past , offering us an interesting adaptation on important events . This is a lavish budget but slowly-paced costumer and full of nudism and simulated sex with a good cast who gives nice interpretations , it has Georges Blagden as authoritarian King . Personality and charisma of George Blagden's portrayal as one of the most remarkable European kings that ever reigned . His wife Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is well played by Elisa Lasowski and his homosexual brother Monsieur Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans by Alexander Vlahos , and married to Henriette performed by No\u00e9mie Schmidt whose gorgeous beauty is difficult to resist . And Tygh Runyan as Marchal gives his big opportunity to really shine . Amira Casar gives a convincing character as astute and mean B\u00e9atrice . Stuart Bowman plays with enormous distinction as Bontemps , the incorruptible as well as cunning adviser . The rest of the supporting cast is nice , such as the gay lover Chevalier acted by Evan Williams , Anatole Taubman as traitor Montcourt , Lizzie Brocher\u00e9 as the doctor Claudine , Sarah Winter as Louise and several others .

Mock spoiler alert, it ends not with a bang but with a whimper as though its makers gave up and went through the motions like a team that knows its beaten and is just waiting for the final whistle.\n Versailles covers a roughly 20 year period of Louis XIV's reign but the actors don't age. Not a grey hair in sight. The acting is of a good-to-high standard, particularly given the level of some dialogue.\n The quality deteriorates as the series progresses - or perhaps I should say regresses. At least early on there were sexual shenanigans to distract the viewer.\n Not surprisingly the writers opt for the more sensational stories relating to the period such as that of the pious queen allegedly giving birth to a black baby by a court dwarf. Needless to say we get The Man in Iron Mask. Now there was a real life man in a velvet mask, though there's no evidence of him interacting with the royal family. But since we don't know for certain who he was, why he was imprisoned, and why he was masked the writers were free to come up with their own story about him. It's just a pity they didn't come up with a more credible or at least an entertaining one. \n History goes out the window. The queen died of natural causes, she wasn't murdered. The man in the velvet mask died in prison of natural causes long after the events portrayed. In the series Colbert opposes the revocation of The Edict of Nantes. In fact he was long dead when the Edict was revoked. A totally fictitious back story is invented for the devout Madame de Maintenon as a prostitute but her interesting mixed Protestant-Catholic upbringing was ignored.\n For me the nadir was reached in the penultimate episode in an exchange between Louis and Bossuet. When Louis says it was man who based the church in Rome Bossuet replies, \"Saint Paul himself...\"! You'd think the man the Catholic Encyclopedia considered as perhaps the greatest pulpit preacher of all time might know the line, \"you are Peter and upon this rock I will build my church.\" \n For me these inaccuracies wouldn't grate so much if there were good storylines. I enjoy Vikings even though its historical elements are greatly compressed in time. It has credible narratives and, while Versailles had some storylines to begin with, by the end the writers having abandon history seemed to run out of interesting plots.", "rating": 4, "helpful": "23 out of 32 found this helpful.", "date": "22 August 2018"}, {"title": " Stop throwing shade on Le Roi Soleil", "content": "This king was a showman, not an insecure philosopher, spectacularly controlling, not a bit shy.

Much of the narrative is used to make the King sound clever, by having those around him make transparently stupid observations. My favourite is his head of internal security congratulating the King on signing a peace treaty, saying \"the war has ended\". Its an implausibly absurd comment, given the same head of security is surrounded, at that moment, by men killed as a result of what amounts to a domestic war between the King and elements of the nobility. A war he, as head of internal security, is personally charged with fighting. <br/><br/>The reality of Louis XIV is a lot less glamorous. A parasitic individual, who could only sustain his extravagance through rather ugly acts of domestic usury, theft, international conquest and imperialism. That's not to say Louis was any worse than his contemporaries but, to try to portray him in such an overstated and flattering light, makes a lie of historical truth. <br/><br/>Versailles was hardly the pristine, architectural marvel, its presented as either. People defecated and urinated in hallways, diseases, especially of the venereal variety, were rife. The nobility populating the hallways and rooms of this palace, were not the nice, clean, well scrubbed types presented in this series. They were a dirty lot, who washed infrequently and disguised the stink with powder and perfumes. Simply put, in spite of Versailles visual splendor, it was an unsavory place, filled with indolent, wasteful, maliferous people. <br/><br/>The standard of acting for the series is good and yes, its watchable.

But the show's saving grace is that it does feature a great comedic cast, a funny premise, and a decent production budget. The sci-fi elements really aren't taken seriously (which I suppose was upsetting to some people), but in return we get a test-monkey 'apestronaut' who has go on a space walk to fix a broken satellite... I think they made the right choice.\nAll-in-all it's an entertaining show that made me chuckle quite a bit. Although admittedly there weren't that many laugh-out-loud moments, for me.<br/><br/>I love watching Steve Carell doing his thing, though. The man's comedic timing and delivery are still brilliant. His 'gruff army General voice' is really funny, I'm sure it was the driving force (no pun intended) behind getting this show off the ground. Malkovich is also hilarious as the 'stuck-up scientist' character, he plays is just subtle enough so that it doesn't become ridiculous. Him and Carell have good chemistry and their banter often stands out as being the highlight of the show. A lot of other familiar faces from shows like 'Silicon Valley' and 'Parks &amp; Recreation' round out the cast pretty well and it's fun seeing them all here.<br/><br/>The only thing I did find a little jarring is the story-line of Carell's character's wife (played by Lisa Kudrow) serving a life-sentence in prison.\nFirst it's played just for laughs, which works, but it becomes a bit dour later on in the season and it kinda starts making Carell's character's daughter come off like a spoiled, inconsiderate brat. I didn't really like the actress playing his daughter to begin with; she over-does the snarky teenager thing and I found myself getting a bit annoyed whenever she was on screen.\nThe 'black lady astronaut' character was also a bit of a swing-and-miss, for me, but that wasn't really the actress' fault. Her character is just pretty boring.<br/><br/>Overall it's 'good enough' for me, though. If you like Carell's whimsical humor then you're probably gonna like this. I hope the writing and story-lines get a little more interesting if/when the show gets picked up for another season. Maybe adding a bit more edgy humor would spice things up a bit.

If you miss the sixties, the live sounds of The Beatles, Donovan, Dusty Springfield together with many cult bands in those times of magic when we felt like as if life took you beyond your dreams, then this television series will help you reminisce and relate to such times more than any other television show ( to my knowledge) that is set in that era which contains the British atmosphere.  The plot and theme enriches much of the simple life of a Beautiful English country town somewhere in Yorke, initially focusing around the interaction of a local Bobby - Nick Rowan ( played by Nick Berry) with the characters that make up the village community.  Nearly all of the characters play a unique and important role, creating a new and interesting episode which leads the viewer enticed to want more.  The episodes are beautifully supported by background music made popular by artists of that era and sometimes earlier (as the title tune `Heartbeat' was made famous by Buddy Holly in the late fifties) all depending on the scenes, bringing the sixties as alive as possible.<br/><br/>Every episode can be identified by it's title as most series are and each has it's own merit. It would be next to impossible to comment on all of them here, but two particular episodes which have strongly impacted me were; firstly, when Dr Ferrenby (played by Frank Middlemass) departs the series during a fishing trip and gets swamped into the river by the waves of water. It is a very moving scene superbly supported by the background music`Windmills of your mind' (soundtrack to the original 1968 `Thomas Crown Affair') resulting in an exceptionally directed scene. The news is then conveyed to Dr, Kate Rowan (played by Niamh Cusack) who is a colleague of Dr Ferrenby where she is naturally devastated by the news. Dr. Kate Rowan (who later departs the series when she dies from Leukemia) is a beautiful and empathetic character full of charm which the community get to love, underpinning the village morale.  The other impressive episode titled `Baby Blues' is again well directed and filmed with a lovely scenery of  the beautiful greenery of the Yorke country landscape which is well blended with the background music `Catch the wind' made famous by Donovan back in 1965. The echoes in this background music is well blended giving me goosebumps, hence giving a perfect sixties feel. This episode is one that demonstrates the teething problems that were associated with the typical stereotypes (highly contrasted to today) in the prejudices of judging a book by it's cover, where a group of hippies are accused by snobby upper middle class people for the disappearance of a baby. Cutting a long story short, it is the Hippies that eventually lead to successfully locating the missing baby. The snobby lady then swallows her pride with gratitude and wishes to offer them a reward, which they refuse to take, hinting to her that she had misjudged them. It is a powerful statement of the times which in turn is still valid by todays standards on a different platform<br/><br/>Other characters include the the village Sargent, Oscar Blaketon ( brilliantly performed by Derek Fowlds) who is overly obsessed with catching in the act another semi-comedy scruffy couch potato character Claude Greengrass (brilliantly performed by Bill Maynard) who is one of the village petty rogues who has never being caught for any of his scams. Greengrass is always accompanied by his shaggy dog - Alfred. It also has moments of comedy where one episode has Greengrass with his dog in the local pub and someone complains about fleas. Greengrass is immediately on the defence to claim that his dog is clean, but is soon corrected that it isn't the dog they were complaining about, but of him instead.<br/><br/>The only unrealistic component of this series is that almost every episode that I am aware of has a crime occurring, making this Yorkeshire village one of the most unsafest villages in the world which would obviously not be the case. However, this is probably purposely plotted to avoid the series from tarnishing to boredom which is a nightmare faced by anyone responsible for maintaining successful ratings of any television series.<br/><br/>This series have been running for some 10 years and naturally has changed so much in it's story lines with different characters coming and leaving the series, but the atmosphere and setting has remained unchanged. I have never seen anything like it as it is uniquely focused on a time and life that makes the show what it is and it is superbly cast and filmed.", "rating": null, "helpful": "43 out of 46 found this helpful.", "date": "17 September 2003"}, {"title": " Fun program", "content": "\"Heartbeat\" is a brilliant nostalgic feel-good drama set in the 1960's.

You sit down to watch Heartbeat and while there are certain things you can expect from it, it never disappoints.

Based on Nicholas Rhea's real experiences of police life during that era, it was a worthy and authentic series that set out to address some of the pertinent issues of the time.  Nick Berry's severe limitations when it came to expressing anything were compensated by the fantastic character performances of Derek Fowlds as tyrannical Sergeant Blaketon, William Simons as lazy, ageing Constable Ventress and Bill Maynard as local rogue Greengrass.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the show progressively suffered from a series of departures. The excellent Niamh Cusack, who played Berry's wife, left to be succeeded by a less capable actress as his love interest.  After about five years in the series, Nick Berry left.  Berry's replacement, Jason Durr, was a better actor, but the writing was deteriorating and the series appeared to have run out of ideas.  Two of the best characters were also replaced with very over the top and irritating substitutes; Bill Maynard left, to be replaced by Geoffrey Hughes and Derek Fowlds was replaced as Sergeant by Philip Franks. Four long years later, Franks was gone.  Somehow, Ventress remained a serving officer, when he clearly looked too old by this time.  Jason Durr left in 2003, to be replaced by young actor James Carlton, who has only lasted in the show for a year.  These frequent changes in the cast have not helped the series.

She was supposed to cause bruises on their son, but butter wouldn't melt in his mouth, wife-beating husband does nothing wrong. I think that this series tells you that it is alright for men to beat up their wives which may lead to the wives beating their children, or they could be forced to admit they do by their animal husbands, but the wives should still be punished, even though they're being led to believe this is the way to treat people. And recently they showed an episode where domestic violence was not okay. But can you explain the domestic violence in the episode entitled David stockwell's ghost?

Perhaps it was because Henry Winkler was older than the rest of the cast that he looked, as you said, twenty years older.<br/><br/>Fonzie never dated high school girls.  He knew they were too young for him. He had morals.  <br/><br/>Fonzie being an illiterate high school drop-out?  I don't know where you got that from.  Fonzie had dropped out of high school when the show started, but one of plot points of the episode where Richie graduated high school was that Fonzie revealed that he'd been secretly going to night school to earn his high school diploma.  He graduated with the rest of the gang. <br/><br/>\nFonzie living above the Cunningham's garage.  That was because he'd given up his own apartment to his grandmother after she'd been forced to leave her own place.  He stayed above the garage for so long because he loved he Cunninghams like his own family.  He essentially was a part of the family. In the last season, he did move out into a regular apartment.  In the last episode he bought a house so that he would be allowed to adopt an orphaned boy he'd befriended.  Gee...buying a house so you can provide a good home and be a good parent?  Doesn't sound like a loser.<br/><br/>As well, Fonzie also worked several jobs at once.  He was (or became) the owner of the garage he worked at.  When Arnold's burned down, he put up money to help Al rebuild and became the part-owner.  Then, he started teaching shop class at Jefferson High.  He later went to a tough school and became the Dean of Boys, so he could help kids who needed guidance.<br/><br/>So, I think Fonzie was a cool character not because of his leather jacket, or motorcycle, or his prowess with girls.  I think he was cool because he was a good person who was always willing to help a friend in need.  Did you ever see the episode where Al wants to go down to Alabama to join a Civil Rights march?  (This was a later episode when the time was the 1960's). Fonzie is concerned about Al's safety and goes with him to look out for him.

I always thought the Fonz was funnier in his gray jacket days, but when he just had powers beyond belief, it detracted from his character to me.<br/><br/>All that aside, the 1st few seasons were 1st rate.

Then there was the greaser Fonzie who rode around on a bike.  The first couple of years took great pains to show the 1950s accurately, with the actors dressing and looking the part.  Fonzie was just an ordinary greaser.  The show was so good in those first couple of years, that you never questioned why Fonzie who looked about 22, was being a loser and hanging around a bunch of high school kids and hitting on under age high school girls.  <br/><br/>But then the last 7 or 8 years of Happy Days became just utter camp.  Potsie went from a normal guy to a total idiot, and somehow Fonzie got superpowers where the mere snap of his fingers would cause all sorts of magical things to happen, including women/high school girls flocking towards him like lemmings.  The 5'6 Fonzie also could suddenly beat anyone up and not break a sweat.  I also hated how the studio audience would cheer for 3 or 4 minutes when an actor would walk on the set.  The actors would even have to pause and let the audience cheers and applause die down, \"Hey Mr. C, [audience erupts in applause, cheers, and screams].....I just came down to tell you\".

At the time of its broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950's were in middle age with families, and the scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought an artificial nostalgia to them. The Fonz was of course the coolest of the cool (although the actor Henry Wrinkler to this day has never learned how to ride a motorcycle). Richie Cunningham was the all-American blond-haired kid who would probably be elected student body president. Potsie was Richie's best friend--the star of the show has to have a best friend, I guess. And Ralph Malph was the bumbling sidekick to the Fonz, if not the entire group. I loved it when the Fonz would beat up on poor Ralph Malph. And there was Mel, the middle-aged lug who ran Mel's Diner. And of course who could forget the appearance of Mork? Was this really the 1950's? Ironically, films produced during the 1950's, such as \"Rebel Without a Cause\" and \"The Wild One\" have gotten better with age and portray the period more honestly than this show which was produced 20 years after the period it portrays.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the TV show \"Happy Days\" is not in the same league as \"Rebel Without a Cause\" or \"American Graffitti\" for that matter. \"Happy Days\" may have captured some aspects of the 1950's with its burger diner, juke boxes, cool cars, and tacky plaid shirts, but it is more a nostalgic idealism done strictly for laughs rather than an honest portrayal. \"American Graffitti\" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950's whereas \"Happy Days\" seemed more about what middle-aged people of the 1970's wished the 1950's had been like. The result was a kind of watered down fabrication that really has nothing to do with the 1950's. \"Happy Days\" is, at best, a comedy-fantasy with some of the artificial culture of the 1950's as its backdrop. As pointed out by another reviewer, the all-American kid Richie Cunningham would probably have been chastised for befriending the likes of a drop-out like Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzie from entering his Diner.<br/><br/>A quick history: \"Happy Days\" was originally a pilot called \"Love in the Happy Days\" that was rejected for broadcast. Comedy pilots that had themes concerning sex and romance that did not make it to pilot airing sometimes appeared on the infrequently broadcast show \"Love American Style\" which was often aired in place of baseball games that had rained out or other unexpected programming cancellations and/or alterations. In short, \"Love American Style\" was a throw-away show that contained all these one-episode comedy pilots that never made it to a slotted debut. \"Love in the Happy Days\" did appear as a \"Love American Style\" show sometime in the early 1970's, but at the time TV executives could not foresee how a show about 1950's young people would be popular, particularly during the hey-day of comedy shows centering around middle-aged people, such as The \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" (and its subsequent spin-offs such \"Rhoda\"), \"The Bob Newhart Show\", and \"All in the Family\". (How things have changed since now most TV sitcoms are about young people and the industry avoids most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!) <br/><br/>Subsequently, one of the young stars of \"Love in the Happy Days\", a child actor from \"The Andy Griffith Show\" named Ron Howard, got the chance to star in a film about young people taking place in 1959 called \"American Graffitti\" directed by the relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous \"THX 1138\" had bombed miserably at the box office. Even when it was premiered to movie executives, again the studios could not see how a movie about young people in the 1950's could become popular because it didn't \"fit\" with what had been popular in the past, although they didn't realize that much of the movie-going audience had been young in the 1950's. As everyone knows, the movie was a huge hit, and studio executives recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience. Somewhere during the theatrical run of \"American Graffitti\", TV executives realized they had a comedy pilot in their vault that was a lot like \"American Graffitti\". They brought it back with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler as \"The Fonz\", re-titled it \"Happy Days\" and the rest is TV history as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970's.<br/><br/>\"Happy Days\" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never being more or less than what they superficially are. The issues they deal with are trivial. And their reactions appear mindless and even silly. Nowadays, the character of the Fonz seems to be a caricature of, well, The Fonz. Was the idea to be a kind of parody of Marlon Brando's character in \"The Wild One\"? Looking on the show with fresh eyes, I feel the producers really missed out on a great opportunity to present the 1950's with depth and realism that still could be fun and entertaining. Instead the producers decided on cheap laughs for quick bucks. This is definitely a show that has not withstood the test of time. \"American Graffitti\" has many of the outward appearances of \"Happy Days\" but it had an edge. It had an honesty about the characters and their issues. \"Happy Days\" took the look of \"American Graffitti\" but failed to take its heart.", "rating": 3, "helpful": "16 out of 30 found this helpful.", "date": "27 March 2007"}, {"title": " Brilliant in the 1970's,but lost the magic in the 1980's.", "content": "If there were a \"Sitcom Hall Of Fame\",the television series,\"Happy Days\" would surely have a cherished spot as one of the most wholesome family-situation comedy oriented series of the 1970's. The series ran on ABC-TV from its premiere episode on January 15,1974 to the show's final episode on July 12,1984. The show survived until mid-1984 by the way--with an astonishing ten and a half year run on the air. The show was produced by the team of Garry Marshall(who was the show's creator and executive producer)along with some of the best producer,writers to ever be assembled for a series.<br/><br/>\"Happy Days\",was set in the 1950's Milwaukee,Wisconsin,the heart of middle-class America and it basically told the story of the Cunningham family. Mr. Cunningham(Tom Bosley)ran the local hardware store while Mrs. Cunningham(Marion Ross),was a stay-at-home mom who spent time in the kitchen. Their son,Richie(Ron Howard),hung out at Arnold's Drive-In with his pals Ralph Malph(Donny Most),and Potsie Webber(Anson Williams),who try to be as cool as the coolest greaser in town,Arthur Fonzarelli,better known as \"The Fonz\"(Henry Winkler). Richie's sister,Joanie(Erin Moran),tagged along whenever she wasn't at her friend's house. The Cunninghams also had an older son Chuck,who mysteriously disappeared after the show's first season. When the series started in 1974(the first season),Richie and his pals were struggling to find dates,and clear up acne,and mostly to fit in with the hip crowd. By the time the show ended,their teenage problems had given way to decidedly adult topics like marriage and having children.<br/><br/>For those who wanted to know that \"Happy Days\" started out as a pilot in 1971 called \"New Family In Town\",that was produced by Garry Marshall for ABC. It had the same characters,with the exception of the role of Mr. Cunningham(played in the pilot by Harold Gould). However it was used in a segment episode of the another Garry Marshall produced series,\"Love American Style\",which was on the same network. By 1973,ABC programmers were looking to cash in on the wave of 1950's nostalgia,which was generated by the hit film \"American Graffiti\",which was directed by George Lucas and starred Ron Howard. Fortunately,the network executives at ABC did not have to look very far since they remembered Garry Marshall's rejected pilot. ABC called up Marshall and asked him to make some changes to his original concept. He complied,and thus a legend was born when it hit the airwaves in 1974.<br/><br/>\"Happy Days\" also brought to life the creation of a classic TV character who would become one of the greatest icons of our time. Within its first season,the show climbed into the top ten of the Nielsens. With the character of Arthur Fonzarelli becoming into view, it was Henry Winkler that made him a television icon not to mention a part of the culture of 1970's shows too. Even the catchphrases that were used became national and from there made their way into the hearts of viewers. The phrases were: \"Sit On It!\" and \"Ayyyi!\". It was here that the show \"Happy Days\" went straight to Number One for the first three seasons(1974-76) that it was on the air,and basically gave the network ABC,a domineering force in the ratings competition.<br/><br/>After the success of the first season,Marshall was tinkering with the show,and with public response the audience demanded more and from there Marshall answered the call with three \"Happy Days\" spin off. First,Marshall created \"Laverne and Shirley\". Fonzie's friends Laverne DeFazio(Penny Marshall)and Shirley Feeney(Cindy Williams)first appeared in a 1975 episode. In 1976,they were given their own show,\"Laverne and Shirley\",which ran on the network for seven years (1976-1984)and was a ratings winner as well. Then Garry Marshall used \"Happy Days\" as a launching pad for Robin Williams' space alien character,Mork. In the fall of 1978,Williams was starring in the second spin off,\"Mork and Mindy\",which ran on the network for four seasons(1978-1981),and also was a launching pad for Pam Dawber as well. After the success of the these shows,ABC also launched the characters of \"The Fonz\",\"Laverne and Shirley\",and \"Mork\" into their own Saturday Morning cartoon shows which were very good.<br/><br/>By the 1980's,the show suffered a decline as well with Ron Howard and Donny Most leaving the show and that would follow with the magic that was once brilliant,but viewers found themselves losing interest with the show and by the last four seasons of the series,it was slipping into a downhill spiral within the ratings and from there Marshall again made several changes. To add new life to the sitcom,the writers added new life to The Cunninghams world as a new rebel move into town,Fonzie's cousin Chachi Arcola(Scott Baio)who had the hots for the Cunninghams daughter Joanie. From there the third and final spin-off of \"Happy Days\" intitled \"Joanie Loves Chachi\" was made into a weekly series,which lasted one season. In some of the episodes,most of magic that made this series great was gone by the start of 1983-1984 season. In 1980,the Smithsonian Museum of American History honored the series' role in America's pop-culture history by placing Fonz's leather jacket on display. After an astounding 255 episodes,the final episode of \"Happy Days\" came on July 12,1984,with the marriage of Joanie and Chachi tying the knot and also in the series final episode was the return of Richie(Ron Howard)and Ralph Malph(Donny Most).", "rating": null, "helpful": "5 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "29 September 2005"}, {"title": " \"Goodbye Gray Skies, Hello Blue\"", "content": "For a decade those who grew up in the Seventies got a look back at what the culture was like for their parents with Happy Days.

Howard realizes he's been taking advantage of his wife and he works it out with her.

Now of course, I was only 11 when I was watching the first season and I guess since it had grown up's in it, I assumed it was true to life. I grew up missing later seasons after Mary went to Buffalo to be with her grandparents. So years went by, not watching the show, not even missing it, but then one day I noticed on ABC Family that they were beginning to show the re-run's, so I figured I would watch the series again and give it another shot.<br/><br/>The plot is basic, a minister's family has daily problems, usually mediocre and over blown. We have Eric, the dad and husband, he's also a minister at the local church. Annie, his wife and mother of 7, she's a home maker, tries to do little jobs here and there, but I guess Eric prefers her living at home. Matt who is the oldest brother, he's also throughout most of the series in college studying to be a doctor. Mary, the second oldest, a basketball star in high school, but goes onto \"evil deeds\" later on, the rebel of the family. Lucy, the third oldest, the drama queen sister. Simon, the fourth oldest, who is the bank to his siblings and is always having girl problems. Ruthie, the fifth oldest, the little know it all who gives advice and goes to special school for her talents. And lastly, the twins, who are the youngest, don't really get much character development on the show.<br/><br/>Now we have major problems with this show that I realized, first off Aaron Spelling casts unbelievably good looking teens(who look nothing alike, when they're supposed to be siblings), not to mention their unrealistic reactions to their problems. I have learned from this show that you can heavily make out with guys, but it'll never lead to sex. If you're a smoker, you're a bad person. You can easily turn anyone else's problem into your own. When horrible problems occur that have nothing to do with you, guilt yourself, it's your fault somehow, even if you had no clue what was going on. If your wife is on hormones and drives you beyond insane(understandably), you remain patient and tolerant. Also, if you have a few financial problems, have one beer, don't go to college because you wanna figure out what you would like to do, oh, no, you can't do that in the Camdon family, they'll just ship you off to Buffalo.<br/><br/>I think another problem I have with this show is that it's somewhat sexist, Annie is a house wife who really is more of a nut case than a strong female. If Lucy and her husband, Kevin, got into a fight, he just kissed her off and wouldn't talk to her about the problem. And in later seasons, Ruthie got some kind of a boyfriend at a young age, and she said she would die without him, it was just ridiculous. Another thing was how annoying an episode would be with a problem, some how everyone in the family had the exact same problem going on of some sort. The twins finishing each other's sentences was not cute, it showed a lack of material for them.<br/><br/>I don't mean to complain so much about the show, it just had horrible acting and unbelievable situations. While it might be good for pre-teens, this is sadly not an adult show, it's insulting to the mind. I would love to say something good for this show, but I can't really, because it's hard to think about one good thing that I could say, it doesn't really have anything good. None of the characters are lovable, like Ruthie, who was supposed to be the wise one of the family was more annoying than tolerant.

The main family itself is huge, but when you add about 15 side characters the relationships become a bit too hard to follow.

In one episode, Ruthie writes letters to a U.S. soldier who is stationed in Afghanistan. Then she gets all worried when the guy stops writing back, and the preacher father ends the episode by reciting a sermon about America's heroes. Now, I'm all for being patriotic and all that jazz, but that entire episode seemed to be written in about five minutes and tacked onto the season just so the staff could win an Emmy. I'm willing to bet money that the writers just open up the paper to the Opinion section, close their eyes, point at a random story, and then write a script based on the issue. Going back to how complicated the show has gotten, I'd just like to note that it is very frustrating when the characters have boyfriends and girlfriends so many times in a season that you have no idea what's even happening any more. Seriously, you can skip one episode and someone will be married/divorced/pregnant/in a coma the next week. Talk about drastically changing plot lines! Now I'd like to talk about the most unintentionally hilarious episode, AKA the one that discussed the issue of marijuana. I could not believe how politically charged this one episode was, and my jaw was literally on the floor at how exaggerated the story was presented.

When he sees that Matt is eating more than two or three cookies, the camera zooms in on his sweaty, worried face. Why, Matt must have (gasp!) THE MUNCHIES! Dun, dun, DUN! Then one of the girls is acting tired. Why, she must be (gasp) HIGH! Dun, dun, DUN!! I mean, come ON! He even suspects Ruthie, who was probably 6-years-old at the time. Talk about overreacting. So anyway, the dad drags his wife into the bedroom and they discuss who might have brought the joint home. \"Did you see Matt wolfing down those cookies? That's a sure-fire sign of (gasp!) THE MUNCHIES!\" the dad whispers, afraid that his Christian neighbors will hear him. We then learn that the wife smoked some pot in college, and the dad literally freaks out. He comes this close to disowning his wife because she hit a couple of doobies when she was younger. Yes, God forbid someone does drugs when they're in college. I say, anyone who smokes weed is evil. EVIL, ya hear me?! So the dad puts the joint in his dresser drawer for safe keeping, and minutes later one of his daughters finds it while looking for something to wear. GASP!

Everyone over the age of 6 knows that smoking is bad but that doesn't mean all smokers are bad.  The same with drinking.  The same with sex.  Its unrealistic to portray all of the kids as virgins with all the heavy making out that gets shown.  And further more its detrimental because it gives the impression that that heavy petting doesn't lead to sex with most people.  Why is there never an episode that deals with these complicated problems in a realistic manner? Why does an associate pastor drive a BMW, is it really that lucrative of a job? Why do the Camdens have expensive bottled water if they're so poor? Why do the girls on this show so often need the approval of men? Why? Why? Why? This show and countless others like it merely perpetuate unrealistic notions concerning appearance, romance, and income.  So really is this what you want your children watching?

The acting is beneath sub-par--with kids who were clearly picked more for their \"look\" than their acting abilities. The writing is so syrupy and pedestrian as to make \"Martha Stewart's Living\" look edgy and sophisticated by comparison. And the production quality looks like that of a 5th-rate syndicated show from 1987.<br/><br/>And, yet there is something oddly mesmerizing about this show. Maybe it's Aaron Spelling's knack for populating a world with such pretty people with such simple, easily solved problems. Maybe it's part of a secret desire to live in such an uncomplicated world where good guys are soapy pure and every house has a picket fence. Or maybe I just like to ogle Jessica Biel.<br/><br/>But what I really think is so appealing about this show is its camp value. Like a really cheesy B-horror film, 7th Heaven is at its best when it's at it worst. The hokier the story-line, the worse the acting; the more you have to laugh at it.

No one is that good and moral all the time, even if their father is a minister. The creators basically took the most bland, boring people and exaggerated their characteristics.<br/><br/>We have the 'all-knowing father'(is the WB trying to tell us something?)that is ALWAYS right.

The oldest all knowing brother(with no balls), the good-girl turned bad-girl sister, the sister with no other personality trait but whining and complaining, the blonde brother who at 28 is still sharing a room with his little sister, and the second youngest,and somehow smartest member of the family, sister that hasn't yet been told she's adopted. Oh, and the twins, that no one has realized are mentally retarded.<br/><br/>Said family traipses through generic \"troubles\" for an hour, but everything is resolved (always in a sappy way), no matter how bad the situation. The end. How the creators can believe that anyone anywhere relates to this family is beyond me. Some of the situations these people get into are so beyond ridiculous that you laugh instead of empathize. And that just makes for awkward television.<br/><br/>Like the episode where Ruthie(no older than 6)wears a hat in class. Her teacher tells her to take it off, Ruthie doesn't listen, the teacher takes this as meaning Ruthie will be in a gang when she gets older, and takes the opportunity to discuss this with Ruthie's parents.

Older bro Matt comes to his rescue (did he need to be rescued?)and tells him he shouldn't be hanging out with \"those kind of people\".<br/><br/>Basically the show is telling us that the Camdens are what you and your family should be like.

It's saying, these Camdens(who are flippin' crazy)are the model of what is good and moral. Anyone who dresses funny, has a tattoo, smokes cigarettes, or does anything even remotely scandalous, is bad and completely non-redeemable.

However, as the years went on, 7th Heaven fell victim to the vapid nonsense themes that plagues most of the WB's teen-based dramas.<br/><br/>7th Heaven, for those who have never seen it, is basically about the Camden family. Eric, a minister, lives with his wife and what used to be only five kids--though that number has become indefinite as people move in and out and more surprise pregnancies occur to try to comepensate for boring storylines. So, basically, it's just a show dealing with various family crises that arise.<br/><br/>I never thought of the show as much of a role model for young girls, who seem to be a large part of the show's audience, particularly because of the young teen cast (i.e. Barry Watson, David Gallagher, and others).

I could only be talking about Bobbie Spencer's and Tony Jones's daughter BJ giving her heart to Frisco and Felicia's daughter Maxie, in the last moments to save her life.  These stories touched many viewers and there are so many more.<br/><br/>Some of the most precious moments on daytime television have occurred on General Hospital, and the highest rated moment on daytime television was Luke and Laura's wedding in 1981.  It was said to be the only wedding ever to rival Princess Diana's.  General Hospital has created feelings, storylines, and characters that go beyond words.  I thank Genie and Tony who play Luke and Laura for bringing out the fantasy we all have about how love should be.  Though they are General Hospital's greatest achievement, I don't think General Hospital's done with them yet!

When I was watching Guiding Light, it was at its peak in 1991. They fired the producer and replaced them with Butcher Phelps. She drove Beverlee McKinsey away by overworking her to death. She killed off beloved Ellen Parker's character Maureen. So Parker won an Emmy but the loss was much worse for the audience. On Another World, she killed off Alice Barrett Mitchell's beloved Mary Frances Frame Winthrop in a ridiculous storyline. On One Life to Live, I could only imagine what she did to that show which took years recover. Now she is ruining General Hospital by driving the great John Ingle away to Days Of Our Lives where he received a contract role. I feel sorry and sympathy for Jed Allan because he has a tough act to follow. The Quartermaines used to be the funnest family on television completely. She drove the great Dame Anna Lee away right before her death. Now Kristina Malandro Wagner refuses to return unless she gets a contract for playing Felicia Jones. Why aren't the veterans of this getting the short end of the stick? I bet Gloria Monty is livid over the show getting Best Drama Emmy under Phelps. I know Monty's heart was always in the right place with this show and her last time around wasn't successful as the Luke &amp; Laura days but still, I know Butcher Phelps track record with soaps. Nobody in the real workplace would allow somebody whose cost so much damage to so many people. I am glad that Robin Strasser is speaking against Phelps' known favoritism for certain actors. I am going to single them out now on General Hospital because it would be unfair. But I know after 25 years of watching soaps, I could do a better job to satisfy both fans and the cast and crew. I am sorry but Phelps is just a Soap Opera Butcher to me. I know Guiding Light was great at the time but she made terrible decisions which cost fans. Now Guiding Light might be up for cancellation! the cast and crew took a pay cut to keep the show afloat. Remember Another World! Phelps was there before she jumped ship to One Life To Live. What goes on behind the scenes must be more fascinating than on screen. Guiding Light and Another World were creations of another daytime diva or queen Irna Phillips who would be turning over in her grave if she knew what this woman has done to her children.<br/><br/>Now Phelps is killing off Alan Quartermaine who has been played faithfully by Stuart Damon for 30 years. I'm concerned that she is going to lose one of the show's best attributes, the Quartermaine Family. She and the network practically drove Anna Lee out over a contract dispute. Even with John Ingle's welcome return, the shadow over the show is still different. I don't blame cast members like Leslie Charleson and others for being so vocal about Damon's departure.

General Hospital has a large and wonderful cast including Robin Christopher, Nancy Lee Grahn, Tony Geary, Rebecca Herbst, Leslie Charleson, Billy Warlock, Stuart Damon, Chad Brannon and so many others. Yet General Hospital seems to waste this large ensemble cast and only use them to prop up four characters, known as the drab four (Sonny,Carly,Jason and Courtney) by some fans. General Hospital has turned into a wanna be Sopranos. They hardly ever showcase the hospital or the families. They have backburned older characters or gotten rid of them, like original cast member Rachel Ames (Audrey Hardy). The show now puts down the police and strong women like Alexis, Elizabeth, Monica and Carly. The writing is god awful and the pairings lack chemistry and are forced, especially the pairing of Jason and Courtney. Alicia Leigh Willis's Courtney showed promise in the beginning but without Billy Warlock's AJ the character and actress is a disaster. Nancy Lee Grahn's Alexis was once a strong independent lawyer who is now reduced to dressing like a man to see her daughter. General Hospital is now the worst show. It is appalling.<br/><br/>General Hospital needs to write better for it's women, for the police and for all it's characters. They need storylines about family, love, adventure and storylines that are not about the mob. They need couples with actual chemistry that sizzle like Steve Burton and Rebecca Herbst's Jason and Liz, Zander and Emily or Alexis with either Luke, Ned, or Cameron.

Separate from the incredible actors and guests in the new episodes, the continuous jump cuts and poor cinematography take away certain characteristics from the storytelling.\nWhile I believe Serling pushed his viewers to the boundaries of imagination while shedding light on taboo social topics, the new revival ironically backfires with the poor script writing and lack of creative language. \"Suck my p****\", a line in the first episode that instantly caught my attention as poorly written. On the other hand, Jordan Peele's depiction as The Narrator is incredible and his dialogue is told with much needed care.\nIn the original series, take note that many scenes feature incredible monologues and little need for scene-cutting. It is truly theatrical. Example, a popular episode starring William Shatner titled \"Nick of Time\", when two newlyweds are confined to a diner by a fortune-telling machine. This episode takes place almost entirely inside a diner with a simple 2-shot camera set up with a few insert shots.\nMany of the original Twilight Zone episodes are produced in this manor. Respectively, Rod Serling and the producers did not have the biggest budget to film the original series. Also the lack of technology forced the use of practical effects in this era of film, which helped push the storytelling into dialogue-driven tales. This does not translate into the new series very well, thus letting down fans of the original series.<br/><br/>Lastly, there are no clouds and there is no rain at 30,000 ft.

But I'm glad I did check it out; this hilarious, over the top romp was a blast from start to finish. Let me warn you, though: it's a bit of an acquired taste and certainly not for everyone. But if you like the sort of raunchy humor the Rogen/Goldberg brand usually stands for, AND you're a fan of the most iconic sci-fi blockbusters that came out over the last 30 years, chances are you're going to love it.<br/><br/>So what exactly is it? Well, the story pretty much recycles nearly every important plot point from nearly every better known sci-fi flick that came out over the past three decades; the show gleefully rampages through everything from 'Back To The Future' to 'Terminator I &amp; II' to 'The Butterfly Effect' and shamelessly plunders and spoofs whatever it likes along the way. And it actually doesn't limit itself to just spoofing sci-fi: from 'Easy Rider' to 'Top Gun' nothing is safe from 'Future Man', and if you started a drinking game and had to take a sip every time you spotted a reference from another movie, you'd be drunk 20 minutes into the first episode.<br/><br/>But it's not all just lose references and jokes, and despite starting a bit uneven pacing wise and initially giving off the impression of an overlong comedy sketch, 'Future Man' actually soon has an engaging story to tell that ends up being quite original in its own right. As the show goes on, the characters become more than just caricatures, and chances are you'll absolutely love them by the end; they even all get satisfying arcs (naturally, of the more hilarious sort).<br/><br/>My verdict: For sci-fi nerds and fans of over the top comedy (who don't mind the occasional bit of gore, semen or other bodily fluids) this is a must. 8 Stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/", "rating": 8, "helpful": "177 out of 204 found this helpful.", "date": "21 January 2018"}, {"title": " Not for dumb dumbs!", "content": "This is a solid little show.

Season 1: 10/10 Season 2: 2/10<br/><br/>Season 1: From the first episode I was hooked, it was one of the best and unique shows I have watched in a while, the jokes were funny and the whole concept of what the main characters had to do was hilarious. All 3 main characters were very likable and the character development was great. There was not a single episode I didn't like in season 1. If you haven't watched it, stop wasting time and go watch it.<br/><br/>Season 2: I was very disappointed with season 2, they took all the character development, all the fun and wacky concepts from season 1 and threw them away. The show became something more akin to a rubbish sitcom complete with a musical, and there was some slight political pandering that should have been kept out of the show, there was good parts of the episodes and funny parts, where I would laugh the whole way through season 1, season 2 would only get a giggle every now and then and watching the episodes became a slog. My favorite character of the show Wolf, turned into a completely different person, I would say he had the most character development of any character in season 1 and in season 2 it was like it never happened and he was someone else.<br/><br/>The one redeemable aspect of season 2 is that the last 2 episodes did get back the feel of season 1 and if there is to be a season 3 I really hope they capture that magic of season 1 once more, it would be a shame to see such a great concept of a TV show die. I really hope someone important see this review ( doubt it ) and makes sure that season 3 goes back to season 1s glory. I would also heavily advise to stay away from any politics, franchise after franchise are failing due to them becoming political and I do not want to see Future Man go this way. Seth Rogen is capable of producing something better than season 2, I hope he and the other producers realize that season 2 was definitely not where fans wanted the series to go.<br/><br/>Overall the series would get 7/10 I wish I could give it higher but season 2 almost ruined everything about the show.

By the 5th or 6th episode of season 1, you begin to get a better sense of the characters, and the chemistry is developed. Also, their seems to be a bit more weight in the plot. The last half of episode 1 is completely addictive and hilarious, with Wolf becoming COMPLETELY over the top. In the end, the show blew my mind. Yep, it's still a bit potty humor, but on an adult scale. The references to certain things (like the whole Corey Hart tie in) is pure genius. The characters (Josh or Joosh, Tiger, and Wolf) develop and display their talents in such a way that goes beyond what I initially thought would ever happen.<br/><br/>That said (SPOILER ALERT), Josh's (or actually, Joosh's) dad's reaction and acting in the nursing home was unbelivable!

I was initially a little off-put by the show's strange pacing (it is a drama series with half-hour long episodes), but by the third episode I was really digging it. Although the story moves at a slow pace, it is thoroughly engrossing and packed full of spine-tingling moments.<br/><br/>I have not listened to the podcast this is based on, as I wanted to go in blind, but I'm a massive fan of Mr. Robot and was very excited to see what Sam Esmail would do with a pure noir. I was not disappointed. The directing of the series is ridiculously strong, including some familiar Esmail-isms (top-down shots, unusual framing, etc) and a lot of steady-cam and long shots. The third episode in particular had a number of images that took my breath away.<br/><br/>Outside of the directing, the acting is probably the strongest element of the show. Julia Roberts and Stephan James bring impressive depth and emotion to the two lead roles, while the other characters are more defined by their quirks and are often used comedically. Shea Wigham in particular stands out because of all the subtle little mannerisms he employs to define his character. Bobby Cannavale is also very good, although his character is quite mysterious at this stage.<br/><br/>Overall, I am really loving Homecoming so far, and would recommend it to anybody who likes a good mystery, although it might be a good idea to wait until the whole season is out so it can be watched in hour-long chunks.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "281 out of 359 found this helpful.", "date": "8 September 2018"}, {"title": " Rather straightforward story that could have been told in 90 to 120 minutes.", "content": "We have Amazon Prime so I was able to stream this through my Roku.<br/><br/>It stars Julia Roberts, who was also a producer, as Heidi Bergman.

The experimental approach involves a sleek, comfortable Florida setting complete with therapists who are unwitting of their actual role, and mind control by means of experimental drugs.<br/><br/>By the end of S1, it is not clear at all who is calling the shots at this facility as employees all seem to have an outsized opinion of their function when, in fact, they each perform as cogs in another more nefarious plan. What they are doing to the veterans becomes evident eventually. That's when the wheels fall off. Crises of conscience are suffered leading to illicit use of or dependence on the mystery drug.<br/><br/>Fans of Mr. Robot will probably love this. Viewers looking for more explicit action and quick pacing will probably be too bored to stick with it. Fans of Kubrick, Lynch, or in my case, Denis Villeneuve, will recognize the influences of these and other directors. But Esmail is no copycat. His use of the long shot is not as painfully suspended as Kubrick's. Whenever the camera hangs on long, the viewer can observe character development as the actor acts with their eyes and face. Esmail chooses the most arbitrary set details to linger on just barely long enough for you to begin to suspect a clue, or foreshadow, is being given (I just knew that pelican in the beginning had its own particular role in the game, beyond just posing majestically).<br/><br/>Symbolism is everywhere, but the use of if is woven into the background, never in your face, never overstated as is the case with so many of the most popular police procedural shows (i'm thinking of Law &amp; Order SVU, NCIS, or anything involving Bruckheimer). By way of example, the contractor is named Geist which translates to \"ghost\" from German. Another one: at Geist headquarters where the various divisions are named after tree species, the division where Colin Belfast (played by Cannavale) resides is named after the Manchineel tree, a southern US native tree commonly called the beach apple, and everything on the tree is toxic. These are a couple of the most obvious cases. Less clear are tiny things like Heidi Bergman's (played by Roberts) rarely observed slight obsessive-compulsive disorder. What does that mean?<br/><br/>Esmail's fingerprints are unique and found throughout this series. Scoring and sound is used to identify certain characters and situations, much the same way as Esmail does in Mr. Robot, leitmotif. Birds eye view camera shots enhance the feeling of suspense/suspicion. The overhead-and-a-few-feet-behind camera trailing the slow moving car is ripped directly off the S2 final episode of Mr. Robot. It made me smile. One curious appropriation still has me spooked. A piano study is played through the ending of ep. 8 when Heidi Bergman is at her rock bottom lowest, having just discovered the true malice of her employer and what role she played in condemning the vets. The music, here newly arranged, is thematic music from a little seen old Coppola move, The Conversation, an excellent suspense noir also involving hidden motives, surveillance, and paranoia.<br/><br/>Esmail is outstanding in my estimation, and I believe we've only gotten the tip of his iceberg. He develops characters like nobody else today, and often with very little dialogue being used. Characters are sympathetic and complex, possessing both virtues and negative traits. At 30-minute episode pacing, this series is dangerously prone to binge material. And yet, in that short span Esmail conveys a level of suspense followed up with cliffhangers that one by one produce a heavy sense of dread.

It's entertaining, it's interesting, it has some pretty good humor, and I liked the casting choices. However, this show is soooo not original, the content is very shallow (meaning no depth), and I find it hard to follow at times.<br/><br/>I knew I wasn't going to care about it before it even aired. I saw the promo with Taraji and Terrance, and instantly thought it was an unoriginal \"Hustle and Flow\" spin-off. Aside from that, it already looked messy. So, I didn't see it when it premiered. Well, my co-workers were praising the show the next day at work like it was the best thing to happen to television. So, yeah, that got my curiosity going. By that time I was aware that Empire in fact was not a Hustle and Flow knock-off. More like an urban \"Dynasty\", a soap opera, which was one of the inspirations for Empire (Daniels mentioned this himself).<br/><br/>I was not impressed by the first episode. In the first scene Lucius is telling a singer to think about her brother who got shot in order to convey more emotion in her singing a song about love and loss. So, right away, I thought that the show was already bordering on too dramatic with the whole \"I need you to REALLY bring the pain\" dynamic of that scene. Just ask her to remember her first break up and go from there. Gosh. The flashback scenes with the gay son Jamal dressed like a woman were somewhat unrealistic to me because of how they played out. Why did the kid dress that way and then just stand there in front of everyone? What was the point of that? He didn't even pretend like he was modeling the clothes or anything like how you play dress-up. He just stood there and looked stupid. Was he making a statement? Anyway, Lucius throwing his son in the garbage was really traumatic for some viewers and made some people cry. But, I thought it was a bit extreme, and I almost stopped watching after that. I also wasn't too thrilled with the fact that the writer being gay made the gay son the most sympathetic character with hardly any flaws compared to everyone else. Is that really fair? Makes me feel as though Jamal can do no wrong and will always just be a victim and if not him, then any other gay character. On top of that, I can't stand Jamal's weak, shaky singing voice. How are people saying that he sounds so great? I'm not convinced that the writer knows how to write believable black female characters (speaking as a black female). Cookie is loud and obnoxious, which makes for good drama and entertainment. I'm not mad at her being real, and having flaws. However, there are times when I really wish Cookie would stop wearing her feelings on the outside all the damn time. Honestly, there are times when I believe she could be upset or disappointed about something without being so obvious or over-the-top. I wish she could be more cool in certain situations. The way she deals with Lucius' girl, Anika makes her look extra pressed in almost every scene. But, I guess if she toned it down, she would be less \"real\", so that won't be an option.<br/><br/>Lucius is a piece of ****. As far as I'm concerned, he doesn't treat any of his sons right, even his \"favorite\", Hakeem. What does any of his relationships even mean to him? Seriously. Why is he acting like he can't decide which son should be CEO of Empire? Clearly, it should be mature, business-savvy Andre, but, he leans more towards Hakeem the \"star\". His struggle with the decision really annoyed me from the very first episode and just convinced me that Lucius was simple as hell. In later episodes it shows that Lucius suddenly doesn't seem to trust Andre. Okay, whatever.<br/><br/>When it comes to a show like Empire that combines music with drama, it sometimes feels like I am being forced to listen to music that I don't like. The \"You're So Beautiful\" track from the show is honestly getting on my nerves. I don't care to hear Cookie or Lucius attempt to sing at times, either. But, that's more of a personal thing, so moving on...<br/><br/>I ended up binge watching the first 9 episodes of Empire OnDemand just so that I wouldn't be out of the loop and to give it a fair judgment instead of copping out after the first episode. Afterwards, I was thoroughly convinced that this show is over-rated... but, not horrible. I do think that for this show to be as real and raw as it aspires to be, it would have to be a netflix series or featured on a premium cable channel where it wouldn't be censored. I can give it 4 stars. The writing is very lacking with poorly developed characters and predictable plots.

That's probably why it has the ratings now. I just wonder about its creation.<br/><br/>It seems kind of odd that this almost all black show was created by a gay white man (Danny Strong) who then gets Lee Daniels, a gay black man, to help develop a show full of black stereotypes and maybe even some fabrications? I have no qualms with the two of them creating a show, but it just seems like it would have been more authentic if they'd made something that was closer to themselves, like perhaps a show about a black and white interracial homosexual couple and their struggles. Instead, they make this.<br/><br/>I understand that Mr. Daniels said this show parallels his childhood, but growing up in a hip hop family really wasn't his childhood. I can only hope that the unbelievable extravagance of dysfunction seen on this show wasn't his childhood too. At least with a show like Game of Thrones, you know that it's all made up and not meant to parallel any reality. I think this show makes the mistake of not making that distinction clear.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by the outline of the show, and I wanted to like it, but after watching a few episodes I do not think it represents anything positive. There is quite a lot of colorism. Only the darkest people are \"servants,\" and the lightest are the upper crust. They even manage to have that hierarchy with the Lyon sons, with the lightest (Jamal) being the obvious favorite of the show, the next lightest being the oldest son who's the \"smart one\" that married and is controlled by his white wife (she literally grabs him by the balls and tells him what to do and he obeys like a child), and then the darkest (Hakeem?) is the youngest son who is bratty, brash, disrespectful, and a wannabe thug. It's also interesting that he's the only of the three sons that seems to like dating his own race, while the \"smarter\" and more \"sensible\" brothers don't. It doesn't stop there.<br/><br/>The father dumps the faithful black wife (Cookie) he had, a woman who went to prison so he wouldn't have to for seventeen years, even going so far as to divorce her and forget about her and keep the kids away while she was locked up for the sake of their family. She gets out and he's marrying a biracial (black/white) woman who the show portrays as more desirable and better than Cookie. They show Cookie as an annoyance and someone to tolerate because they can't get rid of her because she knows too much. It seems odd to me that the sons don't seem to care too much about her. The only possible positive is that she does end up being the most likable character on the show, though I'm not sure if that's entirely the writing.<br/><br/>For anyone not sensitive and knowledgeable about racial issues and contexts relating to racism, I think a lot of this will fly over your head, but subliminally it's being shown every second. They call this show \"real,\" but I doubt that it is. I think they deal with some real issues in some very unreal ways, sometimes even insulting the intelligence (or taking advantage of the lack of intelligence) of their audience. Some of the messages I got were that we're all supposed to love homosexuality (which I have no problem with) and that black people should glorify racism by promoting and practicing colourism against other people of color, not to mention being stereotypes themselves. This is on top of the messages about backstabbing, cheating, killing, robbing, and more.

We've seen many examples and of course we have also seen people that handle it pretty well too.<br/><br/>Whether they are athletes, actors or singers or whatever, they are all subjected to all sorts of seductions, schemes, paparazzi, and of course freeloading people around them.

Though I think some of the criticism the show received was valid, overall I enjoyed the run and I'm glad it came to an end before it wore itself into the ground.<br/><br/>At the conclusion of his career as a professional football player, Spencer Strasmore (Dwayne Johnson) looks to transition into the role of a sports advisor/agent, assisted by his friend Joe Krutel (Rob Corddry). Once they increase their talent portfolio, including gifted but troubled Ricky Jerret (John David Washington), the money and the prestige begins to grow but Spencer hasn't forgotten his time on the field, and is looking to find some way to improve the lot for the men who risk their health on a game by game basis, but miss out on the unbelievable wealth.<br/><br/>It has to be said that in terms of drama, \"Ballers\" is more like \"Dallas\" than say \"Billions\". It's more soapy and is generally pretty much consequence free. There is lip service paid to more consequential themes, such as concussion protocol and drug use - but the shows not willing to make any of its leads really go through anything like that. Instead, they generally just flirt with failing, only to come good at the end. This is not to say that the show is not good. The three actors I mention in the above paragraph are all great and find ways to make you care about their characters, even if they have lives that many would be envious of. You can add to that list the character that has the most interesting arc, Charles Greane played by Omar Benson Miller. He goes from retired defensive linesman to the General Manager position.<br/><br/>There are other criticisms that you can level, it's portrayal of women is hilariously offensive, the money available to the characters comes from ... nowhere and is endless ... and the desire to up the stakes each season, rather than drilling further into the characters was a poor one.

The story line feels very thought out and not just thrown together, I am enjoying the changes they made to the \"present\" time it feels more realistic(not sure of how to describe it) than the 1995 movie. The lead actor Aaron Stanford really nails the part of Cole, as does Amanda Schull as Cassie. I hope they get a series 2 and keep this going!

It is even better than Firefly (another of my favorite series), ten times over.<br/><br/>It is an utter shame that lazy critics never took the time to actually watch this spectacular series before reaching into what could only be drawers-full of unpublished reviews, picking a negative one at random and calling it their two cents.<br/><br/>12 Monkeys, the television series, is superbly written and acted; the costumes are spot-on perfection; the eras stupendously depicted; the plot is both excellently engrossing and magnificently moving - it is amazing in almost every which way that a series should be, and then some which other series never even attempt.<br/><br/>Granted, some of the first-season episodes are a little too filler-esque to hold the attention of those who want a series which will grab them from the get-go. In fact, the ONLY problem this series has, is that it wants to give you just a bit much at the beginning, BUT if one is just a little patient _or an expert at skipping just a bit_ not only is the payoff a supremely gratifying payoff, but the journey toward it is a fantastically, IMMENSELY riveting and enveloping ride where you as the audience, feel immersed in every little bit of what the masterful creators are bringing to the screen with what you can tell, is utter love for what they are presenting.<br/><br/>In short, while most television series lose bits of themselves as they count down to their inevitable conclusion, it is NOT an exaggeration to say that each episode of 12 Monkeys, from good beginning to spectacular end, is better than the last episode. There is no way that it will not become a cult classic. It is touching, heartfelt, humorous, sad; it deals with the love and loss of friends, family and lovers; it teaches, points out, reveals. It is magnificent and silly and reverent, deep, thought-provoking, heart-achingly poignant, heart liftingly funny, heartwarming and heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>I am so glad I found it; would highly recommend no one miss it, and will go a step further in saying that if you do, you are robbing yourself of a wonderful viewing experience.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "7 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "2 February 2021"}, {"title": " Love it and will watch over and over again", "content": "This is the first review I've ever written.

There are tiny moments or seemingly throwaway lines that hint at the ultimate answer/endgame. (These making rewatching the series even more rewarding than the first time around, again fitting for a series based on a story about a causality loop.) The characters are complex and there is something to love and be angry about with all of them.<br/><br/>The stakes are continually raised. When the inciting incident is a plague that ends the world, it's difficult to raise the stakes each successive season. However the storytellers manage to pull it off every time, both by going \"bigger\" and going \"smaller,\" meaning making the stakes very personal. The audience cares about these characters, and the storytellers reward them for that.<br/><br/>Given the typical budgets of SYFY series, what the producers were able to pull off here is nothing less than amazing. From effects to set design to the location shoots, this feels like a drama that has a LOST-level budget.<br/><br/>There are more reasons to love this series, but it's impossible to get into without spoiling it.

The premise of a time traveler returning to an earlier period to alter future events is not a new one within the realm of Science Fiction by any stretch of the imagination. What made the movie special was a combination of directorial vision, superb writing, excellent acting, and mood enhancing cinematography - all the requisite elements for delivering an engaging piece of dramatic fiction. It was a story told well with effective pacing which reached a satisfying conclusion within the span of one sitting.<br/><br/>My first thought upon learning this story was being re presented within a re-imagined version spanning an untold number of episodes throughout a television series was that I hoped they would be able to pad it with enough substance for it to maintain interest. We have already been witness to the far too many entertainment failures by many who have attempted to re-purpose completely self-contained short works into unsuitable formats. Video game adaptations are the first culprits which come to mind. The games themselves may have been engaging in an interactive format but fell miserably flat when translated into a passive medium. Doom is probably one of the best (or at least most popularly recognized) examples of this sort of effort. Some short stories by authors have been more successful than others, such as those penned by Stephen King - but I believe his work lends itself well to a visual interpretation.<br/><br/>Although there are examples of movies successfully translated into television series such as the two espionage shows based upon the character named \"Nikita\" (first embodied by Anne Parillaud); I don't recall any other efforts in porting a story as self-contained and complete as Twelve Monkeys (I am willing to stand corrected on this score). I wondered how they would manage maintaining suspense when we were already familiar with the broad strokes of the mystery. It struck me a like having read the end of a novel before starting at the beginning. I assumed the creative vision required to keep viewers in suspense necessitated altering that mystery in a significant way without diluting its punch.<br/><br/>In watching the first season, it became abundantly clear that it is an homage to the vision first circumscribed by Terry Gilliam. The creators and writers have clearly studied the source to such a degree they likely can recite every line spoken and describe with abundant detail every scene in the movie. Their efforts shine through and have paid off in a way to deliver an engaging story to audiences of this genre. People who struggle with continuity in a story that jumps about through various time periods where the past is often a future event, it can be a confusing effort in keeping track of a linear accounting of events and character progressions. Nonetheless, the writers and production staff succeed in their efforts to ensure clarity is provided through visual cues and references to leading events.<br/><br/>The production values remain true to the original vision in an albeit less foreboding tone but that sort of atmosphere can become too oppressive to want to experience it over the long haul of multiple seasons. The \"whodunit aspect\" of the mystery is delivered with a sufficient number and degree of twists to keep audiences guessing. It also a show which, due to its expansion over the original, allows for character exploration and development and this lends dimension beyond what we experienced within the movie version.<br/><br/>We are witness to evolving dynamics which change characters on a fundamental level and which lead to implications affecting outcomes. The entire structure of the story is altered by character developments and this approach successfully maintains its integrity as a mystery to be solved. Unlike the movie where the mystery is unraveled with a neat ending twist in one time period, the series ties together multiple time-lines to weave a web of interconnected intrigue from past, to present, to future. Each time it appears we have gotten closer to knowing who has been responsible for destroying human civilization and why, we are introduced to a new turn of events which shatter our illusions of certainty.<br/><br/>This short story however, having been subjected to an expansion well beyond its original intent does introduce moments when one becomes impatient for progress. I must admit though, that my own patience had been blurred by personal events which made it difficult for me to maintain my degree of engagement on a weekly basis. As I have become jaded by the experience of weekly doses of entertainment in favour of binge watching, I would recommend one set aside the requisite time to experience this series in this manner to achieve maximum enjoyment.<br/><br/>I do recommend watching the movie first - if you have not already, but that perhaps might be because it's my own frame of reference. I do believe though, that there are a sufficient number and degree of differences between the movie and the serial to preclude boredom. I believe the movie offers a conceptual point of entry into the series which adds dimension to questions about where the story will lead. I also think that one can find themselves more easily lost in tracking events within the series well enough to follow along without losing interest in discovering where its destination may lead.<br/><br/>The production values are solid, the writing is creative and clever, and the characters are well cast, acted, and scripted (with some familiar faces from the most recent Nikita series). (Most of the main characters from the movie have been preserved, but the choice of recasting Brad Pitt's exceptional portrayal of a psychotically disturbed individual in a significantly altered form was an excellent decision.) All in all; for fans of this genre, I believe it is a worthwhile piece of entertainment which can pique curiosity, interest, and empathy while satisfying one's appetite for action-oriented imaginative drama.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "61 out of 95 found this helpful.", "date": "20 July 2015"}, {"title": " Worth giving a chance", "content": "It is always difficult to see something you love exploited.

In its early years,and within the first five seasons,the series had five main characters:Judge Henry Garth(Lee J. Cobb),the owner of the Shiloh Ranch,which was a great big cattle ranch in Wyoming who was also the not only the town Judge but the District Attorney as well;his innocent young teenage daughter Betsy (Roberta Shore);the Virginian(James Drury),his heroic foreman Trampas (Doug McClure),and the assistant ranch hand Steve(Gary Clarke). The relationship between these five individuals,as they were developed and testing were providing the most affecting and amusing moments,and later on during this series new characters would be added on to provide support. It was also during the early years of the show that \"The Virginian\" was rise to the top of the Nielsen ratings,and to anyone's surprise rack up several Emmy nominations for actors Lee J. Cobb and James Drudy not to mention the show's theme song for musical composer Percy Faith. During its initial run,the show was always in the top ten and it stood shoulder to shoulder among the television Western giants like \"Gunsmoke\",\"Bonanza\",not to mention \"Rawhide\",and the courtroom drama \"Perry Mason\".<br/><br/>The series gave us strong,intelligent stories,which could be either tragic or light-hearted,and most often the direction was either imaginative,and sometimes even poetic,but still this series was one action-packed show full of unexpected excitement and breathtaking suspense along with some comedical support in some of the episodes which were directed with excellent timing by some of the best in the business. However,throughout its entire run,only actors James Drudy and Doug McClure stayed on the series until the final episode in 1971. As for the special guest stars on this series,this show had them,and some of them appear in either one or two episodes within the 90 minute time frame. In some of the episodes you got to see Hollywood greats like Bette Davis and Lee Marvin and in some episodes you get Charles Bronson, James Coburn,Richard Anderson,Telly Savalas,Arthur Hunnicutt,John Dehner,David Hartman,Lee Majors,Pippa Scott,Stewart Granger,Diane Baker, Inger Stevens,Harry Morgan,Brian Keith,George C. Scott,Pete Duel,Hari Rhodes,Harrison Ford,and the list of the guest star roster goes on and on with very familiar actors doing the \"Stagecoach\" routine each week.<br/><br/>As the series went on the issues of the day were very informal subjects ranging from injustice,racial prejudice,individual responsibility and the necessary for compromise were explored,and during the final years of the series the name of \"Shiloh\" came to stand for something for the virtues of tolerance,compassion,and courage and optimism as well the respect of mankind were the objectives of the day,and this show delivered the goods. Compared to other Western shows of that era,\"The Virginian\" was well acted and for one,it had a lot of heart and like other shows it knew exactly when to call it quits beforehand. Most recently,this series is now on The Hallmark Channel,and for those who never seen this series,it is a worth seeing every weekend where Hallmark shows back to back episodes of this series.

The cinematography in The Virginian is amazing for a series that started in 1962. Not only was filming a TV series in color unusual at that early time, but the quality of color is outstanding ... each episode looks virtually like a technicolor movie. <br/><br/>Second, most of the scripts are quite compelling. Unlike some Western films, where an complex adventure has to be squeezed into 90 to 120 minutes, the writers of The Virginian knew they had a series of shows to work with. Therefore they opted for somewhat more simple, yet strong, stories that they could explore at a more leisurely pace. It doesn't mean the shows are slow moving ... quite the opposite. It means they have more time for character study, and for the most part this is a real strength of the show.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting is very good. Each show has strong guest stars, a real Who's Who of television and movie actors. The cast also gives strong performances, including an amazing job by James Drury. Why he wasn't treated to more long term starring roles after this is a mystery to me. Even Doug McClure, who walked thru most of the rest of his career trading on his popularity as Trampus, gave strong and believable performances in this series.<br/><br/>Obviously, I highly recommend The Virginian to any fan of westerns.

It was the only western at the time to be in color with a full 90 minute format. It's lengthy time slot allowed for extensive character development and deep plots. The show attracted many famous guest stars of the time because of the amount of screen time that each would be allotted. Because of the shorter time of many westerns, guest stars were not allowed much screen time, as the time was badly needed for developing the central characters. However in The Virginian, there was plenty of time for everyone. The Virginian (James Drury) is the tough minded foreman of Shiloh Ranch, Medicine Bow, WY. He and his top hands especially Trampas are friends who help each outer out in times of trouble. Being weighted down with his many responsibilities, the foreman generally has a more serious nature to his character, and at a glance, might even seem standoffish. However, at heart, he was really a kind and generous person. *His true name was never revealed in the run of the show, which allowed for a sense of mystery to his character.<br/><br/>Trampas was the fun loving cowboy who was the top hand at Shiloh for the entire 9 years of the show's run. Doug McClure succeeded in playing his role to perfection. He was an underrated actor who really did quite well. He was by far the most developed character in the series, and McClure was so popular that he along with James Drury were the only characters to appear as regulars for the entire run of the series. <br/><br/>There were many more characters. A total of five ranch owners owned the ranch from 1962-1971. Their families came and passed with them, and many of them left no explanation as to their leaving. The producers rather chose to let the viewers imagine what might have been the destiny - or fate of the characters. <br/><br/>The Virginian was the third longest running western in television history.

Thanks to syndication by popular channels and DVD releases by Timeless Media Group, this show can now be enjoyed by people of all ages from everywhere.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "9 out of 10 found this helpful.", "date": "30 December 2011"}, {"title": " A pioneering Western", "content": "Compared to other Westerns, the Virginian was a latecomer to British television screens. Preceding it from the late 1950s were Cheyenne, Wagon Train, Rawhide and the like. Initially, all were shown in black and white on very small screens. Although the Virginian was novel in being 75 minutes long and in colour, the team which created it seems to have come from the former era. Blips overlooked in monochrome stand out like a sore thumb in colour, particularly now, when played on the huge screens we have in our homes.<br/><br/>Watching Seasons 3 and 4 (on DVD) for the first time in 50 years, and catching up on Seasons 1 and 2 on Freeview, I was intrigued by the contradictions. There was the ambitious use of acting royalty like Bette Davis and George C Scott, and yet for interior shots, the scenes of the outside world as seen through open doorways, are painted backdrops which look amateurish.<br/><br/>Given my love of Westerns, it's surprising just how unengaged I was initially with the Shiloh regulars. Betsy was close to my age at the time but I didn't identify with her at all. It's like when you read a novel - there needs to be a character with whom you can empathise, one you trust to lead you into the story. For me, that did not happen until Season 3 when Emmett Ryker rode into town. The experience was like Guy Fawkes night, the fireworks those of wit and humour. It was such a clever script. In those days, with no internet to consult, there was no way of finding out if he would appear the following week. There were no video recorders either so if you missed a programme that was it - gone. But he did become a regular, and therefore so did I.<br/><br/>Why Ryker? Sure, Clu Gulager is easy on the eye, but being handsome doesn't necessarily make a person or a character attractive. He was intriguing. Ryker's awkward childhood, his chequered history, are laid bare in that first episode, giving his character instant depth. You understand how his experiences have sharpened his survival instincts and his intellect. At a turning point in his life, he hits the ground running, inner conflict hot wired into him. The mystery is not who he was in the past but who he is going to become in the future as he takes on the role of upholding the law he was sometimes on the wrong side of. In later episodes the scriptwriters refrained from throwing him into doomed love affairs like the ones Doug McClure and James Drury had to endure, which was another huge plus.<br/><br/>With Gulager driving the performance, Ryker is never, ever boring. He had two good years on the Virginian, but then when Season 5 opened on tv, he just wasn't there. For weeks and weeks he was a no show. My interest in watching dwindled and I sought solace with Manolito Montoya over at the High Chaparral. I never went back. Until now.<br/><br/>Watching The Virginian episodes again, knowing how little time the actors and production team were given to create them, it's truly amazing what they managed to achieve. Season 3 in particular is very good. But the gruelling schedule must have taken a toll because from Season 4 onwards, the turnover of regular cast members is constant. Some long absences and disappearances remain unexplained which, with time invested following the story arcs of certain characters, can be frustrating for the viewer.

I'm sure some are, but, for the most part, these are real people with real relationships being \"tempted\" by people that are at least real enough (I think there's a big spectrum of quality on the temptation side, which is exactly how it should be).<br/><br/>Also unlike Love Island, there's no immediate incentive for the people to lie in their solo camera time (Love Island's viewers vote, so the people are obviously just feigning whatever they think the viewers want to hear to stay on the island-- it's annoyingly fake).<br/><br/>The Host! To Love Island's credit, the guy narrating is actually funny, which is extremely rare for Network TV, but TI's Host, Mark Walberg (no, not the one and only pimp daddy Marky Mark) is EXCEPTIONAL. Total pro. He knows exactly when, and how, to interject. Adds class to a show that could easily go in the direction of some brainless Jerry Springer trash. The producers manage to keep the show respectable, which is important for attracting the quality people I'm only interested in watching.<br/><br/>I didn't give it a 10 because S1 had some cheesy music that they did NOT repeat in S2. Also, there was a brief time in S1 where I felt unengaged (the slowest time in both seasons is their 30 second videos).

On one hand you have interesting plots for episodes, crazy situations, and twists and turns, and I'm the other you have predictable plots and writing. The acting was great, they made a smart move by getting actors that have worked on projects previously, and Wyatt Olef is perfect for his role. I enjoyed Sofia's performance as well, she really sold me on her character and her ability to change from being an angry or rude character to a charming and like able one is extremely impressive. I also loved Sofia Bryant, she was great for her role. All the acting was amazing so props to the casting director. One of my main complaints is the inconsistency with the episodes, some of the, were great, some were okay, and some I didn't like very much. This wouldn't be a problem if there were more episodes, but considering there are only 7 it was not convenient. The series doesn't drag along and the music is amazing. It perfectly fits the mood! I do feel like the last episode was the best one, and it made me feel like the story had just begun. That's another big problem. I felt like the first 6 episodes were all leading up to the real show. One good thing to come from this is that it made me want more from the show. The potential really shines through I'm the last episode and we get to see what the writers and directors can really do and I would have liked to see that more extreme tone through the season. I was suspecting something was going to happen but the scene really did leave me in shock. It was amazing! I want more of that in the show. My only advice for the writing team is do your research! Look at what other Netflix shows are doing and do not do that. That is the only way you're getting noticed. Break the clich\u00e9's! You've already started with having the protagonist having a crush on a girl. We rarely see a (possible) LGBTQ+ lead so props to you guys! Make something different and don't be afraid to take risks.

What makes it even more funny is that it seems to be legitimate. With TruTV's programming, most, if not all, of it is fake. Shows like Operation Repo, Hardcore Pawn, Storage Hunters, Lizard Lick Towing, South Beach Tow, etc. all seem to be scripted. Impractical Jokers doesn't have that feel to it, as everything seems genuine -- the pranks, the laughs between the four guys, and everything else. That's what is perhaps the best thing about the show because it's on a channel that airs predominantly scripted shows. Many people seem to think that Impractical Jokers is a reality TV show, but that's definitely not the case. As I said earlier, I thought the show was idiotic at first, but then I began to watch more and more and I have now seen nearly every single episode of theirs.<br/><br/>Another thing that is great about the show is that all four of the guys -- Joe, Murr, Q and Sal -- are very likable. Joe is the guy that never appears to be scared -- on certain pranks that have the three others tell Joe what to say, Joe says it nearly every single time, no matter how embarrassing, awkward, mean or crude it is. Sal, who is perhaps my favorite on the show, seems to be a very genuine guy who doesn't want to make anyone mad and most of the time, loses when the three tell him what to say. Murray, or \"Murr\" for short, is the part of the group that everyone jokes with -- i.e. calling him names, making fun of his looks, getting him to the more embarrassing things, etc. If it weren't for Murr, this show would be a lot less funny. Q... I really don't know about him (haha). He rarely loses and like Joe, is rarely scared.<br/><br/>DEFINITELY check out this show if you haven't already. Impractical Jokers isn't a show like Jackass, as they primarily had very crude stuff on their show. IJ has primarily fun pranks that is sure to get the people around them to laugh hysterically. It's definitely a barrel of laughs and shows a great amount of camaraderie between the four pranksters.<br/><br/>I would love to see Impractical Jokers come out on DVD in the future because there's no question that I would buy the first season or two as soon as it hits the shelves. There's also no doubt in my mind that this is unquestionably the best show on TruTV's network right now. When perusing through the user reviews, completely disregard the negative comments toward this show -- I was once one of those guys, but I'm definitely not like that now. This show is hilarious, check it out!<br/><br/>Be sure to look out for new episodes of Impractical Jokers -- they come on Thursday night.

Joe Gatto, known as Joe, Sal Vulcano, known as Sal, James Murray, known as Murr, and Brian Quinn, known as Q, make one of the funniest and creative comedy troupe I have ever seen. The real gist of the show is that you have to do and say what you are told, mostly, and sometimes other stuff, like trying to get people to do stupid things. It's one of these shows that you really don't care if someone loses, but if someone wins, hooray! Who cares if you might have done the stunts if you were two years old? It's even more funny if you are 35 years old and married. Well, some of them are. Anyway, the boys never fail to be hilarious, and them getting along through their lifetime of friendship makes the show even more enjoyable. Trust me, some of these stunts are making you be happy you weren't on the show. At the beginning of the show, it comes out with a warning that says \"Warning, this show contains scenes of graphic stupidity among four lifelong friends who compete to embarrass each other. Viewer Discretion is advised.\" Making you think it's going to be graphic, but it isn't really. Even my dad laughs at it when I make him watch it, telling you it's hilarious. I laugh through all half hour, which is how long the show is. One of the only things I don't like about the show is that sometimes they curse, not a lot, but when they do, it's in a chain. It doesn't take away from the show, though. The scenes where they have to go up to random people and invade their privacy, are just downright hilarious. I hope this show isn't scripted, because that would really take away from the hilarity of the show. I can rave forever on this show, but, I think I summed it up well enough.

They usually have a goal to accomplish in each episode instead of just teaching or informing people about something. Also, they have a good sense of humor. Impractical Jokers is show that will make you laugh. Impractical Jokers is a show about 4 guys who have been lifelong friends who try to embarrass each other by making them go around and do whatever the other guys tell them to do. For example, if they don't do what they are told; they lose. Additionally, each time they lose; they will get a thumbs down. Yet if they complete the task, they get a thumbs up. In conclusion, whoever has the most thumbs down at the end of the episode, they lose and are the \"big loser.\" For instance, the \"big loser\" usually will have to do a terrible punishment at the of the episode. For example, one time one of the guys had to get a tattoo on their body and they couldn't chose what it would be. The four guys who are in the show have been lifelong friends. Their names are Joe Gatto, Sal Vulcano, Brian \"Q\" Quinn, James \"Murr\" Murray. Also, you can find their show on TBS. Right now, they have done four seasons and are working on their 5th. The show is well put together and has lots of positives. They make the scenarios live in the moment and I love to see the reactions from different people. They also have a great sense of humor and seem to get along with anyone. Yet, on the contrary there are some negatives to the show. I think that they do script who wins and loses each task because some tasks seem fairly simple but then one of them can't complete it. Also they have started to shorten the amount of competitions in the past seasons which make the show not as fun to watch because there are less scenarios. I believe the show will gain more popularity the more seasons they do. The four guys have a great future ahead of them.

First off I am not a professional writer and I don't write reviews very often, so this will just be my little, short take on the show, nothing more and nothing less. <br/><br/>Easy is a Romantic-Drama Anthology series (like Tales from the Crypt did with Horror, Black Mirror with Sci-Fi and so on...), which means that each episode of this show is a self-contained story. Sometimes characters from one episode will have small connections with characters from others, but except for two episodes (Which are also my favorites), the stories aren't connected to each other. <br/><br/>The show has comedic elements but overall I would definitely call it a drama. It is the brainchild of Indie-Filmmaker Joe Swanberg (Drinking Buddies, Digging for Fire). Fans of Mumblecore and artsy Rom-Coms will have a lot of fun with this little gem.<br/><br/>Easy aims at examining the small and big problems in modern-day love relationships and how the people involved deal with them. The writing and acting are absolutely superb, the stories engaging and realistic, the characters and their issues are very relatable and the cinematography is artistic without being pretentious. The overall style, pace and execution reminds me a lot of the even better (HBO) show \"Togetherness\" by the Duplass brothers. I also want to give a small shout-out to the musical score and soundtrack, great song choices! <br/><br/>Some of the actors in Easy are unknown and some are familiar faces, I was definitely surprised to see some A-Listers acting in here, but overall I thought that the lesser known actors fit in more with the indie-vibe the show is going for. <br/><br/>Not every episode blew my mind, but for the most part I absolutely loved Easy and can't wait for season 2!

All I can think is the writers clearly have no personal experience with the disorder at all and needed a band-aid for their shallow writing.\nThroughout the show both the mother and daughter only experience exaggerated episodes of Mania (especially the daughter Kat). I have never experienced or have met anyone that has experienced episodes of Mania like the ones Kat goes through; running 9 miles without realizing it then running 9 more and still having the energy to bounce off the walls, or staring at yourself in the mirror and hearing what sounds like \"white-noise\", or having amnesia from a manic episode. Ridiculous. The same kind of thing is repeated with the Lithium, sleeping for 4 days straight after going back on it, what? Do you wanna know what going on Lithium is really like writers? It's like everything is happening far away and you can't respond to it, you can barely concentrate for .5 seconds at a time, you just exist and your basic instincts are barely registered like needing to go to the bathroom, and at least for me and a few people I've met, severe nausea for like the first week. There's more to it and everyone has different reactions but still not sleeping for 4 days or taking half a pill less than prescribed and flying into a ridiculous manic episode. Also what doctor would prescribe amphetamines for a Bipolar patient? Again, ridiculous.There is more I can point out like the promiscuity but, you know, I have other things to do today.\nThat said there are a few things portrayed somewhat accurately. Like wanting to hide your diagnoses from everyone you know because of general ignorance and stereotypes about the condition (which this show hasn't helped in alleviating). Being obsessed with perfecting something; like with the character Kat, practicing your skating routine over and over and over and still thinking it isn't good enough.\nI really did want this show to be good and a solid representation of a condition most people are still ignorant about, but it just isn't.

Here she plays, herself / Betty Draper again. Not only am I sick and tired of seeing that character, this woman isn't supposed to be a *B*, she is supposed to have bipolar. Not even close to an accurate portal of bipolar. Kaya Scodelario is just horrible as Kat. She too just acts weird and seems to think that is Bipolar. She walks around bug eyed all the time. Probably because her eyes are her best feature but that is not bipolar. Kat is also a very unlikable lead character who I could care less what happens to. She always has a problem that is well made up in her own head. It is annoying. She also is the girl that everyone wants in the world (Mary Sue). All the characters want her because -- as they tell us -- she is so special -- but as an audience member I can see that is not true. When the story starts she fails one of her skating tests. Hardly the top pick for a top pairs couple. They story just keeps telling us how special she is.<br/><br/>Willow Shields plays Kat's younger sister but she is stuck with a plot that is laughable. The suggestion that her coach is after her. Most men in skating are LGBT and if you are a coach in skating you know how to handle crushes and mom crushes. I truly think the story would have been better without the little sister character.<br/><br/>The skating. They set it up right. Establishing that it takes a long time to get a pairs couple trained but everything else is ridiculous. From the \"feelings\" classes the lead couple takes so they can be more together to the lead actress being far too \"large\" to be a pairs skater. Female pairs always have a very petite woman. Finally what in demand male skater chooses to willingly work with a partner who is so difficult when he has his pick? The time line should have been used to show the making of pair but instead every episode follows this same format: Kat is crazy, Kat does something crazy, Kat learns she was wrong, everyone loves Kat anyway. Wow, Mary Sue alert.<br/><br/>Finally, I tuned in for the suggestion of romance with Justin but that too was blown out of the water by making it that Justin is... loose (sleeps with every girl he meets) and had previously slept with Kat.

Ash vs. Evil Dead fires on all cylinders.<br/><br/>After so many years had passed since Army of Darkness (aka Evil Dead III) came out in 1992, it looked like a direct sequel just wasn't going to happen anymore, yet apparently, the Raimi-Campbell gang had been working on one for some time. According to recent interviews with the show's creators Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, what was first supposed to be a new feature film and the fourth entry in the franchise, over time turned into an idea for a TV-series, and I believe fans will be very happy with the result. Instead of a 2-hour film for a sequel, we now get 5 more hours with Ash and the Deadites (possibly more if the show's going to be a success) and judging from what I've seen so far, those 5 hours are going to be an absolute blast.<br/><br/>(This paragraph contains some \u2013 very \u2013 mild spoilers; there won't be any in the rest of this review). At the beginning of the show we meet Ash leading a lazy, but apparently happy slacker life, residing in a run-down trailer and working as a stock boy at a Value Stop (for some obscure legal reasons, the writers couldn't use the name S-Mart from Army of Darkness' iconic last scene). In the show, 30 years have passed since Ash's last encounter with the Deadites, and while he might be well into middle age now, he hasn't matured one bit. Ash is still the exact same guy we last saw fighting walking skeletons and other ghastly undead things in Army of Darkness, cracking wise and appearing as cock-sure of himself as ever (despite still not being the \"smartest cookie in the jar\" - to put it mildly). These days, he likes to spend most of his spare time either getting wasted in his trailer or picking up random ladies - or both (mostly both). I won't go further into any of the story details (because that would only spoil the fun); suffice to say that his rather irresponsible lifestyle ultimately won't go too well with his duty as keeper of a certain (slightly) dangerous book, and (very!) bloody mayhem soon ensues.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Ash vs. Evil Dead does everything right. Instead of going down the \"gritty drama\" route of shows like The Walking Dead or taking the \"straight horror\" approach of Fede Alvarez' Evil Dead remake, creators Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell fully embrace the over-the-top goofiness and playful tone of Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness, while still delivering the scares of the first film and plenty (and I mean: PLENTY) of gore. The Deadites are frightening, but they're also kind of comical in that they don't look too realistic (don't get me wrong, their make-up is gorgeous, but they don't look like the zombies from George A. Romero's films or The Walking Dead). The production values in general are absolutely great; the writing is in the vein of the first three films (no wonder, since the episodes were mostly written by Sam and Ivan Raimi); the music, the pacing and the direction: really everything just falls into place. It's clear that this wasn't some lazy attempt to cash in on the name of a beloved cult-franchise, but a labour of love for all involved.<br/><br/>Another great plus of the series is the cast. Seeing Bruce Campbell step back into this iconic character is simply hilarious fun; it still fits him like a glove (or, perhaps more accurately in his case, a chainsaw). But there was never a doubt in my mind that he would deliver (it seems Ash is a character Campbell was born to play); what really surprised me was how well the rest of the cast fits into the show. Ray Santiago as Pablo and Dana DeLorenzo as Kelly (they're Ash's co-workers at the Value Stop) are completely able to hold their own; they are fully fleshed-out characters and just as fun to watch as Ash.<br/><br/>So my verdict: Ash vs Evil dead brings back everything that I loved about the original Evil Dead films, but it also manages to introduce interesting new characters and story lines which help maintain the element of surprise for long-time fans. And the show works just as well as a stand-alone story, so people unfamiliar with the original trilogy need not worry either: they will find just as much to love here as those who know and cherish Sam Raimi's classics - as long as they have a certain affection for trashy, gory horror comedies and don't expect serious drama (Six Feet Under this is not). In my book, this show is already a winner: 8 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>ASH IS BACK: HAIL TO THE KING, BABY, AND HAPPY HALLOWEEN!!!<br/><br/>Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/", "rating": null, "helpful": "326 out of 350 found this helpful.", "date": "30 October 2015"}, {"title": " HOW THE F HAS THIS BEEN CANCELED????????? incredible, out of 156 reviews.

Along with his colleagues Pablo and Kelly, Ash travels across country to try and find some way to stop the demonic forces once and for all.... Or at the very least make it someone else's problem. <br/><br/>God I loved this! I am absolute target audience, I accept. I had the films on Video, then DVD and now on Blu Ray. . so the very idea of a series continuing Ash's story was always going to be an easy sell to me. Then we had the slight hiccup that I don't have the channel the show airs on in the UK, but I've now seen the first season on Blu Ray and here I am. <br/><br/>It did not disappoint. Very much in keeping with the tone of Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, the series uses largely practical special effects to tell a hyper violent funny story, that re-hits some of the best beats from the films; the cabin, the reanimated hand, Evil Ash, the book of the dead and most importantly, the chainsaw hand. Bruce Campbell returns to his signature role without missing a beat, keeping the arrogance that we saw in Army Of Darkness, but adding a smudging of regret and desperation for the life denied him since that fateful day at the Cabin. <br/><br/> Ash is joined by Pablo ( Ray Santiago ) and Kelly on his trip (Dana DeLorenzo) who provide a fresh audience's entry way into the story, should they not have been watching the movies for the past 30 years. Performances are broad, as the subject matter requires it to be, but both prove welcome additions as the season continues. Also new to the story is Ruby, played by Lucy Lawless, who believes that Ash is the cause of the death and destruction that he fights against. Other characters come and go across the season, and when they go... it's usually in some horrifically violent manner. <br/><br/>But it's not all comedy, there are some genuine scares, with the possession demon around the series half way point, and the horrific Children in the finale. The story is interesting and manages to find a way to weave a lot of those film points back into the plot, without them seeming desperate or forced. The music choices are agreeable and New Zealand does a good job of doubling for the States. <br/><br/>Occasionally, the visual affects betray the budget, though usually only when the have opted for a CGI rather than practical solution and I can imagine it's not as much fun for people who don't have pre-existing love for the franchise but generally it's a cavalcade of blood spraying, chainsaws slicing and heads exploding and I can't wait to get season two.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "49 out of 55 found this helpful.", "date": "8 March 2018"}, {"title": " Absolutely Groovy", "content": "Ash vs Evil Dead is one in a million.

Watch some classic Asian made films and you'll see the acting in this offering is very true to form. As for casting of Chinese as Mongols when they are two very distinctly different ethnic groups,the make-up did a very credible job transforming them into believable Mongols...who are much darker in skin than Chinese, have higher cheekbones, broader faces and a more pronounced slant to the eyes than Chinese as well. The choice to have each group speak in English was a wise business decision. The biggest audience for this is Americans who don't exactly have much patience with subtitles. There was a nice combination of native languages spoken either in the background or as asides that gave one a good flavor of the languages. The attention to detail in costuming was really, really good. And for those worried about historical accuracy...there are almost 150 different editions or versions of The Travels of Marco Polo which is the travelogue \"written\" (actually spoken to a scribe) by Polo himself. They all have great flights of fantasy and magic and extremely improbable events in them so much so that some scholars have wondered if Polo had ever really been to all the places he claimed to visit, so a few inaccuracies ( like everyone speaking in English) is actually right in line with Polo's original work and actually might have been something the author himself might have appreciated.

I was disappointed that the initial reviews called it boring and slow moving while lauding the cinematography. I'm glad I decided to see for myself.<br/><br/>All I can figure is that the critics were disappointed that there weren't Kung Fu or large battles two or three times in every episode. I think in some respects, that has become the expectation on any eastern themed movie nowadays. They also complained about slow plot development, and most tried to draw a comparison to Game of Thrones (which I also enjoy greatly). They miss the mark. Comparing Marco Polo to GOT is an apples and oranges comparison, and still with certain parallels which they failed to note.<br/><br/>GOT is fantasy, where MP is based on historical events. That's not to say MP is documentary; I'm sure that the writers have created fictional plot lines and characters to advance the story. However, many aspects of the storyline, and many of the characters are based on historical fact. The character development is thorough and intricate. These are very deep and nuanced characters. We tend to think of Kublai Khan as some short little cartoon character from the Rocky and Bullwinkle show, and the Mongol Horde as an undisciplined mob of savages. In this series Khan is shown to be a complex and politically and militarily savvy strong leader, and his army to be as powerful and effective as any of the great armies of Europe from the same era. The development of the peripheral characters are equally as complex and nuanced. There is much intrigue in both the Mongol and the Song palaces, enough to hold our interest, and require careful attention to understand. Next to GOT, the characters are much more complex, and far more interesting.<br/><br/>The critics were right about the cinematography. The locations are striking, and it is easy to see that no expense was spared in the making of the series. Their complaint about the dearth of action is unfounded. Every episode has some action. GOT tends to budget for one major event each season (Battle of the Blackwater, The Purple Wedding). In ten episodes of MP, I counted a number of battle scenes using thousands of extras. The show is impressive in its scope, and very enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>The critics point out the gratuitous sex. Perhaps there is some, but no more than we would expect in any made-for-subscription TV series. I'm not a prude, but I did think that the producers may have pandered somewhat to the viewership in this respect, but while the nudity and sex don't actually add to the story, they don't diminish it either. I can think of several series (Spartacus and Rome come to mind) where gratuitous sex/nudity is much more obvious.<br/><br/>If there is a negative to the show, it is that you need to pay close attention to each episode to follow each plot line. Some of this is because of my own lack of familiarity with eastern culture. Names are difficult to remember and to keep straight, as are the family relationships, the alliances, the conflicts and the interests of the characters. This is not a show you can watch with one eye. To fully appreciate the story, you must be willing to watch with 100 per cent attention, every episode.

I won't discuss acting or cinematography, since they've already undergone all sorts of criticism. I'd like to state one simple fact: the cultural value of the show in itself is reason enough for its existence.<br/><br/>The story is taken from \"Il Milione\", known to the English-speaking public as \"Book of the Marvels of the World\". It was first written down by Rustichello da Pisa from stories told by Marco Polo himself, while held captive in Genoa. It's a collection of descriptions, stories and actual historical facts, and the chronicle of the dialogues between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. It's an ancient and extensive text (183 chapters), that knew instant celebrity in its time, mainly because it was a first-hand depiction of Medieval Asia: a vast and mostly unexplored continent. The profound impact that the book had on the culture of its time, caused it to be translated, adapted and edited so many times, that the original manuscript had to be reconstructed almost three centuries later. The first attempt to collate manuscripts and provide a critical edition was printed in Venice in 1559.<br/><br/>Even in Italy and in Venice, due to its obscure medieval language, the book isn't read as often as it deserves, yet it inspired Columbus to pursue his travels, and represented an invaluable source of information for merchants, cartographers and travellers. So my point is, the simple fact that this show exists is a tribute to one of the most fundamental pillars of Western culture and our relations with the Far East. In light of this, and considering that the book itself is a dazzling melting pot of historical reality, imagination and stories collected by Polo during his travels, all the inaccuracies and sometimes awkward mistakes contained in the TV show can - I think - be excused.<br/><br/>I never thought I would've had the pleasure to \"watch\" this book, and let me say something: when Marco Polo is portrayed in Venice, selling spices along the canals, he shouts \"P\u00e9vare! P\u00e9vare!\", which means pepper, but not in standard Italian. That's actual, perfectly pronounced, ancient Venetian dialect, and really blew my mind. With this kind of attention to such a small detail (especially when I'm so accustomed to the most horrifying American accents spoken by supposedly Italian characters) I can't but think that if inaccuracies abound, there must have been a good reason for each one of them. For example, both Marco Polo's uncle and father stayed in Mongolia 17 years, receiving honours and government charges. They weren't sent away or incarcerated, that I know of.<br/><br/>Do you really care that some secondary facts have been altered for the sake of the drama, if this is the price for bringing such an unfamiliar and amazing piece of history to your screens?<br/><br/>I really don't.

It's visually stunning. It has a very interesting (although perhaps not compelling) story and some excellent acting (especially by Benedict Wong). But it's lacking. Season one is good - but just good. It's not great.<br/><br/>Despite the obvious lack of actual Mongolian actors, it's pretty well cast. Most of the actors are good - some very, very good - despite no one really getting a whole lot of development. Khan Kublai is by far the most interesting character - but is perhaps the *only* interesting character in season one. This is season one's downfall. The characters are forgettable. There's little to no screen time dedicated to getting to know them. They're just faces and names (and often clich\u00e9s) that forward the story. <br/><br/>Season one does not deserve the 8.1 IMDb rating. <br/><br/>A few episodes into season two, things start to change. The show takes on the advice of all the bad reviews and low critic scores. They start to flesh out the characters, to help you understand their motivations and relations. Cliche's fall away and characters become themselves, and - although many of them are cruel and vindictive - it's much easier to relate to and understand them, and even care about them. <br/><br/>As well as this, they also rely less on unnecessary harem scenes to fill out the episodes, and ditch some of the eyerolling racist stereotypes seen in season one. Marco himself becomes (a little) less distractedly boring, the pace of the show improves, and in general it becomes rawer, more dramatic, and much more 'show don't tell'.<br/><br/>There's still a weird mashup of Asian, Australian, American and European accents, but it's not too distracting.<br/><br/>In Marco Polo the good guys do bad things and the bad guys are often well intending. It's one of those shows that becomes compelling because of the realistic way the characters are (eventually) handled. And this is why season two is much better than season one.<br/><br/>Season three will be a huge turnaround for the popularity of Marco Polo. Marco Polo is brilliantly diverse, beautiful in setting and production, and tells a story that becomes increasingly more interesting.

I'm reviewing the first six episodes--the entire first season. The series is written by Sally Wainwright. Different episodes have different directors.<br/><br/>The key plot point is that Celia (Anne Reid) and Alan (Derek Jacobi) were in love with the other as teenagers. For complicated reasons they were parted, and lived separate lives for 60 years. They are reunited via Facebook, and they fall back in love. (All this is seen in the first 20 minutes of the first episode, so I'm not giving anything away.)<br/><br/>Each has raised a daughter. Alan's daughter Gillian (Nicola Walker) and Celia's daughter Caroline (Sarah Lancashire) have gone down very different paths. Gillian is a widow. Caroline is in an estranged relationship with her husband John (Tony Gardner).<br/><br/>I've already named five characters, but there are more. What's amazing is that the actors portraying each character are all truly excellent. There's not a weak link among them. The BBC has the unique ability to find great actors, and to enable them to work together seamlessly.<br/><br/>Derek Jacobi is a famous Shakespearean actor, so we expect great things from him. However, the other actors keep pace with him. If I had to single one of them out, it would be Tony Gardner, as Caroline's husband, John.

The cast includes a zesty Carol Kane, the funny as always Jane Krakowski, 30 Rock Guest alum Tituss Burgess, and our lead Ellie Kemper; these four hilariously colorful players take the normal NBC formula for comedy and make it into something far smarter and much sharper. The writing also manages to succeed beyond my expectations. As a HUGE fan of 30 Rock, I know Ms. Fey can write up a storm. However, I thought it was the comedian perception of Television that made it so fresh. No\u0085 it's her perception of diversity and identity and all their wonderfulness that makes this show work so well. As I mentioned earlier, the show is funny yes, but also much deeper than the common person will perceive.

I, however, came in with expectations that this will be on 30 Rock's calibre, and was disappointed.<br/><br/>The characters here lacked depth. Kimmy Schmidt didn't feel at all like a real person - every 5 minutes or so she would squint her eyes and pout her mouth in an over dramatic expression of victory, and the plastered on theme of female power. She is framed as the strong independently woman, but in the short 13 episode of the first season, 3 men were romantically involved with her character. Cyndee is at best a non-descript friend of Kimmy's - at the end of a season, I don't know how to describe the character.<br/><br/>There's no developed storyline. Other than the main premise that Kimmy had been kidnapped and cut off from the world for 15 years, there's not much else to go on. The three on and off men of the first season made no sense to me. Titus's career transformations from robot to singer (or at least tried to be) to waiter to internet sensation, mixed with quite a few initiatives that led to nowhere felt like a circus show.<br/><br/>The show went for cheap jokes.

Ellie Kemper sticks out the most, she has her award win down right here, with a lovable sweet and honest performance as an ever grinning oblivious girl with a big heart. But even the supporting cast is perfect. Titus Burgess nails it at what is basically his character from 30 Rock just without the success. While he starts off as annoying he gets to be one of the most hilarious parts of the show as a desperately trying actor. Jane Krakowski is basically Jenna from 30 Rock, still as perfect as an actress can get for a role like that. Carol Kane as the freaky weird landlord of Kimmy's and Titus' delivers just as much and is just as lovable as about every aspect of the show.<br/><br/>But the smaller things stick out just as much, the costume design is fantastic with the glowing colorful wardrobe of Kimmy's or Titus' long 70's like shirts.

Hall arrived with the role of a lifetime as far as fit goes and he matured quickly as the series quickly found it's legs. Hall is back and he's definitely trying to inhabit another character from the written page which he likely finds interesting. This time it's not a hand in glove fit. While the character of Dr. Tom Delaney may be good for his own artistic growth it has the distinct feel of a \"fish out of water\". Hall has a bit of trouble selling it and the accent isn't the whole problem. He's a bit edgy and sharp not like Dexter's laid-back cool vibe that endears one.<br/><br/>The shows a Brit crime mystery which is generally a sharper, often a less bombastic more intense kind of a human drama. I tend to like the Brit flavor when compared to America's offering. However, it's going to take some getting used to seeing \"Dexter\" as Tom Delaney in simplest terms.<br/><br/>I don't think this is one of the best of the genre and it's not a BBC production. While these two things shouldn't be linked I get the idea this is one the BBC would pass on. I'm not too keen on the whole lot. An unsolved old crime with adolescents then and now who just happens to want to get involved. The degrees of separation aren't really that compelling even if it's a proper mess of involving multiple crimes over time. A father searching for his daughter who disappears after her mother's death becomes the flashpoint for a mashup of bad things. I think it goes for a intricate plot that may read better than the show pulls off. It's intelligent somewhat, but it's not something that really grabs me. I confess I watched because it was smart enough to throw breadcrumbs which I was hoping would end in something I found more crazy smart. So while I can't call it a stupid story I will call it full of forced incidents that were suppose to be clever and ended up more maddening. In the end I don't even think a slight middle-age woman can drown a strapping teenage boy so that's kind of a fail at the big reveal juncture.

Don't only thank executive producer James Wan, But thank everyone the cast, the crew, makeup artists, editing, music, and the acting, everything on the first episode is amazing. Also, the first episode shapes to become the origin of the entire show. The script was great, very solid drama going on between characters in the small town in Louisiana. A lot goes on without dwelling too far away from what's important and to what we want to see. Thrills. And you get a lot of them. From people dying, to intriguing tense moments leading it's buildup to climatic horror, to autopsy's gone wrong, to exploring the depths of the swamp.

The difference though between the last couple films and this series, is that Robert Rodriguez(the guy who created/directed original film) is the helmer of this series rather than someone else. The show has proved to be successful with his adapting the film to television. 5 episodes in the series and each one has been nostalgic of the film. What I like about the show is that it follows the original story religiously, but goes into way more detail than it did in the film. I assume things will be somewhat different though from the film before the season is over in order to keep the story going since the series was recently renewed for another season after this one. So far though, the story is building the same way it did in the film, in that the Gecko brothers are on the run after robbing a bank, join up with the Fuller Family by taking them hostage in there RV so that they can evade police and make there way for El Rey. Episode 5 was the best episode I've seen yet. A small synopsis is that The Gecko Brothers and Fuller Family are almost into Mexico, but they need to get past the border checkpoint. This scene is much different than the film though, it that the stakes feel way more dangerous and higher. The story is great and smart, incorporating Wilmer Valderammas character Carlos and Ranger Gonzales who is still hot on the Gecko Brothers trail. All I have to say is by the end of the episode, you'll be wanting to see next weeks. If you've been keeping up with each episode so far, you've noticed little nods to the world of Rodriguez/Tarantino such as The Big Kahuna Burger, Earl Mcgraw's character played by Don Johnson in the series, Seth/Richies mannerisms..etc. If you get the El Rey channel, Netflix, or have internet to download, I definitely recommend keeping up with the series.

I also thought it might make for a decent limited series, fleshing out some areas of interest and even extending what mythology the film implied.<br/><br/>I still think it is ripe for a limited series but this is not it.<br/><br/>In order to get ten episodes or more from the 108 minute movie, this series is adding unnecessary and tedious detail to some elements and creating news elements which add little. There seems to be an attempt to add a meta plot, having their crime spree and travel to Mexico be guided by a larger force. Perhaps it will work over time. Right now, it is a chore to watch. It is just dull.<br/><br/>Moreover, the writing, direction and look of the series is flat. Watch the movie and you will find the look edgy and compelling. This series is dull and grey in comparison. Visually boring.<br/><br/>Finally, it is a pet peeve of mine when a visually brash movie is taken to TV. First, the language has been sanitized. In the real world, I do not hear anyone say things like frick. The real f bomb is dropped so often in reality, it unlikely that either brother would be unwilling to use it.<br/><br/>On the visual pet peeve side, walking into a bar called the Titty Twister and seeing that all the girls have their tops on is jarring and stupid. Again, the movie was interesting on that level, showing the type of badly augmented chests that populate clubs across North America.

The experiment goes wrong, and Sam is sent in the past, with most of his scientific knowledge and memories temporarily erased. His body vanished, his mind now trapped in other's bodies, and Sam soon discovers that a \"superior authority\" can transfer his mind from time to time, only if he manages to \"fix what's broken\" and give his \"host\" a better life.

I think for this reason it may have been difficult for some to fully wrap their heads around. It had a very unique way of mixing in drama and comedy while at times also giving the viewer a look back into the past and giving a history lesson all at the same time <br/><br/>Sam (Scott Bakuka) and Al (Dean Stockwell) have the perfect chemistry together. Sam's straightlaced, Boy Scout and always wanting to do the right thing matched with Al's well placed comedic relief and naughtiness with a sex crazed, one track mind (not to mention those clothes). It was just a match made in heaven. Their ongoing banter was always a highlight and often made more humorous by Sam often appearing either plain silly or almost crazy by seemingly talking to himself in such an animated way when he doesn't realize others are seeing him during these conversations with Al. The characters genuinely cared deeply for each other and I think as the series rolled on the offscreen friendship of Bakuka and Stockwell transferred to the screen. Scott Bakuka has remarked many times how much he learned from Dean Stockwell, seeing as this was his breakout into the mainstream after mainly bit parts and mostly doing theatre until QL. Dean Stockwell on the other hand, survived Hollywood as a child actor in the late 40s, and much like his character he really experienced a lot in his life and career. I really can't picture a better duo than these two actors for this show. <br/><br/>Sure there were some episodes that weren't as strong as others, but that's going to happen in a long running series. For the few so-so episodes there were plenty of plain stellar ones to make up for them. I particularly always liked when Sam leaped into a woman. For one, it takes a confident man to be in drag as much as Bakuka was, and secondly, not only for his character, but I think for male viewers in general, it really did provide a different look into the struggles and situations that women faced throughout history, sprinkled with some humour in it as well. The final season did break the original mould a bit but still managed to stay true to the origins of the show. <br/><br/>I know there is supposedly a script written for a movie adaptation, but I'm unsure if it would tarnish my memories and attachment to the show. I wouldn't mind seeing a reboot of the series if done properly and the right leads cast. With reboots of many popular shows from the 80s being done these days this might be one that might have some of the best potential of them all, especially with today's special effects. <br/><br/>I'm admittedly a shameless Scott Bakuka fan, and really do think he is an incredibly underrated actor, especially with his musical abilities to go with his acting. Sadly he was handed a lot of poorly written scripts through the years (although he managed to do a lot with little in Enterprise, likely by not always taking it as serious as some actors might and having some fun with it despite some abysmal writing) but it's nice to see his ressurection in his early 60s on NCIS: New Orleans and starring in a hit show again. At the end of the day, Quantum Leap is his finest work to date and the series will always have a timeless element to it and can be enjoyed by people of any age. QL will always be a 10/10 for me. I can watch the episodes over and over and always enjoy it.", "rating": null, "helpful": "3 out of 3 found this helpful.", "date": "27 January 2018"}, {"title": " My review of Quantum Leap", "content": "Quantum Leap is without a doubt, the best show, ever. A perfect story line, and a great cast makes this show come together to provide an excellent show after show, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat between episodes wondering what will happen to Dr Sam Beckett.<br/><br/>Dr. Sam Beckett is a man who created a theory of how to travel through time. The project name is Project Quantum Leap. Which is a time travel experiment based on String Theory. When the government threatened to stop funding Project Quantum Leap he drastically stepped into the accelerator and leaped. He is then sent to a different time and he is a different person. To the audience we see him as Sam but to everyone else he is the person he has leapt into. He can be a man, woman or even animal. He leapes into a different person when he puts right what went wrong. He has the famous line at the end of every episode which is \"Oh Boy\". Sam Beckett is played by the great actor Scott Backula.<br/><br/>From the help of Al Calavicci, full title Rear Admiral Albert Calavicci, a womaniser who has married 5 times but has never got over his first wife Beth, who remarried when Al was declared MIA in Vietnam. To Al his happiness and his heart always belonged to Beth. He met Sam when he was drunk and trying to beat a vending machine. The two became friends very quickly and they worked together on the Starbright Project. After the StarBright project they started to work on Project Quantum Leap together. When Sam leaped Al was able to speak to Sam as a form of a hologram which only Sam can hear and see. Al helps Sam by telling what to do to be able to leap again hoping that the next leap will bring Sam home. Al explains Project Quantum Leap with the following theory \"Life is like a piece of string, one end your birth, the other end your death. Tie the ends together and your life is a loop. If you can travel fast enough along the string, you can arrive at your birth. Ball the loop and the days of your life touch each other out of sequence. Therefore moving from one part of the string to another, will move you backward or forward within your own lifetime\" Al is played by the BRILLIANT Dean Stockwell.He is the greatest actor that I have ever layed eyes on. He has a very funny personality which can change when he wants it to so this is what makes him a great actor.<br/><br/>Gooshie is the head computer programmer in Project Quantum Leap. He is known for his bad breath. He is rarely seen. He is played by Dennis Wolfberg.<br/><br/>To sum up Quantum Leap it is the best program that has been made. It contains comedy, action, seriousness and sadnesses. It is a family program that children and adults of all ages will enjoy.

To me the mixture is not as strong as the pure thing.<br/><br/>Interesting that this show starts in the desert with a science experiment of time travel. That is the same place it's ancient Irwin Allen relative, The Time Tunnel started. Donald P. Bellisario improves on the concept presented by Irwin Allen by actually making his time traveler (Quantum Leaper Scott Bakula) assume the roles of real people in the time he was transported too. This makes for better plotting, but the basic idea of being stuck in time &amp; not being able to get back is the same premise used in Irwin Allen's show.<br/><br/>Bellisario enlists Dean Stockwell as a companion who seems to be able leap into all these times but since he can not usually been seen except by our leaper, he usually is just around to bug him &amp; give him clues about where he is &amp; what he is doing. In spite of all the publicity that Quantum Physics got from this show, it is entirely based upon science fiction.<br/><br/>In fact, if you watch the entire series, you learn more about history than science. The leaps are almost always into eras where something historic is going on &amp; our main character is always being put into peril or is fumbling around trying to figure out just where he is. It is a good show though unfortunately it can not even be watched for history as very often the history is revised to fit out characters &amp; the plot into the circumstances.<br/><br/>So you watch it for the Science Fiction &amp; a good cast of regular actors &amp; guest stars.

However, in that book, he takes the life of that person and then moves on when finished. An unintentional mental-physical vampire. He also finds that it is a known phenomena and others exist as well. This TV version is far more benign. He rights wrongs and fixes history, much like the hero in the TV series \"Early Edition\". The \"temporarily\" misplaced person waits in a holding area, and returns to their own body after Sam Becket leaps back out. In one of my favorite leaps, he saves an elderly man from falling from a 2nd story window. Also, in the same episode., he meets a teen-aged \"Stephen King\" and unwittingly serves as the inspiration for several of King's later classic novels. All this while confronting The Devil and witchcraft in a hallucination or daydream. The leaps in later seasons include Elvis, Marilyn Monroe, a real vampire, ghosts, witches, clairvoyants, a real UFO \"passenger\" , and a visit from his guardian angel in \"It's a Wonderful Leap\". The last episode \"Mirror Image\" is also explained in the IMDb article. In another noteworthy episode, he \"leaps\" into Lee Harvey Oswald to prevent Jacqueline's murder.

The fact that they don't realize is that most fans of the show are aware of this. We know that there's camera crew, and a medical team waiting for if anything were to happen. And as far as the show being scripted, that simply makes no sense. For one, it's illegal for a reality show to be scripted in the United States. In addition, numerous castaways (Russell Hantz, Rupert Boneham) have had early exits, despite being ratings magnets. Take Heroes vs. Villains for example. You would think that to boost the ratings, if it were scripted, one of the fan-favourite Heroes would win, to bring in the ratings and please the fans. What happened? Not a single hero made it into the top four. Take the numerous medical evacuations. Watch one and look at the other castaways' faces (Skupin's in particular). Tell me it's scripted. The only things close to the show being scripted was in Season 1 (It's at season 40 now, and no such thing has happened since) when Stacey Stillman claimed that Mark Burnett (Executive Producer) had asked several castaways to vote out Stacey instead of Rudy Boesch. The other situation was when in Fiji, only one castaway actually applied for the show. Other than that, nothing out of the ordinary has occured.\nIn addition to Heroes vs. Villains, many seasons had non-favorable winners. Such seasons include Edge of Extinction, Game Changers, Kaoh Rong, Worlds Apart, San Juan Del Sur, South Pacific, Nicaragua, Samoa, Gabon, Panama, Guatemala, All-Stars, Pearl Islands, The Amazon, Thailand, and Marquesas had less than favorable winners. Hell, Jeff Probst almost quit the show after Gabon because he thought the show had reached it's end.<br/><br/>But, after all of that, what truly makes this show great?\nThe suspense, survival aspect and sense of character really make this show something great and something to remember. I walk away from each episode either mad or happy, but I think about it for a while afterwards. It sticks in your mind. It's evolved so much since Borneo. This show is really, in all honesty, the saving grace for CBS reality shows. The Amazing Race's ratings have been poor for a while, and Big Brother is only around in the summertime. In addition, the format of Big Brother makes it more difficult to get into.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, Survivor is a fantastic show, and I highly recommend watching it. Most of the people writing the bad reviews have most likely not seen more than a couple of episodes, or are discussing Island of the Idols. Island of the Idols did have some political issues brought into it, but for me, that just shows how real it really is. Situations on Survivor match situations experienced in the real world. Just because they're on a remote island doesn't mean that they aren't affected by the world around us. I agree with some people that the show could've handled it better. But, at the end of it all, Dan was removed and served some time in jail. In addition, the castaways featuring in Winners at War were all informed of a strict new ruleset detailing new rules about inappropriate behavior. But, at the end of it all, it's a game.

Interestingly I find myself having evolved along with it. Season 1 the contestants and consequently the unseasoned viewer seemed to think it was more about surviving, being a hero in challenges, providing for your tribe and making people like you, etc than it was about social politics, strategy and the journey of self discovery that these people must go through as they battle the elements and literally starve for 39 days. It feels almost that in the earlier seasons, naivety in the human condition prevailed as contestants and viewers alike were trying to figure out how to balance their real life morals with the fact that they were in a game that ultimately required them to betray almost all of the values we applaud as a society. To me this is the beauty, real people with real emotions will inevitably form real connections and will ultimately need to betray those relationships... there is no way around that fact. <br/><br/>By season 36 I am witnessing a different game. The die-hard fans and contestants have evolved. Now we know it is a game and we know how to play it, but the human factor, the emotional side - the relationships they form, etc are still REAL. The strategy is on a \"whole-nother\" level. The savvy-ness and emotional manipulation required to be successful at this game is intriguing. The twists and advantages that the creators come up with are nothing short of brilliant; fueling this excitement and intrigue. Some of the Jury miss the point and sit there overwhelmed by the emotion or their feeling of being betrayed; instead of applauding the hand that dealt the blow, others \"get it\", they understand that this game needs to be played personally but never taken personally - even just this observation to me is interesting to witness.<br/><br/>In terms of exploring human psychology and realness, there isn't, nor has there yet been, any other reality competition show out there that is as brilliant, addictive and REAL as Survivor.<br/><br/>I'm a fan for life.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "11 out of 15 found this helpful.", "date": "29 July 2018"}, {"title": " After 31 Seasons, Survivor Still Remains an Awesome Show!", "content": "As far as entertainment goes, at times it really doesn't get any better than Survivor. Especially the first season or two you watch. I've never been the type of person to change up my plans or not schedule any plans just because a show I liked was going to be on TV... that is until Survivor (the first season or two I watched that is). I would be so exited leading up to the show and be completely enthralled throughout. I remember cramming for my midterms/finals and even though I didn't have any extra time to spare I couldn't skip out on Survivor (a couple times). <br/><br/>As a viewer it can be an emotional roller coaster, which is why it takes a rare breed to endure several seasons of Survivor, but I think it's worth it too endure it. You'll probably have to take a several year hiatus multiple times, but it's always enjoyable and rewarding to start watching it again. I'd be willing to bet the reason why many people stop watching is because of frustration, rather than lack of entertainment. Frustration because of bad winners, emotionally retarded people not being voted off, etc, etc. One of the first hurdles most people have to get through is; often times the better physical as well as mental players will get voted out early more often than not (more so as the show has gone on compared to the beginning). The key to enduring that and the show as a whole, is to except the luck factor. Sure there's all the clich\u00e9 talk during the show of people saying, you beat me because your still in the game and I got voted off or people going out with 3 left and saying I got 4th place. It's one thing for a contestant to say you outplayed me because you made it further, because that's just being a good sport, but it's a completely different thing for the viewer to have such a naive/dimwitted/idiotic way of observing the game. Forget all that nonsense... accept the fact that there is a ton of luck in the game (for example one contestant won the game twice and this person is probably in the bottom 5 of all time winners in ref to strategy), sometimes more than others. While frustrating at times the luck factor keeps the game exciting, because anything can happen and anyone for the most part can win. Also in the very early seasons if someone was emotionally retarded they would get the boot early, but as the seasons progress the socially inept people often times make it deep in the game, because it strategically makes sense to keep non threatening players in the game (though seldom win it). Which is why the 3rd/4th/5th/6th/etc. place talk is so ridiculous because there are a multitude of reasons why people land where they do that are external to skill level and ability to play the game. If a player goes deep in the game, but never puts themselves in a place to have a shot at winning and someone else has their cards lined up so that if they do go to the end they can possibly win, but end up getting the boot at 10... the 10 is way more impressive. Anywho, I had to take several leaves of absence along the way, with the longest being after season 6 (over 5 years)... got sick of the jury asking the question, if you win what would you do with the money and emotional nonsense external to the game dictating the winners, but I was pleasantly surprised coming back after my leave to watch seasons 7 and 8. BTW for the most part as the seasons progress the jury starts basing the winners on the game they played. <br/><br/>Anyways they do an awesome job with the show as a whole, even though they most likely metal with the game, trying to keep the entertaining players in the game longer... ironically more so in the earlier seasons, because so much was depending on the future of the show. The show has always been good at spoofing on itself right from the first season. The cutting room and the camera people have a good sense of humor. Something as simple as someone being angry or super dramatic and then the show pans to an animal that's analogous to the situation. If the show wasn't spoofing on itself (in a sense) this would come across really corny, but instead it's hilarious and there are several subtleties such as this that enhances the overall show. Anyways, I'm rambling on too long, so I'm just going to cut out, but if you stopped watching the show or haven't seen it as of yet, I highly recommend this show, there are few if any shows that are as entertaining as Survivor, especially when you're new to it.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "7 out of 9 found this helpful.", "date": "27 January 2016"}, {"title": " Best Show Ever!", "content": "What an unbelievable show.

I saw only 6 of the 10 first episodes so I can only judge as far as that goes. \nThe decision to make the parents villains to the teens, despite them not having much presence in the actual comics, was a noteworthy risk to take. Some of the parents are interesting characters themselves, albeit they don't really as deep into any of them as much as they should. \nThe makeup and costume design is also good, everyone looks exactly like their comic book counterparts, which is also bad because...<br/><br/>The Bad: They sacrificed good writing for what looks good. It's not just the dialogue that's bad, or bland and cartoony side characters that are bad, but for most of the first 6 episodes _absolutely nothing happens_. We get exposition, we slowly learn of everyone's special superpowers, and it seems to mix allegories when suddenly they go after a gunman with lasers and magic.<br/><br/>Also the drama is _atrocious_. After the characters are all long introduced, you'll notice filler scenes with characters bleeding out exposition but not talking for the sake of change. As a rule, that's what's SUPPOSED to happen in a scene!<br/><br/>It was at about episode 4 or 6 I found myself in the worst place possible: that is _wishing_ for conflict. Wishing for something unpredictable to hit the characters, or episodes that end with them making real choices that can't be undone (Show Writing 101). <br/><br/>Did I mention the characters? They're mostly bad:\nAlex: Fine. Just fine. Not exciting or anything.\nBoy #2: Also just fine, a little exciting, but has a lot of cringey lines.\nGurt: Annoying, pink haired, 3rd wave feminist, who is the show's propaganda preacher, goes unchallenged, has _visible_ double standards, is unfunny, annoying even to her parents, and makes me lose hope in our society when a kid like her was so horribly socialized. \nThe adopted Mexican: Small, doesn't add anything to any scene, occasionally helpful because of her mutant genes (not because of her personality or intelligence or anything). \nThe Church Girl: I found this character a little offensive. Not because she was an obvious riff on scientology and Jehovah's Witnessism, but because they said that this show was the \"human story\" because they \"summed up people of all races, genders, sexualities, and...'religious beliefs'\" with their characters. A closeted lesbian cult-follower does not sum up anyone remotely outside California. Obvious agenda is obvious. Because that, she was just okay. \nNico: Eh. I'm very neutral towards Nico. She may be an Asian Wiccan girl with the EXACT VOICE OF MILEY CYRUS 5 YEARS AGO still grieving her dead sister one year later, but in terms of character she has nothing to offer except, \"poor me, my sister died. Who can relate?\"<br/><br/>I'd mention the individual villains too, but this review is already long enough.<br/><br/>Spoiler on the villains' secret motivations: It turns out most of the parents who are a part of the PRIDE committee were FORCED via blackmail to join. The ONE aspect that kept me watching turned out to be: \"Oh, look! They're not even bad guys! They're just FORCED into cultic ritual and killing! Don't you feel for them?\" NO! I don't! Because now, instead of them having values that challenge society AND the main characters, they're just common criminals with a stick!\nAnd you know what, they don't all even have to be a part of PRIDE! Yes, their boss needed someone to hold the cult mansion, someone to hold the staff, and time travelers...but MUTANTS, the witch's husband, and scientists? Maybe if I kept watching I'd know his \"grand plan\", but again, I stopped caring when I found out they were just common criminals.<br/><br/>No More Spoilers Here.<br/><br/>The Ugly: There's more I could talk about, like how they reenacted an UNREALISTIC almost-rape scenario and then showed a girl actually victim blaming two episodes later because...she loved lacrosse so much. It was HYSTERICALLY cartoony. Clearly, to make up for all the empty writing, the writers and producers thought they could heavily appeal to millennial leftism, despite the fact that Generation Z, the focus group of this show and age of its main characters, are going to be conservative as possible in the future. Even they won't like the ridiculous scenarios that happen, like the pink-haired feminist girl having two overaged men flirting and complimenting her. It's not because she was ugly that I'm complaining; it's how unrealistic their openness was. <br/><br/>So all in all, if you like progressive pandering, your leftist views to be affirmed, women needing to use superpowers while the men rely on actual smarts, millennials to be coddled (the show's called \"Runaways\" and they're still living off their parents' assets for some reason), and a comic book that _looks_ interesting to be watered down to it's basic Wikipedia page, then well, this show was made for you!

The TV series has a similar plot, but is very different in that all the characters are watered down. Actually, everything is watered down. There are things that I was looking forward to because of how amazing they are in the comics, and then when the show gets to them, they're clich\u00e9d, and seriously not amazing.

We know very little about them other than how they dress and you can tell how hard they're trying to make them as inoffensive and PC as they can which really takes away the sense of fun. <br/><br/>Then there's the fact that it's a show about people with abilities and we've seen a total of maybe 60 seconds of special effects over the course of three hours. Inhumans had this same problem. No one is tuning in to see another drama, these comics are interesting because they're about people with powers. I know they're trying to save money because well...it totally looks like they're trying to save money. No original sets, no special effects, just people talking or staring.

The actors aren't very competent either but that could be a result of the direction. <br/><br/>Then there's the one with the purple hair.

I'm a comic fan, but I also know that changes must be mad when adapting, and none of the changes have been absurd. Making the parents have their own stories and motives, as well as stretching out the time between the kids finding out and them going on the run was necessary, simply to fill the time a TV show needs to fill. Changes to the story, such as Molly's background and the Gibborim are yet to be seen, but I think it's half stretching time, and half updating a story that's nearly 15 years old. (who else remembers 2003 vanilla racist Chase). <br/><br/>Overall, a fun story that's not 100% a loyal adaptation, and a little slow paced, but definitely worth watching, especially if you're not a nitpicky comic fan.

A lot of the show revolves around the evolving relationships between family members and friends as they deal with their actions in the current as well as come to terms their actions in the past.

Other themes the show presents are dealing with the transition of youth to middle-age, sexual morality and parenting. If that's not enough there is drug-comedy and a little crime family conflict in there as well.

One of the series' chief strengths was how likable this fussbudget was, and how he didn't ALWAYS hate Dennis being around, as he understood that he was a good boy overall, and said so often. He also recognized that quite often Dennis would straighten things out, sometimes getting him out of a fix that was his own doing. One example is an early episode where if not for Dennis, Wilson would have given money to a phony, instead of the man who really had owned the old radio George bought at an auction.<br/><br/>Plots were fairly simple, believable, but mostly lots of laughs.

Boy did it suck.<br/><br/>And so in 1993, while working a summer job in a podunk town, I found it on when I came home for lunch one afternoon.  I wasn't sure what it was at first, but I suspected it was that horrible, pathetic show.  I figured I'd watch it... nothing like seeing a train wreck to cheer you up on a bad day, right?  But then I realized it was time to go back to work and I couldn't go... 'cos I had to see the full wreck.  And then I realized I timed my lunch hour to the same time the next day... and the next.  You guessed it. I liked the show.<br/><br/>Really, I don't know why I hated the show... probably because, like most people who are completely firm in their negative opinions, I had had no real exposure to it.  I found (after watching, mind you) that the plots were decent, the actors from passable to excellent, and the writing and dialogue better than average.  Depp and Peter Deluise worked well together, particulary when they worked as the McQuaid Brothers.  Stephen Williams became a favorite actor of mine with his portrayal of Captain Fuller (he was later X on the X-Files.)  As much as they were used, Holly Robinson and particularly Dustin Nguyen were never used as well as they could have been, but they were still good.<br/><br/>Someone else mentioned that this because a star vehicle after a while. Despite the amount of future stars, I tend to disagree.  Many of these faces were being seen for the first time here and no one could have guessed that they'd become famous.  Brad Pitt, Pauly Shore, Sherilyn Fenn, Jason Priestly, Shannon Doherty, and several others had fleeting guest spots on the show and eventually went off to do bigger things, but there was also a long list of other actors on the show who went on to do very little or nothing at all.<br/><br/>Another note (heh) that should be mentioned is that the show was one of the first to push a lot of popular music of the day in the soundtrack.  I remember one epsiode about an AWOL military school student featured R.E.M.'s Orange Crush (off of the just released Green album).  I believe the final Johnny Depp episode had an Oingo Boingo song from the Dark at the End of the Tunnel album... and don't knock Boingo... lead singer/composer Danny Elfman has been a respected film composer for over 15 years now.  I believe a soundtrack was released, but I don't think many of the good songs were released on it.<br/><br/>As the show went on, it became a little unbelievable that they could keep hitting the same schools without the students catching on or talking to each other to rat out the undercover officers.  The writing got really bad in some episodes and Depp seemed to be giving bad performances just so he could get out of his contract.  They allowed him to skip several episodes completely or limited his appearances in others as a result.  After he left and the show went from FOX into general syndication for the last season, more and more shows were throwaways.  The cast and guest stars suffered as well, with Robinson left to carry the show almost by herself (Peter Deluise guested on a handful of early episodes while brother Michael ended up on about half.)

The production is so well done that it feels like watching a film. The narrator makes it feel different to a standard romance and gives off \"Pride and Prejudice\" vibes. The dissection of past relationships idea is a solid concept and it works well to devote one episode to each of Darby's past relationships.<br/><br/>As Darby, Kendrick is funny as ever, and her facial expressions and sarcasm bring a rather flat script to life. Unfortunately, the writers dulled down the Kendrick effect by giving her a character who is inherently quite bland and has very little about her.<br/><br/>While the series starts really well, the more we see Darby through the lens of each relationship, the more we realise that she lacks an independent personality. I don't know whether this was poor writing or whether they were intentionally trying to make the point that Darby is always defined in terms of her relationships. I'm inclined to think the former based on the ending, which does nothing to subvert her lack of an independent personality. Either way, it didn't work and there is like to like about Darby.<br/><br/>She sails along on whatever life gives her, yet lands an incredible job without much effort. She has a difficult relationship with her mother, which isn't fully explained. She has issues that we don't really get. In short, we don't come to understand why Darby is the way she is, so the dissection trope is unrealised.<br/><br/>Now for the ending....<br/><br/>Disappointment #1: Of course, Darby can only experience \"real love\" when she has a baby, can only \"find herself\" by being a mother, can only repair her relationship with her own mother by becoming one. I wish the producers of these shows would think about the kind of message this sends to women, especially those who can't have or don't want children. Women's value is not defined in terms of motherhood, so please stop pushing this idea on us.<br/><br/>Disappointment #2: We get two episodes of Augie and two of awful Magnus, but we get hardly any of \"the person\" and learn almost nothing about him, so he fails to be a fully-formed character that we could believe Darby will spend the rest of her life with.<br/><br/>The ending, I guess, aims to subvert the notion that meeting the love of your life is all fireworks, but we are expected to believe that Darby meets her person while being rude to him, and that he keeps coming back despite her talking about nothing but herself and her baby and asking him one question about himself. Yes, romances are unrealistic, but we are given no reason to believe in their connection other than he thinks \"it's cool that she's a mom\". Again, the message is that Darby ceases to be her own person and is now defined in terms of her baby.<br/><br/>I really wanted the ending to be Darby taking control of her own life and learning to become an individual (like in Dakota Johnson's character in \"How to Be Single\"). Instead, we get the cliched, traditional ending where Darby does not become her own person but is instead defined in terms of her relationship with the three men in her life: her son, her son's father, and her person.

Throughout my teenage years, I've only got hooked to Dragonball Z(15-18 years). That's it. Gundam Seed did appealed to me once in a while but I was totally not into anime for almost more than a decade. I suppose I got matured and that these kiddies stuff are waay past my time and not my type anymore.

I was transported to my childhood days just after watching 2 episodes and instantly got hooked to the series like an eager blood-sucking leech.<br/><br/>It is wonderful to live in a fantasy world and that is the reason Bleach is so watchable. The excellent scripted storyline and wonderful varied characters will bring out the child in every man or woman. Watching the character of Ichigo develops from a normal kid to one that has super-natural powers is a rewarding journey, not to mention his what-you-call-that powerful 'bankai' that enables him to prevail in most of his battles with other powerful villains. The ups and downs throughout the journey from resisting turning into a hollow to becoming a shinigami had made this series so much enjoyable to watch. Coupled with his allies, from the cute little girl who can summon cute little angels to the cool-looking bloke with his deadly bow and arrows, and not to mention the powerful and indestructible Byakuya(did I spell that correctly?). Man talking about that guy. I saw him taking down Ichigo in one chapter without much effort at all along the alley on one fateful night which he took Rukia to Soul Society with him after that, leaving Ichigo as good as dead. I then thought to myself, how the hell is Ichigo going to bring his level up to that of Byakuya's if he were to match his powers and to save Rukia from the gallows? Anticipating what's going to happen next, the show ended. booo... Wait till the next episode comes by. duh.... See?

It just didn't... do anything for me. One day, I just happened to catch an episode of Naruto... it looked cool so I thought I would give it a shot, see what happened. It was amazing. I quickly ran out of it though (yes I download really fast :) ), and required a new anime series to quench my thirst. I went for the darker route, with Full Metal Alchemist. It was more mature than Naruto, in that the themes were deeper, it was sadder (episode 25 omg), and it was a bit more violent, but I really enjoyed that too. Then one fateful day, I discovered Bleach. This anime series has blown me away (after a slightly slow start).<br/><br/>Character development, character relations, action, comedy, animation and even sub stories are amazing. The fights are beautiful in that they aren't dragged out for 5+ episodes (Battle on the bridge early in Naruto anyone?), but still manage to capture the heart pounding, edge of seat thrilling moments.<br/><br/>The series leads us through Ichigo's (the main characters) home town, where he battles hollows in place of a Death God, Rukia Kuchiki, after she bestows her powers on him. Eventually, Ichigo and a band of friends are lead through the mystical, futuristic Soul Society.

And yes, its not a bad show, there are a lot worse animes out there. I tried REALLY hard to LOVE Bleach like everyone else does, but it seems that almost every chance Bleach has to make itself a great show, it fails.<br/><br/>Negatives.<br/><br/>First of all, the first season of Bleach is stupidly boring.<br/><br/>Second, there are WAY to many filler episodes in the series.<br/><br/>Third, the second season introduces a totally stupid amount of secondary characters, and then spends way too much time detailing their history, their special attacks and individual personalities, and all kinds of crap that drags the show down.<br/><br/>Fourth, serious and emotional/drama filled moments in this show are constantly shattered by \"comic relief\" when they shouldn't be. They are also dragged out to the point of ruin by excessive dialog.<br/><br/>Fifth, the characters need to SHUT UP AND FIGHT, and stop taunting each other and giving huge monologues about their abilities and their swords and what not. If I want to hear about every detail about a character's powers I'll go read the wikipedia article about them; it doesn't help the already crawling pace of the action to constantly interrupt it with boring talk.<br/><br/>Sixth, the action in Bleach is way behind the times for animation and for the most part is not that fun to watch. For the most part, I could describe the action in Bleach as Dragon Ball Z, with swords, in slow motion. ITS BORING. In almost every major fight in the series, as soon as the action starts up, it cuts away to another scene with boring dialog somewhere else in the world. Its damn annoying. There are certain Nickelodeon shows *cough*Avatar*cough* which have action that is 10 times more entertaining than Bleach.<br/><br/>Positives <br/><br/>1. I will admit, I have a big soft spot for emotionally damaged female characters, and Bleach has a couple of really good ones. It also has pretty solid character development overall, thanks to the excessive talking and explaining that goes on.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I've watched Bleach because I wanted to see some bad ass sword fighting; while there are a few good fights in the series, none are very memorable, and all of them are marred by the aforementioned mouth diarrhea that almost every character possesses.

Almost every fight in the series is detailed and exciting to watch. You can really see how the character's mood changes all the time. With unexpected twists and turns. There is much added comedy and feuds even between friends and family that just make bleach even more interesting.

The first section where Ichigo (the main character) receives his powers and learns the basics of being a Soul Reaper to guide souls to the afterlife was pretty interesting, Ichigo being this sort of lost soul who can't seem to connect to people after some undisclosed tragedy that happened in his past.<br/><br/>The second arc where Ichigo and his friends have to go rescue Rukia (the Soul Reaper that gave Ichigo his powers) from execution was also pretty engaging, introducing us to the Soul Reaper captains and the militaristic Soul Society as well as revealing the main villain.<br/><br/>Then the series started to spiral downward. It took a while, but eventually the pacing of the episodes slowed enough to the point that not even to cool action scenes were engaging, as they were falling into the shonen trap of having characters perform a 13-second special move and then spend the next five minutes explaining EVERY SINGLE DETAIL about said move.<br/><br/>But the crowning moment of lameness came at what should've been the series' most exciting episode. Ichigo is finally ready to confront the big villain who's been causing all the woe and death up to this point; the villain who they've spent episode after episode building up as this invincible god-like entity who is so powerful that you can die just by getting too close to him; the villain who can tame an entire realm. Ichigo has also grown pretty strong, though we haven't exactly seen go through these changes as most of them take place off screen. And when the two meet, do we get a huge explosive finale to the plot that has taken over 300 episodes to conclude? NOPE! Instead we get an two-episode long flashback followed by the exchange of all of THREE attacks (I'm not exaggerating, that is LITERALLY how many blows are exchanged) before the god-like villain who in no way can be defeated is defeated by a deus ex machina.<br/><br/>I have no clue as to what happens next, as this was the point at which I checked out of Bleach. It started off well enough, but the amount of padding combined with the tired shonen tropes that plague long-running anime of today took its toll on me. Ichigo went from being a tortured soul to an emo kid with a connection to his friends that honestly felt kind of fake seeing as he only seems to care about them when they're in danger.<br/><br/>And there's a pointless love subplot that goes nowhere.

Unlike most action anime in which the plot is simply battle after battle broken up by long winded speeches, Bleach breaks the mold, at least in most cases. <br/><br/>Early episodes of the show (minus the filler arcs)feature intense character development and touch upon human emotion/psychology. The show is entertaining up to episode 63. Past episode 63, there have been few good episodes. However, if one is willing to look, most episodes featuring Ichigo and Rukia or Captain Hitsugaya are worth watching, as they are by far the most interesting characters.<br/><br/>However, the reason I gave this anime only 7 out of 10 is because of the amount of filler episodes, the now repetitive storyline, and meaningless character interactions. <br/><br/>Also, a comparison of the English dub and sub reveals another dilemma. The English dub contains good voice dubs for most characters (except Hitsugaya, who sounds more like a man than the young boy he really is)it also excludes a lot of the somewhat annoying battle cries and exaggerated vocal tones prevalent to most anime of this nature.

Beginning kinda spoiled us that trip of our protagonists, British couple, authors of successful show in England, isn't going to be very pleasant. Mainly because other episodes are in tone \"It isn't what we wanted, but hopefully, it will work\", giving us hope there will be happy ending. Flashbacking of pilot was cheap and I was afraid, it's going to be another mediocre show.<br/><br/>Then second episode came and with it, Matt LeBlanc. Matt is portraying his ultimate character, called Matt LeBlanc as well. But this Matt is different. It draws from legacy of Friends far better then Joey ever did, creating not true LeBlanc, but rather actor, who acts the way audience would think \"Joey\" acts like. He is great. But it's not just Matt who gets better with second episode. Every other character gets more and more interesting too. Merc, the puppet master of television, is more, then just \"guy who wants to have sex with stuff\". His humor is usually cruel, yet there is deeper, fragile part of his soul. He loves his wife, yet he makes fun of her charity activities. He manipulates everyone around, yet he is afraid of someone cutting his string. His wife is his hero, yet he cheats on her. That brings us to Carla, who is as interesting as Merc, with angel and devil fighting each other, while sitting on her shoulders. She cheats, but she hates herself for it. She is Mercs right hand of manipulations, yet it makes her feel bad.<br/><br/>And, same goes for the British couple. In first episode, they looked like one simple character split between two actors, but now, they are getting more alive, more real and more different. And that's what I like about them. They are acting like normal people set in crazy sit-com world, surprised and confused, it is literally driving them crazy (ending of second episode is one of the most hilarious moments in history of television shows). It almost looks like they didn't crossed just Atlantic, but also dimensions and are lost in fictional world of show called \"EPISODES\" and that's what sets it apart from anything else you can see in television right now.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this show to anyone who's looking for some quality time with just a little bit of smarter humor.", "rating": 9, "helpful": "20 out of 23 found this helpful.", "date": "7 February 2011"}, {"title": " Good start and I look forward to the next episode.", "content": "I was not sure what sort of comedy this was going to be.

When the show ended, of course I looked out for everything that those 6 people did including the Cougar Town which I also liked and Mr. Sunshine. Even though those shows were good, \"Episodes\" is something different and something really really good. First of all, we should accept the fact that we can not watch Matt LeBlanc and not think about Joey or Friends (like any other character of friends in any other show). The difference of Episodes is that this show knows this fact, acknowledges it, uses it but also not overwhelms you with it. Also, it makes its difference by using the widely different British humor quite wisely (in Sean and Beverly characters) and mixing it with American flavor (the rest of the characters starting with LeBlanc). Besides its great humors, the show is giving us a wonderful insight of Hollywood and TV networks. Its self criticism of the \"industry\" makes us feel like listening to an honest, funny and a very clever person. The only complaint about this show is it lasts only 7-9 episodes in one season!

The title nicely fits the premise of season 1, Heaven is an office with departments, with Buscemi's God being the goofball CEO. Fun. And loved seeing Radcliffe in something else. We mainly follow two angels trying to pull off a miracle (where they're limited to techniques that don't automatically prove there's a heaven). I found it fun and funny, and as someone gleefully without religion, religious topics usually don't interest me, but that wasn't a problem here.<br/><br/>Cut to season 2, subtitled The Dark Ages. The subtitle likewise neatly explains the setup. But EVERYTHING from season 1 is gone! No god, no angels, no heaven, no divine influence... The only thing in common is the majority of the cast, all in completely different roles! Now, while it's cute that their experimental human from season 1 now gets to interact with the others in season 2 (though we're missing the female experimental human, I found her cute and would like to see more of her. Pity), that isn't anything, really. This is essentially a completely new show! Plus it betrays the title, there's no miracles going on, nobody is \"working\" on miracles. Plus I miss the magical elements, the Heaven way of doing things here and there.<br/><br/>I can't take off TOO many stars for this weird shift in tone and setting, the new season is still enjoyable (though unquestionably less so, with less and more subtle humour). Radcliffe becomes the new goofball. Buscemi and the female lead become downtrodden peasants (a SIGNIFICANT step down for Buscemi, LOL!). Of course, the focus changing to downtrodden peasants in a backward time has an unpleasant undertone of their sad bleak existence. One cute thing is frequent somewhat subtle references to modern life, converted to Dark Ages, like someone asking Alexa to play music and skip tracks becomes telling a minion the same things and having him sing things for entertainment.

The premise of the season shows how people get by day to day in the medieval times.\nMain Character\nGeraldine Viswanathan was more of a supporting character in the first season but I felt like here she is the main character and I thought she was okay. I think she is a talented actress and she has some fun moments here it is just her character that I didn't really enjoy. She comes across as really pretentious and above every other character here and it makes it hard to care about her and the plights that she goes through.\nSupporting Characters\nDaniel Radcliffe is more of a side character here but he is still really good, he plays the prince of the village and he was very likeable for me and was funny here, like he was in the first series. Steve Buscemi is back but he is not God this time around but he is still funny, he is likeable here and still looks like he is having plenty of fun. Karan Soni is back and he is still a fun part of this show and has some good chemistry with Radcliffe throughout. Also the addition of Peter Serafinowicz as the King was an inspired choice and I thought he did a great job.<br/><br/>Story\nThis is mostly where the show falls down for me, the plot really doesn't do anything for me, mainly because I still am not sure exactly what the point of the story is. There is this basic romance and family drama and it just didn't work for me and if I am just being honest I would have much preferred a second season in Heaven.<br/><br/>Script\nThe script is still quite funny here, I cannot deny that at times I was finding myself laughing quite a bit. It just lacked the charm that I thought the first season had and the lack of intrigue that the first season had as well.<br/><br/>Style\nThe one thing I like about the style of the show, is the use of modern day ideas in the medieval times and the creative ways that they use them. But, a slight criticism I had of the first season was having a few too many episodes, so they thought it would be a great idea to give this season 10 episodes which is way too many which hurts the show.<br/><br/>Overall\nOverall, this is an average second season, that feels more paint by numbers which is disappointing.

There's plenty of feeling, no padding or softness, and no mindless experimentation with technique or vulgarity such as has ruined so many westerns made since 1970.<br/><br/>It's difficult to understand why an approach which succeeded for so long was abandoned in the 1970's by both television and feature film makers. Many producers turned instead in the direction indicated by spaghetti westerns. Compared to classic westerns like \"Bonanza,\" spaghetti westerns were much less lyrical and took more of a gutter eye view of the old west, stripping it of its romantic appeal and substituting what to a misguided new generation seemed a dirtier and therefore more authentic realism. In retrospect, Hollywood gave up way too much for the little that it got in return. The success of a vast body of works similar in appeal to \"Bonanza\" (including many of the other action adventure TV serials made from the '40s to the '60s) is proof that there is a widespread taste that is radically different from the one which has predominated in Hollywood since the '70s. Let's hope that one day we'll see the return of Bonanza's classic values to the screen.", "rating": null, "helpful": "54 out of 64 found this helpful.", "date": "1 March 2005"}, {"title": " The Cartwrights Of The Ponderosa", "content": "It got to be a running joke around Bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any Cartwright men. After all Ben Cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage. And any woman who got involved with Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe were going to end up dying because we couldn't get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic TV western.<br/><br/>Perhaps if Bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the Cartwrights. People have relationships, some go good, some not so good, it's just life. And we're less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don't have to kill the character off to keep the survivor's nobility intact. But that's if Bonanza were done today.<br/><br/>But we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and Bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from NBC certainly helped, the secret of Bonanza's success was the noble patriarch Ben Cartwright and his stalwart sons. Ben Cartwright was THE ideal TV Dad in any genre you want to name. His whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense Ponderosa spread for his three children. The kids were all different in personality, but all came together in a pinch.<br/><br/>The Cartwrights became and still are an American institution. I daresay more people cared about this family than the Kennedys. Just the popularity that Bonanza has in syndication testifies to that. <br/><br/>Pernell Roberts as oldest son Adam was written out of the show. Rumor has it he didn't care for the noble Cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious. Perhaps if it were done now, he'd have liked it better in the way I describe.<br/><br/>This was just the beginning for Michael Landon, how many people get three hit TV shows to their credit. Landon also has Highway to Heaven and Little House On the Prarie where he had creative control. Little Joe was the youngest, most hot headed, but the most romantic of the Cartwrights. <br/><br/>When Roberts left. the show kept going with the two younger sons, but when big Dan Blocker left, the heart went out of Bonanza. Other characters had been added on by that time, David Canary, Tim Matheson, and Ben Cartwright adopted young Mitch Vogel. But big, loyal, but a little thick Hoss was easily the most lovable of the Cartwrights. His sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family.<br/><br/>So the Cartwrights of the Ponderosa have passed into history. I got a real taste of how America took the Cartwrights to heart when I visited the real Virginia City. It doesn't look anything like what you see in Bonanza. But near Lake Tahoe, just about where you see the Ponderosa on the map at the opening credits, is the Cartwright home, the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction.

The continuing cast for the first 6 years featured essentially five persons--Benjamin Cartwright, his three sons and their Chinese cook, along with the local sheriff. Cartwright had been a seaman, who went west and married three times; each time he produced a son and lost his wife. Reaching the ponderosa pine country near Virginia City, Nevada and Lake Tahoe, he built up a large landholding, with cattle, timber, and mines, becoming an important man in the territory. Ben Cartwright was played by Canadian announcer-actor Lorne Greene, who was much younger than the part he played but had Shakespearean training and a powerful speaking voice. Pernell Roberts played his eldest son, Adam, a thoughtful but restless man, 1959-65. Eric \"Hoss\" Cartwright was portrayed huge Dan Blocker as a man of gentle ways and grit but ordinary intelligence. Attractive Michael Landon played \"Little Joe\", fast with a gun and learning to be a man; he also write and directed episodes for the series. Victor Sen-Young was Hop Sing, and veteran Ray Teal played Sheriff Roy Coffee. Later, others were added to the series for various stretches, once Adam's part was written out; these included David Canaray as Candy, Bing Russell, Harry Holcombe, Guy Williams, Kathie Browne, and Remo Pisani. Each week guest stars were hired, and a few actors were used in dozens of shows. Among the most memorable guest stars were John Larkin, Ruta Lee, Joan Hackett, Frank Overton, Bruce Yarnall, Inga Swenson as Inger, Ben's second wife, Felicia Farr as his third wife, Grandon Rhodes, Patricia Donahue, Robert Lansing, Lisa Lu and Steve Forrest. Titles such as \"The Honor of Cochise\", \"The Eden Train\", \"Inger, My Love I,II\", \"Right is the Fourth \"R\"\", and \"The Mountain Girl\" among many others bring fond memories. Many directors toiled on \"Bonanza\", whose title referred to the rich ore found in the Virginia City area during the nineteenth century. The list included Lewis Allen, Leon Benson, William F. Claxton, Herschel Daugherty, Don McDougall, Christian Nyby, Leo Penn and William Witney. Principal writers for the series, with 5 or more credits, included Robert V. Barron, Frank Chase, Suzanne Clauser, Frank Cleaver, the producer David Dortort, Warren Douglas, John Hawkins, Ward Hawkins, Arther Heinemann, Michael Landon, Jo Pagano, Stanley Roberts, Robert Sabaroff, Jack B. Sowards, Thomas Thompson and Al C. Ward. It is difficult to characterize the show except that it was a consistently second-rank attempt to do stories about first-rate ethical people living in an interesting era in a frontier setting. It was the first of the family-oriented westerns, and at the same time a show capable of detaching its principals for dual or independent adventures. If few of its episodes risk to great dramatic heights, many are far-above-average film-making efforts, even by feature-film standards. The production featured clean, straightforward cinematography, Nellie Manley's hairstyles, Wally Westmore's makeup, enjoyable costumes and expert sets, art direction and action scenes. If the family spent too much time at home, seldom were shown with cattle and had virtually no employees, the writers made up for such derelictions by involving the sons and the father in the affairs of town and territory.

Ben is a self-made man who has carved out a piece of Nevada - a large piece - as a prosperous ranch. Each of Ben's sons has a different mother and a very different background. Adam's mother is from New England, Hoss' mother had Scandinavian roots and met Ben out on the Great plains when Ben and Adam were on the way west after Ben's first wife died. Little Joe's mother was a southerner from New Orleans. This difference in roots is explored even in the first season when Little Joe almost joins the Confederate army after having someone come into town and stir up his feelings for his southern roots. However, the full story doesn't come out until later. There is one episode each in seasons two, three, and four that are dedicated to telling the story of each of Ben's wives.<br/><br/>This first season follows the successful road map that all of the seasons did. Many have a guest star that is recognized even today. For example, Yvonne De Carlo is the guest star in the very first episode. Alan Hale Jr. (The Skipper of Gilligan's Island) also makes the first of several guest appearances he will make over the years during the first season.<br/><br/>Most episodes involve heavy-hitting drama often involving some injustice which the Cartwrights, with their prominent place in the community, are in a place to right. The show often used the fact that it was set in the old west to explore some of the social issues of the 1960's without stirring present-day controversy. However, there are a few almost completely comedic episodes here and there. The odd thing is, nobody did comedy as well as Bonanza did when Bonanza decided to do comedy, and usually Hoss is at the center of it all.<br/><br/>The show never really produces a long story arc. Each episode pretty much stands alone. The show really had only two disruptions. The first, which didn't prove fatal to the show, was when Pernell Roberts left in the late 1960's. His \"place\" was taken by Candy. Candy was not another son - he was a hired hand, but he was also a trusted friend of the Cartwrights.<br/><br/>The second disruption probably was fatal by most accounts. Dan Blocker, who played Hoss, died suddenly of a heart attack in 1972. The show only lasted one more season before it was canceled.

Bonanza is still infinitely re watchable in re runs.<br/><br/>The series chronicles the adventures of the Cartwright family, who live on a ranch near Virginia City, Nevada around the Civil War era. Their ranch (called the Ponderosa) is run and defended by the widowed father, Ben, and his unmarried three sons, Adam, Hoss, and Little Joe. These three brothers have different mothers, all of whom have passed away years earlier.<br/><br/>The Cartwrights are a hard working, prosperous, and honourable family, highly respected in those parts. The Ponderosa is large so reaching its extremities requires a lot of horseback riding. Also, trips away are often necessary in order to buy or sell cattle and so forth. Needless to say, few of these excursions pass uneventfully. Although hospitable, much of the Cartwrights' energy must be spent defending their ranch from interlopers, or protecting themselves from townsfolk jealous of their prosperity and stellar reputation. The Cartwrights do a fair bit of firing their guns up in the air and such, but only shoot to kill when deemed absolutely necessary. They are involved in various town affairs, even the political life of the Nevada territory.<br/><br/>One of the main assets of the series is the underlying warmth that is always present (despite occasional disagreements) between Ben and his three sons, and (despite frequent disagreements) between the three brothers. Now, one brother might beat up another every now and then, but generally has a good reason for it at the time and his anger never lasts long! The characters are all very well drawn. Ben is portrayed as a successful and noble man of great integrity. The oldest son, Adam, the most rational and suave of the brothers, left midway through the series. The middle brother, Hoss, is a gentle giant of a teddy bear, who has an insatiable appetite for food and is a little shy around the ladies. The youngest, Little Joe, is a hot headed, handsome charmer who, by contrast, has quite a way with women. This trio of brothers enjoy various romances but their love interests are typically killed off by the end of the episode or else marriage proves impossible, for whatever reason.<br/><br/>The actors are all stellar in their roles, including Pernell Roberts (Adam), Dan Blocker (Hoss), Michael Landon (Little Joe), and of course Lorne Greene as the principled family patriarch, Ben.

How many of us would pay that much for the privilege of watching a show transmitted by a cathode ray picture tube on a 17-inch screen? I was eleven when the series began, and I watched it from the beginning.<br/><br/>Watching it now, 50 years later, several things come to mind. First, many of the story lines involve the Comstock Lode and the heyday of silver mining, which dates to 1859. For 1859, the weapons and clothes are, for the most part, not authentic. (The haircuts are left out of the discussion.) That's basically a nitpick.<br/><br/>And, it would have been impossible for Ben to have arrived in the Lake Tahoe area in 1839 and to have amassed a 100-square mile ranch in the next twenty years. Pioneers were still trying to solve the Sierra Nevada problem as late as 1847, and the Gold Rush did not even begin until two years later.<br/><br/>Indians are not played by Native American actors. John Ford was using Native American actors in the 1920s. The Bonanza producers could have easily done so thirty years later. That is a major nitpick for me.<br/><br/>There are other time-line problems. In Season 1, Mark Twain appears, and he is depicted as a middle-aged man. Mark Twain was 24 years-old in 1859. The stories also vacillate between 1859-1860 (pre-Civil War) and what was more suitable for an 1880 time-frame. There are continuity problems, over and over.<br/><br/>It is somewhat off-putting, too, that there is so much killing in the first season. In time, the killing was reduced.<br/><br/>Many of the episodes take a socially liberal slant, which would be hard to believe, given the time-line, but give the writers credit for anticipating the seismic shifts in the Nation's attitudes beginning in the 1960s.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the acting is good, and I have come to conclude in my latter years that Adam's character was drawn better than any other's. I don't think Pernell Roberts ever got the credit he deserved. Also, Season 1 reinforces the fact that Dan Blocker (Hoss) was a good actor.<br/><br/>Many of the stories trace real historical events.

There are also many fine dramatic episodes- including the Legacy(1963), and the War comes to Washoe. Also a must see is the pilot episode, where you get to see the characters as they were originally intended to be, by creator David Dortort. It has no actual title but goes by the title \"a Rose for Lotta\"- guest starring Yvonne Decarlo of Munsters fame. Some interesting tidbits are that Michael Landon was the only one with a full head of hair- He colored his though because his went gray by age 20. Both Lorne Greene and Pernell Roberts wore hair pieces that were constantly changing(from the very beginning), and Dan Blocker wore a partial and or sprayed his head starting in 63 or 64.

Thats all- by the way after Bonanza my favorite and the best shows are #2 MASH, #3 Star Trek, #4 I Love Lucy, and #5 The Twilight Zone. Anyone one would be hard pressed to come up with better shows, Seinfeld is #14 for me. 6-10- Northern Exposure, Star Trek TNG, Quantum Leap, Cheers, and The Avengers(long live Emma Peel and Tara King(38/25/36) whoa! T. Part 2-It is 7 years later, and I am adding more- MASH is the only other show to be able to have equal parts humor and drama. Unfortunately, after Pernell left, the comedy episodes became more ridiculous and were a lot more infrequent. Pernell actually wanted to leave after the first season. He was the most liberal of the group(which is ironic because he was from Georgia), and he didn't like many stereotypical aspects of the show, that he thought could be vastly improved. The show started in 59', several years before the civil rights movement really took hold of the country. Also, unlike today where seasons are 8-16 episodes; back then it was 32. It was extremely grueling on everyone-They would film for 5 and a half days; usually 16 hr days. Then process and edit etc...There was no time for a break. Plus episodes back then were 47-50 min.vs 40-42 now. Pernell was not ready for the hard core assembly line of TV back then. He was mostly a stage and movie actor. Not only that, but the actors also did commercials for Chevy and promo appearances, and even records. All of that was part of their contracts. He felt( and deservedly so), like cattle. The money was not that important to him vs. everyone else, and he just got burned out. That coupled with what he thought was NBC and the producers ignoring his quality script ideas for the show, made him increasing dissatisfied. Now, in reality , they did listen somewhat-they even hired Lee Marvin for an episode where Adam has a nervous breakdown, after Marvin's character goes insane and treats Adam like a pack mule..Def. one of Pernell's best performances. They continued to try and make him happy by giving him many episodes where he didn't appear or only briefly, but it wasn't enough for him, because he felt trapped by his contract. Back then, a star of a show was not allowed to do anything else. Today that doesn't exist, as star TV actors basically control everything. The show had a big lull in it after he left, and even though the show lived for 8 more seasons, it was clearly lacking. Had the show been made a decade later, things would have been much different. Lastly, both MASH and Bonanza had many, many back story and historical errors, including years and time constantly changing, and back story characters dying and living etc...It seems completely ridiculous to think that they could get away with that, and I don't think they could now-of course the worst is got to be DAllAS when an entire season was a dream!! Still, there are so many great Bonanza episodes to watch, that it trumps all the errors.

What better than to create a family show based on true American history, with the right set of fundamental moral standards, and where every story has a happy ending? When also the absolute right set of characters played by the ultimate actors were created and found, and their never seen mother character empathicly had passed away, just so that female guest stars could make a much bigger impact in the episodes - how could it not be a success? It didn't matter that the quality of episode plots always weren't that good, that the jingle was truely poor before one of the most recognized theme tunes of all times came along, that the scenes constantly switched from studio to location filming, resulting in sudden changes of light, sound and actor's positions, that the acting sometimes was characterized by actors who were disappointed with their role, having a bad day, or simply being tired of it all.

He said it could have been a lot better if the bean counters were not totally focused on wringing every dollar out of it. They could have replaced him after a couple of years but the three remaining stars did not want to divide the pie in four pieces again. His leaving disrupted the rhythm of the show and the hole was never filled successfully. Also, it looks like about that time, Michael Landon was running everything. It was on for 14 years and none of the sons (before Dan Blocker's tragic death) grew or progressed in their characters. The show was stuck in a time warp and such a path for a show would not succeed today. In other words, after 5+ years, three adults sons would not still be living in the home place with their father and still acting like they were not quite adults yet. Like Pernell Roberts said, he felt that Adam should marry and have his own house, maybe on another part of the Ponderosa and start his own family.<br/><br/>It was not safe to be a woman who fell in love with a Cartwright. She would either die or fall in love with someone else, or one of them would change their mind. Also, I would not write Adam as they did in that he was a bit stuck on himself. It was a given that Hoss was not as smart as Adam but today, that would not be a source of amusement as it often was then. He certainly was not stupid. By the time 12 years had arrived: Adam, Hoss, and Joe would have married and started families. Remember, they got there around the time of the Mexican-American war and people got married and started families a lot earlier then than they do now.

Stories of this era often focus exclusively on the political figures and the generals involved. <br/><br/>These are people who have grown up together and in many cases been driven apart due to the respective sides they've chosen in the conflict, Tory vs Patriot. There are no real villains in this equation, since it's possible to make a good faith argument both for the rightness of maintaining allegiance to the Crown and the rightness of seeking independence due to unjust treatment. <br/><br/>It's fascinating to watch these political allegiances play out within the context of relationships, impacting friendships, romantic couplings, even family relations. <br/><br/>The spy angle is intriguing, well integrated into the story, and hooks you from the start.

But I appreciated the fact that the writers did not give us some lengthy explanation of a first episode (that usually spells dullness), but instead threw us into the story. A little patience paid off; soon, the story was comprehensible and compelling.<br/><br/>Additionally, I noted that much of the action is filmed in low light or in darkness of night. But how else would the covert actions of espionage be portrayed? And it's not like the colonials had neon lights. Staying true to the story and its historic environs helps the viewer project himself into the times during which it is set.<br/><br/>Perhaps you have come to realize that the glossy, \"patriotic\" version of the American Revolution you were taught in school had little to do with historic accuracy. \"Turn\" incorporates the ambiguities in loyalty/treason/patriotism that were present during the revolution, especially in the times \"Turn\" is set. Those who took sides did not always choose the \"right\" side according to personal principles. In the twenty-first century, many who speak about loyalty to a government that has given them opportunity, laws, protection, etc. would probably have found themselves on the Tory side in the 1770s. Law and order sometimes come with oppression and people have different tolerances for oppression. This is clearly demonstrated in the pilot.<br/><br/>One reviewer said that the pilot was historically inaccurate. I do not think so. So far, it seems about as close to accurate as the passing years allow.<br/><br/>A good drama will allow for differences in personality and honor among its characters. Hopefully, British soldiers, for example, will display different temperaments and varying degrees of honor. In the pilot, it seemed that will hold to be true.<br/><br/>I am rating this show highly and hoping that future episodes live up to its promise.<br/><br/>UPDATE after watching 4 episodes: I am really enjoying this show. Throughout there are references to developments in the war that I know of, as we are treated to activities behind the scenes.

Virtually no thematic variety.<br/><br/>So first and foremost, TURN is an interesting theme and time period for a series. Although it is fictionalized for the soap-y through storyline, I am so totally intrigued by the real historical accuracies that after every episode I am reading the on-line content, researching bits, and have even borrowed the copy of Washington Spies that I gave my Dad for Father's Day a few years ago to read. At last, a TV show that Dad and I can't wait to enjoy together!<br/><br/>I thought the first episode was just good enough for me to tune in the second week. By week 4 though, TURN had challenged Mr Selfridge for the \"which do I watch and which do I dvr.\" By episode 8, I was craving TURN in between episodes. <br/><br/>Criticisms: The accents: I think the accents - which DO enrich the characters and would have been present in that era - makes the dialogue hard to understand at times, and I watch with closed captioning on at least once in order to catch all of it. The accents don't confuse the action but particularly when they use a period colloquialism, I find myself worried I missed something subtle.<br/><br/>Who is who: It took me five full episodes to sort out the British and in the first three episodes confused John Andre and Ben Tallmadge. None of them had enough screen time in the first four episodes for me to know who was who for whom.<br/><br/>CGI Backgrounds: OMG, this is the worst criticism I have. The CGI ocean ACTION scenes are so freaking bad and it cheapens an otherwise high production value. They remind me of the final ocean scenes in Truman.<br/><br/>The Pros: So well acted, and I don't say that lightly. In the first three episodes, I thought they leaned heavily on Kevin McNally to assure the audience this was serious performance drama. None of the characters except Anna and Abe get a great amount of screen time in any one episode, so every look and every word and every action has to project a great deal of information to the viewer. I think this show is as well acted as any of my regular viewing which is mostly Downton Abbey, Big Bang Theory and HBO. <br/><br/>The incorporation of the historical, the literary, and the vehicle. Very well done.<br/><br/>The likability of the characters: Each of these characters are not entirely likable and yet all are riveting. <br/><br/>Captain Simcoe's chilling, amazing, insane gestalt shriek! Abraham Woodhall's transformation. John Andre's perfection. Anna's broken heart over and over, and awesome latent feminism. I could go on.<br/><br/>Cultural and period accuracy.

If a square peg doesn't fit their idea of a round hole, they shave the edges until it fits. I also understand that there are people who wish to elevate Governor John Simcoe to sainthood - great, he probably was a super guy. One must remember that war tends to bring the worst out of people. Simcoe, proved his tactical brilliance numerous times. In one instance, as a major, he led a surprise attack at the, 'Battle of Crooked Billet,' resulting in a brilliant victory. I don't know how accurate witness' accounts of the horrific treatment of prisoners of war actually were by the Loyalists, and I have questions concerning the accuracy of stories about Loyalists burning living captives to death. Incidetns worthy of questions...but should not be poo-poo and completely dismissed. Atrocitites happened. With that being said, Samuel Roukin portrays Simcoe as one down-right dirty rotten scoundrel of a bad guy (every good show needs a good antagonist) and boy, does he do an outstanding 'bad guy,' impersonation.

For those who have read anything about the Revolutionary War, you may or may not agree (and who really cares anyways \u2013 I dreamed this theory up myself, so you come up with your own)\u0085the outcome depended so heavily on things falling into just the right place at just the right time. The end-result of the War could have (and maybe should have? hmmmm) gone the other way. I do hope the show succeeds and doesn't try to warp history too much. Once the plot wanders too far out onto some outstretched limb, and it has no chance of finding its way back \u2013 I fire the show from my TV.

I had given up on this show back in the second season finding the acting a little corny and the dialogue strange, but when I decided to catch up on it, I found myself enjoying the dramas of the characters alongside the pressures of war. Anna Strong (Heather Lind) finds herself in the refugee camp after refusing marriage to Major Hewlett (Burn Gorman). She conspires with Ben Talmadge (Seth Numrich) and Caleb Brewster (Daniel Henshall) to root out the spies in the camp who seek to betray General George Washington (Ian Kahn).<br/><br/>Woodhull has been so close to being exposed on numerous occasions especially as he was hunted by John Simcoe (Samuel Roukin). The plot at the beginning of the season sees Woodhull parting from his wife Mary (Meegan Warner) who has taken resistance into her own hands before including shooting Simcoe, and pretending to be captured with his father Judge Richard Woodhull (Kevin McNally) by the rebels in order to free Caleb. This plot goes terribly wrong when the Judge is shot during the prisoner exchange and Abraham is nearly shot too if he wasn't saved by Akinbode (Aldis Hodge). The murder of his father gives Woodhull the chance to disguise his motivations for joining the British army. <br/><br/>Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com", "rating": 7, "helpful": "6 out of 7 found this helpful.", "date": "13 August 2017"}, {"title": " Absolutely head over heals with this series!!!", "content": "This episode was absolutely amazing!

Let me tell you when i saw the first couple of episodes i had a little trouble following the dialogue and at one point almost decided to drop it, i am so glad i didn't. i am mainly basing this review on the last episode,even though the entire series as a whole was excellent. The series finale not only kept me glued to my seat but on the edge of it. The entire series was good but the finale was a bloodbath, they went a little overboard with killing a whole bunch of people but that only tightened the grip on the show even more. my favorite character in the entire show has to be Captain simcoe,the main antagonist. Samuel Roukin not only played his role, he dominated it. I loved the part where he finally cracked. In his mind, you could literally see the essential part that allows us as humans to be reasonable and not act too rash shatter. When Simcoe saw that Maj. Hewlett was going to issue a peaceful trade-off in where the rebels would return the British soldiers without them being harmed and the royal army would return the captured prisoners, he lost it and did the deal breaker, the final squeeze of a show that was already gripping me pretty tight, the final shove that pushed me to the very last edge of my seat, what i consider the climax of the entire episode and the entire series. He grabs Brewster's grandfather takes him outside,for all the rebels to see, pulls out a pistol, puts it to the poor old man's neck and without any hesitation whatsoever pulls the trigger. Now this action as aggressive and enough for me as it was, was not the end of it,oh no, i was satisfied with simcoe killing the old man and that being it but no, another reason this is such an amazing show is when you've had enough and you say \"oh, no thank you, my nerves have had enough and i have enough goosebumps as it is\" this show says no! you haven't had enough and to the shock of all the rebels and me simcoe lets the old man's lifeless body fall to the ground and with blood splattered on his face gives off one final scream of insanity and then cuts to commercials.Normally when a show cuts to commercials everybody's just like \"aw man\" and this time is no exception, i still hate when a show cuts to commercials but this was timed perfectly. It is kinda like hearing a really good conspiracy theory and then thinking about it later when it has had time to sink in. Throughout the entire commercial period i was petrified at how amazing the role of a madman can be played if the right man plays him, i was reminded of that feeling i haven't felt since i saw heath ledger's performance of the joker in the dark knight. Even as i am playing the scene over in my head right now i am getting goosebumps. And after that, shocking and trilling things happened throughout the remainder of the episode, like Abe learning it is kill or be killed when the British redcoat living in your house finds out you are a rebel spy and his and Mary's plan to escape punishment for this horrible incident but none can compare to the real performance we got from captain simcoe,the last time i saw such a primal,insane and just plain psychotic look in a man's eyes like that i was watching a video documentary on the third Reich.

As an \"X-Phile\" I'm obviously interested in the subject matter. The idea of a show based on the real-life Project Blue Book investigations is intriguing. The historical setting is a nice change of pace.<br/><br/>The problem is that tonally and conceptually, the show is inconsistent. Characters often seem to have multiple personality disorder.<br/><br/>During the course of a typical episode, the two main characters (Aidan Gillen and Michael Malarkey), as well as their immediate superior (Neal McDonough) will vacillate many times between (a) seeming to believe that people are having UFO and alien (and occasionally other Fortean) encounters, (b) seeming to think that the idea of UFO and alien encounters is pure bunk, and (c) being more agnostic about it but seeming to think that their job is (i) ultimately to provide b.s. cover stories for the government, or (ii) ultimately to be subversive and suggest that the government is covering up something.<br/><br/>A lot of screen time that could be spent on investigations is spent on inter-character drama where our stars take turns being on opposing sides of (a), (b), (c)(i) and (c)(ii) above. It becomes confusing. You don't know who is on what side. It's usually not clear what anyone's goal is exactly. And the bosses seem to continually make decisions--including many times that Project Blue Book was going to be closed or at least our investigators fired--that they renege on within 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The pacing and overall aesthetic--even the style of dialogue delivery, reminds me a lot of the video game L.A.

The majority of the worlds' people believed that the world had to be flat and to sail past the sun's horizon a ship would fall off of the end of the world. More recently in the early 1900's songs were sung about reaching for the moon and who can forget that fateful day on July 20th, 1969, when the entire world was literally glued to their black and white television sets to watch that historical moment when American Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed their spacecraft Apollo 11 on the moon's surface.

Most rational people believed aliens did not exist and the wild stories were all hoaxes, but go back in time in the 1400's when the world was considered to be flat, or in the 1900's when no one believed a man would ever land on the moon, but here we are.<br/><br/>I was taught to believe in Christmas and Santa Claus and I am a better man for it, as are my own children.

With The X-Files no more it is nice to have a show like this on the air especially since in part it inspired the show created by Chris Carter.\nThe episode begins with a US Air Force pilot encountering a light in the sky causing his plane to crash. Enter Capt. Michael Quinn (Malarkey) who is tasked by his superior Gen. Harding (McDonough) to look into the case with the assistance a college professor Dr. Allen Hynek. Hynek very early on is painted as the \"believer\" with the Capt. being the hardened skeptic which is a common trope in this type of show.\nI really liked the pilot episode even though it did heavily rely on the cliches of a possible gov't. conspiracy to cover up the truth, shady men in black and partners at odds in their search for the truth. Even though it does contain a lot of familiar tropes I still found the episode very entertaining and to be fair this is not a show looking to reinvent the wheel but to retell the \"based on true case files\" of Project Blue Book which is an entity I have been long familiar with as I have had a long time interest in the paranormal and in the possibility of extraterrestrial life.\nThe end of the program actually provided some of the real life details of the case that the episode was based on. There was a subplot in the episode involving Dr. Hynek's wife that I didn't feel was truly necessary but I know that they are trying to fluff up the series with interpersonal dramas and entanglements to make the show more interesting to a broad audience.\nI definitely plan on checking out episode two of the show as I want to learn more about the cases investigated by the government entity.

Yes, it has some (well done, IMHO) musical numbers. If this makes your eyes roll back in your head, then nothing else that anyone says will probably make much difference to you. Is it different? Yeah, sure it is. As someone else already proclaimed, it is \"refreshing\". With so many other \"attempts\" at comedy programming, which simply retread the same formula (ad infinitum), it's enjoyable to see someone do something completely different. I also thought that the premise of the show was clever, as well, and thought that the initial musical presentation of that \"plot\" enhanced it, instead of detracting. (It pretty much \"enhanced\" and legitimized, the craziness of it all, which I assume to have been 100% intentional.) As I'm only one episode in, it's hard to know how the writing will hold up. I'm far more concerned about the fact that (in most parts of the country) it's head to head, with three, double-digit ratings, \"big network\" programs. That may say more about its ability to survive, than future scripts, musical numbers, or anything else. It feels a lot like the CW has simply offered it up (from the get-go) as nothing more than a sacrificial lamb. In fact, it's probably the absolute worst possible time slot, in that it's up against two reality shows, one involving singing, and the other dancing. If there's an audience that might have actually been \"the most likely to enjoy\" a comedy that folds in full (singing and dancing) musical numbers, it's probably the folks that are already invested in two of those three double-digit (ratings) programs!

His success had been adequate, but far from impressive. By 1984, NBC wanted to have a show that would be endeared not only by minority groups, but also by white America. Enter \"The Cosby Show\", the very definition of a Nielsen Ratings Monster as it devoured competition, along with cohort \"Cheers\", for the better part of the 1980s and early-1990s. The series is basically the life of Cosby with a few creative twists. Cosby, an obstetrician, lives in New York with his wife Phylicia Rashad (an attorney) and their four children (Lisa Bonet, Malcolm-Jamal Warner, Tempestt Bledsoe and Keshia Knight-Pulliam). Comedy and drama would always dominate the series, but an early criticism of \"The Cosby Show\" was that it had no real point to it. Enter eldest child Sabrina Le Beauf who was created the middle of season one. This child was away at college and receiving a first-class education at an Ivy League School. And that is the point of \"The Cosby Show\"---two parents doing their best to give their five children the life and opportunities that they have taken advantage of. The Le Beauf character was a culmination of everything that Cosby and Rashad did with the four younger children. As the series grew, the cast grew to include performers like Geoffrey Owens, Joseph C. Phillips, Deon Richmond and scene-stealer Raven-Symone. The greatest problem that most had with the show was that critics said it did not show accurate African-American life in this country. To be perfectly honest, this show does not show typical life for the vast majority of this nation's population. There are not many white children in this nation that have a doctor and a lawyer as parents so that criticism lacks substance and social research. Cosby always kept the show somewhat light-hearted and sometimes shied away from some key issues of the time period, but keep in mind that his name was on the program and everything was written as if the characters were sometimes walking on eggshells. Bonet created the controversy for the series during its run, especially in 1987 with her very adult-oriented role in \"Angel Heart\". That did not deter, but rather engross an even larger audiences tuned in by the late-1980s. Slowly the younger performers grew up and grew out of their roles and the series finally began to show its age by the 1990s. But for a few fleeting moments in the 1980s, was there anyone bigger than Bill Cosby?

If you aim high enough and work for it, you will succeed too. They showed how important family values really are now in a time of broken dysfunctional families. Bill Cosby, God Bless Him. He made me believe I could go to New York University like Theo. I was accepted but I could not afford it. However, Bill Cosby got me to believe in myself and he is wonderful and thoughtful about children. You can let your children watch Bill Cosby without worrying that they may pick up something bad from it. Bill Cosby may be the best babysitter on television today.

So we subscribed... and I'll never forget that \"Hallelujah\" feeling when I finally discovered the Huxtables. We enjoyed the \"Physican of the Year\" then the \"First Day of School\" episodes but the show won us with \"The Juicer\". There was something unique in the way Clair Huxtable (Phylicia Rashad) handled the incident with little Rudy (Keshia Knight Pulliam), and such a beautiful moment when Cliff (Bill Cosby) hugged her. And I still remember that glee in my Dad's eyes in the following scene where Clair, like a good lawyer, confronted Cliff to his own responsibility and he had no other choice than naughtily pleading guilty. No other show had such inspiring displays of good education and a marital chemistry that was very sexy under a family-friendly cover. The show became an instant favorite.<br/><br/>To make it better, my father had to record it for his sister who didn't have the decoder, which ended with an interesting collection of Cosby VHS tapes we've been borrowing from her for years and years. These are not gratuitous anecdotes, they illustrate the power of the best family sitcom: to be deeply connected with your own family memories, this is how big 'Cosby' was at that time. And I still remember my 4-year old brother answering the phone saying \"Huxtable Residence\", imitating Cosby's groovy moves at the end of the second season's intro or \"zerbutting\" on my father's cheek\u0085 the show affected our life. And when I heard the \"Night time\" song in the film \"Ray\", I immediately remembered that hilarious anniversary episode, and \"I Just Called\" still brings me back to that magnificent episode with Stevie Wonder. \"The Cosby Show\" was THE wonder and we were familiar with names like Malcolm-Jamal Warner or Tempest Bledsoe before any Bruce Willis or Julia Roberts\u0085 and even at 8, I understood why the show was titled by the name of his main actor.<br/><br/>On a sad note, this is why I've been thinking for a long time that Malcolm Jamal Warner died: because my grandma told me that 'the son of Cosby' died, it was his real-life son, Ennis, shot dead in 1997. And the fact that Cosby and Huxtable almost make one might explain why the series is being tarnished by the rape scandal, to the point it's pulled off the air almost everywhere. It was even more revealing when my favorite website made a list of the greatest TV dads and overlooked Cliff Huxtable. But should all the harm Cosby might have done cancel all the positive things the show provided? Can we just ignore a show of such historical magnitude and with so many great messages to the youth?<br/><br/>Remember the pilot, Theo confesses, during a heartfelt speech, that he might not be a doctor or a lawyer like his parents but that they should love him as a son anyway. The long pause, followed by the audiences applauses are instantly swept off by Cliff's iconic answer \"that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard\"... there's no pride in being an underachiever if you give up before trying. Cosby was the father of five children, whose names started with 'E' as in Excellency, and his hymn to efforts was not just typical 80's inspirational stuff, it was ahead of its time because it made the 'obvious' race issue look insignificant. We never cared for the Huxtables family being Black, they were a regular successful family \"happening to be Black\"... but it certainly encouraged many Black young people to go to college. Should such a positive model be banned from TV?<br/><br/>The show was also ahead of its time on another topic: feminism. Forget \"Girls\", \"Desperate Housewives\" or \"Sex and the City\", \"The Cosby Show\" was the first feminist show and with four daughters and a mother of such classy strong-mindedness as Clair Huxtable, it was unavoidable although this \"battle of the sexes\" aspect annoyed me a little when the \"woman-always-right\" became a pattern for redundant and uninspired episodes (from the \"perfect parents with imperfect kids\", the series became about a \"perfect mother\"). I also never bought the way poor Elvin (Geoffrey Owens) was branded as a macho when most of the time, he should have grown a pair and tells Sondra (Sabrina Lebeauf) how he felt, but I guess it makes it all the more ironic that the show's reputation is ruined because of a scandal involving women. <br/><br/>Now, I wish I could speak about the best and the worst of the show, how I could pinpoint the start of the decline with Rudy's story episode in Season 4, the attempt to replace her with Olivia not to mention the infamous Muppet nightmare (literally), but the series needs kinder words, reminding how important it was back then, when every 80's/90's sitcom, whether to copy the model (\"Growing Pains\") or work on a blue-collar level (\"Roseanne\"), was an answer to \"The Cosby Show\", starting with its the biggest rival, \"The Simpsons\", still airing today maybe because, contrarily to \"The Cosby Show\", kids couldn't age and time was frozen, so the appeal stayed the same. And now, every sitcom is an answer to \"The Simpsons\", but that doesn't diminish the legacy of its 'big brother' \"The Cosby Show\", on the contrary. And ignoring this legacy by pulling the show off the air is as harmful to the show as it is to the people it inspired and can inspire in the future. <br/><br/>And speaking for myself, I can't ignore the show just as I can't ignore my best family memories, which the show is part of.", "rating": 8, "helpful": "15 out of 19 found this helpful.", "date": "24 July 2016"}, {"title": " Good In the Beginning", "content": "The first season of the Cosby Show made it one of the finest shows on television.

Great viewing for youngsters since the offspring on this show, despite assorted rebellious phases, moods, and disagreements, invariably treat Mom &amp; Dad with the respect they both expect and deserve. Of course the series is legendary, and quite deservedly so, for its landmark portrayal of a well educated, affluent Afro American family. True, maybe the Huxtables don't represent the typical American family (black or otherwise), but I consider it a positive and uplifting depiction of a FUNCTIONAL family.<br/><br/>The program chronicles the amusing interactions of the Huxtable family, who live in a lovely, well appointed Brooklyn brownstone. The father, Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, is an obstetrician and the mother, Claire, a lawyer. They have five children ranging from kindergarten to college age...Sondra (initially off at Princeton), Denise (a funky rebel), Theo (a charming underachiever eventually revealed as dyslexic), Vanessa (originally an insecure pre teen), and Rudy (the cute, precocious, and rather spoiled baby of the family). As the series progresses, four of the offspring go off to college, various romances come &amp; go, Sondra marries med school student Elvin and has twins (Nelson &amp; Winnie, after the Mandelas), and Denise weds the divorced sailor, Martin, who has an adorable little girl, Olivia. The Huxtable family is eventually also joined by Claire's teenage cousin, Pam.<br/><br/>The cast are all stellar in their roles...Phylicia Rashad (Claire), Sandra Le Beuf (Sondra), Lisa Bonet (Denise), Malcolm-Jamal Warner (Theo), Tempestt Bledsoe (Vanessa), Keshia Knight Pulliam (Rudy), and of course the incredible Bill Cosby himself as Heathcliff. Personally, my favourite character apart from Heathcliff himself, is the charismatic, cool ne'er do well, Theo. I also love his sidekick, Cockroach, as well as Rudy's hilarious little friend, Kenny!<br/><br/>In a sense, it's a bit of a modern Father Knows Best, albeit well laced with humour. The perpetually funny but wise Heathcliff has an amazing relationship with his children, a treasure trove of sound fatherly advice, and especially endless patience. He never loses his temper but always deals good naturedly with every challenge...whether an outrageous outfit, dead pet goldfish, poor report card, unsavoury boyfriend, dropping out of college or surprise marriage announcement. One of my favourite episodes depicts Cliff demonstrating to Theo just how rapidly his puny salary will disappear if he doesn't get a college education, especially if he has a girlfriend! Not only is Cliff a wonderful father, but also the obstetrician every female viewer wishes could deliver her babies! The chemistry and banter between him and wife, Claire, are both fabulous.<br/><br/>My sole complaint may not be popular, but I believe this series strengthens the myth that women can truly do it all. Claire has a successful law practice (bringing home a briefcase, presumably containing work), maintains a fairly large and spotless home, prepares lovely meals, always appears drop dead gorgeous &amp; stylishly clad, enjoys outings with her children as well as social engagements with her husband, and invariably responds positively (never too weary) to her charming but rakish husband's bedroom advances. Above all, she's an exemplary mother to her FIVE children, always appropriately in the know regarding their homework assignments, school antics, relationships with friends, college or dating woes, and parties they shouldn't be attending. Really, she's quite a remarkable lady...and all with no sign of any maid, live in nanny, or significant involvement of her husband and youngsters with household chores.<br/><br/>However, though many aspects may not be realistic, it's a wonderful series overall. The Cosby Show presents uplifting programming for Afro Americans (and everyone else), frequently bringing into discussion Martin Luther King Jr. and other such inspiring personages. A tip of my hat to this series and all the entertainment contributions of Bill Cosby, who must surely be one of the funniest human beings alive.

The 1960's had \"The Danny Thomas Show\". In the 1970's there was of course \"The Brady Bunch\". Then in the 1980's came another feel good family comedy called \"The Cosby Show\" which was the first time this TV genre was devoted to an all African American cast.<br/><br/>The patriarch of this loving, and well structured nuclear family was none other than veteran actor/comedian Bill Cosby himself. Cosby played an obstetrician named Heathcliff Huxtable, with a loving,loyal yet very independent and professional wife Claire, played by Phyllicia Rashad.<br/><br/>Cliff and Claire a litigation attorney by trade, had five kids ranging in age from kindergarten to college. Rudy, the youngest (Keshia Knight Pulliam), Vanessa (Tempest Bledsoe), Theo (Cliff and Clair's only son played by Malcolm Jamal Warner), Denise (Lisa Bonet) and oldest child Sandra (Sabrina Lebeauf) living away at Princeton.<br/><br/>\"The Cosby Show\" went through the trials and tribulations of all of the kids growing up and their adolescent problems. Even though the sitcom was centered around the dean of comedy, Bill Cosby, the only irreplaceable member of this show, the other actors were well cast and their characters were well drawn out. Claire was also fabulous as the 80's do it all mother, hard working and strong willed yet conscientious and nurturing to all of her children.<br/><br/>Of course Bill Cosby was perfectly cast as the patriarch of the Huxtable clan. He was a father who could do it all. Spend quality time with all his kids, always give them good advice, tend to all of their problems many of them being silly and trivial, and still hold down a great full time career.<br/><br/>There was one thing I always loved and admired about Bill Cosby as Dr. Heathcliff Huxtable, the father. He never lost his temper with his kids, despite their immaturity and bad decisions.At least Heathcliff never showed it in his demeanor to his kids,whether it was Theo failing in school, or Sandra living in squalor with her husband Elvin, or Vanessa refusing to leave Cliff and Claire alone for the night because she was having nightmares of a R-Rated movie Claire forbid her to see.<br/><br/>Cliff never lost his temper with Denise, even with all of her contemptuous boyfriends, her weird outfits, and high strung personality. Densise never really fit well into the feel good, well structured authoritarian Huxtable household. She was always like a rebel without a cause, and when her rebellious boyfriend (Kristoff St. John) broke bread with Cliff and Claire for the first time, Denise decided to join his cause, even though she didn't really know what it was. David James was a vegetarian and not for ethical or environmental reasons, but because he had a vendetta against the medical establishment. He also had a vendetta against the legal establishment too, Claire's profession.<br/><br/>When David came to dinner with intentionally wearing mismatched socks, he looked like the perfect boyfriend for bandanna wearing, nose piercing, totally 80's hip Denise. But she quickly broke it off with him. HE WASN'T HER TYPE.<br/><br/>\"The Cosby Show\" drew light on many of these new teen fashion trends, which used to make parents blood boil, but today are commonplace. Remember the episode when Theo came home with an earring, and was desperately trying to hide it from his dad. Today half of all young males who weren't born when this episode originally aired in 1984 have their ears pierced.<br/><br/>Cliff always knew the right things to say to all kids, the good ones as well as the rebels. He was kind, considerate, sociable, yet still fatherly and authoritarian. Bill Cosby himself was always a master at relating to kids of all ages, from toddlers all the way through the oldest college students. It was fun seeing his character Heathcliff play fatherly figure to some of Denise and Theo's weird and drug using friends, yet also be able to warm up to insecure Vanessa and hers, and of course little Rudy and her little gang of rug-rats.<br/><br/>Cliff had so many great moments with Rudy, like when he was trying to teach her that eventually everything that lives, dies, like her poor little goldfish \"Lamont\", that she kept feeding even though it was floating on its back. Rudy was upset but got over it quickly, and Cliff got carried away with the goldfish's \"funeral\".<br/><br/>Vanessa unlike Rudy always had a problem with insecurity and lack of perseverance. She would always try a new activity, but would lack the motivation to excel at what she did. This reminds me of myself. This just brought out some of the immaturity of the Huxtable kids.<br/><br/>The only major problem I had with \"The Cosby Show\" is that it did not accurately and truthfully portray the average middle class American family, and certainly did not portray the average, urban African American family. How many average black families, all right, how many white families live in a beautiful Brooklyn townhouse where the father is a successful medical doctor, and the mother is a successful lawyer? And of course both still have more than enough time to devote to their kids without a live in nanny. I think that two lesser known but above average sitcoms from the 1970's \"What's Happening!!\" and \"Good Times\" were a more realistic portrayal of urban African American life.<br/><br/>\"The Cosby Show\" was written more in the style of feel good family sitcoms from the 1950's and 1960's like \"The Brady Bunch\", \"My Three Sons\" and \"Leave it to Beaver\", than a realistic portrayal of the mainstream African American family.

While a common criticism of this show is that it does not accurate represent race, the real truth is that the show doesn't represent human beings in any way, shape, or form. There are no real issues handled in a realistic manner. There are no real characterization outside of archetypes that date back to \"Leave It To Beaver.\" Theo could be interchanged with Wally Cleaver or Eddie Haskell at various points in the show's run. Bill Cosby's character could be Gomez Addams mixed with the ghost of Dick Van Dyke. The lack of true characterization is what dooms this show. If anything, the Cosby Show was able to be a classic because it was right on the precipice of the old sitcom mold and what was to come but not yet formed style of television making. It did what it did well, but what it did wasn't anything groundbreaking. The Cosby Show could have been about homosexual Martian plumbers who collected Spawn figures, and the archetypes would have been exactly the same from every sitcom that came before it. Race wasn't a factor outside of publicity. Anybody could have inhabited those roles and made a classic. They did: it was a mold used for various sitcoms since the rise of popular television.<br/><br/>That said, the show just isn't interesting anymore. Now that Cosby's best-known show has faded into the ether for fifteen-plus years, its lack of characterization really plays against it. While most people alive and watching then could easily recognize the plot of the show, the fun is just no longer there. Outside of the new and the generally accepted opinion that the show was funny at parts, the show just has nothing to it. Most of the actors on it have faded into the ether along with the show or have done nothing of real consequence since then. They're not untalented, but the show gave them nothing to stand out with. With archetypes for characters, nobody stands out unless the plot directs them to.<br/><br/>In short, the show that represented the best years NBC has ever had is now just a forgotten relic without any punch in a world full of more interesting programming. While it is a piece of the past, there's nothing to recommend it outside of nostalgia. While this is unfortunate, it was the same fate that befell most of the shows that it based off of. Considering the fate of that sitcom mold, perhaps the Cosby Show can claim some sort of victory. At least it used the mold when it was somewhat respectable, and not tarnished by has-beens with the last names of Belushi and Sheen.<br/><br/>Not a good ending, but not as bad as it could have been.

However, the characters have strong mannerism; there's great emphasis on development. Basically, there's some dilemma being faced... people join forces and battle this threat; Also, the search for Dragon Balls places heroes and villains against one another; each having their own desires for obtaining the balls.<br/><br/>Story: The essence of the series is to convey a solid storyline, intertwined with sheer brutality... well-animated fighting... and emotional sequences... there's a commonly seen pattern of events building to climactic, pulse-pounding revelations.<br/><br/>Music: I can say one thing about English version music: it's bad. They're plain techno tracks that don't match the great emotion... with minor exceptions... most are lame. However, the DVD releases have included the original Japanese version music, which is a GREAT positive; those extravagant tracks are the sheer saving grace as the show's BGM. There's such emphasis placed on each strike of a limb, every twitching nerve; everything perfectly coincides. Bravo to Shunsuke Kikuchi for writing these brilliant pieces; especially the likes of \"Kyoufu no Ginyu Tokusentai,\" and \"Tenka Wakeme No Chou-Kessen\"... examples that bring the scenes to life.<br/><br/>Battles: Some conflicts are rather long and tedious. I didn't enjoy the scuffle between Gohan and Cell, for example. That two-way Kamehameha was quite annoying. Nor was it enjoyable to witness the childishness of a candy battling Super Buu... that's rather lame, to say the least. However, there's enormously brutal instances littered with bone-cracking, back-breaking action that makes up for it. Personally, my favorites are, respectively: <br/><br/>1. Zarbon versus Vegeta - Zarbon transforms into a demonic beast and completely dominates Vegeta with a systematic ferocious head-butt combination, gripping choke holds, and a devastating pile-driver that sends Vegeta plummeting.<br/><br/>2. Recoome versus Vegeta, Goku, Gohan, and Krillin - Recoome tosses Vegeta like a rag doll, incapacitates Krillin with a single kick, and unleashes an array of blasts against Gohan before paralyzing him, and is in turn downed by Goku's swift hit.<br/><br/>3. Android 19 versus Vegeta and Goku - Android 19 takes the opportunity to savagely suck Goku's energy as a heart virus weakens the warrior... until Vegeta intervenes, proceeding to shred off 19's arms and relentlessly decapitate him.<br/><br/>4. Spopovich versus Videl - Videl's attack generates no effect on the muscle-bound Majin-inflicted Spopovich, who mutilates Videl using bone-smashing maneuvers.<br/><br/>Characters: They're all well-layered, exquisitely designed, and encompass radiant back-stories. Ultimately, my favorite characters are villains. In particular, Zarbon and Dodoria; they redefined the substance of villainy and are perfect plot devices due to butchering the Namekian warriors, elders, and children. In essence, they portray brutality; the more treacherous a character, the more I'd find them captivating. Their suggestion to Frieza to eliminate the Saiyan race pretty much sets the entire story in motion. They meet a grisly fate... which makes me love them even more. There's others I love, the likes of which include Cui, The Ginyu Force, Android 19, Spopovich, Dabura, Pui Pui, Nappa, Raditz, and Frieza... but Zarbon and Dodoria remain my favorites throughout the series run.<br/><br/>Sagas: The series is divided into three primary sagas: The Frieza debacle, the Cell scuffle, and the Buu era... all three have redeeming qualities... my least favorite's the Cell Games, where the main antagonist challenges the main protagonists to a tournament (I found this idea rather dull in comparison to the rest; it was less engrossing in terms of ferocity)... I was rather neutral for the Buu saga in terms of progression since the main antagonist was a bumbling goo monster... fine for children maybe, but for the serious viewer, not very appealing... Ultimately, I found the Frieza saga to be best, beginning with the Saiyan conflict between Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta... to the three-way guerrilla war making a battlefield of Namek, where Zarbon, Dodoria, and Cui take on Vegeta, who later joins forces with the protagonists to take down the Mercenary Squadron of the Ginyu Force... and the eventual rise of the Super Saiyan, Goku... who faces Lord Frieza to halt the tyrant's threat. This was Akira Toriyama's masterpiece; the epitome of the series at its zenith. Of course, like many series, the ending couldn't live up to prior expectations... it was rather low-key and without rising tension.<br/><br/>Moral: Everyone takes something away when they watch it; be it last impressions or a complete understanding of the piece... I have obtained, to my knowledge, the best viewing experience an anime can offer. Giving mankind such an honorable taste of morals, it remains unparalleled. The actions of subduing one's own greed and desires to find a common goal, and sometimes choosing to do things one would detest for the overall betterment makes this series genuinely riddled with moral overdose.<br/><br/>Overall: As a highlight to anime history, the series should be judged on all levels; not its eventual decline. The Frieza saga portrays Toriyama's vision as he had originally grafted it, without altering anything based on fan preference. It was the initial concept to which the series unfolded; The struggle of good versus evil portrays the wicked with emotion; Frieza has feelings of his own, and the audience has the chance to comprehend him; his fears and his agony; and come to an understanding with the decisions he made out of his own fear of someday meeting a warrior who'd surpass him. And from Goku's perspective; to give into one's anger and become the thing you hate or remain oblivious to cruelty... the definition of a hero's quest to stand against the evil that destroyed his race, his planet, and the very struggle to sustain the love he's gained and contain the silent thunder that boils within.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "314 out of 334 found this helpful.", "date": "29 September 2011"}, {"title": " The 2nd installment of Akira Toriyama's iconic anime about the life and adventure of Goku, earth's greatest defender.", "content": "I'm no expert on anime aka Japanese animation but I like the genre. Dragonball Z is by far my favorite anime. Toriyama's dragonball saga are the king of anime. It's no doubt the most iconic anime ever or at least in America. I think Akira is a very talented writer and is master at developing stories and creating characters but I do think that he sometime disregard characters and plot points to suit his story. Also a lot of people say how the fight sequences are way too long, which is true but they're also well crafted. This is different from it's predecessor dragonball but makes for a good sequel. I like how in the dragonball series we get to see Goku, his friends and family grow up unlike most cartoon characters like Charlie Brown and the Simpsons who never age. In dragonball we see Goku as a kid, in Dragonball Z(dbz) we see Goku as an adult and dad and in Dragonball GT we see Goku as an old man and granddad. I like how dbz is split up in sagas then seasons and I think that's the best way to review it. The series begins with the \"Saiyan Saga\" that takes place 7 years after dragonball. The star of the series is Goku a kind-hearted martial art expert who lives in the woods with his wife Chi-Chi and his son Gohan(named after his step dad \"grand pa\" Gohan) and he meets his old friends from dragonball like Bulma, she is one of my favorite characters and possibly the 2nd most important character in the series. Krillin, Goku's best friend and comic relief. And Master Roshi, Goku's and Krillin's former martial art teacher and pervert. Then we meet earth's biggest threat up until this point, the Saiyans an race of ruthless, bloodthirsty alien warriors who act as mercenaries, invading planets and destroying it for other aliens. Thus, we meet one of my favorite villains from dbz, Raditz. Who comes to earth looking for his younger brother, Kakorot who is Goku! So we find out that Goku's an alien. Later we meet the super strong Nappa and Vegeta, the prince of all saiyans who will become the breakout star of the show. But the good thing is their home planet was destroyed 20 years ago so only 4 are left but earth is still in great danger from the 3. This is the best saga in the series, I love the plot twist that Goku's a saiyan, it fits perfectly. I like how someone as good natured as Goku could come from a race of brutal killers. The saiyans make for great villains. I love Raditz, he's ruthless and his sonic the hedgehog like hair style is awesome. It's a shame he pretty much disappears after this saga, I wish he would of came back or at least be mentioned in future sagas. I also love Vegeta who is a really menacing villain and who's more evil then the others. But I don't like how Akira disregards Piccolo's(a villain from dragonball) back-story. He was Piccolo Jr. the son of the evil Piccolo, who's spirit lives within him but all of that is forgotten as Akira turns him into one of the good guys. Next is the \"Namek saga\" where Bulma, Krillin, and Gohan go into outer space to planet Namek, there they meet Vegeta and worst yet his boss, Frieza an evil planet conquer who has the reputation of being the most powerful being in the universe. Frieza is my favorite villain in the series, he's like a cross between Satan &amp; Adolph Hitler. He's the most important villain in the story and I like his right hand man, Zarbon. In the \"Ginyu Force saga\" we meet Frieza's special forces who are a great group of comical but deadly warriors. In the \"Frieza saga\" Goku comes to Namek and faces off against Frieza and we get to see Frieza's true power and Goku turns into a \"super saiyan\" and defeats him. This one goes on forever, it's way too long but still great to watch. In the \"Trunks saga\" we see Frieza is brought back to life by his father, the evil King Cold. They come to earth but are killed by Trunks, Vegeta's son from the future. This one starts off good but I don't like how quickly they killed off Frieza but I like the introduction of Frieza's father but they don't explain much about him like why is he called king? and they said he was stronger then his son but they never showed it. I like Trunks but I don't like how Vegeta went from being pure evil to a good guy with a bad attitude, didn't make sense to me. In the \"android saga\" we meet half human half robots killers. I like Android 17 &amp; 18 who in another time line wrecked havoc. I like them because they're teenagers out to have fun not conquer but they're idea of fun is mayhem. In the \"cell saga\" we meet a special android who's made up of the cells of great fighters. I like him because he's cool, sophisticated and calm. But by this time we get too many \"super saiyans\" with Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Trunks all becoming \"super sayains\". In the final saga, \"Boo saga\" we meet an indestructible villain, Boo. The saga goes on for too long but I like the 3 Boos, baby boo, evil boo and kid boo. Unfortunately some of the characters from dragonball like Yamcha, Tien, Chazu, Parr, olong and Launch get overshadowed by the super saiyans and the villains. I love the comical moments. The fight scenes are the best ever any where! Goku is one of the greatest heroes ever!

I started watching it around the Ginyu saga when I was probably younger than seven or eight, and as a child I looked forward eagerly to each episode like no other show before and few since. \"Next time on Dragonball Z\u0085\", it was great. As a kid, it seemed quite different from the kind of action the USA was putting out, and the fights were unbelievable. However, some have lambasted it as over-lengthy, bad-dubbing and a terrible English score.<br/><br/>My, my shame, on all of you, criticizing your own childhood. But as it goes, I will enlighten those critics. For starters, over lengthy? It was simply a very, very, long tale of epic proportions told in small and detailed bits. If you've watched it and paid attention to the character's reactions to things, it will dawn you this is on the level of a Greek tragedy. Some of the filler was unnecessary but a lot of it was either funny or added to the fights. Overall if you hate filler, \"Dragonball Z Kai\" is now available for viewing. Bad dubbing? Sean Schemmel,, Christopher Sabat, Eric Vale, if you hated the dubbing it was probably due to some of the cheesy lines they incorporated. However, as you may or may not know the original Japanese cut is free of this. What exactly did you expect, seeing as it was being broad casted on prime time, and not late night animes like you would often see on \"Adult Swim\". Granted, it's somewhat better, but if that's what you want just purchase the season box sets, which contain several language and audio options, plus revised dialog. Bad score, please! The score by Faulconer is fresh, something new and it sharpens the action to an irresistible point. Once more, if you don't like it, the season box sets can let you enjoy the also exhilarating Japanese score in 5.1 surround sound, awesome! Aside from those ludicrous claims, I believe DBZ holds together as a timeless show with many themes. Themes of pride, loyalty, courage and endurance. The characters develop continuously from start to finish, the most noteworthy of them being Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo and (Future) Trunks. While kids will find it hard not to watch, there's a fair level of violence and even disturbing character moments. The villains were never boring and always so varied from one another. Frieza with his cold and calculating persona, Cell with his thirst for greater challenges and power, and Buu in all his insanity. The fights are of course were always amazing, brutal and here and there even funny. Akira Toriyama has created a masterpiece that will be passed on for generations.<br/><br/>The artwork is stunning despite the age. Owning all the seasons as I do, makes you realize that a very select few episodes had a somewhat less standard look to them, but these are scattered about and one could hardly notice. Anyways, far from a brainless smack down, DBZ takes you on a adventurous adrenaline fueled thrill ride and yet deliverers emotionally and comically as well. If you're a true fan make sure to get the seasons and pass this on to your siblings or children, as I have.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "26 out of 31 found this helpful.", "date": "23 November 2010"}, {"title": " Greatest cartoon/anime ever created", "content": "Dragonball z is probably the most entertaining of all anime.

But who cares? I love this show.  And I loved Dragon Ball (although I must say that the American dub of Dragon Ball is for more of the 11-under crowd if you ask me) Now, allow me to tell you my testimony of how I came to love the Dragon Ball series....<br/><br/>When I was in Kindergarten-first grade or so, I saw my first episode of Dragon Ball.  I was sick and home from school, and it was airing on Fox Kids I believe.  It came on after Bannana's in Pajamas. (God save my soul, I hated that show.) Well, I've been one who has followed and practiced Martial Arts my whole life, and since I was a huge fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (and since I was sick in bed) I decided to watch Dragon Ball.  I laughed, and smiled, and of course enjoyed it.  I can't tell you exactly what I remember, Master Roshi and his island come to mind at best.  Well, over the years I skipped through the episodes, never exactly becoming \"hooked\" and die hard.  That wouldn't be for another few good years.  In 5th grade, my friends were Role Playing Dragon Ball Z during recess (it had just started to air around that time.) Of course, I wanted to role play with them, but didn't know-or remember- any female characters.  They had me play as Bulma.  All that came to mind was blue hair (and one of my friends complained of me playing Bulma because they had to play Yamucha.  Go figure) Years still went by and it wasn't until around the 6th grade did I start watching.  Over the summer I'd be wtaching Frieza or Garlic Jr. reruns, and my younger cousin and his friend would make fun of the show. (I tell you now:  DBZ isn't just about people screaming at the top of their lugs with beyond steroid possible muscles and beams of light shooting from their bodies.)  And when the time came of the Android/Cell saga, I WAS OFFICIALLY HOOKED!!!!!!  DBZ is the first show I've come to obsess over, and even though I am a 15 y/o female, I don't care.  If fighting and mountains blowing up appeals to me, then too bad!!!!!!  DBZ ROCKS!!!<br/><br/>P.S:  Like I said in my above comment about screaming and muscles and lights, it is beyond that.  The show talks a lot about courage, friendship, and loyalty.  Though the American edited version may not be AS good as the Japanese version, I still find it great.  And it may take a while to understand the principles of DBZ if you start watching in the middle of a saga, but keep watching- it may take time (like me.) <br/><br/>Akira Toriyama has definitely created a classic.", "rating": null, "helpful": "100 out of 160 found this helpful.", "date": "6 November 2002"}, {"title": " An Amazing Story...", "content": "I'm a late blooming DBZ fan, but I've already seen almost the entire series! LOL!  I will tell you the story of how I became a die-hard fan, and why you'll be VERY sorry if you haven't already!<br/><br/>It was around the year 1999 that I first came across DBZ.  I think the Namek saga was airing on Cartoon Network.  My friend was big on the show (though he had very little knowledge of it's origins) and forced me to watch it myself.  I made fun of the show every-time he watched it.  I thought it was corny, cheesy and the voice-acting was stupid.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, somewhere along the way in the summer of 2001 he told me they were re-airing the Android saga on CN.  Well, I started the old usual comments, making fun of it.  But then.. I actually became interested in the story. After a few episodes, I was hooked.  You see, the story of Dragonball is more than you think.  It covers over 500 episodes in it's entire run over three different animated series.<br/><br/>I began watching with the Android/Cell sagas.  I watched them to the end and then watched the Frieza saga.  Then I watched the Saiyan and Namek Saga. Now here we are today at the Buu saga.  What better time to become a DBZ fan than now!  The last 54 episodes of the show will air this fall, and that's something NOT to be missed.<br/><br/>The show never has an ending to a story.  It's a continous \"to be continued\" storyline that grows and grows.  Characters have time to develop into interesting relationships among them, making moments where someone dies or is hurt even more emotional.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Goku (son Goku in Japan) who is an incredible man born with an amazing fighting talent.  His strength never ceases and he becomes stronger and stronger.  He is kind and pure of heart.. a friend to even his enemies at times.  He is the central point of DBZ, but not the only point.<br/><br/>Throughout the series, he learns of his Saiyan heritage, finding that he was born of an alien human-like race that has an ability to concentrate energy called Kai (or ki) to create energy blasts, fly, etc.  They are born with a natural instinct to fight, and conquer entire planets to sale to the highest bidder.<br/><br/>That is only the beginning of DBZ, there are 200 episodes or so of a previous series called Dragonball that explain Goku's childhood-into-adult hood. DBZ covers him from his early twenties or so all the way until he's over 50 years old.<br/><br/>The show has sparked 13 movies and two specials.. and much more.  Some of the movies are dubbed in english, while others are only available in Japanese subtitled versions.<br/><br/>ANYWAY, this show is specatacular, and takes forever to explain every aspect of the storyline.  The ORIGINAL Japanese version has much better music and voice acting, I'll admit.  And the English versions (at least early episodes) were edited to death, the show still holds what makes it magic.<br/><br/>The beginning of the series will re-air on Cartoon Network as of May 2002. I suggest you begin watching.  Do NOT let the animation, or the voice-acting, or bad editing of this first saga shake you away.  The show takes time to understand and become interested in, but once your there, you'll be hooked.<br/><br/>There are over 290 episodes of DBZ, and the animation gets much better, as does the storyline.

So very dramatic to get to the end of one episode and to ponder \"what is going to happen next? Is Tien gonna kill himself trying to kill Cell? Is Goku gonna make it to King Kai's planet? Can Evil King Piccolo be stopped?\" so many cliff hangers over the years.... so many episodes battles... which brings us to <br/><br/>The Action - GREATEST FIGHTING EVER! The fighting in DBZ isn't your every day martial arts. We see super warriors who have trained in over 100X gravity performing incredible feats of power, speed and energy, and yet they still seem like real people to us because the characters are so well thought up. <br/><br/>The Morals - Yes, DBZ teaches us life lessons. It teaches us to overcome our fears and to have confidence (Gohan). It teaches us to be strong but gentle (Goku/Mirai Trunks) and to be determined and never give up (Vegeta) and that brains are as important as brawn (Piccolo/Bulma) and that , yes, it's okay to be silly (Gotenks/Mr. Satan). We learn so much from the characters on DBZ. <br/><br/>The Relationships - So many wonderful relationships since the beginning of DB. Many friendships and even romantic attachments. Goku and Krillin, lifelong friends forever, both students of Kame Sennin. Bulma and Vegeta, an unlikely romance between a space warrior and a mere human.... yes, Piccolo and Gohan, perhaps the most touching and unlikely friendship of all..the story of how a boy taught a demon to love.

However I forced myself to watch a few episodes of the series when my friends all told me how great it was. So when the reruns of series one where being shown again on cartoon network in one hour specials I sat-down to see what the fuss was all about at school. It of course did take me to watch a few episodes to get really into the plot and so on but by the time I'd seen several or more episodes of this amazing action show at the most, well that was it I was truly hooked and from that very moment I was a true Dragon Ball Z fan and I only wished that I had listened to my friends advise write from the start. Utter brilliance that was the only word to describe this cartoon. Not surprising really considering it came out of Japan who are master cartoonists.<br/><br/>Dragon Ball Z told the story of a young earth man called Goku who in the first ever episode learns from a strange visitor from outer space who turns out to be his evil older brother Raditiz that he was born on another planet home to the strongest race of people in the universe, the mighty saiyans. Who long ago sent him to earth to destroy all the living creatures so they could take it over and sell it on the Galactic Market headed by the ruthless Emepour Frezia, but due to a head injury Goku suffered when he was a small child had forgotten his mission so his brother was sent to see why he had failed. After defeating his evil brother in battle Goku and his friends here of two other far more powerful Saiyans warriors ( Nappa and Vegeta ) who are now on their way to earth. One of which turns out to be one of the central characters in the whole show, the saiyan prince Vegeta. Now when we first see Vegeta he appears to be nothing more than an evil killer, but in later episodes he joins forces with Goku and his team of heroes in order to over come many far more evil and powerful bad guys like the evil Freiza, Cell and Majin Buu etc. Goku and his son Gohan are the true heroes of Dragon Ball Z but my favourite was always Vegeta for some reason as he always took the fighting and being a saiyan very close to his heart plus he also delivered most of this shows most memorable quotes and lines. When he and Goku fight along side each other they are truly an unstoppable force of good. Also my favourite villain would have to have been Frieza as he was one villain who we all loved to hate. <br/><br/>Even though all the battles do last a long time that to me made the show more real and like other fans on this page have said it was made indeed like a soap opera which kept-ed on going for over several years.

I prefer the English version over the original Japanese version, just because I saw the dub before the Japanese version. But, I will watch the original version and keep an open mind. I respect everyones opinion and understand where they are coming from. Although, I can NOT tolerate people who talk shit about a show they probably don't understand.

The whole world doesn't need to know what you don't like. <br/><br/>Just to set the record straight: The first 64 episodes of DBZ were done by a company in Vancouver, Canada. Not the Fort Worth company FUNimation.<br/><br/>It was SABAN who changed the show more than FUNimation. Thats why they sounded like Power Rangers (Somebody said they sounded like them) And, whoever said this show doesn't teach you anything? This show used a very vivid vocabulary. They said lines like \"But to no avale\" Children could learn more watching DBZ than in a vocab lesson at school.<br/><br/>About the music: You have to remember that the music was conducted during two different time periods. The original music was made in the late 80's to early 90's. The dub's music was made in the very late 90's to the early 2000's. Music changed a lot from the Japanese version to the dub.

So there are people who might not find this interesting. But if you \"lived\" the Dragon Ball legend, you can't object how amazing Z is. In fact, despite some big flaw, it's hands-down the best series of the Dragon Ball universe, with some scenes that are ought to go down in the history of television.<br/><br/>The whole series starts where the first Dragon Ball ends - Goku and Chichi marry, and now they have a new son, Gohan. But a mysterious Saiyan, who later turns out to be Goku's long forgotten brother (Radish), notices that Goku did not do what he was asked for - kill the earthlings. Therefore, he gets Gohan as a hostage to make him change his mind. This starts it all, with some unexpected alliances, and some extremely lenghty enemies. Many situations are actually extremely famous by now - Vegeta-saga, Frieza-saga, Cell-saga, Buu-saga, they're all well known. This is because, despite the similarity of the stories, they're all exceptionally written.<br/><br/>If you like these kind of super-fights, you can not miss Dragon Ball Z. But it has many aspects from the 1st series as well, like the characters being very charismatic, and the humor, which is now a lot less, but it's still good. The drawing style is good, you always understand what is going on the screen. And while in the bottom of your heart you always know that in the end the good guys will win, but there's still plenty of suspense.<br/><br/>There is some bad side of the series though.

The Dragon Ball Z series contain some of the most charismatic characters, great fighting sequences, and strong plots that covered thousands of years. Originally created in the 1980's, it's truly a blessing that western audiences finally gets to see it in english.  However I wish the series would start from the very beginning, the story when Son Gokou was a courageous little boy who uses his innate fighting talents to help out others.<br/><br/>It's only a shame though that the western TV version are heavily censored, causing disorientation and lack of flow to some of the original fight scenes.  The Japanese version showed no-holds barred violence and the use of strong words (aka swearing), creating emotional tension that is not present in the english-language version.  Also, die-hard Dragon Ball fans out there will agree with me that the voice acting is nowhere as good as the Japanese version.<br/><br/>Still, revisiting Dragon Ball in any language still stirs some of the fondest memories in my heart.

This is because the series as a whole, including Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT, all the movies, games, and toy lines, reach out to many nations and are somewhere in the memory of many fans of different age groups.<br/><br/>This is a classic anime that is easily adaptable to American television. Its power lies in its originality and the fact that it is fun to watch. The anime has a strong sense of suspense and a large inclination towards great battles between alien forces. It has a lot of humor and builds on the concept of morality that surrounds its main character, Goku, although the Japanese version is more vulgar than the American, or other international versions.<br/><br/>Altogether I give this entire series a solid 9/10. The reason I hold back 1 point is because its episodes are sometimes empty of any action and the animation in general is slow.

I own some of the Season DVDs you can buy online or sometimes find in places like Walmart. Dragon Ball Z is timeless, I mean it's interesting to think how the episodes you watched aired in the USA in the late '90s early 2000s, and they even aired earlier in Japan in the '80s and '90s. Watching this show years later, it does not look old or lose it's appeal, some of the graphics from the older episodes, mostly DragonBall look a little old. DragonBall Z is the version they started out with in the USA before DragonBall thinking DragonBall Z would get more viewers. It used to be on Cartoon Network on Toonami. They later would have DragonBall be part of Toonami to show the origin of the story. Then, they'd later do DragonBall GT, but DragonBall GT is non- cannon and written by somebody else. Most of us don't like GT as much. By all means, DragonBall Z has been a huge success. I've read interviews from the guy who wrote the series on the Manga, Akira Toriyama. He did not anticipate the series going on for so long. From what I read, Toriyama did not think much about writing after the first Saga Emperor Pilaf when he started the series. He would later think of ending the series after the Frieza and Cell Sagas. But, the success of the series had him continue writing it and coming up with new awesome story lines. Obviously, the series was awesome enough for him to continue writing it. Though some of the things he wrote did not seem well thought out of and he was probably trying to hurry up the series. For example, most of us do not like the series finale of DragonBall Z. There were also some things Toriyama obviously either forgot or stopped caring about from older episodes to later episodes. I personally am amazed at the success of DragonBall Z. People still talk about that show regularly even when it no longer is airing. I've worked at Amazon and some of the most popular franchise I saw on the shelves would be from DragonBall Z, mostly DVDs. You can also see so many clips from the show on YouTube and so many searches on Google for DragonBall Z showing it's a living legend. On YouTube if you want to hear about people who are fans of the series and have thought well of questions we have of the series and how to answer them you can go to Blackenfist and Qaamans Land. You can also Google Search any episode throughout the entire series, you could do a search on any attack, any character even like a background character from one episode. You can basically search like any noun that is from the DragonBall Z World and your top results will most likely be DragonBall Wiki where you can get a full in depth view on your search for what is known about it. So, I've talked about the success of DragonBall Z, I'll now talk about what makes it a good TV show. Well, it has a really good story line you're likely to get into if it interests you, and like a Soap Opera although this show isn't a Soap Opera, the story line is continuous where each episode continues where the last one left off, and the episodes frequently end at an exciting part where we will want to see what happens next. The show by all means is an empowering show, when I watch it I'll feel motivated to push myself harder as you see characters throughout the series training and always getting stronger. Sometimes it even shows real workouts we could be doing. So, the fact that we see characters that like to work out and continue to push themselves hard is motivational. The show has awesome fighting, which is one of the main reasons for the popularity of the show, the action. But, I don't see how you could not see the action in certain episodes and not think of it as epic. The characters in that show can also be role models, mostly Goku as he is the main character throughout the series. Goku is always cheerful and friendly. Goku has a mind set where he does not give up and can always think of a way to win the toughest fights. Well, thanks for reading.

In a way, it is a lot more watchable than even so-called \"better\" comedies because it has a very inviting, comfortable feel and always seemed to stay within it's zone. It never really got overly serious as other comedies and always maintained a light, fun approach to storytelling. And, 99.9% of the time, the jokes were spot on, so spot on that they are still funny upon repeat viewing. <br/><br/>A major strength of WINGS is the dialogue, which seems so spontaneous and ad-libbed at times that I wonder how much of it comes from the writers and how much from the actors (I'd bet a fair amount came from them!). Much of the dialogue is actually conversational and not just to set up jokes and punchlines, like in most situation comedies. So I find myself laughing DURING the conversations, not just at the end of them!<br/><br/>In general terms, like many of the great comedies, WINGS was just as funny in it's later seasons as it was in the early ones (I dare say the later seasons were funnier!). The earlier seasons are a lot more structured and plot-oriented, whereas the later seasons, because we already know the characters so well, the plot plays 2nd fiddle to the characters we have come to know and love and they just run with it!<br/><br/>WINGS starred the great, underrated television stalwart Timothy Daly (who should have at least one Emmy for something by now!) as Joe Hackett, owner of Sandpiper Air in the tiny island of Nantucket outside of Boston. Joe got to live his dream of owning his own airline and the opening scene introduces us to this central character. \"Joe\" is the appropriate name for this character as he was truly an \"Everyday Joe\", \"Everyman\", \"Regular Joe\" type of character! A stickler for order and neatness, Joe was borderline anal retentive! And Daly ALWAYS was in character. I think playing the straight man amongst a sea of wacko characters is one of the hardest things to do and Daly's Joe was the calm, solid center for the show's entire run. Not to mention that Daly was just as funny as his co-stars and he didn't need to act like a wacko to be funny!<br/><br/>But Daly wasn't the only star. Steven Weber hilariously essayed the role of Brian Hackett (Joe's younger, cooler, zanier brother who initially worked for him and in later seasons became his equal partner in the airline). Brian was perhaps my favorite character as he was always so sarcastic, nutty, and witty, even in serious situations that you just HAD to laugh at him. I just couldn't help myself from laughing at Brian's antics (even when I tried!). Weber's comic timing was just plain superb. If I had to choose ONE actor from WINGS to that should have won an Emmy for their role, it would have been Weber. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Daly and Weber as siblings Joe and Brian is some of the best I've ever seen on a TV show. There are a lot of times where I'd swear I was watching real brothers interact...They are that good! <br/><br/>The third star (who could also be considered a supporting character) was the infectiously funny and wild Crystal Bernard as Helen Chappell, the Hackett brothers childhood friend who would eventually become Joe's wife in later seasons. She ran the lunch counter at the airport, the central location for every episode of the show. I personally liked Helen a lot more in later seasons (when she and Joe got married) than earlier. I think her marriage to Joe (who she had a crush on forever!) really lightened her up in a good way and allowed Bernard to show her full comic range. She and Joe's banter pre-marriage seemed a bit too Sam-and-Dianeish (a la CHEERS) for me; usually, when a show finally puts a couple together, it is the deathknell, but WINGS flourished after they finally got Joe and Helen together.<br/><br/>The supporting cast was magnificent and one of the best ensembles ever: the daffy airline mechanic Lowell (played by Thomas Haden Church, who left early in Season 7 to star in his own show NED AND STACEY), the brothers' airline assistant, the esteemed world-weary, sarcastic Fay (played the entire run by Rebecca Schull), the brothers rival at the airline, the boisterous, unapologetic robust Roy (played entire run by David Schramm), the lovable, Italian loser cabbie Antonio (probably my 2nd favorite character, played by Tony Shalhoub, who everyone now knows as MONK!), Helen's looney, spurned-by-her-husband-jack-of-all-trades older sister Casey Chappell (played wonderfully by the delightfully radiant Amy Yasbeck in Seasons 6, 7, and 8, the last three seasons of the show).<br/><br/>Also, there was helicopter pilot Alex (played by Farrah Forke in Season 5). While a solid character, I didn't really think Alex added anything special to the show from a comedic standpoint other than be kind of a \"cheerleader\" type character and thought she brought Brian's character down and kept him from being his usual fun self. Thankfully, they rectified that and Alex only lasted the one season, allowing Brian to become a full-blown, comical character. At the end of the day, when it comes to comedy, I favor laughter over realism! Also, I thought that Brian and Casey had a lot more chemistry as a wacky kind-of-but-not-really-a-couple couple than Brian and Alex had as an actual couple! <br/><br/>A funny, lighthearted satire, WINGS is one of the best ensemble comedies that has ever graced television!", "rating": 9, "helpful": "15 out of 16 found this helpful.", "date": "13 September 2010"}, {"title": " Wings Will Send You Soaring High With Sentiment and Laughter!!!", "content": "I have discovered Wings to be one of the most underrated and under-appreciated of comedy series that I have ever watched. The writing is crisp, witty and often warm. The main setting is a small Nantuckett airport, wherein a madcap cast of characters attempt to cope with a hilarity of usually self-created misadventures. The chemistry between the major characters, Helen Chapel (played by Crystal Bernard,who gives a flawless delivery of her punch lines) and Joe Hackett, is superb, and gets even better as the show has more seasons. Brian Hackett, as Joe's immature, misbehaving younger brother, adds by often creating the plot dilemma and simultaneously provoking his serious, overly fastidious older brother. Add to this an exquisite supporting cast, consisting of: an aging female flight announcer who's been through the deceased husbands; a wisecracking self-centered rival airline owner; a luck-deprived Italian taxicab driver; and a lunk-headed airplane mechanic, (played by a wonderfully deadpan Thomas Haden Church). In later shows, Amy Yasbeck appears as Helen's neurotically shallow older sister, and teams unwittingly with Brian to create more madcap, particularly in an episode where she and Brian give a surprise gone awry. <br/><br/>The comedy is only enhanced by several repeat guests, including a whiny senior citizen named Carlton; an old flame of Joe named Sandy, who forces him to reenact a \"missed\" high school prom; and even few characters who reprise their same roles from the Comedy \"Cheers\".

Yet, the fans continued to follow it. The other thing that made this show was sexpot Crystal Bernard, a survivor from the last season of Happy Days. The show had an incredible ensemble of talent including Bernard, Weber, Tim Daly, David Scramm, Rebecca Schull and Thomas Haden Church who played the slightly annoying mechanic Lowell Mather. Replaced by the dynamic Tony Shalhoub as the haplessly unlucky Antonio Scarpacci, the series even became a cousin to the equally successful Cheers with crossovers with its best talents. Underrated for its time on TV, this incredibly funny and relentless series lasted an enjoyable seven years until Amy Yasbeck joined the cast as Helen's jinxed sister, Casey, possibly named after Bernard's Happy Days character, K.C.

Helen (Crystal Bernard) was the former childhood chub, now fit and trim, yet, she was still very non-motivated about her life!! Roy (David Schramm) was the biggest jerk in the world, having a halfway decent mind made this situation all that much more nauseating to stomach!!

My segment of the Boomers, were always over-shadowed in the media, by both our older Boomer brethren, and Gen-Xers. So, it was great to finally find a sitcom like \"Wings\", with tail-end Boomers as the main focus of the show. I could identify with these guys, since we hailed from the same generational zeitgeist, so-to-speak.<br/><br/>The series revolved around two very different brothers, named Joe and Brian Hackett. Joe was the elder, responsible, and straight-arrow one. Brian was his younger, much more free-spirited sibling (Brian could be a real screw-up, but somehow always came out okay in the end). Because of their radically different approach to life, their conflicts were the main source of laughs for the show. <br/><br/>The Hackett brothers ran a tiny, one-plane commuter airline, on the island of Nantucket. They were surrounded by a menagerie of other colorful characters on the show. Their lifelong friend, Helen, ran the lunch-counter at their little airline. Roy Bigguns was their ever-egocentric competitor. Roy always loved to crow that his airline, Aeromass, was bigger and better than the Hacketts' puny operation. Lowell was their ding-bat mechanic. And Faye was their receptionist/flight announcer, who was always hilariously cheerful.<br/><br/>In later seasons of the show, Lowell left. Then Antonio, the sad-sack airport cabdriver, joined the cast. The Antonio character was only mildly funny to me. I thought Lowell was much funnier. On occasion, actress Farrah Fork appeared on the show, as Brian's no-nonsense, military pilot girlfriend, Alex. She could never tame Brian's free-spirited ways, no matter how hard she tried (and it was always fun to watch her keep trying). Helen's klutzy sister, Casey, became a regular cast member late in the series. These extra characters added their own comedic dash to the overall ensemble of the show.<br/><br/>\"Wings\" was never one of NBC's main comedy attractions, like \"Seinfeld\", or \"Cheers\" were. But for 10 seasons, it managed to generate a loyal viewer-ship. In my opinion, I think this was due to the fact that many viewers (myself included), liked to watch the Hackett brothers live-out their dreams. After all, they owned their own business, doing what they loved (flying). They had comfortable, solidly middle-class life-styles, even owning their own gorgeous house. They lived on a scenic island, far from any crime-ridden, major urban areas. All-in-all, the Hackett brothers were tail-end Boomers, who also managed to win the proverbial game-of-life.

Others featured were Thomas Haden Church's dummy mechanic Lowell, and sweet-tempered Fay, the brothers ticket agent.  After the first season Tony Shalhoub was added as cabby Antonio, and in season 4 the lovely Farrah Forke was brought on for a couple of years as Brians love interest.  Most of the time Joe found himself on again off again with Helen, with the rest of the cast dating a myriad of visiting characters.  Must see episodes include \"Joe Blows,\" when Daly deals with an unbearable amount of the casts problems, the one where Helen tries to get ready for a date as each of the cast keeps dropping by, and definitely the one where Brian and Joe lose the body of a bitchy rich lady's father.  The final episode has some of the gang coming into money, but like its sister show \"Cheers\" does not give its characters big send-offs.  But that last show is still decently written and provides fans with a decent payoff.  So if you have the chance, hop on board \"Wings,\" one of the more underrated sitcoms ever.

You do need to be slightly thick-skinned to appreciate it though...<br/><br/>Mark and Jeremy are 2 loser flat-mates. One's got a turgid office job and is in love with a colleague, and the other, Jeremy, is the leech without a job and failing miserably to do anything worthwhile with his life.<br/><br/>On the face of it sounds not unlike Men Behaving Badly, and there are the 2 women both guys respectively pine for; one being the aforementioned colleague of Mark, and the other being the next door neighbour who Jeremy is desperate to 'have'. <br/><br/>However, Peep Show does 2 things which make it quite unique and laugh-out-loud funny. Firstly it adopts a first person perspective so we see the action not as a 3rd party, but from the very points of view of the characters. Not only this, but we hear their thoughts as well, which means we know what they're really thinking as opposed to only hearing what they actually say. This is a terrific twist and provides genuine hilarity throughout.<br/><br/>The second aspect it adopts is adult humour, and by this I don't mean Viz. It uses sexual situations, drugs, booze, and political incorrectness as incredibly risqu\u00e9 and dark humour, and goes beyond anything I've ever seen before, certainly in sitcom land. It's plainly obvious why it gets an 18 certificate (UK).<br/><br/>Furthermore, the acting itself is absolutely great, and is incredibly conducive to to the script. Because of the strength of the script and the supreme acting, there are many genuinely toe-curling embarrassing moments (But never fail to make you laugh, as opposed to just making you cringe), along with some awkward silences where, for a moment, you actually sympathise with the characters because you 'are' them.

However the fact that it remains quite a \"cult\" sort of programme means that those of us that watch it are allowed to be a little bit smug about the fact that we do. The concept behind the programme is the live of flatmates Jeremy and Mark \u0096 the former being a bit of a student type and the latter being a bit middle-class and repressed. Rather than just follow the story in a normal way, we see the action through their eyes and, more importantly, get to hear their thoughts in between the dialogue.<br/><br/>This approach doesn't sound that clever or unique but I can assure you that it works much better than it sounds. The simple story lines are based around the recognisability of the characters and many of their thoughts are actually not that exaggerated. They are to a point of course, but not to an extreme and it is the familiarity of the characters that makes it work for me. The script is regularly spot on, with a real ear for dialogue, mixing the convincing with the absurd well and producing plenty of funny lines \u0096 again surprising me that the suitability for trailers and adverts of the material hasn't brought it more success\u0085.particularly in the Friday night slot that has previously shown to be such a winner for dross such as Friends as well as genuinely good comedies.<br/><br/>With good writing comes the need for good delivery and thankfully the lead two are on the ball. Webb wears Jeremy like a second skin and is totally convincing in his rather selfish character. Although he is less \"cool\" of a character, Mitchell is equally as good as Mark and again is easily able to carry off a rather podgy and repressed man who would rather suffer in silence than make a public scene (annoyingly a trait that I can recognise in myself). The support is good but with the script focusing on the actions and thoughts of Mark and Jez it is no surprise that Mitchell and Webb do deservedly dominate the programme.<br/><br/>Overall a fresh and funny comedy. The \"point of view\" thing does feel like a gimmick for a while when you first watch it, but the humour of the thoughts/voiceovers means that it is worth while and I quickly bought into it.

The show follows two men who share a flat together, Mark Corrigan (Mitchell) and Jeremy Osbourne (Webb).<br/><br/>The shows comedy is very dark and cringeworthy and contains themes regarding sex and drugs so it's definitely not for kids but its a very guilty pleasure for everybody else. What sets this apart from similar awkward situation comedies is that the show is constantly shot from the characters' point of view, whether it be the two main characters or supporting characters and we can hear Mark and Jez' thoughts. This is a truly brilliant innovation and lifts this high above most other sitcoms, especially as the two leads are highly insecure and conniving, a lot of the time they say things only for you to hear their conflicting true thoughts and its absolutely hilarious, they often talk themselves into bizarre and embarrassing situations.<br/><br/>Mark and Jez seem very different but they fit together well. Mark is a semi-successful, middle-class loan manager who owns the flat he lives in with Jeremy, while he seems sensible and cautious on the outside he is actually quite impulsive and occasionally talks himself into erratic behaviour he later regrets. He is highly neurotic and worries about anything, even socialising with other humans which doesn't come easily to him, he researches subjects he has no interest in just to fit in with the crowd and endures activities others enjoy. Strangely though you can identify with him and feel sorry for him, he is essentially a good person but often makes stupid mistakes in an effort to make himself look 'normal'.<br/><br/>Jez on the other hand is far more out-going and sexually promiscuous, unemployed throughout most of the series he claims to be 'in the music industry' although his band is going nowhere and he appears to be deluded into thinking fame and fortune is waiting to come to him without him making any effort. He is Mark's only real friend but is often spiteful and malicious and seems to be constantly holding Mark back, the reason for this however seems to be Jez' fear of losing Mark rather than him actually disliking him, when things are at their lowest he always sticks by Mark and the selfishness disappears showing he isn't a completely nasty character. Jez is also a recreational drug user and is often seen hungover or on a 'downer', there are indications to Jez having bisexual tendencies as well although he often represses those feelings.<br/><br/>The first series starts with Mark and Jez both single with Jez having just ended a longterm relationship with his girlfriend Big Suze to move in with his old pal Mark. While Mark pursues work colleague Sophie Chapman (Olivia Colman) somewhat obsessively, Jez begins seeing an attractive American with a hippy attitude, Nancy (Rachel Blanchard).<br/><br/>The supporting cast in Peep Show are as strong as the leads, in particular Jez' friend and bandmate Super Hans (Matt King), a walking chemistry set who never met a pill he didn't pop or a pipe he didn't toke, every sentence that leaves Super Hans' mouth is an instant classic quote, a lesser show would miss such a great character but this doesn't due to its high quality and leaves him on the sidelines to great effect. Paterson Joseph plays Mark's boss Alan Johnson, supremely confident he comes across as the black James Bond, cool, calm and collected at all times. Finally Neil Fitzmaurice plays Jeff Heaney, Mark's nemesis and love rival to Sophie, he is a bully who torments Mark with sarcastic comments to put him down in front of others. Other minor characters come and go but these three really add a lot to the show.<br/><br/>Over the course of the six series, nothing really gets any better for Mark and Jez and they are destined to spend the rest of their life together wallowing in mediocrity, stumbling from one excruciating situation to the next. Quite how this truly great masterpiece of a sitcom hasn't caught on is beyond me, perhaps due to its much darker theme than shows like The Office and the fact its been shifted to a late slot on Channel 4 it's been overlooked and while that's criminal it just means those of us who do know about it can enjoy it all the more, because it's our little secret.

But peepshow is so good and MORE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT IT to the point that i felt compelled to create an account and give it 10/10 and write a review. I was reading some of the reviews and someone summed it up perfectly, and I paraphrase- a cult classic that has the bonus of leaving those of us who do watch it a little smug. This could not be more accurate, peepshow is one of those programs you keep under your hat, but when it becomes apparent that someone else u know has seen it too you will be trading quotes and laughing about for ages, excluding everyone else from the conversation like a huge inside joke. Far far from a boring sitcom with episodic mundane episodes, peepshow takes the mundane and makes it absurd, awkward and hilarious all whist remaining somewhat believable. This is helped by the fact that Jezz and mark are incredibly easy to relate to, with most people i know who like the show believing that they are themselves, a sort of amalgamation of the two. The real surprise with peepshow however is the dialog especially the internal dialog. Whilst the awkward humour comparable in a way to the office, is what brings people to the show initially, the fantastically witty script is what elevates peep show to new heights. Its down to earth humour usually relating to social anxiety is just so funny, with almost every line being quotable, jezz-\"just tell her you love her\" mark-\"I dunno being the first to say i love you, is a bit like shooting first in a duel... if you miss your f**cked\". In short peepshow is bloody fantastic, if you watch two episodes and its not your thing fair enough... however if you skip past it without trying you are only doing yourself a huge disservice.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "6 out of 6 found this helpful.", "date": "8 March 2018"}, {"title": " Hilarious and brilliant series.", "content": "I never watched Peep show when it originally went out, for the life of me I don't know why.

That good!<br/><br/>Question: Apart from a few well-known names, is the cast worthy of justifying their role(s)?\nAnswer: You would be stunned by the acting. The actors are as good as the script. There are more number of pivotal characters than there were in \"Sacred Games\". You would be pleasantly surprised that all of them have been given enough screen-time and none of them are unimportant. What an ensemble! Wow!<br/><br/>Question: Is it better than Sacred Games?\nAnswer: First of all, we MUST NOT compare the two series.\n\"Crime\", \"Thriller\", \"Action\" are the common genre between these two series. However, Mirzapur has done tremendous justice to it's script and carved out a niche space for itself.\nI had watched Sacred Games just a week before Mirzapur and after reading the panning reviews of Mirzapur, I decided not to watch it. One of my close friends - Sasi, told me to forget about the review(s) and give the first episode a try. I would like to quote him here: \"It is far better than the number of stars the critics have awarded.\" HE WAS DAMN RIGHT.\nSacred Games has used the terms of ancient Indian history (or mythology, whichever word you would like to use) to narrate the story. Mirzapur doesn't have that level of narration - Yes! ... But you would be gravely mistaken to take this point against Mirzapur. Each and every episode is gripping with sometimes gory and sometimes an undertone of humor which would never let you feel enervated.\nAll the actors have done a phenomenal job. The women have been given lots of freedom. The documentary(ies) which BauJi keeps watching frequently, has 100% relevance in the context of the episode and the series.\nEveryone knows about Pankaj Tripathi's prowess. He doesn't need further introduction (nor do the others), but I would like to mention Guddu (Ali Fazal) as a revolutionary character. The way he has portrayed his passion for body-building, his dumb-wit, his self-assured and self-serving bias; it will blow the viewer away. After watching a few episodes, I had started to wonder if someone can be really so eccentric and so blind due to self-obsession. He just cares about how to live through the current moment in time, nothing else. In my humble opinion, I think that every character is a shade of different level of narcissism. Just visualize, how could a writer conceive the idea of so many narcissistic characters. ;-)\nIf I ever meet Guddu Bhaiyya (Ali), Munna Bhaiyya (Divyendu Sharma) and Bablu Bhaiyya (Vikrant Massey), it would be extremely difficult to imagine them as a different person than their portrayal.<br/><br/>I would like to quote my friend again: This series is far better than the ratings you would come across on various critics' web pages.<br/><br/>The only reason I wrote this first-ever review on IMDb is because I could not digest the admonishing and panning of a beautiful work done by these fine actors and writers (and everyone involved in the project).", "rating": 10, "helpful": "142 out of 191 found this helpful.", "date": "29 November 2018"}, {"title": " This is the kind of story, we always wanted to see, and was always missing.", "content": "Disclaimer: I am from Uttar Pradesh, who lives in Bangalore.

At times you question the casting agents decision rather than paying attention to what's actually going on. For example Ryn's sister being played by a black actor.

It was originally run on CBS (1964 - 1967). It must be one of the most heavily viewed programs in the history of syndication. GI was an essential part of the after school ritual for millions in the early seventies. Seeing it so much as a kid left an indelible print on my brain to the extent that, even though I haven't watched the show regularly for the past 25 years, I can still recite some of the character dialog when prompted. A remarkable testament to the effect (for good or ill) of TV on young minds.<br/><br/>The show revolves around the fate of the crew and passengers of the lost Honolulu tour boat--the S.S. Minnow---blown off course by a freak storm onto \"an uncharted desert isle\".<br/><br/>Most of the episodes center on the \"seven castaways\" efforts to get off of the island and back to civilization. The attempts are always sabotaged by the bumbling first mate of the Minnow --Gilligan (Bob Denver). I like the skinny and young Denver as Gilligan -however the characterization works only on a rather limited basis marked by age and appearance. Put 15 years and 15 pounds on Denver (as was done in the reunion movies) and Gilligan's antics become almost intolerable. The Skipper (Alan Hale Jr) is seen by some to be a gruff authoritarian figure--however I see him as being much more benign (Alan Hale's natural affability comes shining through). I believe that Gilligan and the Skipper come across most of the time like \"Mutt and Jeff\" rather than as \"Laurel and Hardy\".<br/><br/>Jim Backus and Natalie Schaefer playing Thurston and Lovey Howell (The millionaire and his wife) are the most accomplished members of the cast. The Howells are played for all they're worth by Backus and Schaefer. Both actors were masters of the ad-lib. I especially like one laugh line Thurston Howell III gets as the castaways listen to a radio broadcasting the launch of a test missile that the professor calculates will hit and destroy the island. The radio announcer does the countdown... then crows, \"And it's a perfect launch!\"-- \"It would be...,\" says Howell with bitter, comic resignation.<br/><br/>Ginger--the movie star--seductress, red head (Tina Louise) &amp; Mary Ann (Dawn Wells) the virginal, wholesome Kansas farm girl, brunette--certainly set up the eternal question of preference among the male viewers of the show. For my part... either girl would do in a pinch. Tina Louise does a creditable imitation of Marilyn Monroe -I would bet heavy money that the character of Ginger holds the TV record for the sheer number of come-ons made by a woman (always for ulterior motives and never for sex). It's to Louise's credit that she made all that flirting seem real and in context and always in bounds. Sweet, little Mary Ann is a much more incidental character and the only character in the show that is played \"straight\" most all of the time.<br/><br/>Russell Johnson is first rate as the Professor---the island's resident intellectual / technician. He has a good laugh line in one of the episodes when the other other castaways wax nostalgic about what they miss the most about their previous lives back in civilization--the Professor suddenly pipes up: \"What I miss most is Saturday night at the library....the hustle and bustle at the reference desk....\" .<br/><br/>It has been pointed out by more than one deep thinker that the \"Castaways\" are meant to represent \"archetypes\" of humanity. I am certain that the character types and the casting contributed much to the success of this show. The casting is so critical because the setting for the series (an otherwise uninhabited tropical island) is not the most promising for a situation comedy (which is the reason no doubt for the many strange visitors that find their way to the island--everyone from a World War One fighter pilot to a rock band to a mad scientist to an exiled South American dictator-to a dozen others).....<br/><br/>I mentioned at the beginning of my comments that Gilligan's Island is often abused by critics. It received bad reviews from the the very first show and there are plenty of people who have continued to hammer away at it through 5 decades down to the present day-(Did anyone else see Larry King make Bob Denver squirm when he was a guest on Larry King Live a few years ago?). Gilligan's Island is generally attacked for being comedy of a very low variety--dumb and unsophisticated and marked by a noted lack of realism (How is it that the Howells brought so many clothes along for a three hour cruise?---Why can't the Professor figure out a way to get them off the island if he can make a generator out of a coconut? And why doesn't anyone sleep with anyone else? etc...) I will concede that the overall tone of many of the episodes is slightly juvenile. (The most avid perennial viewers of this show would have had to have been 9 - 11 year old boys). However, that said, it's never been proved to me that Gilligan's Island was any more unlikely in either premise or execution than any number of its contemporaries. Contrived characters and situations have always been a hallmark of American network TV from the beginning --all the way, arguably to the present ---but that's another subject. I can find at least some jokes and situations on GI that contain more social and political comment and present sex in a way more realistic than can be found on Dick Van Dyke (as an example).<br/><br/>Sherwood Schwartz and the show's cast and writers must be given much credit for creating a unique version of an escapist fantasy---that has...like it or not...found a place in American pop culture.", "rating": null, "helpful": "22 out of 25 found this helpful.", "date": "8 March 2005"}, {"title": " After watching even one episode, who wouldn't want to get stranded on an uncharted island, just to see if you could experience what these seven experienced?", "content": "I never get tired of watching \"Gilligan's Island.\" As one of the many 1960's TV shows with wacky premises (breaking away from the \"Leave It to Beaver\" mold of the previous decade), it lives on to this day. At the beginning of every episode, when the theme song begins, I always act out the lines, and then wait for something crazy to happen.<br/><br/>Let's look at the characters. First mate Willy Gilligan (yes, he did have a first name) is the bane of everyone who believes in order and normalcy. Clumsy, pencil-thin and naive, he bungles every chance they have to get off of the island, and yet the other castaways didn't kill him. I guess they understood that he was a good guy under that idiocy.<br/><br/>Skipper Jonas Grumby is everything that Gilligan isn't: fatter than fat, competent and perfectly capable of taking charge. As his weight often is the butt of Gilligan's jokes, not to mention all the times when Gilligan drops things on his feet, the Skipper usually proceeds to hit Gilligan with his hat.<br/><br/>Thurston Howell III is the archetypal crass capitalist. He never does any work, and sits around all day talking about money. I always get the feeling that his grand ambition is to defraud all the other castaways. In spite of all this, Mr. Howell does have one weakness: his Teddy Bear.<br/><br/>Eunice \"Lovey\" Howell is as much of an heiress as can be. Always the aesthete, Lovey engages in eternal attempts to teach everyone the ways of the elite, but they never get the hang of it. Sometimes, it seems that she and Thurston married for money more than for love. Their marriage is often rocky, but they stay together.<br/><br/>Ginger Grant is the castaway with whom I would like to be stranded. A sultry movie star, Ginger can always seduce the men to get information. Her endless tales about life in Hollywood make life on the island sound not so bad. Ginger's dream would apparently be for Rock Hudson to rescue her from the island...and then some.<br/><br/>Professor Roy Hinkley is truly too smart for his (or anyone's) own good. Still, the Professor is the only reason that they are able to stay alive on the island. Whatever anyone needs built, he can take whatever materials are on the island and whip it up in a jiffy (unless of course anyone needs a raft).<br/><br/>Last but not least, Mary Ann Summers. She is the only castaway who can be classified as normal (and I use that term loosely). A wholesome farm girl from Kansas, Mary Ann tends the island's crops and keeps herself entertained by tuning into the soap operas on the radio. Nothing wrong with her.<br/><br/>So that's the story of the seven Castaways. They've been marooned on that island for over 40 years, and Gilligan's naivety, the Skipper's short temper, Mr. Howell's greed, Mrs. Howell's stuffiness, Ginger's sex appeal, the Professor's smarts and Mary Ann's glimpse into Americana never get old.

I watched it, like many other classic TV shows that aired in syndication at the time of my youth with regularity. Didn't really pay attention to much of the detail or innuendo or commentary. Just was a kid watching what was on. Back then, there weren't nearly as many choices as there are now.<br/><br/>In re-watching the series recently to gain some perspective, I realize that, no matter how silly and brainless people say this show was, it really was a FUNNY show! I'd say that it's utter lack of realism and complete focus on comedy is the primary reason for it's popularity and staying power. It never tried to be anything more than it was. Even \"greater\" shows can't lay claim to that trait! <br/><br/>The humor of GI is really broad, laced with sarcasm, wisecracking, innuendo, double-entendres, and, of course, physical comedy. There's quite a bit of ad-libbing that I realized went on. The dialogue, while simplistic for the most part, is actually engaging and still fresh in many ways. The main reason is that the 7 castaways are so well-defined and unique, illustrating that the actors really had a handle on their characters.<br/><br/>Gilligan, Skipper, Mr. and Mrs. Howell, Ginger, Professor, and Mary Ann are all awesome in their own way. TV icon Bob Denver played the equally iconic titular and central character Gilligan, with the then early 30ish Denver so effortlessly essaying the role of the innocent man-child. Alan Hale was also wonderful as the lovable Skipper. The Laurel-Hardy routine of he and Gilligan is a joy to behold! <br/><br/>I'd say my favorite character upon re-watch is really Mr. Howell. I'm amazed at how quick and natural that Jim Backus was with such a broad and somewhat cartoonish character. I'd bet he must have gotten at least an Emmy nomination for this role! <br/><br/>Mrs. Howell (played by then veteran Natalie Schafer) was an ad-libbing scene-stealer much like her hubby and garnered many laughs of her own. Russell Johnson must be commended for having to play the straight-laced, no-nonsense Professor amidst all the wackiness! <br/><br/>Glamorous Tina Louise was a childhood crush for me as Ginger and still does it for me! And hot Dawn Wells was so fresh and engaging as earnest do-gooder Mary Ann, and she did it WITHOUT ever coming across as annoying...no small feat! Of course, THE eternal question is \"Ginger or Mary Ann?\". They're both great in their own way and I'd take either one of them (as if I had a choice!). I can see why so many seem to prefer Mary Ann (the sweet farmgirl who would be the perfect mate) over Ginger (the sultry fantasy girl beyond reach), but it's not like Ginger was an awful person! She, like all the other castaways, in all their diversity, were presented as truly NICE people, which I find endearing as I re-visit this show. There are very few shows where EVERY character is likable. GI is definitely one of them.<br/><br/>When I started re-visiting this show, I couldn't believe that it ran for only 3 seasons! Honestly, it seemed like it was longer and that is because there were over 30 eps per season! Plus, the running time of each ep was longer than the average half-hour show now. So, if you equate GI to a show today, it actually would amount to about 5 seasons worth of episodes...I'll take it! I also find that I can watch GI much more so than several other shows from this era that I used to watch as a kid. It just has a warm, inviting quality and setting that I prefer.

Why would he want to be rescued? The island offers shelter and plenty of food, so he's in no danger of dying. He's got his best friend, the Skipper. He has a mentor in the Professor. He has parent figures in the Howells (rather strange parent figures, but still parent figures), a fantasy love interest in Ginger, and a realistic love interest in Mary Ann. Why would he want to leave? None of them seem that interested in leaving. Once every couple months, they'll concoct a half-hearted scheme to build a raft or light a signal fire, but overall they're more interested in their wardrobes or putting on talent shows or electing a leader on an island where everyone pretty much does what he or she pleases to begin with... It's a commentary on how man will change any landscape to suit his or her image. Gilligan's motives for staying have been outlined. Skipper is finally a leader (at least in his mind). The Howells love being among people they can clearly feel superior to. Ginger is now the celebrity she always imagined herself being, since her roles in minor movies show she was never A-list. The Professor is totally getting off on being the brains. Mary Ann feels useful and important, probably for the first time in her life, by being the only truly sensible person on the island. The show also comments on man's laziness: letting others do the work. When a guest star arrives the castaways always see that person as salvation, instead of using their own skills to get off the island. This show is awesome.

All 7 cast members are very convincing and their chemistry is outstanding. I'm the first to admit that some of the humor is silly. But some of it is not. It also falls under the banner of TV sitcoms with a very catchy soundtrack. The guest stars on this show were very entertaining for the most part (including a very young Kurt Russell). In my opinion, I don't believe that there has ever been a more scrutinized, criticized, nor analyzed show in the history of television. The very exaggerated detail that's questioned is what makes it funny (ie for a 3 hour tour, the Howells are carrying about 30 million dollars). Besides: if they have THAT much money, why are they on a 3 hour tour when they should be sailing on one of their own yachts? See what I mean?

Now, I started watching this show when I was at the there is a Santa Claus age and the concept of reruns really had not conceptualized in my thoughts.

It was also eye candy and I mean Dawn Wells eye candy, oh man was she my fantasy (still is!). I blame watching Gilligan's Island for my choice in choosing brunettes my whole life, it really influenced my life!

The comedy was great, but man was it heightened by that sexual tension of 3 adult men and 2 gorgeous women on a remote island. The same thing that I dream of Jennie and Get Smart had before they blew it with marriages in attempts to boost sagging ratings. Going back to season one, the times I saw them on TV (rarely shown when I was growing up), I immediately caught the theme song and my beloved Mary Ann not being included, which was a big turn off. The episodes just didn't seem as funny to me as the color ones but I'll give them another try, for me watching the BW episodes as a kid was doing research, how did they get there? Could they salvage that boat? etc etc, man I really took that show oh so seriously! Even as an elder teen I had to see the TV movie where they finally escaped and man was I on the edge of my seat!

The history of Days of Our Lives is similar to other soap operas in existence but in my opinion, Days has one of the richest history.   It has some of the best cast in daytime and some of the most memorable storylines.<br/><br/>How can I talk about Days and not mention my favorite couple on that show? Jack Harcourt Deveraux and Jennifer Rose Horton portrayed by the brilliant and gorgeous Matthew Ashford and Melissa Reeves respectively.  Their love story is unique, dramtic, poignant, funny, sexy, romantic, and enduring. Matt and Missy portray these characters so vividly and the viewer knows exactly just what they are going through.  (note: I am talking about J/J during the late 80's, early 90's right now their storyline is kind of shaky. We don't know what Jennifer feels although I have a pretty clear idea) Anyway the chaste and \"good girl\" Jennifer falling in love with the \"town pariah\" is just one of the best love stories, if not the best one, in daytime history.  These are two characters who have flaws and fears yet they overcome some of them and have dreams with the help of one another.  With the help of Jennifer, Jack realize that he is worthy of love.  Jack pushed Jennifer to be the best of journalist that she can be and guided her.  To quote a fellow Jack and Jennifer fan (Jennifer whose werbsite \"No Ordinary Love\" is just wonderful) \"They were an unlikely couple from the beginning--the young, innocent girl next door and the town pariah who everyone thought was irredeemable. But what unfolded was a love story that was poignant, funny, sexy, romantic, and most of all, enduring. In Jennifer, Jack found redemption from his past sins, and in Jack, Jennifer found her strength and spirit.

On so many levels, the characters evolve as the story matures - even the content of the story is about evolving technology.<br/><br/>Another revolving theme would be pursuit of dreams at all cost, while up against great challenges. The science fiction show Farscape had a similar episode formula. Basically in Farscape a series of impossible challenges are presented in the first 10 minutes. The rest of the episode is spent solving these issues, generally with lives on the line. But are lives on the line? Even in that show that I love, the threat of real harm is rarely felt - just awesome entertainment!<br/><br/>But here in StarUp? The threats are very real. The stakes are super high. Choices effect multiple characters. And harsh, harsh scenes allow for tremendous acting opportunities. The cast is up for it! Incredible, breath taking scenes - at least one every two episodes, will reward and punish viewers. It's a Breaking Bad kinda punish though - so artistic and well executed, can't help but continue, because? The characters are so compelling!<br/><br/>StarUp is about a small cast of characters who are trying to get a tech business off the ground and make it viable. One character is the brains, one businessman the other muscle - but they all desire financial success for various reasons. Knowing this hardly can set the viewer up for a truly diverse cast from widely different backgrounds - all with various forms of personal baggage. Nor can one guess at the losses along the way of the journey, each blow the team takes making success more important and worth striving for. Lastly - this show does violence as well as any movie or TV show has to date. Weapons are assigned their extreme destructive potential. Violence is presented how it would actually occur -awkward, shocking - unbelievable scenes that are as stunning as they are captivating. This isn't three rich kids in the bay making an idea a reality. StartUp is a struggle for life for all the major characters.<br/><br/>Humor is present where it should be, as well as the whole gambit of emotions. StartUp wouldn't work without the victories either. It isn't just a slog of difficulties - I'd say StartUp is way less punishing than a Breaking Bad in general, but the hard hitting scenes pack just as much emotional punch.<br/><br/>My one critique is the dialog heavy nature of the show at times feels like it may be, perhaps... dragging on a bit. I guarantee that this is my opinion. I feel this way because the pacing and (all) the dialog may be needed for the show to work. These scenes set the groundwork and anticipation for the more explosive action sequences. At times the suspense is overwhelming - the viewer can really feel the big scenes coming.<br/><br/>StartUp has vision! The tech ideas are awesome, and like Mr. Robot - some of the choices in this show effect the entire landscape of the environment - i.e. world changing stuff. TV with big ideas is easy to like, especially if the presentation, story and characters are solid.<br/><br/>Lastly, as a viewer you'll know pretty quick if this is a show to invest yourself in. If the characters aren't liked a few episodes in? Maybe not your show. I was curious about the casting in the first couple episodes, but after 4 or 5? I couldn't see anyone else in these roles. All the characters are a nice mix of the performer + the writers initial abstraction.<br/><br/>So much to recommend! And the online format by which this exists? Pretty incredible!

Would I recommend it, yes but with reservations. I really admired the cinematography and the sets. The interiors of the upscale houses and apartments reminded me of Michael Mann's Miami Vice. The lighting of the outdoor scenes that were shot at night was exceptional, whether it was the slums or downtown. This Miami was part of the story and its contrasts beautifully rendered.<br/><br/>On the other hand I felt the narrative dragged too often for my liking. There were many scenes where I felt \"what was the point of that?\" It was not quite plodding but pretty close to it. There are many long scenes where 2 or 3 people are just in conversation. I understand that the point of these scenes is for the viewer to gain insight into the characters personality and motivations (as they were not about developing the plot), but at the same time they needed to be witty or dramatic or insightful or clever. There are too many conversations that don't meet any of those criteria or increase our empathy.<br/><br/>The acting was almost uniformly good. Edi Gathegi is an actor with huge screen presence, something you can't learn, you either have it or you don't. His performance here is magnetic and one of the best things (if not the best thing) about the series.<br/><br/>The plethora of sex scenes (particularly in the early episodes) felt gratuitous. Sadly this seems to be fashionable, maybe it's an attempt to appeal to a certain demographic. But I don't like it. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the interesting and often ingenious plotting.

In a field with many top contenders, 'Fawlty Towers' remains my favourite of all 'Britcoms' - situation comedies originating on British television. Fawlty Towers has a cult following decades after the originals aired; it is sometimes hard to believe that there are but 12 episodes, six hours total. The regular cast is led by John Cleese, veteran of the famous Monty Python comedy troupe, as the irrepressible Basil Fawlty, titular head of the hotel with dreams of class and glory; Prunella Scales is his long-suffering and hardworking wife, Sybil, who recognises that while Basil may think 'the sky's the limit!', in fact, '22 rooms is the limit'. Connie Booth (Cleese's real-life wife) played the level-headed and sensible, overworked maid Polly, and in a role matched only by Fawlty's own bizarre manner, Andrew Sachs plays the lovable and ever-incompetent Spanish waiter, Manuel (he's from Barcelona...). Ballard Berkeley makes Ballard Berkeley makes a regular appearance as the Major, a retired long-term resident at the hotel. Brian Hall joined the cast for the second season as the not-quite-gourmet chef, Terry.<br/><br/>From the very first episode (first aired in 1975) featured a social-climbing Fawlty as perhaps the most rude and insufferable hotel manager in existence, in the resort town of Torquay, on the Channel coast of Britain. Sybil tries to maintain a reasonable level of service, but Fawlty's snobbishness permits him to be gracious (indeed, excessively fawning) toward those he considers 'worthy', which in this episode turns out to be Lord Melbury, who ends up not being Lord Melbury, but rather a confidence trickster, and Fawlty's revenge scares away the real 'posh' guests, whom Fawlty sends off with the hilarious shout, 'Snobs!' In each of the episodes, there is a crisis - one gets the sense that the life of Fawlty is non-stop crisis, with his wife and Polly forever picking up the pieces, Manuel always complicating things, and the others wandering around in a state of disbelief (or, in the case of the Major, perpetual daze). The twelve episodes highlight all the things that could wrong at hotel in classic comedic fashion - the institution of a Gourmet Night falls flat when the not-quite-recovering alcoholic chef starts drinking the night of the main event; a guest dies in the middle of the night, and Fawlty tries to slip him out unnoticed; remodelers install and remove the wrong doors; the health inspector unexpected shows up and gets served a bit of rat with his cheese.<br/><br/>However, nothing quite matches the kinds of situations Basil can get himself into. When trying to plan a surprise anniversary dinner for his wife, she leaves the hotel thinking that Basil has forgotten again, and Basil dresses Polly up as a sick-bed-bound Sybil to fool the guests. When Polly's friends check in for a wedding over the weekend, Basil suspects the group of free sexual expression (highlighting his own repression); this theme is carried over to a glorious extreme in the episode about the visiting Psychiatrist.<br/><br/>'How does he make his living?' Basil protests. 'He makes his money by sticking his nose into others' private parts, er, details...' This is also the episode where Sybil finally confronts Basil about his double-sided hotel manner toward guests: 'You're either crawling all over them, licking their boots, or spitting poison at them like some Benzedrine puff adder,' she declares. He replies in perfect form, 'Just trying to enjoy myself, dear.' As the psychiatrist will comment near the end, there's enough material for an entire psychiatrist conference. Indeed there is, as this is slapstick humour with a difference. Intelligent and witty while utterly chaotic and beyond the pale, one is treated to the moose-head incident and the ingrowing toenail as well as Fawlty's unique form of automobile motivation (how many of us have ever been tempted to whack away at a stalled car with a stick!) and a nice performance of Brahms (his 'third racket', to be precise). One must not overlook the little details, either, including the ever-changing sign in front (the actual hotel used for the exteriors unfortunately burned down many years after the show), and the fact that the interior and exterior layouts of the building cannot correspond (shades of 'The Simpsons' whose furniture layout changes from scene to scene).<br/><br/>It is almost inconceivable that the two series, each of six episodes, were four years apart (1975 and 1979), as they flow rather seamlessly together.

Amazing how many belly laughs and guffaws the show can still inspire, and this is probably my third or fourth viewing (still, it's been years).<br/><br/>\nEven more amazing is the short documentary on the realBasil Fawlty--Donald Sinclair, manager and owner of the Gleneagle, an ex Navy commander who (as Ray Marks, present manager of the Gleneagle puts it) thought running the Gleneagle \"would have been a wonderful job, if it wasn't for the guests. The guests spoiled his job.\"<br/><br/>According to legend, the Monty Python troupe once booked rooms at the Gleneagle, in the seaside town of Torquay; they still remember some of the things Sinclair did to them there. Pythoner Eric Idle carried an alarm clock inside his briefcase at the hotel reception; when Sinclair heard the ticking he said \"My God, there's a bomb in there!\" and threw it off a cliff. Later, Pythoner Terry Gilliam sat down to a meal and ate American style, cutting up the food first before picking up the pieces with his fork; Sinclair, passing by, picked up Gilliam's knife and snapped \"we don't eat like that here!\"<br/><br/>Eventually the entire Python troupe moved to another hotel--all except Cleese, who stayed. Apparently, he thought there was an idea for a TV show here somewhere.<br/><br/>It wasn't only the Pythoners that suffered; one guest asked for a drink at the bar, to which Sinclair replied by slamming down the grill and saying \"the bar's closed.\" When his friend invited him to a nearby hotel to drink, Sinclair informed him that if he isn't back by 11 pm, the front door will be locked. He comes back late, and just as Sinclair threatened, the front door was locked. \"This is ridiculous,\" he said, \"my wife and daughter are in there,\" and started banging on the door; a light turned on in a window, and Sinclair popped his head out and said \"I told you I'd lock the doors by 11!\" The guest replied: \"If you don't open the doors I'm going to knock them down!\" Three or four minutes later, Sinclair opens the door, lets him in, bangs the door behind him loud enough to, as the guest put it, wake everyone in the hotel, and yells \"Don't let that happen again!\"<br/><br/> Sinclair was also hard on the hired help. He hated builders, and would yell and curse at them; one Greek waiter was so fed up with Sinclair's treatment of him he jumped into a taxi and demanded to be driven to London. Rosemary Harrison, who once worked for Sinclair, describes how when one waiter, tired of waiting for Sinclair to make the tea, took a teapot meant for another table. Sinclair stopped the serving of breakfast and \"went up and down the tables like a policeman, questioning the guests. He came across a set of teapots at a table for two. He realised because of their size they were meant for a table for four, and he asked the guests for a description of the waiter.\"<br/><br/>Sinclair was apparently so appalling that when his wife had to go out shopping, she would lock him up in their room, and say to the staff \"don't let him out, he's only going to upset you.\" Ian Jones, owner of the nearby Coppice Hotel, said \"fugitives from the Gleneagle used to come knocking on our door, pleading accommodations.\"<br/><br/>He was, as Cleese would put it, \"the most wonderfully rude man I have ever met.\"", "rating": null, "helpful": "96 out of 107 found this helpful.", "date": "14 May 2004"}, {"title": " He's from Barcelona...", "content": "If you were to look up some of the most hysterical moments on the BBC, you would no doubtably come across two names. Those names would be John Cleese and Ricky Gervais. While Gervais recently found comedy through his program called 'The Office', Cleese has been providing wit, wisdom, and down-right hysteria for the past several decades. While away from his namesake (Monty Python), you can find Cleese comfortable in several other roles that showcase his bubbling talent. One of those programs just happens to be the funniest bit of crumpet called 'Fawlty Towers'. <br/><br/>Remembering this show when I was a child and was on our local PBS station, I eagerly bought it when it was released on DVD about a year ago. Since then, I have watched random episodes here and there but never fully taking in the enjoyment from watching it all. So, today I decided to sit down and watch this series from beginning to end and I have yet to finish laughing. If this program doesn't define comic genius, I don't know what does. Never have I witnessed a show that has continually been fresh, hysterical (I cannot use that word enough), real, and outlandish all at the same time. Normally, with our current television programming, you need to pick or choose which it will be, but thankfully 'Fawlty Towers' is all of these and many more. <br/><br/>Cleese remains in top form as Basil Fawlty, the owner/manager of the B&amp;B that just happens to have his hands and over-worked imagination in everything. With the aid of his helpers Manuel (he's from Barcelona) and Polly (co-writer Connie Booth and ex-wife of Cleese), Cleese always seems to find himself in a heap of trouble with his wife Sybil (the dragon of the hotel). Armed with physical humor and a snake-like banter, we witness everything from a dead body, hotel inspectors, a failed anniversary party, a moose head, and a Himalayan rodent of sorts happen to this simple, everyday, B&amp;B. This is not only a few of the episodes you will find in the complete set, but also the daily stress that Basil finds himself falling into daily.<br/><br/>This series, again, is hysterical. Cleese is the master of his trade while proving that he can manage any task thrown in front of him. While some will argue that he overshadows the rest of the cast, I would say 'hogwash' to that. My two favorite characters in this series were Major and Manuel. The comedy that they provide cannot be found on television today.

Classic British comedy.", "content": "Fawlty Towers is one the best, most popular but sadly slightly overshadowed comedies in Britain. it has the ingredients for perfect comedy and contains perfect characters. It is about this misanthropic arrogant man, Basil Fawlty, played brilliantly by the genius John Cleese, who is totally in the wrong job. He runs hotel and is rude to nearly everyone within a ten mile radius of him, but determined to make a success of his business. His wife Sybille played by Prunella Scales, whom he despises to the nth degree because she rules him with a rod of iron. Then there is Polly the waitress played by Connie Booth, the most intelligent character in the show who always ends up sorting out all the problems and keeps the hotel running. There is Manuel played by Andrew Sachs, the lovable gormless Spanish waiter who Basil bullies and tries to kill in nearly every episode. Other additional characters are the batty Major Gowen played by Ballard Berkeley, the dotty old ladies Miss Gatsby and Miss Tibs played by Renee Roberts and Gilly Flower and Terry the chef played by Brian Hall. All played very well.<br/><br/>One thing this programme didn't do like others is go on for series after series and eventually become far-fetched like several British sitcoms seem to do (cough, Last of the Summer Wine). It only ran for two series and left the audience starving for more. I think that it was a wise move not to do more, even though I would have loved it if they had. This is probably what John Cleese might be best remembered for in Britain, he not only stared in it he wrote it as well with wife Connie Booth. He based the character on a hotel proprietor in while staying at a hotel in England with the Python Gang.<br/><br/>I have no issues with this show at all, brilliant work.

My first encounter with Basil was Episode Four - 'The Hotel Inspectors'. Even now I can feel the pain in my side from laughing too hard. I spent the next few days telling everyone how great this show was. <br/><br/>'Fawlty Towers' takes place in a hotel in Torquay, run by the world's rudest man - Basil Fawlty ( John Cleese ) and his henpecking wife Sybil ( Prunella Scales ) who has a laugh like someone machine-gunning a seal. The permanently overworked staff includes American art student Polly Shearman ( Connie Booth, then Cleese's wife ), Cockney chef Terry ( the late Terry Hall ) and, of course, Manuel ( Andrew Sachs ), a Spanish waiter whose command of the English language leaves a lot to be desired. Among the regular guests are the senile Major Gowen ( Ballard Berkeley ). What gives the show much of its humour is that Basil is snobbish and quick-tempered, barely disguising his contempt for the guests.<br/><br/>'Fawlty' was based on the late Donald Sinclair, owner of 'The Gleneagles' in Torquay. He was so rude that the Python cast, there on a location shoot, moved out! Cleese remembered him when writing for the L.W.T. sitcom 'Doctor At Large'. The episode 'No Ill Feeling!' was a success and it was clear that there was a series based around its setting and characters.<br/><br/>The show debuted on B.B.C.-2 less than a year after the final season of 'Monty Python'. It was not an immediate hit. Repeats came to the rescue. When it moved over to B.B.C.-1 on Sunday evenings a year later, ratings skyrocketed. <br/><br/>It got off to a fantastic start with 'A Touch Of Class' in which Basil is taken in by a confidence trickster ( Michael Gwynn ). Other classic episodes include 'The Hotel Inspectors' ( boasting a marvellous guest performance from Bernard Cribbins ), 'Gourmet Night' in which Basil tries to make the hotel famous for its cooking, and, memorably, 'The Germans' with a concussed Basil offending a party of Germans by making constant references to the war.<br/><br/>It was a triumph, yet a second season did not appear until 1979. The first was a tough act to follow, but the second managed it. Memorable episodes include 'Communication Problems' with Joan Sanderson as a fussy old woman who uses her deafness to get her own way, 'Waldorf Salad' in which a loud American ( Bruce Boa ) tries to bribe Basil into keeping the chef working, 'The Kipper &amp; The Corpse' has Basil trying to conceal the fact one of the guests has died, and the final edition - 'Basil The Rat' - involves the staff hunting for an escaped rodent before a Health Inspector is due to call.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that 'Fawlty Towers' is the most perfectly realised British sitcom of them all.

He'd internally explode or offend the guests just that little bit too much, and that would be the end of Fawlty Towers.<br/><br/>If Basil died, on the other hand, I don't think Sybil, Manuel and Polly would worry at all about carrying on without him. Although he's a hotelier, Mr. Fawlty clearly doesn't like people at all. He exploits the fact that the slightly deaf and constantly complaining Mrs. Richards has her hearing aid switched off to ask, \"Is this a piece of your brain?\". Obviously sexually repressed, Basil can't come to terms with the liberated 1970s that he lives in. He goes out of his way to avoid giving an unmarried couple a double room, then spends the night \"checking the walls\" for woodworm and having misunderstandings with a pretty Australian guest, leading Sybil to respond with \"If you're going to grope a girl, have the gallantry to stay in the room with her while you're doing it!\". With lines like this, you can see why it took Connie Booth and John Cleese weeks to write each episode. <br/><br/>Basil himself is an interesting physical character. I think it particularly helps that John Cleese is well over six feet in height, because when Basil gets in a rage he seems trapped in his own body. Anyone else would be throwing things and flailing their arms about and screaming, but Basil, being emotionally (and certainly sexually) repressed, doesn't seem to know how to handle his anger and his physical struggle is very funny to watch.<br/><br/>There are a wonderful host of interesting characters for Basil to bounce off - a small guest named Mrs. Hall that he doesn't notice, a highly-strung (\"Yes, he should be\") teenager who demands salad cream instead of fresh mayonnaise and the priceless builder Mr. \"lick o'paint\" O'Reilly, as well as the better builder Mr. Stubbs (\"That's a supporting wall! God help the floors above!\"), the Major and the old ladies who seem to live in the hotel.<br/><br/>If Basil Fawlty was still alive today (though I imagine he'd have long since expired of a heart attack or astronomically high blood pressure), I'm not sure if he'd have retired or if he'd be clinging on to his treasured establishment until he dropped down dead. I'd like to think that Sybil could outlive him - perhaps in a twist on Basil's reference to the film \"How To Murder Your Wife\" she'd have gone mad and killed him - so whether she'd be in prison or retired or mourning the loss of Basil, I can't tell but I hope she'd enjoy her retirement.", "rating": 10, "helpful": "12 out of 13 found this helpful.", "date": "12 March 2006"}, {"title": " Brilliant", "content": "I consider this series one of the best comedies ever produced!

The jokes on the show are completely ridiculous and hilarious. Cleese plays Fawlty. He is an extremely unpolitically correct manager of a hotel in Torquay, England. Torquay (near Cornwall) is in the southwestern part of England. There are real palms trees at the ocean level. Fawlty is a nasty man, who says exactly how he feels. This is probably how most hotel workers feel after 15 years, but don't usually say how they feel outloud. Fawlty is supposed to represent the rural Tory mentality of the 1970s. There is a great supporting cast. Connie Booth, co-writer of the episodes, plays English enough to not realize that she is from Indianapolis, Indiana. Andrew Sachs plays a very convincing Spaniard. Of course, Fawlty treats Manuel like absolute dirt, representative of how lowly regarded EU workers are in England. The only fault of this show is that there were only 12 episodes.

One, the scene where Basil beats up his car with a large branch, two, his impression of a German Soldier, three, his struggle to get the corpse out of the hotel and finally, the deaf old woman who complains about the room. Although each episode itself contains side achingly funny situations that still seem original today in spite the fact that it was made back in the mid/late 70s.<br/><br/>Like most people, the sad feeling is that only 12 episodes were ever made.

And Takaya is doing just that, she is overseeing all of production and 20 episodes in, I AM AMAZED, not only with the animation, but with the subtle updates to this 20 year old story, and not to mention the way that they are switching story arcs around slightly to better express the on screen telling of this story.

Despite each episode running fast-paced due to closely following the manga, it is heartwarming, nostalgic, and makes me tear up, especially in the later half of the series. Whether I watch it in Japanese dub (with English subtitles) or English dub, I find myself crying over each emotionally-heavy scene. Here are a few reasons why I'm giving Fruits Basket: 1st Season (2019) a 10/10:<br/><br/>Character Designs - Wow! Amazing! Stunning! The artwork is gorgeous and detailed. Female audiences especially would definitely thirst over the beautiful and stylistic look of these animated characters! The Sohma boys are good, and as a female viewer, I couldn't agree more. The artwork is inviting and audiences are more likely to appreciate the animators' hard work in the tiniest details<br/><br/>Voice Cast - I watch both English dub and Japanese dub (with English subtitles), and I appreciate them both. The Japanese dub rings true -- the voice casts are so natural -- they don't try too hard to sound too cute, too modest, or too angry. As this anime is made from Japan, I like watching it with the new Japanese voice casts as the actors/actresses' raw voices transpires the beautiful animations from 2D to 3D.<br/><br/>Although Japanese voices are powerful, I am an English audience, and the story has had more impact on me if I watch it in English. But don't get me wrong, I like the Japanese casts -- in my opinion, it's better than the 2001 original voice casts. And FUNimation is doing a great job in dubbing the English casts!<br/><br/>Plotline - It's closer to the manga, and I love the way the animators tease audience to watch for the next episode / next season, as it truly hypes up the viewers for more emotional and epic scenes! A little bit of changes are made, but it's better 'cause we never saw them in the manga in the first place :)<br/><br/>Music - Astounding! I love hearing the music background in each episode as it only heightens the already emotionally-heavy scene, which ultimately brings tears to my eyes!<br/><br/>Technology - Little changes were made to adapt to tech-savvy audience as the manga was produced between 1998 - 2006. Background characters now have cellphones to communicate. And some of the Sohma guys even purchased Apple computers for work purposes, as well as a flat-screen TV. It just goes to show that the story has to adapt to its tech-savvy audience so the anime can be relatable.

I also find that locating shows that include all of these elements is HElla difficult so when I do find one I am overly excited to binge it. But this show delivered and more.<br/><br/>There's a great soundtrack, the lead girl is believably sarcastic, witty, and damaged, the romance element isn't over the top or high school-esque, and the plot is something I haven't ever seen before (and trust me I have watched ALL THE TV in this genre) and includes elements even I haven't heard about. The show is also very pro-female power (I'm female and I like when there are strong lead female roles before you rip me a new one but let's me honest, sometimes nowadays the feminist element goes above and beyond and moves toward utter ridiculousness) without going over the top. Also, while Some elements are a bit cliche (tho lets be honest at this point any storyline is derivative of something) like the hero overcoming obstacles, mean girl humbled etc etc, it's not overtly noticeable and doesn't effect the enjoyment of the show.<br/><br/>HOwever, if you are a devout Catholic or feel that ANY disrespect towards the church is a big \"hell no\" for you, you may not this series.

Netflix greenlights and maybe purchases the rights, but as a company has very little to do with the actual stories or scripts.. and I'm sure didn't have much to do with the actual production of the series.. a lot of times in these instances, the show is already produced and shot and Netflix is just the distributor. So to blame Netflix is completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>The show could use better dialogue at times and the fight scenes seem too choreographed. I get bored with the teenage angst and some of the drawn out life lesson dialogue.. more action and shooting or do a better job of building this world and developing the characters.<br/><br/>Ava tho is a total jerk. Given a second chance at life and can walk after being bed ridden majority of her life and just acts a complete a** when blessed with a second chance out side of a few moments of humility. The nuns should just take the Halo out of her back if she refuses to follow the plan or be on board with their ideology. That simple. Because of that fact and the CW feel of rhe show that should be a tid bit grittier in nature, I have to give the show a 6. Ava goes on saying she didn't ask for any of this over and over again, but at the end of the day, the Halo is a part of the OCS, so If she is just gonna be an a**hole the first 6 episodes, then just take the Halo from here and end it all. Problem solved.<br/><br/>Edit: Horrible wigs on Ava in flashback scenes lol and you can tell the show was shot out of sequence. Shotgun Mary's hair/ braids looks rough and frizzy in first few episodes and then perfectly freshly braided in the 5th/6th episode lol kinda ruins continuity a little for me. Production/ hair and make up matter, braids like that do take a long time to have to redo and hard to keep fresh looking after a lot of sweating over days time, but then you have to keep that in mind when filming.<br/><br/>The CGI is pretty decent for the kind of show it is.<br/><br/>I like inclusiveness and diversity and love some of the messages they want to make.. but the execution was bad. For instance, woman are strong and don't need men to be White Knights saving them, right? But LITERALLY she was yelling help while drowning in a pool she jumped in, instead of swimming at the beach she was just at of course, so JC jumped in a saved her (by the way, why didn't the Halo just glow and levitate her out the water or help her swim like it helps her fight at times?) and then the shower scene, she yelled like she was being attacked, so of course JC came running in, but then after when they're eating breakfast, she's like \"I don't need you to keep rescuing me, I can slay my own dragons\" which is over the top, out of no where and he only has rescued her when she was about to die or screaming like she was about to die lol", "rating": 6, "helpful": "28 out of 38 found this helpful.", "date": "9 July 2020"}, {"title": " Pretty good.

Although I wasn't super-impressed by the promos leading up to the premiere, I was so pleasantly surprised when the show started - a great mix of comedy and drama, and the show's quality has been so consistent through the first three seasons. <br/><br/>Nina Proudman is an obstetrician in her 30's. Although she is extremely capable and respected at her job, she has a difficult time getting her personal life in order. Enter her family, consisting of an older sister Billie who isn't afraid to say what she thinks, a chilled-out younger brother Jimmy who loves his carefree irresponsible life, the matriarch of the family Geraldine who is searching for her identity after splitting with her husband Darcy Proudman, who although still loves his wife has a weakness for other women as well. Mick is a shoeless musician who is also Jimmy's best friend and Billie's ex-boyfriend. Add in to the mix a range of co-workers including nurses Cherie, Zara and Kim, who get great pleasure from commentating on Nina's life whenever they get the chance; and Dr Martin Clegg, the eccentric boss who is just a bit too interested in the personal lives of his staff. And don't forget the range of other doctors passing through the unit, including Chris Havel the dreamy paediatrician, Patrick Reid the brooding anaesthetist and Fraser King, the starry-eyed obstetric registrar. <br/><br/>Each character in the show is easy to relate to due to their individual quirks. There are no 'bad guys' or troublemakers, but rather just regular people interacting, clashing, making mistakes and trying to make amends. Nina particularly is refreshing as the heroine of the story, as although she is beautiful and incredibly smart, she is clumsy, rehearses things over and over in her head and still gets it wrong. <br/><br/>I've heard this show compared with other popular comedies such as Ally McBeal and Scrubs, however I feel this show is much easier to relate to. Funny, yes absolutely, but Nina's daydreams are more realistic than dancing babies or exploding heads, and the characters don't speak at a rate of a million miles per hour!

If I listen to them it is everything I wouldn't enjoy. However the same thing happened with \"The Alice\", where every review and Nine's own promos made it look like \"McLeod's Daughters\". It's only through catching a few episodes by accident that I have realised how quirky this show is, and how well it balances comedy and drama (exactly like \"The Alice\"). <br/><br/>Perhaps that's our real problem in Australia: we can make these shows just fine, we have the talent, but if it isn't a cop show or soapie we don't know how to sell it. Perhaps many people who'd enjoy it are being turned off by the advertising and reviews, which are in turn attracting the people who don't like it after all.<br/><br/>It has what I like: well written, well acted stories with original characters. The fact it is technically great (camerawork, sets, lighting etc) is a bonus. The characters are ordinary people without being ordinary clich\u00e9s, and not everyone looks like a model with a six figure wardrobe. <br/><br/>Sure some of them give me the irrits no end with their stupidity - who agrees to a surrogacy arrangement without thrashing out the details *before* any sperm goes anywhere?! I want to bang their stupid heads together. But people are like that, some are stupid and annoying, and sometimes you're related to them. The show would only be unwatchable if the stupid and annoying were *the* core of it, which thankfully they aren't.<br/><br/>The comedy is varied and at times unexpected, while very intense dramatic moments (such as informing a couple of the death of their child after a car accident) are handled with subtlety while still managing to be confronting and difficult to watch. The fact that these extremes can be found within episodes, and yet it still flows and works, shows how good the writers are.<br/><br/>This is well worth a look, and I would encourage the sceptical who are turned off by the \"babies and love\" reviews to give it a shot anyway.

In general, I enjoy Australian TV a great deal more than US network TV shows. Part of it is probably the Australian over-the-air networks can get away with a lot edgier material than the US nets. In that sense, shows like Offspring resemble US shows on cable networks like FX or HBO, and those are the ones I tend to gravitate towards.<br/><br/>Overall, I've enjoyed Offspring, even though I typically don't watch the hospital type shows like Grey's Anatomy to which I've seen some compare this too. There is a fair share of melodrama and tragedy, but it also has a much lighter air than shows like Grey's, which I appreciate.<br/><br/>Don't read any further if you don't want to be spoiled on key show plots. But I feel like I need to address some things I liked, and things I didn't, in order to properly review the show.<br/><br/>I do find the Proudman clan just straddles the right side of the line from being too cartoony...they each have their own struggles and demons, especially Nina and Billie...they make progress only to regress at key moments...they rebuild only to fall again. If the characters weren't likable this would get tiresome. But for the most part, even as they make the same mistakes, I found myself engaged with the Proudmans. But its a very thin line, and the show has been in danger of crossing it too far several times.<br/><br/>I do think the show struggled a bit in the 5th and 6th seasons, after the death of Patrick. I don't have an issue with the writers killing him off (though I can only imagine Australians' reaction watching that live), and I thought the actors did a wonderful job portraying how heart wrenching that would be.<br/><br/>It just felt one step too far in pulling on the viewer's heartstrings. To have Patrick die a week before his child was born, when a big reason for his struggles was the stillborn birth of a child with his first wife, was a bit too emotionally manipulative for me.<br/><br/>So I think the show struggled finding a footing after that. By killing him off in such a tragic circumstance, the show has lionized Patrick as the \"one great love\" for Nina, when as others have pointed out, their relationship had as many downs (maybe more) as ups over the 3 seasons he was on the show.<br/><br/>I just think they've made it hard to root for any of the subsequent men in her life; for instance her current love interest through the 7th season is probably a stronger (and healthier) relationship for her than Patrick. But as one of her ex-boyfriends comments to her in an episode (which I can't help but wonder was the the writers' way of answering critics), Patrick is always going to exist as the perfect ideal to Nina now, whether he was that in real life or not. Its hard for anyone else to compete.<br/><br/>I also think the show has introduced too many peripheral characters recently. Did we really need yet another Proudman half-sibling at this point? And while I think the Mick/Billie relationship had really run its course, it was dispatched with so little fanfare at the beginning of season 7. I can only assume actor commitments made it impossible to bring Mick back for more closure than we got, but it was kind of weird that after all those two had been through we don't get to see the ultimate break up scene.<br/><br/>But overall, I did think the 7th season was an improvement over 5 and 6, and has me intrigued to watch an 8th season, if there is to be one. Even if they make you want to pull your hair out, I still want to root for Nina, Billie, Jimmy and the rest of the Proudmans.

This is the best television show of the new season. Melinda Gordon (Jennifer Love Hewitt) own an antique shop, has recently gotten married, and deals with everyday stress. But unlike anyone else, she has the ability to help ghosts finish their unfinished business and cross over to the other side. The first episode started off as horror, with some extremely disturbing visuals. But it turned into one of the most emotional stories I have ever watched, and the second episode follows in that tradition. I am a guy, and most people think that either this is a chick flick, or a teen horror show, but that's not the case. This drama shows that you should never take things for granted and that you should always do the best you can do! Because you never know if tomorrow will come. There are some people who don't believe in ghosts, and some that do. Either way, this show deserves a chance because it makes the phenomenon believable with convincing performances and story lines. <br/><br/>I am glad to see \"Ghost Whisperer\" performed well in it's deathly time slot on a Friday night, and hope that it will continue. Jennifer Love Hewitt has always been one of my favorite actresses, but on this she really outdoes herself, playing a character more her age.

I don't know how long it will last, but who can tell nowadays. (I figured Joan of Arcadia for a seven year run.)<br/><br/>At least Jennifer Love Hewitt is back and she's not reprising Party of Five this time. She's chasing ghosts, which allows her to do everything she does well except sing. (She has a great voice. Started out singing in Texas at age 3. Maybe she'll meet a singing ghost somewhere along the way.)<br/><br/>So it's Ghost Whisperer on CBS versus Medium on NBC and that may rankle Medium fans but Medium is on a different night and seems to be slowing down this season. I always tape Medium because it usually puts me to sleep in the last half-hour, despite the admirable talents of Patricia Arquette and Jake Weber and their wonderful TV kids Sofia Vassilieva and Maria Lark.<br/><br/>It isn't Jennifer Love Hewitt versus Patricia Arquette in any case. These two actresses are as different as night and day in look, style and approach. Both total pros and completely capable of leading a series.<br/><br/>I didn't like the Medium rip-off scene where a prophetic nightmare wakes Melinda (Jennifer Love Hewitt) in bed with her husband (David Conrad), but once you get past the obvious similarities GW goes way beyond Medium. Melinda doesn't depend on dreams. She sees ghosts everywhere, all the time. (The bedroom in Medium is that show's main set.)<br/><br/>Ghost Whisperer is no Dead Zone and it's not jumping on the post-X-Files backlash bandwagon like Supernatural either. It's more Touched By An Angel (a similarity that Dead Zone exec producer Michael Piller specifically instructs his writers to avoid.)<br/><br/>The Ghost Whisperer pilot did center entirely on Hewitt, but it's her show, after all. I wondered if they cut stuff out for time. References to what her husband does for a living were rather obviously thrown in as voiceovers until they briefly discussed his day as a paramedic, rather than showing him in action somewhere in the beginning to establish him.<br/><br/>I liked that producer Hewitt pulled in character actors Eddie Jones (ex-Pa Kent from Lois &amp; Clark, the Invisible Man's boss, etc) and Jon Polito and also Wentworth Miller (from Prison Break) as guest stars.

Truthfully, the subject matter, on the whole, is handled with care and expertise.<br/><br/>What makes the show so watchable are the relationships and characters, which are portrayed and make it a pleasure and a joy to watch. The directors are on top of their game too. Each of them has the ability to make you feel happy and elated and then creep you out with an eerie atmosphere - and ultimately have you reaching for the hankies at the soppy happy ending. I still marvel at how the writers turned even the darkest tales into lightness as the ghost always, mostly, walks into the light. Though I won't complain too much as most episodes lifted me up and put a smile on my face, which is always a good thing.<br/><br/>Jennifer Love Hewitt as Melinda Gordon and David as Jim Clancy and, later, Sam \"Jim\" Lucas work perfectly together and are pretty believable as the \"Perfect - Good-Looking Couple\" - do these really exist? Ah, well, it give's the viewer something to dream about. Then add to the mix, Aisha Tyler as Andrea, Jay Mohr as Prof. Rick Payne, Camryn Manheim as Delia Banks, Christoph Sanders and Tyler Patrick Jones as Ned Banks, Jamie Kennedy as Prof. Eli James, and David Clennon as Carl you get a great cast with well written and fleshed out main personalities. Though, there are some issues here too. The main one for me being the Jim and Sam storyline: This had so many possibilities and just as the writers start to get their teeth into the subject matter the story just peters out. Sam is pretty much forgotten, even by the people who know Sam... Parents, family, previous friends, and lovers... nobody that knows Sam ever turns up. This is a wasted possibility and left me quite dissatisfied.<br/><br/>This, however, is the only thing which is wrong with the entire five seasons... continuity. Even though the majority of the stories are standalone, there's a major storyline which runs through each season. These are dark and ominous but all of them just peter out or are resolved instantaneously. The worst for this is the story concerning Melinda's father and brother. This had all the mystery and suspense and was building up to be one hell of a story... and the writers decided to change direction... and in one episode the story was resolved and both brother and father were forgotten and never seen again. More missed opportunities.<br/><br/>A major missed opportunity was the relationship between Melinda and Rick. These two had palpable chemistry, though it would have wrecked the \"Perfect Couple\" image the show wants to put across. So out goes one major character to be replaced by a very similar one, Eli - and this one is minus any sexual sparks. I did hope that Rick might appear again, especially at some crucial times in her life, since he was meant to be such a good friend. But he just turned out to be somebody else who is out of sight and out of... who was I talking about again?<br/><br/>To be honest, and thinking too much on it the \"Bye Bye - You're Gone\" list is pretty massive. Not only is there Sam's missing people, Rick, Melinda's Dad and Brother, there's even Melinda's Mum (though she only lives one town over) and Jim's Mum who also disappears for good - bad grandparents, who never come over to check on their grandson. To the extreme that their own offspring never discuss them with their son.<br/><br/>Another gripe of mine is Delia's unwavering self-perpetuated ignorance concerning ghosts. Though she has a few ghostly experiences herself, she is unwilling to believe in there existence. Then after the longest time... piff-paff-puff - and she's not talking to the dead too.<br/><br/>Even though you'd think all this would be a major setback and a viewer turn off, it's actually just a niggle as each story has merits of their own and holds the viewer attention and actually sturs emotions. At the end of the day, you can let the niggles just fade away and you will still enjoy the story.<br/><br/>This is the second time I've watched the series as it's being rerun on the telly and I enjoyed it just as much the second time around. I still wish that there were more \"realistic\" stories as not everything has a happy ending.<br/><br/>If you want an easy watch with a few smiles, a couple of laughs, along with a ghost story and a morality tale then this could be for you.

Jennifer Love Hewitt is a gorgeous girl but it was super irritating that she was usually half-naked (i.e. breasts ALWAYS falling out of her tops), her hair was never done differently, when she cut her hair off it sure grew back fast! She's not that great of an actor, she was always crying/sobbing/whining/scowling and screaming. I realize the show was more somber than most out there but come on! All of the episodes follow the same general outline 1) ghost shows up and scares Melinda Gordon (Hewitt), 2) she screams and turns into the busy body of Grandview and breaks into someone's car/home/office but never gets arrested, 3) ghost doesn't tell her what it wants so she has to figure it out on her own, blah blah blah. Her relationships with her \"guy friends\" are a little too friendly for a married woman. Seriously, crying when her \"best friend\" leaves to explore other things when her husband should be her best friend. Anyway, it would have been good as maybe a one season show so I can't believe I watched them all. The thing that bothered me the most was that in season 4 they kill her husband, Jim. However, Jim, does not \"cross over\". Jim ends up stealing the dead body of another man because he cannot bear to leave Melinda. I'll admit, they had me glued to my seat for Jim to get his memory back after he stole Sam's body and had me bawling my eyes out when he did. I guess it's because I am horrified to lose my own spouse. In any case, the story REALLY went downhill after that. At the start of the fifth season Melinda gives birth to the baby that she and Jim made before he died (to which I might add, she got REALLY pregnant REALLY fast). Also, in the first episode when she has the baby they fast forward five years (soap opera much?) so they can neglect their child instead of neglecting their baby. Also, we are to forget that Jim was in Sam's body because his name is Jim Clancy and we never see Sam's face again (not even on Jim's ID badge at the hospital), we never hear Sam's name (except for when Aiden is born and they name him Aiden Lucas \"in Sam's memory\", as Melinda says), his concerned family never calls or drops by, blah blah blah. So is he Jim or is he Sam? Did Sam legally change his name to Jim Clancy? I'm confused! Love Hewitt is NOT convincing as a mother, she acts more like the aunt that spoils her nieces and nephews or a very loving nanny.

It definitely did not need 5 seasons, two would have been plenty. Crying in a show works for dramatic purposes but when you do it all the time then when it's needed for emphasis it doesn't work. She cries on every episode... sometimes more than once. So in the situations like when her husband dies or her son goes missing those are supposed to be very dramatic points but we are so used to her tears that it left a little to be desired. And whining... that grates on my nerves like nails on a chalk board does to some people. She didn't whine a whole lot but when she did it was very annoying.<br/><br/>Then there were a few inconsistencies (or things that lacked explanation) in the show. One of the biggest is the situation regarding her husband when he stole the other guy's body. Here you have a body that has taken on sufficient damage enough to kill the guy but yet another soul can just move into his body? Is it too damaged for the original soul to move back in? Why could Jim not move back into his original body, if that's the case? Then, since he was a thief, they still used his original face throughout the rest of the show to throw the fans off that that was not Jim's body even though EVERY SINGLE PERSON supposedly saw the other guy's face. How about keeping it real and using the other guy since it is his body that was stolen.<br/><br/>And Melinda the hypocrite. She tells everyone that they must move on because it isn't right for them to stay... well, except when it comes to her own relationship. How about she tell people, \"look, you gotta move on or seal some guy's dead body like my husband did.\" At least give them the option like she and Jim took. <br/><br/>Overall, the show was not bad but it wasn't really good either.

As opposed to Medium, Hewitt, as well as the producers, were quick to differentiate their show as being a more positive look at the Earth bound spirits who simply needed to relay messages back to living ones. That premise lasted for less than a season before the show turned into a haunting Friday night scream fest. Probably a result of lazy creativity and the outright contempt for audience intelligence, the writers proceeded to change the show's theme into a darker setting. Now dealing with more dangerous plots, NBC's Medium producers can now watch Ghost Whisperer confident that their story lines have been lifted by CBS.<br/><br/>In contrast to the frightening new plots, Jennifer Love Hewitt playing an overly cutie pie Melinda Gordon. Filled with obnoxious giggling and frequent cleavage displays, Hewitt's character dances, stalks, and meddles around her town searching for answers to ghosts, only to conveniently stumble on information between costume changes. Melinda Gordon must be a 'Rainbow over Texas' portrayal of Hewitt herself. How can a newlywed couple exist in real life, one a new small business owner and the other a EMT, with two brand new cars, their own well-furnished home and a closet with more clothes than a Sears warehouse? In addition, they seemingly needed to dumb down every other character in the cast to make Hewitt's character seem smarter. The husband is a emasculated doormat and her friend Delia chose to gave up her career to work in Melinda's antique store. Plus, Jay Mohr's character was originally a sceptic professor who begins to belief and take part in Melinda's adventures. Something tells me James Van Praagh (the show's lead inspiration) requested a character to zing real life sceptics who have read through his scamming. Also, why has it taken more than three seasons for Melinda Gordon supposed secret abilities got out? Finally, has anyone else noticed a major change with the Earth bound spirits? Early on the ghosts were mostly powerless and good-natured, gaining the attention of the living requiring Melinda to act as a third-party. However, as the show continued, ghosts become unlimitedly powerful and surprisingly bad tempered for no honest reason.<br/><br/>This show is following the structure of the horror films they release weekly into theatres.

Despite being a show about a possibly psychic detective, that starts with an insane amount of different stories about characters that doesn't seem to have any impact on each other, everything is actually connected and brought together in a brilliant unexpected way in the end. \nApart from all this, Max Landis has managed to write every single character interesting, and capable of being the star of their own show. Above all they are relatable, despite or maybe because of them being a bit crazy and a loser in their own way. None of these characters are unflawed and it makes you care about them in a way that I've never been able to care about fictional characters before. \nEvery single actor is hugely talented, and the creative team behind the show must have put such a huge amount of love and effort into bringing Landis's vision to life. \nThe portrayals of women, lgbt+ people, people of color and mentally ill people are so respectful in a unique way that I think is mostly due to the fact that Landis knows how to write them as any other human being. As a woman I experienced a great relief in watching a show where no woman is sexualized in any way, but still considered worthy of love and acceptance. \nThe dialogue is never random, it changes dynamically between hilarious and thoughtful. No clich\u00e9s ever show up, which is incredibly refreshing. \nI could go on and on about this show, the beautiful music and cinematography, the powerful messages that are often underlying and sometimes outspoken, the relationships between the characters and the absence of toxic masculinity in the male heroes, but I'm already ranting, so I'm just going to end with this:<br/><br/>Give this show a chance.

Nine hours later I had finished the whole show in one run with breaks only to cook food that I ate in front of my laptop.<br/><br/>I don't know how to accurately describe the tone and feel of the show. On the one hand it has the kinda-quirky \"Doctor Who\" vibe wherein characters act insane only for the plot to fall in line behind their actions, but it also has a grittiness and grungy feel to it. Characters are written so that they can be lovable and evil or darkly- endearing. It's a very strange, multi-layered vibe throughout the show.<br/><br/>What I absolutely loved, above all else, was the character of Bart, a \"holistic assassin\" who randomly, violently, and gruesomely murders people with zero remorse while looking rather terrifying. Not only is it a refreshing change of pace to not somehow tie violence to sexuality with a female character, which they don't do with Bart (the name is short for Bartine, apparently), but it's also pretty insane how they make a character start off seeming like a sociopath monster only to sway the audience into genuinely loving her by the end of the season.

As the show goes on, you learn more about both characters, and new ones are introduced, like Amanda, who is Todd's troubled sister, and Bart, a sort of antithesis to Dirk, who shares several of his traits and abilities, but in a slightly different way.

The characters are likable and funny, the dialogue is interesting and quirky and the stories vary from downright silly to incredibly moving.<br/><br/>I guess I'm mostly referring to the first four seasons of the series rather than the travesty that was the final one. The first four seasons were fantastic to watch and I really enjoyed every episode. Yes there were one or two duds scattered here and there, but that is only to be expected with that many episodes. But there could be some really moving moments. When Ally has to inform the office that Billy has died the acting by Calista Flockhart was superb because the whole situation was totally underplayed which made the announcement almost real and that much more moving. The final scene of the season one episode \"Boy to the World\" was heart wrenching That said the sheer comedy moments were also wonderfully played out. Ally getting stuck in a toilet, her fear of murderers, her trial for statutory rape are all a joy to watch.<br/><br/>But how could it all go so wrong after so much right? I won't say I watched the entire 5th season, it was just to painful to see such a decline. We were missing Renee, Ling, Georgia, Billy and Larry, it just couldn't be the same.

Certainly on this side of the Pond, the TV critics seemed to have lost the plot - if they had found the plot in the first place. None of them liked Ally McBeal and they failed to find the essence of the programme.<br/><br/>What was interesting from my point of view is that it poked fun at the litigation culture which is prevalent in the USA, and is beginning to gather momentum in Britain, where people can sue one another often for the most ridiculous reasons. But if you had been fired for the most ridiculous reasons - for having orange skin or for seeing unicorns or for thinking you are Santa Claus - the team of lawyers at Cage and Fish would fight your case for you. However ridiculous the case, the programme took the legal arguments seriously, and John Cage's summations were a work of art, as they should have been after spending the night pacing round his office in his bare feet.<br/><br/>Some of the funniest moments in TV or cinematic history come from this show. The scene where John Cage's blowtorch erupts in the courtroom had me laughing so hard that I was literally fighting for breath.<br/><br/>Counterbalancing the humour was a great deal of pathos involving the characters whose entire lives are lived under the aegis of Cage and Fish - even the bar where Vonda Shepard performs is in the same building as the office.<br/><br/>Over the years, there were inevitable personnel changes in the cast. One of the most successful ones I thought was the introduction of Jackson Duper - one sane man in Cage and Fish's mad unisex toilet.<br/><br/>I know a little bit about acting - enough to know that much of the stuff the actors were doing is very difficult, so the cast are to be commended. Calista Flockhart made something outstanding out of a character that is essentially a cipher. She is a terrific dancer, too. It is a pity that so-called professional TV critics home in on her short skirts and her long, slender legs. They seem to be unaware that she is actually playing a role.<br/><br/>Peter McNicol's is just brilliant as John Cage, a man who jaywalks the border between genius and insanity. Greg Germann is excellent as Richard Fish.<br/><br/>Perhaps series 6 was a bit of a disaster. Certainly the inclusion of Dame Edna Everage is a good reason for reaching for the off switch.

Basically the story of a kooky, single female professional in short skirts, whose life revolves around her ex, her inner world, and her career as a lawyer, does't really progress very far in it's 5 seasons. It also goes downhill quite quickly from the later half of Season 2 onwards, but more on that later. This is a review of the entire series, so there will be SPOILERS.<br/><br/>Season 1 introduces us to Ally and her quirky outlook on life. Basically all of the first season is one long tale of pining for lost love as Ally works alongside childhood sweetheart /soul- mate, Billy, who is now married to another woman. Of course, they all work at the same firm, a company called Cage &amp; Fish. The episodes follow an extremely repetitive template: Ally and her firm take on a case, which always hold up a mirror to the emotions and events going on in Ally's personal life in that episode. As well as defending cases in court, Ally and her colleagues spend each evening after work in a bar, mulling over events of the day, while \"bar singer\" Vonda Sheperd sings songs that - funnily enough - also underscore the emotions and events of the episode. The episode will normally end with Ally (or occasionally another main character) speaking from the heart during the trial, using their parallel pain and insight to win over the jury, and thus (nearly always) winning the case.<br/><br/>Season 2 kicks off in the exact same style, demonstrating that the show really seems to have no direction to move in. Two new characters are introduced, Nelle and Ling, which normally speaks of desperation in a show, but luckily both Nell and Ling are very entertaining and played to perfection by Portia De Rossi and Lucy Liu. Nelle is by far the more interesting of the two, and I would love to have seen more time spent on her character.<br/><br/>On to Season 3, and this is where I started to lose my faith in the show on my first viewing. The character of Billy now becomes easily the worst aspect of the show, with his metamorphosis into an idiot. I never really warmed to the character of Billy, and sadly by season 3 she now has no depth whatsoever, which turns this whole plot strand into a cartoon. Luckily there are episodes that still have warmth, where the other cast members get a chance to show some depth. Episodes like the one where Elaine finds an abandoned baby, or where Ling makes friends with people in a care home, are good showcases for some nice stories and acting. Ally carries on dating guys and failing, but she is so picky that it makes you lose a lot of sympathy with Ally's so-called loneliness.<br/><br/>So here we are at Season 4 and I was relieved to see that the show seem to gather itself again. Characters feel more realistic, although by now Georgia has been silently written out of the show, while Nelle and new guy Mark pretty much has nothing to do. But the introduction of Robert Downey Junior as a new love interest is pretty good, and it's a shame that this was marred by the later scandal involving the actor, as he brings a lot to the show. Same for Anne Heche as a new love interest for John Cage, another quirky character (of course), but thanks to Heche's acting ability I think it comes across nicely. Season 4 concentrates on Ally's insecurity as part of a couple instead of her insecurity at being single, which is at least a change from three whole seasons where she was incapable of holding onto a man at all. But all in all, Season 4 is an improvement on the shallow and erratic Season 3.<br/><br/>And now finally Season 5, where the whole thing really unravels and slides down the hillside to the bottom. It's easy to see why Season 5 is the last one. Characters are dropping like flies, some are just not carried forward from Season 4 (Renee, Mark), others gradually appear less and less and then disappear (John Cage), and others are turned into little more than extras without story lines of their own (Nelle, Elaine). The worst aspect of the season is to introduce new characters at an alarming rate - including a new lawyer (Jenny) who is identical to Ally, which seems to serve no dramatic purpose. Ling returns briefly in a new ludicrous side story, and of course (for people that remember it), Ally acquires a 10 year old daughter. But other than that the plots go all over the place. Ally pretty much stops taking on any legal cases altogether and all we see is her being a mother. The abrupt tying up of events in the final episode is ridiculously condensed.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, it's a case of diminishing returns for the series as a whole. The positives that hold the entire thing together and made me want to return to watching are is the main cast, who are all pretty good. There are some touching moments in several episodes. Seasons 1, 2 and 4 are the best. The saddest thing is to wonder if the series might have recovered if Robert Downey Jnr hadn't had to leave, as he was really making the series pick up again, but by Season 5, it seemed like other cast members too were either opting out or being fired.

By the end of season two (which turned out to be the last genuinely great season of Ally ever), the show was getting 18million viewers per ep.

Well, in my opinion things started to go wrong in its third season when Georgia left the firm (and appears very briefly in others after she leaves or just doesn't appear at all), Renee is absent for 6 episodes in a row, Billy is killed off and new character Mark Albert is brought in a hurry. Plus the rumours of anorexia that dogged Calista Flockhart and Portia de Rossi which couldn't have helped.

An interesting love story also seemed evident as Ally goes to work at the law firm that her high school ex boyfriend also works at.  The fact that he was married to Georgia made this very entertaining and had the audience on the edge of their seats wondering if he would go back to Ally.  The characters were all interesting and different from each other and in time new characters joined like Nelle and Ling.  Both brought something to the show and made it even better.<br/><br/>I think one of the starting points of Ally's downfall was when Billy (Ally's ex) died.  That spelled the end for their relationship and that whole sequence leading up to his death was a bit wierd anyway, he went completely nuts, but I guess it was because of the brain tumour.<br/><br/>The inclusion of James Le Gros' character seemed completely pointless and by the 4th season there were too many characters and not enough storylines to go around.  John became just too weird (the room behind the toilet was just far-fetched and stupid) his girlfriend (played by Anne Heche)lived in an old elevator - totally lame! For the entire 4th season I felt stupid watching this show because the storylines were just too out there.  The only thing keeping the show alive was Robert Downey Jr's drug scandals and being fired from the show, that made headlines around the world. The fifth season hasnt aired in Australia yet, I doubt channel 7 will be in a hurry either.  I will watch it when it finally does air, but I dont expect to see much of an improvement.<br/><br/>It is sad to see that this once great show has completely hit rock bottom and in the space of only one to two years!  The blame can only be pointed at David E. Kelley.  He had a good thing going - this show won awards.  I think he became too greedy, he wanted to do as many shows as he could by also having The Practice and then Boston Public.  He lost interest in Ally McBeal and let it turn to absolute crap!  I heard that when the cast and crew were told that the show had been axed Calista jumped for joy - she was glad it was over because she saw how bad it had become.<br/><br/>If you ever come across the re-runs of the 1st 2nd and 3rd seasons I recommend you to see them because you will find them funny.

Kelley, the characters and the actors portrayals of them are simply first rate. By far the best of the ensemble, Calista Flockhart in the title role is sensational as the insecure, uptight lawyer of Boston. The Ally character is bound to become a future cultural icon of the 1990s.<br/><br/>Peter MacNicol, as the weird John Cage, Greg Germann as the legally unaware, unsympathetic boss Richard Fish and Lucy Liu as the moody, bitchy Ling are the forefront supporting actors of the cast. Jane Krakowski as the snoopish, inventive secretary Elaine is pretty good too. <br/><br/>However, it is the weaker characters of Nelle (Portia deRossi), Georgia (Courtney Thorne-Smith), Billy (Gil Bellows) and Renee (Lisa Nicole Carson) that have begun to show their wear and tear in the second series. Merely, they seem to be paid for standing around looking pretty. Hopefully David E. Kelley will develop these characters more in the coming seasons, otherwise they will continue to be dominated by the stronger cast, looking like beautiful people dressed up with sex to look better than they really are.<br/><br/>\nThe \"Ally\" cast, and their continuing ongoing struggles in the court room and in their personal lives in a dream of a law firm has been for the majority of the season, one of the most entertaining of the shows on the air today. <br/><br/>However, Kelley's creativity and imagery that goes into each special treat of an episode is excellent. For once, plot and character seem to go hand in hand. By breaking the barriers and creating a show that is neither four parts drama to one part comedy, or four parts comedy to one part drama, was the just the beginning of his dealing with controversial issues.<br/><br/>Since the cross over episode with Kelley's even better show \"The Practice\", I have graduated from little league law to the darker, grittier side of Boston which has now replaced \"Ally\" as my favourite show. But the allure for more \"Ally\" is still there. <br/><br/>As long as Kelley can continue to separate sex and controversy entirely from a show of pure genius, \"Ally\" will be continue to be fresh and by all means, a great show.", "rating": null, "helpful": "15 out of 22 found this helpful.", "date": "13 January 2000"}, {"title": " Like a triple stack of IHOP pancakes w/ extra syrup", "content": "Mmm, doesn't a big stack of pancakes sound good?

She was the most self-obsessed, selfish, egotistical person who constantly whined about not finding the love of her life. She expected everyone to drop what they were doing to hear about her problems and acted so unprofessionally at times that I couldn't believe that she hadn't been fired or at least charged with assault. The whole time I kept thinking she needs to learn to love herself without a man and stop calling herself empty all the time, it just got sad. And then, when she did meet a man, she acted so standoffish and coy- it bugged the hell out of me. I would not be friends with this person- she seems like such a buzzkill. <br/><br/>My other little annoyance were some of her 'fantasies'. Honestly at first they were funny and cute but they got more intense and disruptive in her life and I kept thinking that maybe there was a serious medical problem there. <br/><br/>This is just my opinion and there are probably others out there who think that it is too harsh or too serious for a TV show; however, it pains me to think that this show influences how women should view the world and themselves and how men view us.

I thought a lot of the jokes were funny, the quirky characters were fresh and exciting and the often silly story lines (the cases, mostly) were as entertaining as smart. I also identified a lot with John Cage, being socially awkward yet intelligent and innovative, and Ally herself, being slightly neurotic and a hopeless romantic. I guess I kind of lost interest in the show as it reached its final season and must've forgotten about the bad stuff since I always held it in high regard.<br/><br/>Recently I started watching it again, and having seen A LOT of different series over the years as well as other work from Mr. Kelley I have to say, I'm disappointed. The first 2 seasons only barely still worked for me and after that it went downhill real fast. What changed? How come I connected to a show on an emotional level this well 10 years ago and now all I can see is flaws?<br/><br/>Well, I think those 10 years really made that much a difference. Take these 'hallucinations' Ally ha(s/d) for example. Where they were a relatively new and refreshing way to show how she viewed other people and how she reacted emotionally to certain situations in a slightly comedic way back in the 90s, now they look cheap and silly, at best (and not because of the often poor animation.) Where I could fist simply 'accept' these hallucinations occurring because of the comedic tone of the show, now I can't help but conclude this is a sign of a severe mental illness and a person like that working in a law firm is simply not a believable scenario. There's even this one episode about Ally really starting to believe in them and locking herself into her room, her friends and colleagues worry about her, and then it's all 'resolved' with no further consequences (not even a psych-evaluation) and she can go back to work no problem, just like that. These hallucinations feel like an enormous plot hole (if not a flaw on a conceptual level) rather than funny gags in between because of the semi-serious approach to them. I don't know whether problems like these are really due to experimenting with the format and the newness of it all, but I'm willing to do the show a favor and see it that way.<br/><br/>Of course, not only the show aged, I aged as well. And as I've grown into adulthood I am baffled by the idea this show was meant for adults. I quickly came to the conclusion that most of the characters were written as teenagers, on a mental as well as an emotional level. Ally is of course the best example of this, always doubting everything around her as well as herself, being insecure about herself, either not thinking about consequences of a situation or overthinking them... I could go on but you get the idea. The other characters have some pretty childish traits as well without something else making up for it. I get why I liked this show as much as I did when I was still a teen, but now it's just way too hard to even view these characters as believable, let alone connect with them.<br/><br/>Then there are the 'political' issues. If you've ever seen even one episode of a show by David E. Kelley you know what I'm talking about. Both Boston Legal and Ally McBeal are obviously very liberal shows with a high sense morality and this needn't be a problem, but it is, in many ways. I myself am a liberal, yet I take offense to the notion that all non-liberals are dumb for not being liberals or are simply evil. This notion however is a recurring theme in both shows and I think it displays liberals as closed-minded and smug. Another problem is the 'pro-woman' tone, particularly in Ally McBeal. Men are mostly displayed as either wimpy 'good guys' (Billy first 2 seasons) or sex-crazed assholes (Billy 3rd season, Richard Fish) and I take offense to that as a man.<br/><br/>I often get the feeling the writers really want to rub my face in what they think is morally right, and it's just annoying. I guess having grown up and having found my own sense of right and wrong really clashes with the show, another reason for me to argue it's more suited for teens rather than adults.<br/><br/>For me these are the real big issues with the show as a whole, the characters aren't believable on multiple levels, some aspects of the show are too 'out there' and remain unexplored and the political and moral messages are too one-sided and painfully present. There are some minor issues as well, Elaine never being funny even though she was obviously meant as comic relief, the never ending overuse of Vonda Shepard and her annoying voice, the quality of the animation, etc. etc. These are however a lot more subjective and don't affect the show as much as the rest, the show would be better without them but they don't ruin it either.<br/><br/>Lastly, what DOES still hold up? Well, as I've said the first 2 seasons are okay, even for today's standards. They don't hold up all that great because of aforementioned issues but they do have a lot going for them as well. The cast is great, most of the actors deliver a good, if not great, performance, the silly story lines usually don't get too silly and are entertaining enough to follow and even with their problems there are still some genuinely funny characters in the mix (Dr. Tracey being my favorite, but Richard Fish is also pretty funny at times, to name a few).<br/><br/>So, is it still watchable? Yes, but I'd prefer watching something else.
